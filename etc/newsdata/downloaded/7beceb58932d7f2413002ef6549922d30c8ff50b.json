Snead's final PGA Tour win came in 1965, when he was 52 years old.\n\nAt the storm-delayed Zozo Championship, the first official PGA Tour event in Japan, Woods played seven holes under sunshine Monday morning to wrap up his historic triumph. With rounds of 64-64-66-67, Woods finished at 19 under to win by three shots over local hero Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nWoods, who began the tournament with three consecutive bogeys, stormed back with nine birdies in his opening round and then never trailed after taking the outright lead with two birdies to close his second round at Accordia Narashino Country Club.\n\nIn joining Snead with the most victories in PGA Tour history, Woods added a third-round 66 to grab a 3-shot lead after 54 holes. Woods never failed to win in 24 previous events after taking at least a 3-shot advantage into the final 18 holes.\n\nMake it 25-for-25.\n\nAfter playing 29 holes from dusk to dawn on Sunday, Woods resumed his final round on the 12th tee. He was three shots clear of Matsuyama, who was playing one group ahead of Woods.\n\nAfter making bogey on the 12th, Woods responded with a birdie on the 14th from 12 feet to keep Matsuyama at bay. Matsuyama got within two shots twice, first after Woods made bogey on 12 and then again after Matsuyama made birdie on the 16th, but couldn\u2019t catch Woods.\n\nThe win comes 23 years after Woods won his first title at the 1996 Las Vegas Invitational. It was the eighth time he won his season opener. And the 43-year-old has now won a PGA Tour event in seven countries \u2013 the U.S., Canada, Japan, Spain, Ireland, England and Scotland.", "description": "Tiger Woods finished at 19 under to win by three shots over Japanese star Hideki Matsuyama in the first official PGA Tour event in Japan.", "authors": ["Steve Dimeglio", "Published P.M.
