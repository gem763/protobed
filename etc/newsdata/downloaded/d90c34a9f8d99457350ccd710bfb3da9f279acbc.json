The CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% higher. The Dow and S&P 500 futures contracts edged 0.1% lower.\n\nA modest pullback overnight on Wall Street came a day after the S&P 500 hit an all-time high.\n\nInvestors were cautious ahead of a policy announcement later Wednesday by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut interest rates again.\n\nReports that China and the U.S. may not reach a trade agreement in time to sign a deal next month at a regional summit also put a damper on sentiment.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.6% to 22,843.12. Sydney's S&P ASX 200 sank 0.8% to 6,689.50. In South Korea, the Kospi declined 0.6% to 2,080.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.4% to 26,667.71 while the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.5% to 2,939.32.\n\nChinese investors monitor stock prices at a brokerage house in Beijing, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019.

Shares also rose in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.\n\nHopes that the U.S. and China may resolve their conflict over technology and trade policies have recently buoyed share prices.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere told reporters Tuesday that both sides were working to finalize a deal, aiming to have Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping sign a deal next month at a Pacific Rim summit in Chile.\n\nBut various officials have indicated an agreement might not be ready in time.\n\n\"These headlines are an annoying distraction as it provides a not too subtle reminder of how quickly things can turn on the trade war front while psychologically lingering in the back of trader's minds,\" Stephen Innes of AxiTrader said in a commentary.\n\nLower interest rates also have spurred market gains.\n\nMost investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday. It has cut rates twice since the summer to shield the U.S. from the impact of the trade war and a slowing global economy.\n\nTreasury yields dipped ahead of the decision. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 1.83% from 1.85% late Monday. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to moves by the Fed, fell to 1.63% from 1.64%.\n\nCompany earnings reports have also helped lift the market. With nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported results for the July-September quarter, the index is on pace to report a profit drop of 3.5% from the prior year, according to FactSet.\n\nThat's not as bad as the roughly 4% decline that analysts were expecting on the eve of earnings reporting season, but it would be the first time that profits dropped for three straight quarters since 2015-2016.\n\nAnalysts say the sharpest earnings declines in the third quarter will come from energy companies, raw-material producers and technology companies. Wall Street is expecting stronger growth, meanwhile, from companies that do most of their business domestically, such as utilities and real-estate companies.\n\nOver the long term, stock prices tend to track the path of corporate profits.\n\nBenchmark crude oil fell 5 cents to $55.49 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up 27 cents to settle at $55.54 a barrel on Tuesday.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international standard, added 4 cents to $61.27 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar fell to 108.85 Japanese yen from 108.88 yen on Monday. The euro rose to $1.1115 from $1.1112.\n\nChinese investors monitor stock prices at a brokerage house in Beijing, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019.
