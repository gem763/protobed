The City of Ottawa street signs above them were undamaged.\n\nI just feel sad, very sad. - Linda Chen, restaurateur\n\nLater, local business owners reported a third sign, at Somerset Street W. and Bell Street, had also been damaged.\n\n\"I feel a little bit upset,\" said Marilyn Ma, who works for the Ottawa Chinese Community Service Centre and has lived in the Ottawa area for 15 years.\n\n\"This sign has been here for years. I know it's a symbol of Chinatown, and then [someone] just paint[ed] it out. I don't [know] their purpose, but for me, it's kind of strange,\" she said.\n\n\"I wish people had never done that.\"\n\nMarilyn Ma of the Ottawa Chinese Community Service Centre called the vandalism 'upsetting.' (Kimberley Molina/CBC)\n\nMa said she's never seen such vandalism before, and pointed out there were other, easier-to-reach signs in Chinese nearby that were untouched.\n\nShe said she's never seen any similar sort of vandalism in the area and pointed out many other, much easier to reach, street signs and business signs in Chinese were not touched.\n\nMa is worried the vandals could strike again.\n\n\"If it's just people did it for fun, maybe not ... but if [there's] something behind it, it may happen again,\" she said. \"Hopefully it's safe here.\"\n\nNo police investigation\n\nOttawa police said they were not called about the vandalism, and are not investigating a hate crime. City workers had removed the signs by late Tuesday morning, after CBC contacted the city for more information.\n\n\"Traffic Services has been made aware of this matter and are in the process of replacing the signs. The replacement should be completed over the next few days,\" traffic operations manager Chris Brinkmann wrote in a statement to CBC Ottawa.\n\nCity crews worked removed the vandalized street signs late Tuesday morning. (Kimberley Molina/CBC)\n\n'Very sad'\n\nKay Ng, a pharmacist in Chinatown, first wondered if the vandalism was an act of discrimination, then suggested it might have simply been \"a prank\"\n\nLinda Chen, owner of nearby Ben Ben restaurant, called the vandalism \"very sad\" because the writing is a source of comfort for those who are visiting the area from overseas.\n\n\"I just feel sad, very sad. You know? That's no good. I don't understand why the people do that. You know? We don't do any bad things for anybody. You know? But I don't know why the people do that. I don't know. I don't understand the people.\"\n\nChen said she hopes the city will replace the signs with larger ones, and will consider placing security cameras in the area.", "description": "Business owners in Ottawa's Chinatown are questioning why vandals defaced Chinese-language street signs in their neighbourhood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287166.1568747610!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chinatown-sign-writing-vandalism.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
