You can form your own view.

They say that migrants make a city, and recent adoptees certainly seem to make this town of around 12,000.\n\nIn a hyper-concentrated way, recent influx from the most nearby areas (including, but not limited to, York) has seen Malton grow and grow.\n\nThey boast the opening of 15 new businesses over the past three years, as well as three independently-owned pubs that have reopened as a result of the increased trade and foot traffic; people will always need a place to drink, after all. What\u2019s the secret behind all of this? The artisan producers, according to Naylor-Leyland.\n\nWhile restaurants will always steal the spotlight when it comes to attracting day-trippers and other visitors, local foodies and the chefs in those restaurants know that you can\u2019t affect the cultural change that Malton has undergone without a line-up of businesses that provide excellent produce.\n\n\u201cWe went out and told producers: \u2018come and make your products here\u2019,\u201d Naylor-Leyland explains. The range, diversity and \u2013 above all \u2013 quality of the producers is impressive, even if you don\u2019t take into account the small size of the town.\n\nThere is, in no particular order: Rare Bird, a distillery started by an ex-fireman that produces very good gin, and houses a workshop where you can concoct your own spirit. Florian Poirot, a master patissier who was one of the senior confectioners at Nestl\u00e9 in York but (like many others here) decided to eschew large-scale production in favour of a more artisan life, and is now one of the jewels of the town\u2019s crown; his macarons are the headline act, and aren\u2019t to be missed, but make sure to ask what they have on special that day.\n\nThey had gorgeously lacquered fig tarts on my visit but it all depends on what they can get their hands on.\n\nThere\u2019s also Roost Coffee and Roastery, Food 2 Remember Butcher and Groovy Moo Gelato, proudly the top rated attraction for the town on Tripadvisor and a year-round favourite for locals. The gelato here is of such high quality that it apparently even impresses hard-to-please Italians. \u201cIt\u2019s the Yorkshire cattle, and the milk and cream they produce that makes it so good,\u201d explains Michelle Walker, who runs the gelateria. \u201cIt\u2019s all down to the quality of the dairy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of ease about everything that happens here; it\u2019s the sort of place that still has a cattle market twice a week. The brewers at Brass Castle make the ales in a small (but ever-growing) workspace out the back, and wheel them through to the taphouse in the front when it\u2019s ready to serve.\n\nSimilarly, the bakers, coffee roasters and butchers are close enough to walk the produce over to various kitchens around town. It\u2019s sort of how things used to be in market towns, before the big supermarkets moved in, so it\u2019s no surprise to learn that most of this comes as a result of the victory of a hard-fought battle to stop a huge Tesco being built.\n\nAcross the street from the bulk of Malton\u2019s producers in Talbot Yard is The Talbot, a coaching inn turned 26-room hotel which has been here for hundreds of years and was recently afforded a fresh lick of paint. The refurbishment parallels the rejuvenation of the town; its laid-back vibe the essence of rustic, country luxury, with food at the centre of everything, as with much in Malton. In fact, they claim to be a restaurant with rooms, which is charmingly modest but shouldn\u2019t belly the excellence of the hotel side of the business.\n\nThe Talbot\u2019s restaurant is equally superb: from a twice baked souffl\u00e9 using local cheddar, to a roasted lamb rump, and an excellent mackerel dish, the cooking is of an excellent standard and rightly shines a spotlight on ingredients from nearby.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just one of the several restaurants and cafes dotted around town that are worth your time, perfect for a stop-in on a weekend trip.\n\nWe also enjoyed YO Bakehouse, an adorable cafe that has recently expanded its seating and seems to be thriving, serving very good doorstop bacon sandwiches, as well as an exemplary Yorkshire curd tart. Costello\u2019s, a short walk away, has excellent pies and sausage rolls that are perfect for a flying visit.\n\nChapter One Bistro, meanwhile, has a slightly more eclectic menu; don\u2019t miss the \u201changing kebabs\u201d, which might be slightly gimmicky, yet delicious, as well as an excellent mezze board featuring charcuterie from a nearby butcher.\n\nAbove everything, there\u2019s a sense among the producers here that they want to keep it small-scale, which is what makes it special. In fact, for most of them, they\u2019re only available to buy in Malton. \u201cIf you want to meet the producers and try the food, you have to come here,\u201d says Naylor-Leyland.\n\nDespite the abundance of great producers, Naylor-Leyland is realistic, claiming \u201cwe haven\u2019t solved everything\u201d and they\u2019re still missing a cheesemonger and a smokehouse, at least, in an attempt to make it more consistent across the board.\n\nAnd why should people visit Malton? Naylor-Leyland thinks it\u2019s simple: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be a small, British market-town that actually produces on an artisan scale.\n\nWe have beautiful, high-quality, delicious products. It tastes good, it looks good. It\u2019s a beautiful and exciting town. We\u2019re known for our food but we\u2019re also becoming known for our music and art. Why wouldn\u2019t you visit?\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t really disagree. It\u2019s a success story, sure, but more than that it contains the real lives of many and a surfeit of delicious food, wonderful events and an intriguing, nascent public art scene that are all worth your time.", "description": "The story goes the same way, no matter who here tells it: 10 years ago, fearing the worst for a town that has been in his family for hundreds of years, the heir to the estate decided enough was enough, and he was going to take action.
