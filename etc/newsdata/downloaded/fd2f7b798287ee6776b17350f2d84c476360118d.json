REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nShe asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to investigate the antitrust division\u2019s decision to probe Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, and Volkswagen AG. In July the carmakers said they had reached a deal with California to adopt tougher emissions standards than the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 proposal.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has launched a multi-pronged assault on California\u2019s framework with the four automakers,\u201d said Harris, adding it \u201craises questions about whether the machinery of the Justice Department is being used for partisan political purposes, or at the behest of special interest groups that oppose even modest efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump moved to roll back the Obama-era emissions standards, California and other states vowed to enforce the stricter regulations. The rules the automakers agreed to were looser than the Obama rules but more strict than Trump\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim sent Aug. 28 letters to the four automakers warning the agreement \u201cmay violate federal antitrust laws,\u201d according to documents seen by Reuters.\n\nLast week, top lawyers at EPA and the Transportation Department sent a letter to California Air Resource Board Chair Mary Nichols saying the board\u2019s actions in connection with the voluntary agreement \u201cappear to be unlawful and invalid.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said it plans to hold hearings and seek documents into the automaker antitrust investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump met with senior officials to discuss the administration\u2019s plan to divide its August 2018 proposal to rollback Obama era standards through 2025 and revoke California\u2019s waiver under the Clean Air Act to set state requirements for vehicles.\n\nUnder Trump, federal regulators backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials say its final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration set in 2012.\n\nThe Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 mpg by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration\u2019s preferred option.", "description": "U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Friday asked a government watchdog to look into the Trump administration's decision to launch an antitrust probe into four automakers cooperating with California on tighter greenhouse gas emissions limits that Trump is trying to eliminate.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429520823&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1ZL", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
