In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.6%.\n\n\n\nHowever, the company recorded average negative surprise of 6.1% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings in the third quarter is pegged at $1.36, suggesting growth of 65.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. Moreover, estimates witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $13.98 billion indicates growth of 5.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV price-eps-surprise | Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Quote\n\nFactors at Play\n\n\n\nStrong sales trend and consistent strength in global brands \u2014 Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois \u2014 are likely to have contributed to AB InBev\u2019s top-line performance. Revenues in the third quarter must have gained from improving trends in key markets and continued growth of premium brands. The company\u2019s global premiumization and revenue-management initiatives are also likely to have aided revenue per hl growth in the quarter under review.\n\n\n\nHowever, softness in beer demand, particularly in the United States, is likely to have impacted total and own-beer volumes in the region. Major change in consumer preferences toward premiumization along with health and wellness awareness, and demographic changes in the population is causing a mix shift within the beer segment. Further, adverse currency translations and commodity cost inflation are concerning.\n\n\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\n\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict earnings beat for AB InBev this time around.
