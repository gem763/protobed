Neither parent has the disease.\n\nFeeling 'contaminated'\n\nRebecca Dixon said she learned three years a go at age 25 that Barwin was her biological father, telling the hearing that she felt \"repulsed\" and \"contaminated\".\n\n\"In that moment, my life changed forever,\" she said in a victim impact statement.\n\n\"For a while I felt dissociated with my own face, as if the person looking at back at me in the mirror wasn't fully me anymore.\"\n\nShe noted that the discovery also put a strain on her family.\n\nHer father, while struggling with major health issues, \"had to learn to accept that the daughter he had raised and loved was not in fact his biological child\", she said.\n\n\"My mum,\" she added, \"had to work through the fact that something had happened to her body without her knowing, or giving her permission\".\n\nIn crowds, Dixon said \"I find myself looking for people who look like me, who could be half-siblings.\"\n\nSo far, she said she has found 15 half-siblings and expects the number to grow.", "description": "A Canadian fertility doctor's licence has been revoked for having used the wrong sperm, including his own, to inseminate patients over decades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6679/0b488fd8ec70423fa43c8636fa228272.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
