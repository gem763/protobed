All that could be seen, as rescuers began their recovery efforts last weekend, were the rooftops - islands of grey and iron-brown beneath a subdued sky.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, one of the strongest storms to hit in decades, has left its mark on Japan. Five lives were lost in Koriyama. In the Suimoncho neighbourhood, a compact network of worn, wooden homes that sits on the city\u2019s river banks, one of their own was among that count.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Of the 77 people so far confirmed as dead in the wake of Hagibis, with many others still missing, 25 are thought to have come from the north-easterly region.\n\nMany of those were killed in the floods. At least 14 levees burst along the Abukuma River, which meanders through a number of cities in the prefecture, including Koriyama, spinning into motion the chaos that locals are now attempting to recover from.\n\nIn Suimoncho, the narrow streets are lined with rubbish and sodden debris days after the storm\u2019s arrival. Mattresses stained brown with flood water are stacked high in the street. Broken TVs are coated in dust. A pair of football boots left to dry in the warm sun. Homes stand empty and bare, skeletal-like, stripped of their possessions as residents, clad in white overhauls, try to salvage what they can. As of Wednesday afternoon, many elderly remained in local evacuation centres - municipal buildings, sports halls, high schools - unable to clean up their homes.\n\nFor Chiko and her family, there\u2019s a long way to go before any sense of normality returns. Their house, close to the foot of one the river\u2019s levees, has been devastated.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll take a month to sort,\u201d she says, a wheelbarrow to hand and with a mask covering her face. \u201cThe bottom floor is completely ruined. Everything is gone.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

NHK, Japan\u2019s national broadcaster, has reported that 13,000 houses were submerged and more than 1,100 at least partly destroyed. Meanwhile, about 12,000 homes are still without electricity or have no running water. It's unclear how long it will take for utilities to restore full-working service.\n\nThe worry is what comes next for Koriyama, Fukushima and similar areas that are continuing to bear the brunt of Japan\u2019s natural disasters.\n\nWhile the likes of central Tokyo woke to sharp sunshine last weekend, unharmed and largely unscathed by Hagibis, the same cannot be said for those regions where the infrastructure in place offers insufficient resistance to the fury brought by typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nIn the capital, subterranean surge chambers, some the size of cathedrals and two football fields long in length, protect the city above during heavy storms and the torrential downpours they generate. In Koriyama, the main line of defence are banks of earth three metres high.\n\nAlthough Hagibis was unprecedented in scale and ferocity - weather officials said some places that flooded received up to 40 per cent of their annual rainfall in just two days - many are fearful that, under the effects of global warming, a similar-sized storm will return in the near future.\n\n\u201cIt could be climate change,\u201d says Moe. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s been very bad but after a year or sometime we could get hit by another big typhoon because of warming.\u201d\n\nGiven the area\u2019s recent history, the prospect of more natural-based disasters, or an increase in their frequency, sends a shiver down the spine of those living here.\n\nPeople came together after the earthquake . . . We will do the same now Moe Kaneda, teacher in Koriyama\n\nAs with the wider country, Fukushima\u2019s economy was decimated by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The region also had to contend with the nuclear fallout from the damaged Daiichi power plant as radiation leakage made its way into water supplies, milk and vegetables.\n\nRegrowth was hindered by staggering financial costs - in excess of $250bn (\u00a3192bn) for Japan as a whole - and high relocation rates, which saw local populations shrink and shoot upwards in age. Around 10,000 residents left Koriyama in the aftermath of the disaster, while villages up and down the prefecture were hit hard by mass exoduses.\n\nSome remain unconvinced that Fukushima has fully recovered, despite the insistence of municipal authorities that this is the case. And now, the prefecture is facing yet another expensive clean-up. At this stage, who knows how much of a setback Hagibis will prove to be for the region.\n\n\u201cEconomic impact in disasters can quickly cascade through different sectors of the economy,\u201d says Hiba Baroud, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Vanderbilt University. \u201cProduction can be affected either by direct impact from the disaster or through interdependent effects resulting from disruptions in the supply chain.\n\nLocal and national authorities need to account for all these aspects in assessing the damage to identify the best recovery strategy for the city.\u201d Indeed, the government already has said it plans to designate Typhoon Hagibis as a \u201csevere natural disaster\u201d to free up more subsidies for reconstruction.\n\nSome will feel, though, that the \u201cbest recovery strategy\u201d is simply soldiering on. Japanese resilience is given no greater showing than in the face of natural-spun adversity.\n\nAlthough the nation is by no means immune to the pain and suffering and loss that comes with these disasters, there seems to be an inherent drive among the people to dig in, to carry on, to serve their duty in times of difficulty - of which there have been many over the years.\n\n\u201cI think that's a really strong part of Japanese society in general,\u201d says Joost Kralt, a coordinator for international relations at Koriyama City Hall. \u201cThey really go with the punches.\u201d\n\nHaving come through the agony of 2011 and the harsh years that followed, the people of Fukushima will likely strive to do so again in the face of this latest crisis. \u201cPeople came together after the earthquake,\u201d says Moe, wearing a smile of defiance. \u201cWe will do the same now.\u201d", "description": "By dawn\u2019s break, after a night of lashing rain and violent winds, the full scale of destruction was laid bare.
