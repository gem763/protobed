All)\n\nThe series ended with [spoiler alert] Isaac's character Bran Stark becoming the King of the Seven Kingdoms after the ruler's mysterious identity was the subject of much debate throughout the series.\n\nFans are now combing back over the episodes looking for clues that the show's producers had this ending planned all along.\n\nIsaac said: \"It's almost worse now that it's over forever because now there's no limit to the amount of reading into it people can do.\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\n(Image: emilia_clarke /Instagram)\n\n\"But there are no more clues that I know of.\"\n\nThe books are lagging behind the TV series, and there is a chance George R. R. Martin will go down a different path to the one in the TV show - particularly after such a savage reception from viewers.\n\nIsaac said he would be \"gutted\" if George changes the identity of the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms in the books to someone else other than Bran.\n\n\"But what's nice is that the books and the show have been able to evolve, and George has no obligation to end it in any of the same ways that we did\", he said.\n\n(Image: emilia_clarke /Instagram)\n\n(Image: JD Images/REX)\n\n\"So we're going to get two ultimate endings.\"\n\nIsaac made the surprise admission that his ideal ruler of the Seven Kingdoms would be Sansa Stark, his older sister on the show, played by Sophie Turner.\n\nDiscussing the concept of being recognised as Bran Stark for the rest of his lift, Isaac is not daunted.\n\n\"I think there are worse things to be associated with for the rest of your life, and people are really excited to talk to me about it.\n\nIt's not going to be like 'ooh, that s**t thing you did ten years ago'.\n\n\"You'd be mad if you tried to escape it. It was so important to so many actors in kick-starting their career.\n\n\"We're grateful for it.\"\n\nIsaac added that despite the overwhelming negative response to the final season of the show, fans have only said positive things to him when they approach him in public.\n\n\"it's just a bit weird to get used to. Sometimes I'll walk down the street and think, 'why is everyone staring at me!?'\"\n\nHe added that he didn't think the final season was rushed, despite that being the main criticism from a lot of viewers.\n\n\"I thought it was pretty well pitched\", he said.", "description": "Isaac made the surprise admission that the Game of Thrones cast don't speak any more, and told us who he would have liked to have ruled the Seven Kingdoms", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Getty Images", "Hbo", "\u00c2 Home Box Office", "Inc.
