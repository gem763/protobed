But a win over Scotland hardly amounts to the sort of potential World Cup winning form the Irish had under a year ago.\n\nThey are not back to those heights, when the All Blacks were their bunnies, but they are getting there.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But they were playing against Scotland.\n\nRob Kearney, Robbie Henshaw and Keith Earls all missed this game injured and Dan Leavy and Sean O\u2019Brien never made it to Japan. That is a serious amount of talent to lose and it was worrying from an emerald point of view when Peter O\u2019Mahony went off in the first and Johnny Sexton gave up kicking duties in the first half.\n\nBut get that first-named trio fit and don\u2019t pick up any more injuries and Ireland have a puncher\u2019s chance of getting to the semi-final for the first time. They should win the pool \u2013 the other teams are Japan, Samoa and Russia \u2013 so don\u2019t have to flog their players. So far, so easy.\n\nThen they will probably meet South Africa in the last eight. The Boks have improved but Ireland have knocked them over in recent years and won\u2019t be intimidated.\n\nIrish fans should not, and won\u2019t give up hope.\n\nBut the stats say that seven times they have got to the quarter-finals and seven times they have gone home. They have never won a World Cup knock-out match.\n\nUnder a year ago with two wins over New Zealand, in 2016 and 2018, and a Six Nations Grand Slam in 2018, Ireland would have fancied their chances in a World Cup. Not many would have bet seriously against them but it is a bit different now.\n\nThey were battered 57-15 by England at Twickenham, laughably just before they got to the top of the charts before two wins against Wales. But the Six Nations third place, where they were ambushed by Eddie Jones\u2019 team and crushed 25-7 by the Welsh was less than ideal in World Cup year.\n\nWhen Wales then Ireland became number one successively the call went up that the rankings meant nothing unless you had a World Cup in your locker to back it up.\n\nThe All Blacks were top of the tree for a staggering 508 weeks until 18 August and had collected the Webb Ellis Trophy in 2011 and 2015 on the way. They backed it up all right.\n\nWhere Ireland sit in what recently has been seen as a back of a fag packet calculation will not affect them in this World Cup and head coach Joe Schmidt knows it.\n\nThey have not really been the best team in the world at any point this year but this World Cup opener was a decent start in their bid to get to the top of the world when it really matters.\n\nCan they win it? Yes. Will they? Probably not.", "description": "When Ireland became the world\u2019s number ranked team earlier this month after beating Wales they should automatically have had a target on their back, but that has been removed already.
