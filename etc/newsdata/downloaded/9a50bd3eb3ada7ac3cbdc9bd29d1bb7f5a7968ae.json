Sounds like one of those fancy attachments you get with a vacuum cleaner, designed to dig the dirt out of hard-to-reach nooks and crannies.\n\nWhat it actually means is yet another delay to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.\n\nBrussels has graciously consented to give us until January 31, 2020, to get our act together and either hold an election, pass the withdrawal agreement or call the whole thing off.\n\nWe face the depressing prospect of selfie-snapping politicians peddling their lies and monopolising the airwaves in the run-up to Christmas, competing with carol singers on our doorsteps\n\nThe only certainty is that we won\u2019t be leaving on Thursday, meaning Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018die in a ditch\u2019 deadline has been missed.\n\nNot that Boris can be blamed for failing to hit his target. Since becoming Prime Minister, he has moved heaven and earth to cobble together an imperfect deal which at least serves to break the deadlock.\n\nNo, the delay is down to the obstructionist Remainer rabble in Parliament, who have spent the past three-and-a-half years conspiring to renege on their promise to honour the 2016 referendum result.\n\nYou don\u2019t need me to recount yet again the concerted campaign to sabotage Brexit by any and every means possible.\n\nNot that Boris can be blamed for failing to hit his target. Since becoming Prime Minister, he has moved heaven and earth to cobble together an imperfect deal which at least serves to break the deadlock\n\nEven after Boris managed to command a majority in the House for his deal, MPs immediately prevented him from pushing it through in time to meet his October 31 deadline.\n\nTheir excuse was that they needed longer to scrutinise the small print. Their real reason, as it has been all along, was to stop Brexit altogether.\n\nLabour\u2019s behaviour has been abominable. Corbyn keeps insisting he wants merely to take No Deal off the table, yet won\u2019t vote for any deal Boris negotiates. Risibly, Corbyn claimed at the weekend that Boris still has No Deal \u2018in his mind\u2019.\n\nAnd despite demanding an election almost daily for the past three years, Labour have refused up until now to let the Government call one.\n\nLast night, Labour MPs abstained on a Government motion to hold an election in December. Under the ludicrous Fixed-term Parliaments Act, that meant Boris couldn\u2019t get the two-thirds majority he needs to dissolve Parliament\n\nThat\u2019s because they fear they\u2019re heading for inevitable defeat.\n\nLast night, Labour MPs abstained on a Government motion to hold an election in December. Under the ludicrous Fixed-term Parliaments Act, that meant Boris couldn\u2019t get the two-thirds majority he needs to dissolve Parliament.\n\nBut it does now look as if there will be an election before Christmas, after a change of heart by the Lib Dems and the Scots Nats, who have agreed to a one-line Bill which would require only a simple majority.\n\nThe date has still to be decided. Boris wants it on Thursday, December 12. The Lib Dems and the SNP want it held on December 9, because that would deny Boris the time to get his Brexit deal through the Commons before going to the country.\n\nYes, I know. You wouldn\u2019t think three days would make much difference \u2014 not after 40 months of wrangling. Yet this is precisely the kind of procedural nit-picking we have come to expect from this rotten Parliament.\n\nSoon after the 2010 election, which ushered in the Coalition, we were treated to an expensive referendum on the voting system, which hardly anyone apart from Nick Clegg wanted. The then Deputy Prime Minister is pictured above voting in the 2011 AV poll\n\nBoth the smaller Opposition parties have their own selfish reasons for agreeing to an election. They think it is now their best hope of scuppering Brexit altogether. The SNP want to get the election out of the way before their former leader Alex Salmond\u2019s trial on attempted rape and sexual assault charges in January.\n\nThey also believe a new Parliament might approve second referendums on both Brexit and Scottish independence. The heart sinks.\n\nWhile we desperately need an election to end the paralysis of the past few months, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to it with much relish. The moment the election is called, the politicians will go straight into campaigning mode.\n\nThere\u2019ll be no escape. They\u2019ll be in our faces 24/7.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m sick of the sight and sound of politics and politicians. For the past nine years or so we\u2019ve had nothing but.\n\nSoon after the 2010 election, which ushered in the Coalition, we were treated to an expensive referendum on the voting system, which hardly anyone apart from Nick Clegg wanted.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve had a Scottish independence referendum, the 2014 Euros, the 2016 Brexit referendum and General Elections in 2015 and 2017 \u2014 the latter called in a fit of hubris by Theresa May \u2014 plus this summer\u2019s Euro elections, which we shouldn\u2019t have had to contest because we were supposed to leave the EU in March.\n\nNow we\u2019re headed for another General Election and, if that goes pear-shaped for the Tories, second referendums on both Brexit and Scottish independence.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the result of most of these votes changed anything much. The politicians simply ignored results they didn\u2019t like.\n\nClegg, currently coining it in Silicon Valley, broke his promise to cut the size of the Commons because the Alternative Vote referendum went decisively against him.\n\nScots were told they had a \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 chance to vote for independence. When the people voted \u2018No\u2019, the SNP pretended they had won and started campaigning immediately for a rerun.\n\nAt least Call Me Dave kept his pledge to hold a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 EU referendum after winning the 2015 election.\n\nBrussels has graciously consented to give us until January 31, 2020, to get our act together and either hold an election, pass the withdrawal agreement or call the whole thing off. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is pictured above last week\n\nBut although Cameron promised solemnly to honour the result of that referendum, he resigned the day after Leave won and, three-and-a-half years on, MPs are still refusing to take Britain out of the EU. This is despite 80 per cent of them standing in 2017 on a manifesto commitment to implement Brexit.\n\nWe were forced to take part in this summer\u2019s EU elections, because Westminster MPs had failed to get us out.\n\nBut even though the Brexit Party swept the board, the result did nothing to dampen the Remain resistance in the Commons.\n\nSo forgive me for wondering whether a fresh election will actually break the Brexit impasse. Anything can happen during the course of a five-week campaign.\n\nEven if Boris wins a majority, plenty of hardline Remainers will get re-elected, determined to stop Brexit at any cost, in concert with the overwhelmingly pro-EU Lords and extra-parliamentary actors like Gina Miller.\n\nWho would bet against another attempt to halt Leave ending up before the Supreme Court?\n\nMeanwhile, we face the depressing prospect of selfie-snapping politicians peddling their lies and monopolising the airwaves in the run-up to Christmas, competing with carol singers on our doorsteps.\n\nAnd at the end of it, whatever the result, what guarantee is there that the politicians will take any notice of what the people want?\n\nIf the evidence of the past decade is anything to go by, none at all. Once back in their Bubble, it will be business as usual.\n\nNot for the first time, I find myself agreeing with Ken Livingstone: If voting changed anything, they\u2019d abolish it.", "description": "RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Brussels has graciously consented to give us until January 31, 2020, to get our act together and either hold an election, pass the withdrawal agreement or call the whole thing off.", "authors": ["Richard Littlejohn For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20303494-0-image-a-9_1572304624954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
