Top GOP leaders in the House and Senate \u2014 including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise \u2014 will meet with Trump on Tuesday to discuss the fall agenda, according to three sources familiar with the meeting. That gives Republicans the opportunity to hear the latest from the president himself.\n\nTrump has sounded at times optimistic or noncommittal about new gun legislation. With memories of last year\u2019s government shutdown fresh in their minds after Trump rejected their spending bill, Senate Republicans have no interest in getting ahead of Trump on such a charged cultural issue.\n\n\u201cWe are very interested in knowing what his plan and proposal is and what he\u2019d be willing to sign,\u201d Thune said, after the party leadership met on Monday. \u201cAll of our members, if this meeting [Monday] was any indication, believe that the president needs to indicate what it is he will be for.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
