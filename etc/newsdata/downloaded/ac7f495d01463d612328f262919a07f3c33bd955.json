The IGI, however, exonerated the SSA and instead found the HRIU was acting illegally and that Van Loggerenberg, then-SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay and then-finance minister Pravin Gordhan be criminally investigated.\n\nALSO READ: ANALYSIS | Genesis: How the SARS rogue unit narrative was born and normalised\n\nAccording to a series of letters between Van Loggerenberg\u2019s attorneys and the IGI, attached to an affidavit by Van Loggerenberg and lodged by Pillay at the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, he has been unable to access recordings and transcripts of the two meetings he had with the IGI. The current IGI, Setlhomamaru Dintwe, has confirmed to Van Loggerenberg that the recordings and the evidence he provided to Radebe in 2014 have been lost.\n\nThe final IGI report makes no reference to the information SARS and Van Loggerenberg provided to the IGI during the course of the 10-week long investigation in 2014. It, in fact, relies heavily on the testimony given by individuals implicated by Van Loggerenberg when he identified a range of individuals as being involved in an operation to hobble SARS.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Radebe on September 29, 2014, Van Loggerenberg attaches various pieces of evidence which SARS felt should form part of the IGI\u2019s investigation into the SSA and the SOU.\n\nThis includes:\n\nExplosive internal SARS memoranda about attempts at the highest levels of the then-government to thwart SARS investigations;\n\nThese documents also contained recordings about secret meetings where senior government officials were discussing irregular normalisation of their tax affairs;\n\nRecordings of smuggling kingpin Glenn Agliotti talking about bribing government officials and how the illegal tobacco trade functioned with the assistance of the SSA, NPA and Hawks;\n\nMessages and communication between a range of senior SSA operatives and managers, including Gibson Njenje (then director-general of SSA), Belinda Walter, who also worked for SSA and laid the original complaint against Van Loggerenberg, Ferdi Fryer, an SSA operative and others, which shows an alleged conspiracy by SSA against SARS;\n\nPrivileged correspondence between SARS and SSA about the two organisations\u2019 working relationship; and\n\nNotes made by Van Loggerenberg after meetings with journalists about the inner-workings of the SSA\u2019s SOU.\n\nThese datasets were in addition to evidence that Van Loggerenberg provided to the IGI in his first meeting with Radebe and her assistant, advocate Jay Govender, on August 25, 2014. This meeting also served as a formal interview, which was transcribed and recorded.\n\nAccording to Van Loggerenberg\u2019s affidavit, he used the meeting to convey to the IGI all of SARS\u2019s concerns about the assault against the institution and laid 38 complaints at the IGI concerning the undermining of and attacks on SARS by, among others, the SSA.\n\nHe also verbally delved into the datasets and selected pieces of evidence presented to the IGI, including the details surrounding the explosive internal SARS memoranda about attempts at the highest levels of the then-government to thwart SARS investigations.\n\nAccording to the September 2014 letter to the IGI, Van Loggerenberg said he believes Pillay \"briefed a high office on these matters\u2026\". It is unclear who exactly occupied the referenced office.\n\nVan Loggerenberg\u2019s detailing of this, allegedly highly-sensitive briefing, was also given and explained to Radebe during their first meeting. Transcripts and recordings have, however, been lost and there is no reference to it in the final IGI report.\n\nThe IGI recently confirmed that it will investigate Van Loggerenberg\u2019s original complaints about the assault on SARS and that an additional number of individuals, including Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, former SSA head Arthur Fraser, journalists Piet Rampedi and Mzilikazi wa Afrika and former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane will be added to its probe.", "description": "A trove of intelligence, documents and other datasets handed to the inspector-general of intelligence by the former head of SARS\u2019s investigations unit in 2014, and which allegedly proves the extent and scope of the conspiracy against the taxman, has been lost.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9434/fa2f3fa9196d43cf896801f8baf4f3d3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
