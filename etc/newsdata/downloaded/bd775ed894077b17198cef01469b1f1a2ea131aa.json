On Sunday, police dispersed protesters who tried to erect a barricade of debris from Saturday\u2019s violence.\n\nAnother indigenous leader said Sunday that protesters who have converged on Quito will remain until an agreement is reached on painful reforms such as a doubling of some fuel prices.\n\n\u201cNot just the leaders but the rank and file \u2014 and we will stay until there is a solution,\u201d said Salvador Quishpe of CONAIE.\n\nThe crisis broke out in early October after Moreno ordered fuel subsidies to be cut as part of a deal to obtain a $4.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nCONAIE had previously rejected an offer of dialogue but reversed course Saturday and said the talks would focus on ending the fuel hike.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that, God willing, today we can sit down and talk and end all this,\u201d said Quishpe, a former governor of an Amazon province.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres \u201cwelcomes the announcement of the start of a dialogue process,\u201d spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.\n\nGuterres \u201ccalls on all concerned to commit to inclusive and meaningful talks, and to work in good faith towards a peaceful solution,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEcuador\u2019s indigenous groups make up a quarter of the country\u2019s 17.3 million people. Thousands from disadvantaged communities from across the Amazon and the Andes have traveled to Quito where they are spearheading demands that the subsidies continue.\n\n\u2013 Media attacked \u2013\n\nDemonstrators on Saturday ransacked and set fire to the building housing the comptroller general\u2019s office, which was shrouded in thick smoke after being attacked with fire bombs.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office said 34 people were arrested.\n\nNearby, protesters had built barricades in front of the National Assembly building as police fired tear gas at them.\n\nThe Teleamazonas TV channel interrupted its regular broadcast to air images of broken windows, a burned vehicle and heavy police presence on the scene.\n\nThe station evacuated 25 employees, none of them hurt.\n\nEl Comercio newspaper reported on Twitter that its offices were attacked by a \u201cgroup of unknowns.\u201d It did not provide further details.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do with the events at the comptroller\u2019s office and Teleamazonas,\u201d said CONAIE.\n\nProtesters did not immediately heed the curfew that went into effect on Saturday, with security forces still struggling to impose order in some parts of the city as night fell.\n\n\u201cWhere are the mothers and fathers of the police? Why do they let them kill us?\u201d cried Nancy Quinyupani, an indigenous woman.\n\nThe restrictions in Quito, a city of 2.7 million, came on top of a state of emergency Moreno had declared on October 3, deploying some 75,000 military and police and imposing a nighttime curfew in the vicinity of government buildings.\n\nThe violence has forced Moreno to relocate his government to Ecuador\u2019s second city, Guayaquil, and has hit the oil industry hard with the energy ministry suspending more than two-thirds of its distribution of crude.\n\nProtesters seized three oil facilities in the Amazon earlier this week.\n\nMoreno is struggling with an economic crisis that he blames on waste and corruption by Correa\u2019s administration.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 Indigenous leaders and Ecuador\u2019s president began face-to-face talks on Sunday after nearly two weeks of violent street protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/57d314_man-walks-rubble-protests-fuel-price-hike-ordered-by-government-secure-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
