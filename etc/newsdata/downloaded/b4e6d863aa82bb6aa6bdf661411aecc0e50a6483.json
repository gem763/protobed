The official count from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency was 19 dead and 13 missing.\n\nHagibis dropped record amounts of rain for a period in some spots, according to meteorological officials, causing more than 20 rivers to overflow. In Kanagawa Prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, 100 centimeters (39 inches) of rainfall was recorded over the last 48 hours.\n\nSome of the muddy waters in streets, fields and residential areas have subsided. But many places remained flooded, with homes and surrounding roads covered in mud and littered with broken wooden pieces and debris. Some places normally dry still looked like giant rivers.\n\nSome who lined up for morning soup at evacuation shelters, which are housing 30,000 people, expressed concern about the homes they had left behind. Survivors and rescuers will also face colder weather with northern Japan turning chilly this week.\n\nRescue efforts were in full force with soldiers and firefighters from throughout Japan deployed. Helicopters could be seen plucking some of the stranded from higher floors and rooftops of submerged homes.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government will set up a special disaster team, including officials from various ministries, to deal with the fallout from the typhoon, including helping those in evacuation centers and boosting efforts to restore water and electricity to homes.\n\n\"Our response must be rapid and appropriate,\" Abe said, stressing that many people remained missing and damage was extensive.\n\nDamage was serious in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke. Areas in Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures in northern Japan were also badly flooded.\n\nIn such areas, rescue crew paddled in boats to each half-submerged home, calling out to anyone left stranded.", "description": "Hagibis dropped record amounts of rain for a period in some spots, according to meteorological officials, causing more than 20 rivers to overflow.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106179222-1571027853962gettyimages-1175564585.jpeg?v=1571027950", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
