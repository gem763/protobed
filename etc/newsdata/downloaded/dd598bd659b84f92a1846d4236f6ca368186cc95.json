Bush: Comedian Defends Friendship across the Aisle", "language": "en", "text": "(Danny Moloshok/Reuters)\n\nOn Sunday, a picture circulated of liberal comedian and television host Ellen DeGeneres sitting next to President George W. Bush at the Dallas Cowboys\u2013Green Bay Packers game. The backlash was swift, as progressives took to Twitter to voice their displeasure at the fact that she was smiling and laughing with Bush during the game, despite his role in the Iraq War, among other political disagreements.\n\nDeGeneres addressed the criticism during her show on Monday. \u201cDuring the game, they showed a shot of George and me laughing together, so people were upset,\u201d she said. \u201cThey thought, \u2018Why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2019 Didn\u2019t even notice I\u2019m holding the brand new iPhone 11.\u201d She continued:\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that we\u2019re all different. For instance, I wish people wouldn\u2019t wear fur. I don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m friends with people who wear fur, and I\u2019m friends with people who are furry, as a matter of fact. But just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not gonna be friends with them. When I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way you do. I mean be kind to everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nPredictably, her response did little to curb the harsh criticism lobbed at her from the left, but her comments were nonetheless encouraging. It\u2019s interesting that Bush received no censure from conservatives angry that he had been spotted sitting next to a progressive, lesbian celebrity at a football game, but DeGeneres continues to endure backlash for defending her friendship with someone across the political aisle.\n\nThough there is no shortage of vitriolic commentary across the political spectrum, it is increasingly partisans of the Left who demand ideological conformity, and total condemnation and rejection of those who fail to champion the progressive agenda.", "description": "Liberal comedian Ellen DeGeneres has faced censure from progressives for sitting next to former president George W.
