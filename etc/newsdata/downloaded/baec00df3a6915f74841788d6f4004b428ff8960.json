REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nBlackRock is the biggest investor in fossil fuels and has faced criticism particularly for its continued exposure to coal.\n\nIt says much of that is through passive, index-linked investment, which accounts for roughly 90% of its $6.84 trillion in assets under management, and that it is also the biggest investor in renewable energy.\n\nSumana Manohar, a manager of the new fund which has been launched with charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, told reporters in London on Tuesday it was focused on exposure to scrap, recycling and reducing plastic waste, and is actively managed.\n\nStarted on Oct. 2 with $20 million of seed capital, the fund is spread over 30 to 50 companies.\n\nAs examples, Manohar cited Adidas, which has committed to using recycled plastic and recycled polyester, Norway\u2019s Tomra, which provides what it calls \u201creverse vending machines\u201d that allow consumers to return glass bottles and cans to supermarkets, and U.S. company Ball Corp, which makes recyclable aluminum packaging.\n\n(GRAPHIC - MSCI vs Adidas vs Tomra vs Ball: here)\n\nManohar declined to name any other companies, but said she expected the fund to expand over the coming years and include, for instance, recycling businesses that provide battery minerals.\n\nEvy Hambro, global head of thematic and sector investing at BlackRock and who is also running the new fund, said the company had been assessing for about three years sustainability as a risk and an opportunity.\n\nSpeaking at a mining conference in Johannesburg last week, Hambro, who co-manages the BlackRock World Mining Trust (BRWM.L), said flows into investment funds labeled environmentally-friendly will increase the cost of capital rises for companies seen as less sustainable.\n\nOne result of the analysis of risk and business disruption, Hambro said, had been the partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Named after the British yachtswoman who set a record for circumnavigating the globe, it focuses on shifting the economy to a circular model that eliminates waste.\n\nAndrew Morlet, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, said it had previously worked closely with companies, governments and cities and the education system.\n\n\u201cThe finance sector is a very important part of accelerating this transition,\u201d he said.", "description": "BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, is actively investing in companies including Adidas , Tomra and Ball Corp through a new circular economy fund that bets on sustainable business.", "authors": ["Barbara Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438476216&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9711C", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
