Thanks again Tesla!.'\n\nTesla has been in the spotlight recently over 'autopilot accidents'.Federal investigators concluded in June 2018 that a Tesla SUV involved in a fatal accident in California earlier this year accelerated before it crashed, killing its driver.\n\nThe vehicle was travelling at 50mph according to Whittle when it detected the family of bears ahead\n\nA mother bear and two cubs are seen crossing the road, before she appears startled by the lights and comes to a stop with her babies, (pictured)\n\nThe Tesla Model X had been operating using the firm's Autopilot software when it collided with a freeway barrier in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, in a preliminary report on the March 23 crash, also said that data shows the Model X SUV did not brake or try to steer around the barrier in the three seconds before the crash in Silicon Valley.\n\nEarlier this month, video showed a California Tesla driver sleeping behind the wheel as his car speeds down the highway on autopilot.\n\nThe driver said it was an 'amazing demonstration' of the improvement in Tesla's Autopilot function since he purchased. Pictured is a version of the Tesla Model 3\n\nThe footage obtained by Storyful shows the unconscious driver sitting upright with his head tilted back as his car speeds down Interstate 280 in San Mateo, California in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe person who filmed the Tesla shows him or herself driving at least 82 mph to keep up with the unconscious Tesla driver.\n\nThe Bay Area incident is the latest in a string of sleeping Tesla driver sightings across the U.S.\n\nIn September, a Massachusetts motorist caught a Tesla driver and his female passenger snoozing while the car drove at high speeds on the state turnpike in the Boston metro area.\n\nDakota Randall, who shot video of the incident, told the Boston Globe he honked his horn at the driver, who was traveling 55-60 mph at the time, but the man and his passenger would not wake up.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment earlier this month.\n\nThe company has issued multiple statements through the media telling its drivers it's not safe to fall asleep behind the wheel, even when using autopilot.\n\nAt least four fatal accidents involving Tesla drivers using autopilot have been reported in recent years.", "description": "A Tesla Model 3 came to an impressive halt when it avoided a hitting a mother bear and her two cubs while the vehicle was in autopilot mode while  travelling through a national park in Montana.", "authors": ["Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/15/19926794-0-image-a-19_1571495943986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
