According to federal prosecutors, Ellision kidnapped Hernandez at gunpoint in July 2018. The Feds allege that Mack peddled heroin and ecstasy.\n\nAs the prosecution wrapped up its questioning of Hernandez, assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Longyear asked him about Jim Jones.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a retired rapper,\u201d Hernandez said. (Jones, in fact, released an album just this May.)\n\nWas Jones in Nine Trey?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hernandez replied.\n\nThe prosecution played audio from a November 2018 call. In the conversation, intercepted via wiretap, Jim Jones and alleged Nine Trey \u201cGodfather\u201d Jamel \u201cMel Murda\u201d Jones complain about Hernandez publicly trash-talking gang members.\n\n\u201cNow he gotta get violated,\u201d Jim Jones said.\n\n\u201cYeah, super violated. Super duper,\u201d Jamel Jones said.\n\n\u201cJust tell that n- - - - that he not a gang member no more. He kicked out the whip. He was never a gang member,\u201d Jim Jones said. (He has not responded to Hernandez\u2019s allegation at time of publication.)\n\nHernandez said at one point that Cardi B was a Blood. (She has discussed Bloods affiliation before, but talking about other people\u2019s gang ties is poor form, which is probably one of the reasons there\u2019s a #Tekashisnitch9 hashtag.) A rep for Cardi has since denied Hernandez\u2019s allegation, telling TMZ, \u201cThis is not true.\u201d\n\nThe courtroom drama was intensified by several embarrassing security breaches at the courthouse.\n\nRecording audio and video in federal courthouses is strictly prohibited. People aren\u2019t allowed to take electronics into the courthouse unless they have special permission. Somehow, however, illegally recorded audio and video of Hernandez\u2019s testimony leaked. Audio was posted to YouTube on Wednesday. A still photo and video of Hernandez\u2019s testimony was posted to DJ Akademiks\u2019s Twitter account Thursday. (Hernandez has referred to the Complex host as a \u201cfriend.\u201d)\n\nHernandez, whose credibility has repeatedly come under question, also admitted that he lied in interviews following his alleged kidnapping.\n\n\u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d Longyear asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I was humiliated,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cHumiliated because I constantly bragged that no one could touch me \u2014 that I was untouchable. The king of New York.\u201d\n\nHernandez said he lied \u201cthat I blacked out.\u201d\n\nThe rapper also revealed that his \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d chain \u2014 stolen during his alleged kidnapping \u2014 didn\u2019t cost him any money. \u201cWe had a deal,\u201d he said of his jewelers in South Florida. \u201cThey gave me the chain free, to promote it.\u201d As Hernandez boosted the chain on social, the jewelers would make smaller versions and sell them, he said. He also claimed that the total value of jewelry stolen during his alleged kidnapping was some $365,000.\n\nEllison\u2019s lawyer, Devereaux Cannick, continued to portray Hernandez as a fabulist who staged his kidnapping to promote the \u201cFEFE\u201d video.\n\n\u201cYou were kidnapped on the 21st?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cJuly 22.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when was \u2018FEFE\u2019 supposed to be released?\u201d\n\n\u201cJuly 22.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this alleged robbery and kidnapping happened hours before \u2018FEFE\u2019 was supposed to be released?\u201d Cannick said.\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nAs part of this strategy, Cannick also asked Hernandez about trolling \u2014 which Hernandez had said \u201ccan mean a lot of things but, to me, it means agonizing, mocking \u2026 showin\u2019 off a little bit of my personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tell others to suck your body parts?\u201d Cannick asked.\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho did you tell that to?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born rapper also talked about his plea deal: He copped to nine federal counts in January and agreed to cooperate against Nine Trey in the hopes of landing a more lenient sentence.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Hernandez would face a minimum of 47 years in federal lockup. If Hernandez meets the terms of his plea deal \u2014 \u201cto tell the truth, to testify,\u201d he explained \u2014 prosecutors can write a \u201c5K1\u201d letter, which would let the judge sentence him below the minimum. (To be clear, the sentence would still be totally up to the judge.)\n\n\u201cWhat type of information goes in the letter?\u201d Longyear asked.\n\n\u201cThe good, bad, and the ugly,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nUpdate, 6:28 p.m.: Cardi B has responded to Tekashi 6ix9ine\u2019s testimony that she is involved with the East Coast gang Nine Trey. Via Instagram, Cardi shared the now-viral clip of Keke Palmer being asked who Dick Cheney is and not having any idea.", "description": "Tekashi 6ix9ine snitched on still more rappers in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, matter-of-factly claiming that Dipset rapper Jim Jones and Cardi B were in the East Coast gang Nine Trey.", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/19-tekashi-cardi.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
