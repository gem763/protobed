It also requested information on age, income, sexual frequency and race.\n\nThe researchers then focused on possible links between what they considered \u201cextreme grooming,\u201d which was classified as the removal of all pubic hair at least weekly in the past year, or at least six times in the past month, and testing positive for chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n\nAccording to the data, between 18 and 54 percent of the study\u2019s participants said they were \u201cextreme\u201d groomers, while almost all had said they had done some grooming. About 10 percent of the women who participated in the study tested positive for either chlamydia or gonorrhea, but researchers did not find a connection between the results and grooming practices.\n\nWOMAN'S MASSIVE BRAIN TUMOR DISCOVERED AFTER SHE COMPLAINED OF 'PHANTOM SMELLS' LIKE BURNT TOAST\n\nMaria Gallo, a study adviser and Ohio State\u2019s associate professor of epidemiology, and Luster said they weren\u2019t surprised by the study\u2019s findings, but were alarmed by a lack of evidence in previous studies.\n\n\u201cParticularly concerning is that previous work didn\u2019t adjust for sexual frequency,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cIt could be that women who were having more sex with more people \u2013 and were therefore more likely to contract infections \u2013 were more likely to be grooming.\u201d\n\nThough the study was small, Luster said it\u2019s important for women to know that the previous research on grooming habits may not be conclusive despite widespread availability on the internet.\n\nIn 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it recorded over 1.7 million cases of chlamydia, making it the most common STD in the U.S. An additional 555,608 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC in that same year, accounting for a 18.6 percent increase from the number reported in 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChlamydia can be asymptomatic in women, which can be problematic because if left untreated, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. Pregnant women with chlamydia also risk passing it onto infants during delivery, which can lead to blindness or pneumonia. Gonorrhea can also lead to pelvic inflammatory disease if left untreated, and it has also developed resistance to the antibiotics typically used to treat it.", "description": "Though the study was small, its lead author said it\u2019s important for women to know that the previous research on grooming habits may not be conclusive despite widespread availability on the internet.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/shaving_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
