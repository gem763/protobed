You can find there\u2019s these under-researched businesses and you can see they're performing better than the market thinks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously we really like picking businesses we think can become really big in the future. What we're finding is the companies we're investing in are really companies that no one would have heard of in Australia.\n\n\u201cWe have a great opportunity to find these businesses but also get them at really cheap prices. We really focus on looking for companies that are under-researched with a big change under way.\u201d\n\nWhile we've surpassed that 15 per cent in year one, we don't want investors expecting 40 per cent every year. \u2014 Andrew Mitchell\n\nThe fund\u2019s biggest holding is in email encryption technology provider Zix Group.\n\n\u201cWe went and saw it in Dallas. It doesn't really have investor relations, very limited coverage but it\u2019s been growing 20-30 per cent,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nZix has a market cap of just under $US400 million ($590 million) and has risen 37.2 per cent in the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cWe're quite confident they're performing very well and it has a great management team,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of the fund\u2019s holdings are in the US and it has some smaller holdings in Europe, Japan and the UK.\n\n\u201cWe've been able to generate good returns but from our perspective what\u2019s more important is what has generated those numbers,\" Mr Mitchell said\n\n\"We've had 60 [earnings] upgrades to six downgrades and that's the best ratio we've ever had in any of our funds.\u201d\n\n'Super growthy'\n\nThe biggest sector weighting within the fund is information technology, mirroring a similar weighting to Ophir\u2019s High Conviction Fund, which has large holdings in Afterpay Touch, NEXTDC and Xero.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks we're super 'growthy' and while our best performing stock last year was Afterpay, not far behind was Austal, which was a value stock,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nThe idea for a global fund had been driven by demand from Ophir's investor base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"People were always asking us what the next fund would be and because we're seeing the world becoming more globally oriented, trends find their way to Australia faster and faster, and we thought having a global fund would make our Australian investment ability better,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\n\"It's surpassed our expectations in terms of our investors wanting to back us with the global strategy.\"\n\nThe firm made several key hires during the past year to strengthen its offshore expertise, including bringing in former senior Citi equity research analyst Michael Goltsman and former Brant Point Capital hedge fund manager Tyler Errickson.\n\nBest performers\n\n\"We have a great investment group that love the foundational idea based on alignment and getting the best performers for our investors,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\nHe tempered investor expectations despite the strong performance of the fund in its first year.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is we have all our personal money invested, our families and friends are invested in the fund too. We're trying to get 15 per cent [annual return] and we're looking for investors who are in it for the long term. This is the family office for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile we've surpassed that 15 per cent in year one, we don't want investors expecting 40 per cent every year. We want to under-promise and over-deliver, and as with our other funds, we've been able to beat that 15 per cent to date.\u201d", "description": "Small and mid-cap manager Ophir Asset Management has been quietly managing a global fund, returning 42 per cent to a handful of investors over the past year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3709%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98c38598f429857115b682e2fe6b3334d56f0595", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
