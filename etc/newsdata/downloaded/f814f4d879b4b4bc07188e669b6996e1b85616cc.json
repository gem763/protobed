Its 65-metre span doesn\u2019t arch over a river or a railway. Instead, below us, there is a thousand feet of desert air.\n\nThe bridge is inside the top floor of the Kingdom Tower, the dominant landmark in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n\nImagine a glossy, metallic-blue skyscraper with a huge V-shaped chunk taken out of the top floors. The bridge links the top bits of the \u2018V\u2019. Expats call it \u2018the bottle opener\u2019.\n\nThe sky's the limit: The Saudis are allowing the citizens of 49 countries to obtain instant tourist e-visas in a bid to change its image. Pictured are hot air balloons in Al Ula\n\nThe Sky Bridge offers epic views of this sprawling Arabian desert megacity, a pinkish-tawny expanse of low-rise concrete buildings with three or four clusters of skyscrapers. There is also plenty of wasteland awaiting the next big architectural statement.\n\nAnother extraordinary thing about this scene, frankly, is me. I was sloshing through the Chilterns with the dog when news broke that, for the first time, the Saudis are to allow the citizens of 49 countries to obtain instant tourist e-visas.\n\nI was first in line and, within two days, I was standing under a poster at Heathrow Airport showing a tropical beach surrounded by turquoise seas, with the strapline: \u2018This is not The Maldives. This is Saudi.\u2019\n\nAnd the visas and ads are only the start. Crucially, the Saudis have announced that unmarried Western couples can share hotel rooms while on holiday in the country (though not, as yet, same-sex couples). Old Saudi hands can scarcely believe it.\n\nUnexpected delights: A street in Jeddah\u2019s Old Town. This reconstruction of the medieval sea port includes the Gate to Makkah (Mecca)\n\nBy 2030, there may be 30 million of us visiting Saudi. That is the target set by the 34-year-old Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, or \u2018MBS\u2019, the controversial figure bringing about nothing short of a social and economic revolution in the country.\n\nBack at the Sky Bridge, I take a lift down to my hotel, the Four Seasons, also in the Kingdom Tower. In my Birkenstocks and linen trousers, I stick out like a surfer dude at a Buckingham Palace garden party \u2014 not because I am Western, but because I am so obviously a tourist, perhaps the first proper one of this new era.\n\nCome back in two, five or ten years and the lobby may be a sea of Hawaiian shirts and flip flops.\n\nWHAT TO DO IN SAUDI ARABIA Masmak Fort: Site of the daring raid that led to the Saudis recapturing Riyadh from the Ottomans. The National Museum of Saudi Arabia: Impressive, un-gimmicky tour of Saudi Arabia from pre-Islamic times to modern day. Edge of the World: Book a 4x4 guide to reach this epic, Lawrence of Arabia landscape two hours from Riyadh. Mada\u2019in Saleh: Saudi Arabia\u2019s Petra; an ancient Nabatean city preserved by the desert air. Old Town Jeddah: This reconstruction of the medieval sea port includes the Gate to Makkah (Mecca). King Fahd\u2019s Fountain, Jeddah: Jets of water reach 1,000ft high. Umluj: The \u2018Saudi Maldives\u2019 on the Red Sea. Empty white beaches, coral reefs \u2014 and, unlike the Maldives, a mountain backdrop and archeological sites, too. Neom: Describing itself as \u2018the world\u2019s most ambitious project\u2019, this is a \u00a3312 billion city of the future on (and across) the Red Sea border with Jordan. We\u2019re promised flying cars, dinosaur robots and a giant artificial moon.\n\nThe Four Seasons, jointly owned by a Saudi prince and Bill Gates, is gearing up to get a slice of those 30 million.\n\nThe Saudi hierarchy is certainly not understating how momentous this change is. \u2018We are opening our economy. We are opening our society. Now we open our home and open our hearts to guests from around the world\u2019 was how one bigwig put it at the glitzy event to announce the visa news.\n\nFirst to open in the initial phase will be heritage sites and huge projects such as the futuristic Neom city on the Red Sea.\n\nYou will need some help on the ground. I meet the Four Seasons\u2019 guest experience manager Ahmed, who sets himself the tasks of a) getting you into places that you might not normally get into; and b) cheerfully discussing any rumours, legends and gossip you may have brought with you along with your factor-50 sunblock.\n\nAhmed introduces me to Saudi travel video blogger Yousef AlSudais. We talk over fresh juices in the lobby \u2014 no cold beers here, obviously. Come to think of it, if you\u2019re planning a dry January, then a trip to Saudi might be just the job.\n\nYousef reminds me that Saudi is the 12th-largest country in the world. While most of its 830,000 square miles are inhospitable desert, there is surprising diversity, too.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got tropical islands, green mountains in the south and snow in the north,\u2019 he says. Though he wouldn\u2019t recommend Riyadh in summer, Yousef adds that even in August you can find variety and respite.\n\nHe recommends taking the country one region at a time. If I were more of a beach person, I\u2019d be tempted by those \u2018Maldives\u2019 posters, even though Yousef says: \u2018There\u2019s no one there!\u2019 The coastal city of Jeddah is relatively artier and relaxed. True, that\u2019s a big \u2018relatively\u2019 in a country that, until now, strived to be the most conservative Islamic state on Earth.\n\nBut I choose Riyadh, which is the heart of the modern Saudi state \u2014 and the family that, uniquely in the world, gave its name to the country.\n\nUnder new rules unmarried Western couples can now share hotel rooms while on holiday in the country. Pictured is cosmopolitan Jeddah\u2019s landscaped coastline\n\nWith a population of nearly seven million and covering 700 square miles, Riyadh is not one of those Middle Eastern cities where you can stroll around outdoor souks or rest outside cafes, smoking a hubbly bubbly.\n\nIts grid system is modelled on American cities and designed around the car \u2014 I found myself comparing it to Houston or Phoenix.\n\nThose baking-hot cities are not the loveliest places in the world, and neither is Riyadh. But it has some unforgettable sites.\n\nWHAT NOT TO DO... Dress: Women no longer need wear the black abaya, and Westerners need not cover their hair in most places. But dress modestly \u2014 no shorts and, for many women, the abaya is still the most practical garment. The opposite sex: Strict segregation laws have been relaxed, but some places do still have segregated zones. Prayers: You will hear the call to prayer five times a day. It\u2019s polite to offer your guide or driver the chance to halt your tour for this. Politics: Beware of openly criticising the monarchy. Alcohol: Drinking is prohibited in Saudi Arabia so don\u2019t take the risk. Drugs: Zero tolerance \u2014 execution if you\u2019re caught.\n\nWe have lunch at Najd Village, a traditional restaurant with cosy, carpeted rooms around a central courtyard. When Ahmed takes off his headdress, I realise something unusual about him: he\u2019s Chinese. His Muslim family fled Mao and arrived in Riyadh via Cairo in 1957.\n\nThe Arabs and Chinese certainly have one thing in common: they are great over-orderers of food. Ahmed\u2019s hospitality requires us to take away two shopping bags full of uneaten spicy rice and yoghurty lamb.\n\nIn the evening, we head to Diriyah, a ruined fort 20 minutes\u2019 drive from Riyadh \u2014 rather longer if you have to wait, as we did, for the king and his cavalcade to pass through.\n\nDiriyah\u2019s adobe walls have been reinforced and sculpted. From a distance, it looks like some modernist villa in New Mexico. Within the walls is a warren of streets and museum exhibits, including a fascinating one about the story of the Arabian horse.\n\nIf Mecca and Medina are sacred to all Arabs, Diriyah is the heart and soul of the Saudis.\n\nThe Saudi clan emerged in Diriyah around 600 years ago. They used it as their base, as, inspired by the teachings of the early 18th-century religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, their emirate set about conquering and forming alliances with neighbours in the desert and far beyond.\n\nEventually, that first Saudi empire incurred the wrath of the mighty Ottoman empire. That\u2019s why Diriyah\u2019s fort is a ruin: in 1818, it was sacked by the Ottomans.\n\nThe Saudis waited for their chance. In 1902, with the Ottoman empire in decline, they mounted a daring dawn raid on Riyadh\u2019s Masmak fort (another site well worth visiting).\n\nThe second Saudi empire arose in triumph. In 1932, after the turmoil of World War I, and with oil riches just around the corner, King Abdulaziz announced the creation of the third state, and modern Saudi Arabia came into being.\n\nHigh ride: Cable cars in the breathtaking Abha mountains\n\nThat story is told in spectacular fashion at Diriyah. As night falls, I am ushered to a small grandstand to watch the dun-coloured wall turn fluorescent green, pink and orange. Under a crescent moon (a real one), stirring Arabic music begins and flames creep up the walls. They become palm trees, then morph into street scenes, battles and festivals.\n\nThe 3D light show, with the fort as the screen, is thrilling \u2014 but I am the only one watching. The presentation ends with an image of the Crown Prince projected on to the highest tower, next to and slightly behind his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz. MBS: heir, reformer and, you suspect, scriptwriter.\n\nYou may have seen him on a smaller screen lately, stating that he takes \u2018full responsibility as a leader\u2019 for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but denying that he personally ordered the killing.\n\nAdventure: Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman hopes by 2030 there will be 30 million of us visiting Saudi Arabi. \u2018Dune-bashing\u2019 in the desert (above) is one of the draws for tourists\n\nYet, within Saudi, he represents hope and progress for a country where around half the population is under 25. The Crown Prince is no Prince Charles, searching for a role until his turn comes. The tourism revolution, the building of the futuristic Neom city on the Red Sea, the fact that women can now drive, attend university and act with far more freedom \u2014 that\u2019s MBS.\n\nIt is 40 years since Muslim extremists seized the Mecca mosque and tried to overthrow the House of Saud. The latter\u2019s response: executions, then a concerted campaign to be more socially conservative than their most conservative opponents.\n\nSalman bin Abdulaziz and his son have called time on that era.\n\nThe island of Umluj in the new advertising campaign\n\nAfter the film, I am joined by a Diriyah guide, Malak. She is in her early 20s and recently graduated after studying English translation. The revolution in tourism promises her a long career. Those words would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. I\u2019m a Westerner alone with a Saudi woman. She has been to university. She is planning a career.\n\nMalak looks elegant in her fitted waistcoat and tailored abaya. She is also wearing a full hijab \u2014 the veil. Does she mind if I ask why? Not at all. It\u2019s because she prefers to do so.\n\nEveryone I meet is keen (overkeen?) that I realise how dress is a matter of personal choice.\n\nLater, we look in at Mono, a trendy art gallery in the Al Mutamarat district. The manager has a floor-length cotton tunic open to show her Western-style jacket and trousers. She says she has never worn a headscarf.\n\nThen there is Noora, training at hotel school in Switzerland. She accompanies us on a desert trip the next day. She has close-cropped hair, tattoos and wears grey jogging pants.\n\nShe tells me it will be many years before Saudis find her choices acceptable. But at least her shins are safe from the Muttawa, the feared religious police who would patrol the streets with big sticks, looking for signs of Western dress.\n\nThe desert trip begins at 5am. We take a Cadillac 4x4 through the scrubby landscape. A falcon swoops over the thorn bushes. By the side of the dirt track, a small herd of camels gaze at us with curiosity. Eventually, the car pulls up before a gap in the low hills. Just as well.\n\nOver the brow, there is a drop of around 200ft. Beyond it is mile after mile of desert.\n\nIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that the desert is like the sea. But how else do you describe this flat, seemingly limitless expanse, the dry, snaking riverbeds making wavelike patterns far into the 900,000 square miles of arid wilderness?\n\nSaudi is the 12th-largest country in the world and the falcon is its national bird. While most of its 830,000 square miles are inhospitable desert, there is surprising diversity, too\n\nA vertiginous path leads to a rocky outcrop. I pick my way to the farthest point, cursing my trainers better suited to a shopping mall. Then I check the map on my phone. I can now say I\u2019ve been to the Edge Of The World.\n\nI had expected this harsh, yet sublime, desert wilderness, but not the welcoming warmth of the Saudi people. A journey here won\u2019t be for everyone. There are rules, which I\u2019d sum up as \u2018dress modestly and be respectful\u2019.\n\nAs we shake hands at the airport, Ahmed asks what I have enjoyed most about the trip. Just being here, I tell him.", "description": "The Saudis are allowing the citizens of 49 countries to obtain instant tourist e-visas and have relaxed rules around unmarried Western couples sharing hotel rooms.
