But the salts identified by Rapin and company looked different than those typically produced by drying freshwater lakes.\n\nWhen lakes are evaporated, pure salt crystals are usually left behind. But scientists found layers of mineral salts mixed with sediment within the Sutton Island deposit.\n\nThe findings suggest the salts were deposited in a wet environment, like one dotted by shallow, briny ponds. Scientists liken the region\u2019s ancient environment to the South America\u2019s Altiplano, where alpine lakes and streams from the surrounding mountains feed a series of saline lakes on an arid, high-altitude plateau. The lakes are very sensitive to changes in climate.\n\n\u201cDuring drier periods, the Altiplano lakes become shallower, and some can dry out completely,\u201d Rapin said. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re vegetation-free even makes them look a little like Mars.\u201d\n\nCuriosity\u2019s earliest observations revealed a landscape characterized by large, flat lake beds. But as the rover has explored higher and higher elevations, its instruments have revealed increasingly dynamic environs \u2014 gradually inclined layers of unique minerals that could only have been formed by wind and streams.\n\n\u201cFinding inclined layers represents a major change, where the landscape isn\u2019t completely underwater anymore,\u201d said Curiosity researcher Chris Fedo. \u201cWe may have left the era of deep lakes behind.\u201d\n\nThe rover\u2019s climb up the slope of Mount Sharp has also helped scientists begin to see the gradual wet-to-dry shift that played out on Mars over the course of millions of years.\n\nCuriosity is headed back to Sutton Island, and researchers hope the rover\u2019s observations will offer additional clues about the forces that shaped the region\u2019s unique sediment structures.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say whether we\u2019re seeing wind or river deposits yet in the clay-bearing unit, but we\u2019re comfortable saying is it\u2019s definitely not the same thing as what came before or what lies ahead,\u201d Fedo said.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 Data collected by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover suggests Mars once hosted dozens of shallow briny ponds that periodically overflowed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
