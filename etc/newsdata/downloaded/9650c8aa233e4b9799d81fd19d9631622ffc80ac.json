Microsoft said the attacks were not \u201ctechnically sophisticated,\u201d but the hackers did compromise at least four accounts belonging to Americans.\n\nThe company did not identify the presidential candidate targeted by the group.\n\n\u201cPhosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts,\u201d Tom Burt, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of customer security and trust, wrote in a Friday blog post. \u201cFor example, they would seek access to a secondary email account linked to a user\u2019s Microsoft account, then attempt to gain access to a user\u2019s Microsoft account through verification sent to the secondary account. In some instances, they gathered phone numbers belonging to their targets and used them to assist in authenticating password resets.\u201d\n\nThe attacks, Microsoft said, indicated that Phosphorous is \u201chighly motivated\u201d to target prominent American journalists, politicians, and government officials.\n\n\u2014\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
