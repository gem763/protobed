Not far away near the southern shore of Lake Erie sits Villa Angela-St. Joseph, the high school where he starred as a linebacker and point guard on two state title basketball teams.\n\nFletcher, who played 16 seasons in the NFL for St. Louis, Buffalo and Washington, eventually soared over John Carroll University, his beloved alma mater where on this sunny final Friday in September a group of students stood on the school\u2019s football field and saluted their famous alum.\n\nThey held a sign in JCU\u2019s colors that said: \u201cCongrats London.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d Fletcher said following his sentimental sky ride. \u201cThe surprise of a lifetime.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been an emotional whirlwind lately for Fletcher, who was enshrined last week in the Redskins\u2019 Ring of Honor. He\u2019ll soon become a member of the College Football Hall of Fame - inducted along with Goodyear\u2019s iconic blimp, the first non-player or coach elected.\n\n\u201cMy fellow Hall of Famer,\u201d Fletcher said affectionately in describing the Akron, Ohio-based aircraft, whose connection to college football began in 1955 when it provided aerial TV coverage for the Rose Bowl. \u201cGrowing up in Northeast Ohio, you see the Goodyear Blimp all the time. You knew if the blimp was around, something big was about to happen. If you saw the blimp at a game, you knew it was a big game.\u201d\n\nGoodyear arranged the above-ground trip on its famous 246-foot, 20,000-pound blimp for Fletcher, along with a reunion with the coach who convinced him football was his future.\n\nHe was joined on the tour by Mike Moran, who coached him in high school and college. Moran\u2019s addition for the journey above Cleveland was a surprise until just moments before takeoff.\n\nAs the giant blue-gold-and-gray colored blimp descended on one of the runways at Cuyahoga County Airport, Fletcher turned to discover that his friend and mentor would be accompanying him on his sentimental sky ride.\n\n\u201cHow did you sneak up on me?\u201d Fletcher said to Moran, who retired as John Carroll\u2019s basketball coach in 2017 after 25 years, but still heads the men\u2019s golf program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be your pilot,\u201d Moran said, joking.\n\n\u201cWell, then I\u2019m going to call my wife and tell her to up the insurance,\u201d Fletcher said, laughing.\n\nThe two men boarded for a trip back through their years together. For Fletcher, it was a chance to relive his inspiring story.\n\n\u201cAll the odds were stacked against me,\u201d he said.\n\nFletcher accepted a basketball scholarship at St. Francis (Pa.) before returning after one year to Cleveland to be closer with his family \u201cbecause there was a lot of stuff going on in my house, some substance abuse issues.\u201d He enrolled at John Carroll, paying his own way, and wanted to keep playing basketball. But the 5-foot-10, 245-pounder\u2019s rough style was more suited for open spaces than tight gymnasiums.\n\n\u201cHe played basketball like he played football,\u201d Moran said, smiling. \u201cYou talk about in-your-face defense, he invented it. When he touched the basketball it was first and goal. This was a guy who was born to play football.\u201d\n\nFletcher took Moran\u2019s advice and made football a priority. He dominated at the Division III level - he had 29 tackles in one game as a senior - while catching the eye of pro scouts because of his speed and toughness. In three seasons at John Carroll, Fletcher recorded 386 tackles, 14 sacks and three interceptions.\n\nStill, his size prevented him being drafted, and Fletcher signed with the Rams as undrafted free agent in 1998. He took it from there, recording 2,031 career tackles, 39 sacks 23 interceptions. He made the Pro Bowl four times, won a Super Bowl and is just one of four players to start more than 250 consecutive games.\n\n\u201cWhen I came out, there wasn\u2019t a ton of Division III players that made it in the National Football League,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I had the kind of success I had, you saw more and more Division III guys not only playing but getting drafted. I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d\n\nNow retired, he\u2019ll enter one Hall of Fame this year and Fletcher has been nominated for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame - the one reserved for giants.\n\nAnd a little linebacker from a little school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m soaking it all in,\u201d Fletcher said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "London Fletcher looked down and traced his unlikely path to football stardom.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": ""}
