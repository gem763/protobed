Mike Lee (R-UT) made the request on Thursday, shortly his fourth bid to pass his S.286 green-card giveaway bill. The bill was quickly blocked by an objection from a Democratic Senator \u2014 while the other 52 GOP Senators did not speak out. \u201cWe\u2019re now down to one objector, just one,\u201d Lee claimed, adding:\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know is how long any one objector will continue to object to something that does as much good as this bill does while doing no harm. It is pretty hard to do that \u2026 I\u2019m going to have to keep doing it until I lose my voice.\n\n\u201cOver time, [objectors] tend to get tired of objecting, in part, because they hear from good people like you who tell them this legislation is good, this legislation needs to pass,\u201d Lee told the Indian workers, most of whom voluntarily took white-collar jobs, salaries and even careers from American graduates in exchange for their employers\u2019 promises to give them green cards.\n\n\u201cI want to come here and say thank you,\u201d Lee told the applauding foreign workers. likely including some of who have taken jobs and money from Lee\u2019s Utah constituents, adding;\n\nThank you for living in this country and for wanting to be here, thank you for your willingness to speak about and educate your fellow beings about this issue. Thank you for defending me online \u2014 I\u2019ve seen so many who have been part of your organization who have stepped up online as the attacks have come, and have clarified the truth and have done so with unmistakably well-informed words, never unkind, always informative and ultimately very persuasive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been as close as we are today, right now\u201d to pass the outsourcing bill, the GOP Senator told the foreign workers, who are neither citizens and nor legal residents of the United States:\n\nWe\u2019re now down to one objector, just one. What we don\u2019t know is how long any one objector will continue to object to something that does as much good as this bill does, while doing no harm. It is pretty hard to do that.\n\nLee\u2019s call for foreign lobbying was echoed by Leon Fresco, a Democrat who works with the Indian group, and who helped write the Gang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill in 2013:\n\nAnyone saying S.386 is dead is clearly not watching the past 6 months. Each time a Senator blocks, the backlogged community works harder to tell their stories, and the hold is released. The only people tweeting that this bill is dead are pple who want it to die. #keepworking \u2014 Leon Fresco (@FrescoLeon) October 18, 2019\n\nLee insisted that the other 53 GOP Senators really do support his outsourcing legislation: \u201cIf this bill were on the floor today for an up or down vote, it would pass overwhelmingly.\u201d\n\nFew GOP Senators want their voters to see them voting for Lee\u2019s bill, which exports the college-grad jobs needed by their husbands and wives, sons and daughters. But no GOP Senator has publicly denounced Lee\u2019s business-backed giveaway bill, which has been twice blocked by Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin.\n\nBut Durbin blocked Lee\u2019s bill because he thinks it does not provide enough green cards to foreign workers. In turn, Lousiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy has blocked Durbin\u2019s \u201cRELIEF Act,\u201d which would annually allow roughly 100,000 Indian workers to get green cards providing they take good jobs from Durbin\u2019s constituents.\n\nLee also blamed Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell for not allowing a formal vote on his bill, and for forcing Lee to see passage via the fast-track \u2013and easily blocked \u2013 \u201cUnanimous Consent\u201d process. \u201cStrategic judgment calls made by those who set the calendar for the Senate \u2014 it is the source of great frustration,\u201d he told the foreign contract-workers.\n\nWatch the video here.\n\n\u201cAnyone watching the events over the past couple weeks would have arrived at the conclusion this is a globalists wet dream come true,\u201d said a statement from Kevin Lynn, founder of Progressives for Immigration Reform. \u201cNot only are our legislators subject to bribery through our corrupt campaign finance system, they are subject to intimidation by hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals living within our borders whose presence in the country was and continues to be predicated on the displacement of American workers [whom] corporations have deemed to be expensive and expendable.\u201d\n\nLee repeatedly touted his outsourcing bill as a noble effort against supposed anti-Indian \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d\n\nLee argued that his bill is morally good because it would remove the so-called \u201ccountry caps\u201d which are intended to diversify the award of green cards to people from many countries. That diversity counts as \u201cdiscrimination\u201d because it ensures that only about 10,000 Indians workers can get green cards each year, he said. Hill bill would allow up 60,000 Indian workers to get green cards.\n\nRemoving country caps \u201cstands to reason; it is a matter of simple logic to conclude \u2026 it does not make any sense to put an arbitrary cap on the basis of what country someone came from,\u2019 he told the Indians.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfair discrimination. That is not what this country is about \u2026 We\u2019ve got almost no-one on in the Senate who pushes back against the underlying idea of the bill \u2026 literally no-one in the Senate thinks the underlying concept is a bad idea,\u201d he claimed.\n\nBut no Senator or staffer in the Senate says President Donald Trump\u2019s curbs on China\u2019s government\u2019s aggressive economic policy is anti-Asian discrimination.\n\nThe country caps on Indian migration curb the Indian government\u2019s economic policy of sending their workers into the U.S. economy. That policy already has a name \u2014 \u201cthe U.S-India Outsourcing Economy\u201d \u2014 and it provided $78 billion in trade to India in 2018 by transferring at least 1.5 million college-level jobs to Indians in the United States or in India.\n\nSo Lee\u2019s removal of the \u201ccountry caps\u201d would supercharge the Indian government\u2019s ability to transfer millions of Americans\u2019 jobs to Indian graduates \u2014 just as Congress\u2019 approval of free-trade rules allowed China\u2019s government to transfer millions of blue-collar Midwestern factory jobs back to China.\n\nRoughly 800,000 Indian college-graduate visa-workers now hold a wide variety of U.S. jobs in technology, healthcare, accounting, and business. Moreover, these visa workers have helped to move more than one million additional U.S. jobs back to teams of graduates working in India.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nThis onshore/offshore process is described in a discrimination lawsuit against one of the Indian-owned outsourcing firms, Larson & Toubro Infotech.\n\nThe firm won a technology-support contract from Iconix Brand Group Inc. in New York. The support was managed by one American employee of Larson & Toubro, according to the lawsuit filed by the D.C. firm of Kotchen & Low. The single American ran a New York team, which consisted of roughly eight Indians who likely arrived with H-1B work visas, the lawsuit says. But the single American also ran a team of 20 Indians in India, and he reported to two Indian managers in India. So the visa programs allowed the Indian company to take roughly 30 good jobs from U.S. white-collar workers with just eight visas, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit noted that \u201cfrom 2013 to 2018, LTI received 9,785 new H-1B visas (or visa amendments) and almost 200 new L-1 visas (or visa amendments) \u2013 far more positions than could actually exist given that LTI only employs about 7,500 employees in the U.S.\u201d The surplus of visa workers allows the company to sideline American job-seekers and instead hire lower-wage Indian visa-workers.\n\nThe use of cheaper Indian labor created payroll savings for Iconix and profits for Larson. In turn, those profits boosted the company\u2019s stock values for U.S. investors, including the Vanguard International Stock Index.\n\nBut those cost savings came from the pockets of American workers \u2014 and from the towns and cities where single Indians fill many of the jobs and communities once occupied by middle-class American families. For example, Indian workers in the United States sent almost $12 billion back to India in 2015. Those remittances, however, are small compared to the vast shift of wealth from U.S. college graduates to stock-market investors and coastal landowners.\n\nFederal data reveals how the H-1B program sucks billions of payroll $$$ from heartland states and cities, & sends it to Wall St investors. Eg, Kentucky loses $100M to $400M per year in payroll. GOP Senate votes today on @S386 to increase the payroll loss. https://t.co/8IJMQWcjqP \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 19, 2019\n\nThis Iconix/Larson example is just one tiny corner of the vast U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, which has received minimal coverage in the U.S. media, despite its huge impact on college-graduate Americans.\n\nMany former visa-workers have become citizens \u2014 and they also sharpen foreign competition for U.S. jobs, amid growing evidence that Indian managers and recruiters actively discriminate in favor of other Indians when hiring people for jobs in the United States.\n\nThis outsourcing economy has helped to deny jobs to millions of American graduates and to cut salaries earned by American graduates, both young and old. That pressure helps to explain why wages for blue-collar jobs are now rising faster than salaries for white-collar jobs.\n\nBut this U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy has grown so much that it has clogged the U.S. immigration system.\n\nThe clog is forcing many of the contract-workers to wait more than a decade to get their green-cards they were promised by employers in exchange for taking Americans\u2019 jobs.\n\nThat long wait helps the companies by keeping their many contract-workers stuck in their jobs, tied to their employers \u2014 often at substandard wages.\n\nBut the long wait also makes it difficult for outsourcing companies to recruit more Indian workers. After all, fewer Indians will sign up for the outsourcing industry if the companies cannot deliver the fast-track green cards.\n\nGreat talking to all the supporters of S. 386 today, the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act. It\u2019s far past time to end country based discrimination in our nations immigration policy. pic.twitter.com/nn5LdpJON8 \u2014 Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) October 17, 2019\n\nThat green-card clog is also a huge problem for India\u2019s government because its entire economic strategy is built around the export of workers into foreign economies.\n\nIndia\u2019s government is pushing for passage of Lee\u2019s bill. \u201cI must compliment the U.S. House of Representatives for adopting the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants bill which removes country caps on the H1B visas,\u201d Indian ambassador Harsh Shringla told a July meeting of lobbyists and advocates in Washington D.C. \u201cWe have worked with congressmen across the board, and we\u2019re happy this is a bipartisan initiative in Congress, and we\u2019re hopeful the Senate would follow course and also adopt the bill.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s economic strategy seeks to grow the economy by exporting many workers. In February 2019, the Forsyth County News reported:\n\nAni Agnihotri, program chair of the USA-India Business Summit \u2026 said India has a massive and young population that could provide skilled, English-speaking workers ready to relocate \u201ceven at a seven-day notice\u201d and said the majority of doctors in the United Kingdom and about 15 percent in America are of Indian descent. \u201cIndia has the youngest population in the world. About 25 percent of the population of India, which is 1.25 billion, is below the age of 25,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be the provider of the workforce of the world in about 15 years, after 2035.\u201d\n\nThe clog is also a huge problem for U.S. investors who need additional cheap Indian workers to meet the stock market\u2019s demand for economic growth and continued gains. For example, business groups want to recruit more Indians to fill Americans\u2019 jobs in hospitals and healthcare centers around the nation.\n\nMany high-tech companies and investors also want India\u2019s government to help them get into Indian\u2019s growing marketplace, especially as the trade war with China heats up.\n\nSo Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, and many others are working with Lee to unclog the outsourcing and recruiting process by removing the \u201ccountry caps\u201d which delay the award of green card to Indian visa-workers.\n\nThe demand by investors for endless migrant labor has created a new thing: The US-India Outsourcing Economy. This no-regulation zone redirects new wealth into a few cities & a small elite. Elites want to expand it, so US college-grads get #HR1044. https://t.co/4lWHtI3sUk \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) July 19, 2019\n\nThe pipeline of Indian workers into the United States is built on the H-1B program.\n\nThe H-1B program is uncapped for non-profit employers, but companies can get 85,000 new H-1B workers into the United States per year. Each H-1B worker must go home after six years, so capping the companies\u2019 workforce of H-1B workers at around roughly 480,000 workers.\n\nThat workforce provides companies with roughly equal to one Indian worker for every nine Americans who graduate with skilled degrees each year.\n\nBut that resident H-1B workforce is just a start.\n\nIn 1990, Congress decided to let workers in the H-1B program \u2014 and in the smaller, lesser-known L-1 program \u2013 to apply for green cards.\n\nThis 1990 decision created the huge citizenship prize which is pulling many Indians into the H-1B program \u2014 and ensures they will brave low wages, tough conditions, and often illegal working conditions to win the prize.\n\nFew Americans appreciate the huge value of green cards and citizenship.\n\nFor many people around the world, getting a green card is better than winning a massive lottery: It allows them to escape the poverty and culture of their home country, to vault themselves into the world as American citizens, to bring their spouses, children, parents, and relatives \u2014 plus all of their descendants \u2014 into a modern society protected the U.S. constitution, culture, military and equal treatment under the law. It is the closest thing to Earthly heaven for many people unlucky enough to be born in India, Africa, or Asia.\n\nYet Congress allows U.S and Indian investors to freely trade this citizenship prize to 10,000 Indian graduates every year in exchange for a decade or more of profitable work.\n\nOf course, millions of foreigners will accept that giveaway deal \u2014 and millions of foreigners feel a moral duty to shove Americans out of their jobs, homes, and careers win so they can grab the fantastic prize for their spouses, children, and grandchildren.\n\nLee\u2019s bill will allow companies to make that barter with roughly 60,000 Indian graduates per year, up from 10,000 per year under current \u201ccountry cap\u201d rules.\n\nCongress also allowed companies to keep their H-1B workers in the United States long after the six-year term is up if the companies nominate the workers for green cards.\n\nMany companies have grabbed this freebie from Congress, and now about 300,000 Indian H-1Bs are still working in the United States, long after passing the six-year limit on their H-1B visas.\n\nThis work-and-wait workforce is dubbed the \u201cEB workforce\u201d \u2014 and it bumps up the resident population of H-1B workers to roughly 800,000, most of whom are Indians.\n\nBut the federal government has quietly created many other programs which allow foreigners to easily take jobs in the United States, regardless of whether Americans want those jobs.\n\nFederal law allows an unlimited number of Indians to get jobs in the United States via the B1 visa for foreign workers, the TN program for businesses based in Canada and Mexico, as well as the uncapped \u201cOptional Practical Training\u201d and \u201cCurricular Practical Training\u201d work-permit programs for foreign students and graduates at U.S. colleges.\n\nGAO warns DHS to do more to prevent the smuggling of Indian and Chinese graduates into U.S. white-collar careers, such as software, healthcare, accounting, etc. Most smuggling takes place via the universities' 'OPT' work-permit giveaway to foreign grads. https://t.co/NSUIVQDO4m \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2019\n\nThe Indian government is encouraging U.S. companies to hire more Indians who get OPT work-permits. \u201cIndian students are an important part of the, let\u2019s say, [trade] engagement,\u201d Indian ambassador Harsh Shringla told the D.C. meeting of lobbyists and advocates in June.\n\nThere are over 200,000 Indian students studying in the United States \u2026 If you are able to use the expertise of some of these people, highly trained and educated in the United States, for short-term employment, I think you would have a very useful source of professionals to maintain the competitiveness of U.S. high-tech industries \u2026 at very, very, very competitive \u2026 rates.\n\nThe mass of OPT and CPT workers in the United States have their own sweatshop economy, where they crowd into shared housing while they work as temporary contract workers for the middlemen subcontractors which are quietly hired by brand-name Fortune 500 firms.\n\nThese middlemen companies are supposed to be the first step for most U.S. graduates into the technology sector \u2014 but the growing share of Indian managers and recruiters have a financial and ethnic incentive to hire Indians OPTs instead of American graduates.\n\nBut many Indian graduates do not want to join the OPT sweatshop economy \u2014 unless they can also get promoted into the L-1 or H-1B program to get green cards.\n\nSo if Lee unclogs the green-card pipeline, then more Indian graduates enter the feeder pipelines created by teh B-1, TN, OPT, and CPT programs so they can get green cards after being promoted into the L-1 and H-1B programs.\n\nCurrent data shows that roughly 800,000 Indians work in the United States \u2014 including many who are working-and-waiting for more than 15 years to get one of the 10,000 green cards issued to Indians each year.\n\nIf companies can offer 60,000 cards a year, then more Indians will rationally work-and-wait for those cards.\n\nU.S. companies will also use those extra Indians to move more jobs back to India.\n\nFor example, Walmart is boosting its stock value by outsourcing 569 finance and accounting jobs in North Carolina to cheaper H-1B workers from India. If the company saves $10,000 per employee, Walmart will save $5.7 million per year. On Wall Street, Walmart\u2019s price to earnings rate is 25 to one, so the $5.7 million in payroll savings will boost its stockholders\u2019 value by $142 million.\n\nWalmart picked an American company, Genpact, to supply the Indian workers. The company is a spin-off of General Electric, and it prospers by providing Indian H-1B workers to many companies in the United States. For example, the company asked for 271 H-1Bs in 2018, 410 H-1Bs in 2017, and 307 H-1Bs in 2016. In 2018, Genpact also got 160 L-1 visas, which allow Indian employees to work in the United States at Indian-level wages.\n\nGenpact\u2019s H-1Bs work on the U.S. side of the vast and growing U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, now worth roughly $78 billion per year. Part of the H-1Bs\u2019 job is to funnel additional work back into India. For example, Genpact may only need to use 100 H-1Bs and 20 L-1s in North Carolina to help steer the work of the 569 fired American finance experts back to large teams of low-wage Indian graduates in India.\n\nGenpact\u2019s $3.3 billion in revenue is enough to generate $7.5 billion in stock value for its investors, which include Bain Capital, Blackrock, and Charles Schwab Investment Management.\n\nWalmart is hoping to expand into India, and so it needs strong support from the Indian government as it competes with Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon for shares of India\u2019s colossal retail market.\n\nWalmart\u2019s ability to win the support of India\u2019s government is aided by its policy of employing thousands of Indian H-1B in Arkansas and other states. Those H-1B Indians are leased to Walmart by Indian \u201cbody shop\u201d companies, such as Cognizant, Tata Consulting, Infosys, HCL, or Larson & Toubro. Arkansas Sen.
