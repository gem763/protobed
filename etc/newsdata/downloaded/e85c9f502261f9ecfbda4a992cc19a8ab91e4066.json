To be sure, there has been good news with a \u201cPhase 1\u201d tentative trade deal with the U.S. and China, and maybe, just maybe, some Brexit agreement (although it ain\u2019t over until Parliament votes this weekend).\n\nBut there is a more positive monetary backdrop developing from lower short-term interest rates and a weaker dollar. And that would be bullish for most risk assets, including U.S. stocks, emerging market debt and equities, and commodities\u2014notably precious metals.\n\nRelated Data Market Data Center: Commodities & Futures\n\nThe federal-funds futures market is putting an 89.3% probability of the Federal Open Market Committee voting for a one-quarter percentage-point reduction in its key policy interest rate on Oct. 30, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch. While a number of economists have pushed back on the notion of another rate cut this month, and most Fed officials remain noncommittal, if not opposed, to further easing, the central bank has a long history of not disappointing market expectations. While the betting line can change by game time, the odds now favor a rate reduction at the next policy confab.\n\nShare Your Market Predictions Barron\u2019swants to know your thoughts on the market, the economy, and the political landscape.

(See this week\u2019s Economy column.) In actuality, the buying reverses the quantitative tightening, or QT, that occurred as the Fed reduced its assets, while on the other side of the balance sheet, liabilities, notably currency, increased, resulting in an even sharper shrinkage in bank reserves.\n\nQuantitative tightening was supposed to be like \u201cpaint drying,\u201d as former Fed Chair Janet Yellen described it, but resulted in the equivalent of 7.5 percentage points of tightening, nearly three times as much as the actual rate hikes, Julian Brigden, chief economist at MI2 Partners, has estimated. QT has kept the dollar stronger than fundamentals would have predicted, he writes in a client note.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nA weaker greenback would provide the missing \u201ccornerstone of a reflationary move,\u201d along with lower rates and higher equity prices. Global investors have been piling into U.S. growth stocks, taking advantage of strong currency and equity returns. As the dollar turns, Brigden looks for a rotation from growth to value stocks, which showed signs of starting in early September.\n\nA weaker dollar and negative interest rates also have boosted hedge funds\u2019 interest in gold, according to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The so-called barbarous relic, and exchange-traded funds that track it, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (ticker: GLD), have moved mostly sideways around the $1,500-an-ounce level since late August.\n\nBut the bank\u2019s strategists recommend a maximum bullish allocation to gold (5% in its portfolios) because the metal \u201cis increasingly seen as an alternative to cash.\u201d They\u2019re especially bullish on gold since they also expect further Fed rate cuts and a lower dollar. While the bank isn\u2019t advocating a return to a gold standard, it notes that central banks such as the People\u2019s Bank of China are diversifying into the metal.\n\nMore Up & Down Wall Street Wealth Taxes Don\u2019t Work. Here\u2019s Why.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire for a weaker dollar, which would be consistent with his barrage of tweets calling on the Fed to slash rates. An end to the tariff wars would further ease the upward pressure on the dollar. And that would benefit corporate earnings, as 40% of sales of S&P 500 companies originate abroad. So there\u2019s good reason to bet your bottom dollar that the greenback is close to a top.\n\nWrite to Randall W.
