He praised Mozambicans for deciding their destiny through elections and urged people to go to the polls peacefully.\n\nCarlos Alberto, a 22-year-old student waiting to vote at the same secondary school said he wanted to see parliament hold the executive to account and push through promised reforms in education, work, housing and other areas.\n\n\u201cWe vote and then nothing happens,\u201d Alberto said. \u201cWe need to make some changes.\u201d\n\nA corruption scandal over government borrowing has hit the economy and damaged Nyusi\u2019s popularity.\n\nA low-level Islamist insurgency in the north, on the doorstep of billion-dollar gas projects being developed by oil majors including Exxon and Total, has also taken the shine off Nyusi\u2019s presidency and threatens security longer term.\n\nFRAGILE TRUCE\n\nMost of Mozambique\u2019s 13 million registered voters were born after Frelimo came to power in 1975, when the country won independence from Portuguese colonial rule.\n\nRenamo fought Frelimo for 16 years from 1977 to 1992 in a Cold War conflict that killed about one million people. It ended in a truce but sporadic violence has flared in the years since - including after Renamo challenged election results in 2014.\n\nUnder the peace deal signed in August this year, provincial governors will now be picked by the main party in each province, rather than the government in Maputo - an opportunity for Renamo to gain long-thwarted representation.\n\nBut factionalism in Renamo and the fading popularity of its leader, Ossufo Momade, could yet make winning the number of provinces it would like a tall order.\n\nShould it come back empty handed, that could trigger further violence, Zenaida Machado, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, has said.\n\nThe run-up to the vote has already been marked by sporadic violence, including the killing of an election observer and attacks from a breakaway group of Renamo fighters.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nA crowd that welcomed Nyusi at his final campaign rally in Maputo on Saturday cheered when he promised peace would last.\n\n\u201cWithout peace, can we build factories ... can we build roads?\u201d Nyusi asked, to cries of \u201cNo\u201d from supporters decked in his party\u2019s signature red.\n\nPolls were due to close at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). The law allows 15 days for results to be announced, though they could come sooner.", "description": "Mozambicans voted on Tuesday in an election that could test a fragile two-month-old peace deal between the ruling Frelimo party and its old civil war foe turned opposition rival Renamo.", "authors": ["Emma Rumney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440980481&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E07A", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
