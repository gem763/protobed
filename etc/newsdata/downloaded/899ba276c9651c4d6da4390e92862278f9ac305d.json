He captioned the image on the left 'I fully intend living up to the name of my boat this week' and the image on the right 'my office for the next 10 days'\n\nEach summer, I take my three sons - Spencer, 26, Stanley, 22, and Bertie, 18 - on a lads\u2019 trip, either to a Caribbean beach or as on this occasion, something a little more adventurous.\n\nWe rented a 73ft motor yacht named, appropriately, \u2018Lazy P\u2019 from Dorset-based Sunseeker Charters, a superbly professional and efficient firm that can cater to any maritime whim.\n\nLazy P accommodates up to eight guests in four cabins, and sports its own tender, water-skis, wakeboard and snorkelling kit.\n\nWe had a two-person crew including Captain Ross, a very experienced Kiwi skipper, and a delightful young lady named Lucy, who acted as deckhand, cleaner and expert cook \u2013 preparing us a series of delicious breakfasts and lunches.\n\nLazy P sleeps eight guests in four cabins and can accommodate 10 people on day charters\n\nOur days were spent carousing the French Riviera, finding charming bays to anchor in, and our nights were spent berthed in ports and sampling the delights of French gastronomy in a series of fabulous restaurants.\n\n\u2018Where do you suggest for our first day?\u2019 I replied to Captain Ross.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go to the Cannes islands,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re pretty nice.\u2019\n\nSo we did, and they were.\n\n\u2018Where are we dining tonight?\u2019 I asked Captain Ross again, having left most of our meal bookings to him.\n\n\u2018I booked you into Le Mashou,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s pretty nice.\u2019\n\nHe was right, again.\n\nI quickly realised that \u2018pretty nice\u2019 is Kiwi for \u2018outstanding\u2019.\n\nLazy P comes with a variety of toys - water skis, mono-skis, wakeboard, donut and snorkelling gear\n\nSunseeker Charters says that Lazy P 'effortlessly blends luxury with practicality' and has a 'graceful profile'\n\nPiers and his sons in \u00c8ze-bord-de-Mer (left) and pictured right is a plate of snails and fine French wine served up one evening\n\nLe Maschou, a charming cave-like restaurant in the old part of Cannes, is famed for its set menus where your only choice is a main dish of chicken, beef or fish \u2013 and you then sit back and watch platefuls of gorgeous grub arrive at your table. It was one of the best meals I\u2019ve ever had, a fabulous start to our holiday.\n\nOur itinerary had structure, but was always flexible.\n\nWe visited Cannes, Monaco, Eze, Antibes, Villefranche, Beaulieu, and the little-known but lovely Porquerolles island, before spending the last two days in St Tropez where my wife Celia and seven-year-old daughter, Elise, were staying in a friend\u2019s villa.\n\nIt was a blissful trip; the sun shone ferociously (we went during the last 10 days of August), the waters seemed warmer than usual but cool enough to be constantly refreshing, and our days were spent swimming, sleeping, reading, arguing about Trump and Brexit (I assume everyone\u2019s family holiday now features these tribal, irreconcilable debates), and watching the unbelievably exciting Ashes Test match at Headingley where Ben Stokes played the greatest innings in history and our increasingly frenzied screams and groans could be heard in Italy.\n\nThe days were spent swimming, sleeping, reading and arguing about Trump and Brexit, writes Piers\n\nIt wasn't all relaxation, Piers reveals that he did do some exercise on the trip - lifting weights and arm wrestling with his son Stanley\n\nThe view in Antibes (left) and a view in Juan-les-Pins 'wrecked' (right), Piers says, by Roman Abramovich\u2019s 'monstrous' \u00a3350m superyacht Eclipse\n\nI did try to do some exercise too, even asking Captain Ross to source some weights to be brought onboard.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll never use them,\u2019 he chuckled.\n\nThis was the only thing he got wrong all trip.\n\nStanley\u2019s a fitness freak, and was determined to drag me into his ferocious daily on-board routine.\n\nPredictably, given how competitive we all are, it soon descended into an arm-wrestling contest that he comfortably won.\n\n\u2018I think I\u2019ll do some shadow boxing,\u2019 he sighed, \u2018might give me a tougher fight.\u2019\n\nGastronomic highlights included stunning dinners at Michelin-starred La Passag\u00e8re in Juan-les-Pins (have the tasting menu), the wondrously located Anjuna at \u00c8ze-bord-de-Mer where Bono has a home, and a riotous six-hour lunch with England cricket legend Allan Lamb and several billionaires at La Guerit\u00e9, a glitzy restaurant in the Cannes islands that can only be reached by boat and where Sir Elton John and the Beckhams had dined the day before.\n\nGastronomic highlights, writes Piers, 'included stunning dinners at Michelin-starred La Passag\u00e8re in Juan-les-Pins (have the tasting menu), the wondrously located Anjuna at \u00c8ze-bord-de-Mer where Bono has a home, and a riotous six-hour lunch with England cricket legend Allan Lamb'\n\nThe picture on the left was taken by Piers at Beaulieu-sur-Mer. And the Instagram image on the right was captioned 'today\u2019s gruelling breakfast spot'\n\nThe next morning, when I stumbled upstairs for morning coffee feeling like a two-ton truck had run me over, Lucy was waiting with a glass of water and some pills.\n\n\u2018Nurofen?\u2019 she laughed.\n\nNow THAT is service.\n\nPart of the magic of the South of France is the sense of glitz, glamour and showbiz that pervades the whole region.\n\nAt Michaelangelo, a starry Italian nightspot in Antibes, we were treated like kings after the legendary owner Mamo rushed over to greet me, said how much he liked my TV shows, and sent us over some delicious extra complimentary dishes including a truffle pizza that was insanely good.\n\nHis only request was that I have my picture taken with him, at which point he then showed me his other celebrity pictures, scattered all over the walls.\n\nLazy P comes with a crew of two - a very experienced Kiwi captain and, writes Piers, Lucy, 'who acted as deckhand, cleaner and expert cook, preparing us a series of delicious breakfasts and lunches'\n\nSt Tropez was one port of call (left) and Monaco (right) was another. When in St Tropez, Piers highly recommends eating at Le Club 55\n\nLAZY P SPECS Specification Year built - 2009 Cruising speed - 22 knots Max speed - 30 knots Tenders and toys zodiac jet tender water skis mono-skis wakeboard donut snorkelling gear Accommodation Sleeps eight guests in four cabins Master stateroom Double guest cabin Double/twin convertible cabin Bunk bed guest cabin Two crew Max 10 guests for day charter\n\nIt was incredible \u2013 he was with everyone from first man on the moon Neil Armstrong and President Obama to Beyonc\u00e9, Jack Nicholson, Brad Pitt and Robert De Niro.\n\nThen above a door, I spied a rogues\u2019 gallery of Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, OJ Simpson and Kevin Spacey.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s my wall of shame,\u2019 he chuckled.\n\n\u2018I hope that\u2019s not where I\u2019m going?\u2019 I laughed, nervously.\n\n\u2018Not yet, Piers!\u2019 he roared.\n\nThe highlight of my regular trips to St Tropez, my favourite part of the Riviera, is always a long lunch at Le Club 55, the impossibly cool restaurant immortalised by Brigitte Bardot.\n\nWe parked Lazy P a few hundred yards off Pampelonne Beach, and the Club 55 tender picked us up and sped us in.\n\nMy fellow lunch guests included Dame Joan Collins and Lord Sugar, making me feel distinctly dishonoured.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not even an MBE?\u2019 asked Joan\u2019s husband Percy, incredulously.\n\n\u2018Honours are only given to upstanding and beloved members of society,\u2019 scoffed Sugar. Which does prompt the obvious question: why has he got one?\n\nWe dined on slabs of sumptuously fresh sea bass, and gallons of Minuty ros\u00e9, and had a wonderful time. It\u2019s where I\u2019d like to have my last ever meal.\n\nThe next day, Lord Sugar and his long-suffering wife Anne invited me onto their vast and undeniably beautiful gin palace Lady A, for a splendid lunch and some very competitive jet-ski racing with my children.\n\n\u2018How long have you been trapped on here with Alan this summer? I asked Anne.\n\n\u2018Three months,\u2019 she sighed.\n\nI finally found something to make me shudder about a boat trip.\n\nAfter ten days, I was ready to return to land.\n\nBut it had been a blissful trip.\n\nThe ultimate test of any holiday is would you do it all over again?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nVisit www.sunseekercharters.com for more information.", "description": "Piers rented the 73ft Lazy P from Dorset-based Sunseeker Charters and spent 10 days carousing the French Riviera, anchoring in charming bays and dining in very fine restaurants.", "authors": ["Piers Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/12/19953398-0-image-a-74_1571569602442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
