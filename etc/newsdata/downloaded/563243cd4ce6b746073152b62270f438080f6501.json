Now, trade tensions and slower global growth are depressing freight volumes. Freight rates have fallen more than 20% from a record in June 2018, says St. Louis-based research firm Broughton Capital LLC. Trucking companies, in turn, are ordering fewer trucks.\n\n\u201cThere are more trucks than there are loads now,\u201d said Kyle Kottke, general manager for Kottke Trucking Inc. in Buffalo Lake, Minn.\n\nProduction for heavy trucks is still brisk, as manufacturers work to fill orders placed over the past year, but new purchases are declining and production rates are dropping.\n\nOrders for heavy-duty models from the four largest truck makers in North America\u2014Daimler Trucks North America LLC, Paccar Inc., PCAR 0.28% Volvo Trucks USA and Navistar International Corp. \u2014fell 80% in July from a year earlier, says market forecaster ACT Research. Orders in June declined 69% from a year earlier.\n\nThe slowdown is rippling through to the companies\u2019 suppliers, contributing to a broader slowdown for U.S. manufacturers. Manufacturing production as a whole was down 1.6% this year through July, according to the Federal Reserve. Eaton Corp. , one of the largest makers of truck transmissions, recently warned of lower auto-related sales for the year, and cab builder Commercial Vehicle Group Inc. said order rates have been falling.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How would you manage truck traffic congestion on U.S. highways? Join the conversation below.\n\nInvestors in truck manufacturers have been anticipating a slumping truck market for months. Over the past 12 months, stock prices for Paccar and Navistar have declined more than the overall stock market.\n\nXL Specialized Trailers Inc., which assembles flatbed trailers for hauling big loads such as construction equipment, has experienced a drop in orders over the past 90 days, said Stuart Sleper, president of the Manchester, Iowa-based company.\n\n\u201cWe are planning for a 2020 that is not going to be as good,\u201d he said.\n\nBig swings in production are typical in the truck industry. Like farmers, truckers tend to aggressively buy equipment when they are flush with cash but quit buying when their incomes drop.\n\nACT Research estimated that trucking companies have added about 6% more capacity to their fleets, or 90,000 heavy-duty trucks, than what was actually needed to handle the freight volumes over the past two years. Production of heavy-duty models is expected to reach about 350,000 vehicles this year, the second-highest level since 2006.\n\nBut a reversal is predicted. ACT Research expects production of heavy-duty trucks to fall to about 238,000 vehicles next year, a rate more typical of years when trucking companies are only replacing worn-out vehicles in their fleets.\n\n\u201cIt would not take much of a weaker [gross domestic product] to send the truck industry down more,\u201d said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at transportation-equipment research group FTR.\n\nA worker painted a truck chassis at a Mack Trucks assembly plant in Macungie, Pa., last year. Manufacturing production as a whole was down 1.6% this year through July, the Federal Reserve said.

He expects other truck builders to follow suit and predicted production will be down by 20% in the fourth quarter from the current level.\n\nSome of the trucking industry\u2019s biggest customers, including the steel industry, automotive suppliers and farmers, are scaling back too.\n\n\u201cEverybody is fighting over the same pool of freight,\u201d said Robert Haag, vice president of operations for Indianapolis-based Perfect Transportation LLC.\n\nOrder cancellations are also rising. Dave de Poincy, president of East Manufacturing Corp., said the truck-trailer maker\u2019s cancellation rate is nearly 8%, compared with a typical rate of below 1%. He expects production to fall 20% in the company\u2019s fiscal year ending in May.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need any more trailers right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flatbed industry is a real indicator of economic health.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm exports have reduced shipments of meat from the Midwest to the West Coast, said Dave Wozniak Jr., vice president of M.C. VanKampen Trucking Inc., a Grand Rapids, Mich.-based specialist at hauling office furniture and perishable cargo.\n\nVanKampen has cut its fleet by 10 trucks, to 140 this year, and Mr. Wozniak said freight demand will likely fall further if President Trump follows through on plans to apply new tariffs to Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cThe market is weak,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com and Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com", "description": "Daimler Trucks North America, Paccar, Volvo Trucks USA and Navistar International are logging sharply lower orders, as trade tensions and slower global growth depress freight volumes.", "authors": ["Bob Tita", "Austen Hufford", "Robert.Tita Wsj.Com", "Austen.Hufford Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-100346/social"}
