Congress, however, much prefers to lay low in the tall grass, wait for presidents to act, and then complain when things go awry.\n\nAnd so they have: The easily foreseeable conflict between Turkey and the Kurds is at hand. We are supposed to see the problem as Trump\u2019s abandoning of U.S. commitments. But why did we make commitments to the Kurds that undermined preexisting commitments to Turkey? The debate is strictly framed as \u201cHow can we leave the Kurds to the tender mercies of the Turks?\u201d No one is supposed to ask \u201cWhat did we expect would happen when we backed a militant organization that is tightly linked to U.S.-designated terrorists and that is the bitter enemy of a NATO ally we knew would not abide its presence on the ally\u2019s border?\u201d No one is supposed to ask \u201cWhat is the end game here? Are we endorsing the partition of Syria? Did we see a Kurdish autonomous zone as the next Kosovo?\u201d (We might remember that recognition of Kosovo\u2019s split from Serbia, over Russian objections, was exploited by the Kremlin as a rationale for promoting separatism and annexations in Georgia and Ukraine.)\n\nIt is true, as the editors observe, that \u201cthere are no easy answers in Syria.\u201d That is no excuse for offering an answer that makes no sense: \u201cThe United States should have an exit strategy, but one that neither squanders our tactical gains against ISIS nor exposes our allies to unacceptable retribution.\u201d Put aside that our arming of the Kurds has already exposed our allies in Turkey to unacceptable risk. What the editorial poses is not an \u201cexit strategy\u201d but its opposite. In effect, it would keep U.S. forces in Syria interminably, permanently interposed between the Kurds and the Turks. The untidy questions of how that would be justifiable legally or politically go unaddressed.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Mccarthy", "Nationalreview.Com Turkey-And-The-Kurds-Its-More-Complicated-Than-You-Think"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
