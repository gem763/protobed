In a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, Michael called his decision to leave \u201ceasy-peasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just made sense to have a partnership like this one, where I get to have the potential of having, you know, platform-level input, as well as the backing of one of the biggest names in gaming,\u201d Michael said. And he\u2019s a big name himself: before his departure from Twitch, the Destiny streamer had amassed just over a million followers on the platform. (At the time of this writing, Michael\u2019s channel had just over 32,000 followers on Mixer.)\n\nMichael joins Michael \u201cShroud\u201d Grzesiek and Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins as the third popular streamer to leave Twitch for Mixer. Blevins and Grzesiek both have exclusive deals with the platform, and Michael probably does, too. (At press time, Microsoft hadn\u2019t returned a request for comment about whether Michael had an official deal.) And it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see other big names depart one platform for the other. People are underestimating Mixer \u2014 and the data shows the live-streaming platform\u2019s plan is working.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Microsoft\u2019s streaming platform doesn\u2019t have anywhere close to the audience numbers Twitch does, the platform has recently been experiencing hockey stick-like growth. Citing various analyst data, The Motley Fool reported earlier this month that Mixer more than doubled its number of hours watched annually to 90.2 million (vs. Twitch\u2019s 11 percent increase to 2.55 billion), and its number of hours streamed just about tripled \u2014 Twitch\u2019s, on the other hand, only rose 4 percent.\n\nWhat this all suggests is that Mixer is becoming a much more attractive proposition for streamers. As Michael pointed out in his video, he\u2019s going to listen to his viewers\u2019 ideas for ways to make the service better for streamers and their audiences. Everything that goes into streamer deals \u2014 money spent on exclusive contracts, etc. \u2014 means it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Michael has Microsoft\u2019s ear, and that they\u2019ll listen to and accommodate his needs. In short, Microsoft knows that it needs to talk to the pros and take their advice for how to better their service.\n\nMicrosoft knows that it needs to listen to the pros\n\nBecause if Mixer manages to become a streamer-led platform, one that offers the kind of flexibility and institutional support many streamers want, it will explode in popularity among the people it relies on for content. That means more eyeballs, more growth, and more revenue. While Microsoft hasn\u2019t disclosed how much Mixer accounts for in its gaming budgets, the games division, which is mostly Xbox, brought in a healthy $11.4 billion last year \u2014 a full 9 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nTwitch is where the streaming audience is, at least for now. But the technical differences between going live on Twitch and going live on Mixer are negligible; and for streamers with communities large enough that they don\u2019t necessarily need new fans, starting over on a new platform with their most dedicated \u2014 and biggest spending \u2014 audience might begin sounding like an attractive proposition.\n\nAt a certain level of live-streaming fame, audiences are tuning in more for the broadcaster than for whatever that broadcaster is doing on camera. It\u2019s a bit like having a favorite TV channel: even if you don\u2019t like everything HBO is programming, you trust them to produce shows you\u2019ll love.\n\nAdd all of that to the millions Microsoft is spending to lock down exclusive rights and the answer, for many bigger streamers, becomes obvious. Or as Michael might say: easy-peasy.", "description": "Michael joins Michael \"Shroud\" Grzesiek and Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins as the third popular streamer to leave Twitch for Mixer.
