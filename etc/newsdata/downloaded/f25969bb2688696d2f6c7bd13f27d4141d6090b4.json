That\u2019s despite violent protests that have rocked the former British colony now since June.\n\nSeparately, Sing Tao reported that China Evergrande Group\u2019s Emerald Bay project in Tuen Mun received 1,100 applications, more than double the number of apartments available.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to allow first-time buyers to purchase more expensive homes with a downpayment of just 10% has boosted transactions, said Louis Chan, the CEO of Centaline\u2019s residential division. \u201cBuyers who have been adopting a wait-and-see attitude are worried that if they don\u2019t buy now, homes will get pricier. So they speed up their purchases,\u201d he said.\n\nSecondary home transaction volumes have dropped since demonstrations against the now-withdrawn extradition bill began, while prices have slipped about 5%, data from Centaline show.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s decision to relax the loan-to-value ratio may help first-time buyers and upgraders who were previously only able to buy new flats because developers could offer financial benefits,\u201d Joseph Tsang, chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. for Hong Kong, said. \u201cWith this change, buyers will shift to the secondary market, which offers plenty of potential stock and lower property prices.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong Sees Best Weekend for Home Sales Since April", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf1b862394c70b20bdc90c744bb734039.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
