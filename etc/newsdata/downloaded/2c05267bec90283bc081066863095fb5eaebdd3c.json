That standoff was part of China\u2019s retaliation against tariffs President Trump had imposed on numerous Chinese products.\n\nChina now will \u201csupport domestic companies in the purchase of soybeans and pork from the U.S.,\u201d Chinese state media outlets reported Friday, citing an unnamed official.\n\n\u201cWe seem to be back in the ballgame of doing business with the Chinese,\u201d said Jim Sutter, chief executive of the U.S. Soybean Export Council in Chesterfield, Mo.\n\nThe soybean move capped three days of unexpected improvement in a U.S.-China relationship that had run aground. On Wednesday, China eased tariffs on 16 U.S. products, including alfalfa and lubricant oils. Trump responded by delaying planned U.S. tariff increases on $250 billion of Chinese goods by two weeks, to Oct. 15, to avoid conflicting with the Beijing\u2019s plans to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Chinese revolution on Oct. 1.\n\n[Trump delays increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks \u2018as a gesture of good will\u2019]\n\nWith the two governments deeply suspicious of each other after more than a year of fruitless jousting, there is little prospect soon for the sprawling agreement that Trump once billed as \u201cthe granddaddy of them all.\u201d\n\nInstead, the recent flurry of reciprocal moves suggested that the two sides might try to escape their deepening conflict by agreeing first on a partial deal while continuing talks aimed at a comprehensive settlement.\n\nJames Green, who until last year managed trade issues for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said Chinese officials believe a partial accord would boost Xi\u2019s image domestically for managing the difficult U.S. relationship and make China look like a responsible actor on the global stage.\n\n\u201cI think the Chinese side wisely decided that some partial agreement would serve their interests,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some analysts have suggested that Trump may feel pressure to seek a partial deal amid complaints that the trade war is hurting the economy, that is not how China hawks in the White House see it.\n\nRecent economic data, including Friday\u2019s retail sales figures, have been strong, and the stock market has recovered. The administration feels it is close to securing congressional action on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal and is closing in on other deals with Japan and India.\n\n\u201cAn interim deal would be opposed by some in the Trump administration who would see it as giving up leverage, but it would be welcomed by the business community,\u201d said John Frisbie, managing director of the consultancy Hills & Co. \u201cA full deal might be too big a task right now, given the level of distrust between the two sides.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump and his senior officials have made inconsistent statements on prospects for an interim deal involving a rollback of tariffs in return for accelerated Chinese purchases of American products and commitments to strengthen intellectual-property safeguards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather get the whole deal done,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday before flying to Baltimore. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken in many, many billions of dollars of tariffs. I\u2019d rather get the entire Chinese done \u2014 look, if we\u2019re going to do the deal, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people are talking about it,\u201d the president said, \u201cand I see a lot of analysts are saying an interim deal, meaning we\u2019ll do pieces of it \u2014 the easy ones first. But there\u2019s no easy or hard. There\u2019s a deal or there\u2019s not a deal. But it\u2019s something we would consider, I guess.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators by early May had agreed on 90 percent of a trade deal that stretched beyond 150 pages, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But Chinese President Xi Jinping balked at enshrining key provisions in the country\u2019s legal code, leading to the talks\u2019 collapse, according to U.S. officials.\n\nSince then, relations have deteriorated as Trump lashed out with additional tariffs and barred Huawei, one of China\u2019s most prominent global firms, from purchasing American computer chips, and China retaliated.\n\nThe Chinese and American presidents agreed in Osaka, Japan, to revive the talks at the end of June. But despite a trip to Shanghai by Mnuchin and Robert E. Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade negotiator, the two sides remain far apart.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of progress, Trump last month announced further tariff increases that would apply by mid-December to nearly every product the United States imports from China.\n\n\u201cInvestors have been pummeled by the Trump administration trade moves so much they have gotten whiplash,\u201d Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong, said via email. \u201cHowever, there is a growing consensus that Trump needs a deal in order to help the economy before the election in 2020. . . . He will probably agree to concessions on China market access and purchase of U.S. goods and call it a win. China would be happy to get the trade war behind them and focus on their real problem \u2014 the slowing economy.\u201d\n\nWorking-level discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled for next week in Washington. Assuming they go well, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to meet with Lighthizer and Mnuchin in Washington during the first half of October.\n\nJames Zimmerman, the former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, called the latest Chinese move \u201ca gesture, but not an incredibly significant one . . . an unsteady truce before the October round of negotiations.\u201d\n\nChina has long offered to buy soybeans from farmers, part of Trump\u2019s voter base, to appease the president and narrow the trade deficit, a measurement Trump cites frequently. The exclusion on pork tariffs will also help ease pork prices in China at a time when the country is suffering a major shortage of its most popular meat and seen prices skyrocket 50 percent in just two months as a result of an outbreak of African swine fever.\n\nThe agricultural purchases, however, do not necessarily reflect a sweeping turnaround in U.S.-China relations. The Chinese government has authorized a handful of companies to resume U.S. soybean purchases, according to Sutter, the export council head. Up to 1 million metric tons of soybeans has been ordered via the ports of Seattle and Tacoma for shipment to China in October, he said.\n\nAnalysts say it is still unclear whether China would agree to thornier U.S. demands involving structural changes to its state-directed economic model.\n\n\u201cGiven the broad range of difficult economic and security issues in U.S.-China relations, a comprehensive deal was never in the cards,\u201d said Andrew Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia in San Francisco. \u201cA partial deal that both sides live up to could be a road map for a more complete trade agreement.\u201d\n\nShih reported from Beijing.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The move is seen as a conciliatory gesture toward the United States days after President Trump delayed tariff increases of his own.", "authors": ["David J.
