Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, rock. Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, rock. Elton John and Queen Elizabeth once rocked around the clock!\n\n\n\nIn his new autobiography, Me, Elton John wrote about a very memorable moment with the queen when he was invited to play at and attend Prince Andrew's 21st birthday.\n\n\n\nThe Rocketman singer danced with his close friend, Diana Spencer, in the ballroom, before Princess Anne asked if they wanted to move over to the \"disco\".\n\n\n\nLet's not get too excited though \u2013 it was a very quiet disco, but out of respect for the queen, according to Harper's BAZAAR.\n\n\n\nIn his book, he writes, \"Princess Anne asked me to dance with her to Hound Dog by Elvis Presley. Well, I say 'dance' \u2013 I ended up just awkwardly shuffling from foot to foot, trying to make as little noise as I could so that I didn't drown out the music.\"\n\n\n\nThen, Elton recalled earlier on The Graham Norton Show, \"The queen came in and said, 'Can we join you?' and what am I going to say? 'No, fuck off?'\"\n\n\n\nThe song shifted into Rock Around The Clock \u2013 and the rest, as they say, was history.\n\n\n\n\"So now I was trying to dance as inaudibly as possible with Princess Anne and the Queen \u2013 still holding her handbag \u2013 while what appeared to be the world's quietest disco played [by] Bill Haley.\"", "description": "\"I tried my best to come up with a facial expression that suggested this was a perfectly normal state of affairs.\" \u2013 Sir Elton John recalls that time he danced with none of than Queen Elizabeth.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9387/efd62018f2df40cba2dd532ad2688511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
