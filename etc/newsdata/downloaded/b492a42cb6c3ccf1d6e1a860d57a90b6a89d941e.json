Of course this should not be up for public discussion in the first place, given that Eilish is a minor, but it has been. Eilish discusses in the interview how a photograph taken of her in a tank top after a performance in Nashville this June went viral on social media. \u201cMy boobs were trending on Twitter!\u201d Eilish told Elle. \u201cAt number one! What is that?! Every outlet wrote about my boobs!\u201d She continued. \u201cIt makes me mad. I have to wear a big shirt for you not to feel uncomfortable about my boobs!\u201d\n\nThis is a sobering reminder that whether or not young pop stars dance in schoolgirl outfits and swing naked on wrecking balls or wear a paper bag to work, they\u2019ll be objectified. Eilish riffed on this impossible choice in the interview, saying, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a woman. I wanna show my body. What if I wanna make a video where I wanna look desirable?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with tank tops but there\u2019s a lot wrong with people, and Eilish knows it. She told Elle:\n\n\u201cI was recently FaceTiming a close friend of mine who\u2019s a dude, and I was wearing a tank top. He was like, \u2018Ugh, put a shirt on!\u2019 And I said, \u2018I have a shirt on.\u2019 Someone with smaller boobs could wear a tank top, and I could put on that exact tank top and get slut-shamed because my boobs are big. That is stupid. It\u2019s the same shirt!\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t agree more that we live in a very stupid world!", "description": "Billie Eilish addressed inappropriate remarks about her body saying, \u201cIt makes me mad.
