The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM worldwide and that every year three million girls are at risk of being cut.\n\nThe practice not only can cause long term physical and mental damage but can also, in some cases, lead to death. Last year a man from Somalia defended female genital mutilation, even after his daughter died during the procedure from loss of blood.\n\nMulticultural Birmingham Has Highest Female Genital Mutilation Rate in UK https://t.co/3E7ERyBdlS \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 30, 2019\n\nInstances of female genital mutilation have been recorded in 30 countries; the majority of cases take place in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nBut the numbers of girls and women cut in Europe, Australia, and North America has started to rise, due in large part to growing migration from countries in which FGM is practised.\n\nEarlier this year in the United Kingdom, a woman from Uganda became the first person to be convicted of FGM. She was sentenced to an 11 year term for allowing the cutting of her three-year-old daughter\u2019s genitals, leaving the girl with permanent physical and likely psychological damage.\n\nThe practice has also been illegal in Ireland since 2012, but as of yet no one has been convicted.\n\nFGM Trial: African Couple Cast Black Magic Spells on Police, Doctors, Court Hears https://t.co/BxXtnflYL1 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 17, 2019\n\nOne of the main issues in ridding the Ireland of FGM is that mothers are often pressured by relatives to return to their country of origin to have their daughter cut.\n\nSalome Mbugua, Head of Operations and Strategy at Akidwa, told The Journal that: \u201cWhat we are hearing now from women is that they believe [FGM] is a harmful practice and they wouldn\u2019t want it to happen to their children, but there is still a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being pressurised from where they\u2019re coming from, being told they shouldn\u2019t wait long [to have FGM carried out on their daughter],\u201d added Ms Mbugua.\n\nMothers told the conference that they feared to return to their home countries, out of worry that their daughters would be cut without their consent.\n\nSenator Bacik has introduced legislation that would not only criminalise FGM in Ireland but criminalise parents who bring their daughter to their country of origin to be cut.\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation: Five Lessons U.S. Lawmakers Can Learn from Europe https://t.co/gNL9DEd0w3 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 22, 2018", "description": "6,000 women and girls in Ireland have had their genitals mutilated, experts warn that another 3,000 girls are at risk of FGM.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/FGM-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
