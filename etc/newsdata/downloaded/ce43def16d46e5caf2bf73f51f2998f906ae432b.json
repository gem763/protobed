The provision exempts large employers only if they can show they would suffer \u201cunjustifiable financial hardship\u201d without the rule.\n\nThe academics\u2019 submission \u2013 coordinated by Liam Elphick and Alice Taylor and signed by Professors Beth Gaze, Simon Rice and Margaret Thornton \u2013 noted the effect of the section is that religious speech \u201cwould have greater protection from employer intervention than any other statement or expression\u201d.\n\nWhat is the religious discrimination bill and what will it do? Read more\n\nFor example, an employer with a code of conduct banning employees from publicly engaging in controversial political debates would not be able to impose the rule on a religious employee who wanted to oppose marriage equality. A gay employee, however, would be restricted from publicly supporting it.\n\n\u201cThere are also workability issues in how an employer can factually prove that a conduct rule is \u2018necessary\u2019 to avoid unjustifiable financial hardship, considering the very high standard required to prove necessity,\u201d the academics said.\n\nThe academics warned the clause exempting religious speech from federal, state and territory discrimination protections would create an \u201cunworkable situation for businesses in regard to employment\u201d.\n\n\u201cWork health and safety laws impose a positive duty on employers to prevent bullying, and discrimination laws require businesses to provide their services free from discrimination, yet [the exemption] would authorise bullying and discrimination,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe Diversity Council\u2019s chief executive, Lisa Annese, said the bill \u201cwould impair organisational efforts to implement diversity and inclusion policies\u201d and would confuse businesses.\n\nAnnese said religious people should be protected against discrimination because of their faith. \u201cBut at the same time, we know that using that faith as a reason, genuinely held or not, to discriminate against others isn\u2019t good for inclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nAnnese suggested the bill would create \u201cabsurd situations\u201d where homophobic comments are protected when made by an employee of a religious background but not when made by a non-religious employee. \u201cThe only people who win in this scenario are the lawyers.\u201d\n\nThe Uniting Church LGBTIQ+ Network also complained about the ban on employer conduct rules, warning it would have \u201csignificant unintended consequences\u201d.\n\nIt said employees would be licensed to tell a single mother that they are \u201cinappropriate parents\u201d or to tell a LGBTIQ employee \u201cthey are praying for them every day that they will be made whole as a straight person\u201d.\n\nThe network recommended the ban be scrapped or replaced with a more balanced provision recognising \u201cemployees who have gained a higher profile due to their employment do have a higher level of responsibility to their employers\u201d.\n\nThe religious discrimination bill has been panned by the Australian Human Rights Commission and civil society groups including the Equality Campaign and Public Interest Advocacy Centre, who warn it provides greater protection for religion than other protected attributes, overrides other discrimination laws and allows medical practitioners to refuse treatment.\n\nEven the conservative Sydney Anglican diocese has opposed the law in its current form, warning it would force Anglican youth camps to host Satanist masses at its campsites and has the \u201cperverse effect\u201d of encouraging companies such as Qantas to threaten to withdraw sponsorship to justify restrictions on religious speech in cases like Rugby Australia\u2019s sacking of Israel Folau.\n\nAs the outrage around Israel Folau peaks, let\u2019s turn the volume down a notch | Peter Lewis Read more\n\nOn Wednesday a group of about 150 Muslim organisations called for a higher protection against vilification on the grounds of religion in the bill.\n\nThe groups argued Muslim Australians do not have the same level of protection as ethnic communities, which are protected from conduct that \u201coffends, insults, humiliates or intimidates\u201d based on race under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.\n\nLiberal senator Amanda Stoker poured cold water on the call for a similar protection for religions, telling Sky News \u201cyou don\u2019t want to stray into something that could end up becoming a de facto blasphemy law\u201d.\n\nStoker said religious people should be protected from violence but not \u201cfair game criticism of religious beliefs\u201d.", "description": "Employers may be unable to fulfil their legal duty to prevent workplace bullying under religious freedom law, say academics", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d10bd4e3ebfd433ec04444ae50a9b47bdf05afe/93_274_4711_2826/master/4711.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48968cea99ed2ae8f0567dfc8cefa2a6", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
