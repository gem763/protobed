He said the cost of maintaining a traditional meter would increase as the rollout progressed because it would be more expensive for suppliers to do manual readings.\n\nConsumers have been warned they face additional costs in using traditional meters and refusing to swap over to smart technology. The government has warned that costs of reading traditional meters will increase dramatically leading to higher energy bills\n\nHe added: \u2018Once you get to the point of moving down from 15 per cent to 10 per cent to 9 per cent and so forth, the expense of maintaining these relic meters will be very high.\u2019\n\nAnd he warned energy suppliers who failed to reach their rollout targets would feel \u2018the full force of the law\u2019, adding: \u2018There will be an awful lot of climate protesters glued to the side of their building if they are literally failing to... help with climate change.\u2019\n\nLast month, the Government revealed suppliers would have an extra four years to install a smart meter in every UK household. It also admitted only half of households would have one by the original 2020 target and that the estimated rollout cost had soared by \u00a32.5billion to \u00a313.5billion.\n\nSo far about 16.6million smart meters have been installed across the UK \u2013 although the speed of growth has slowed. Older smart meters \u2013 known as Smets1 \u2013 \u2018go dumb\u2019 or stop working when households switch suppliers.\n\nYesterday, MPs criticised gas and electricity industry regulator Ofgem for continuing to install the older models. Tory MP Stephen Kerr said it was \u2018a waste of money\u2019 as there was a \u2018high possibility\u2019 these meters would soon have to be replaced. He also slammed the \u2018constant technical issues\u2019 of the rollout.\n\nAbout 14million Smets1 models have been installed, with 4,500 transferred to the Government-backed DCC network so that they can continue to work when customers change suppliers.\n\nMary Starks, of Ofgem, said older models would be installed only under exceptional circumstances, for example if a property was unable to connect to new models.", "description": "The Government wants 85 per cent of homes to have a smart meter to monitor power usage by 2024 - but the rollout has been plagued by delays.", "authors": ["Miles Dilworth For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20399160-0-image-a-49_1572474063913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
