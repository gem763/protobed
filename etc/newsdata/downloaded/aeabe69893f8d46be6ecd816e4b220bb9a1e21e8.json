Hundreds agree that it is \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cperfect,\u201d with one saying \u201cit\u2019s so soft, doesn\u2019t tangle much, and so far, doesn\u2019t shed. I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments.\u201d Another notes that \u201cthe bangs aren\u2019t too thick or thin, they\u2019re just right. The rest of the hair has just the right amount of waviness, AND the part isn\u2019t too fake either.\u201d Customers also love how realistic it looks, like this one who says that \u201cthe wig itself is very thick, so you can\u2019t really see the cap or tell it\u2019s a wig. It looks very natural.\u201d Another agrees: \u201cI go out with this and no one notices it\u2019s a wig.\u201d It also works well for costumes: \u201cBought for a costume but is very life-like,\u201d says one reviewer. Another says they \u201cordered this wig for a Halloween costume,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s so amazing that I\u2019m considering wearing it every day.\u201d It looks great right out of the box, too: \u201cEven without styling, I just tried it on and it looks fantastic in photos,\u201d attests a happy customer. Shoppers also rave about the value of the wig, saying \u201cfor the price, it was beyond my expectations,\u201d and \u201cjust WOW, I have bought $100-200 wigs before and by far this wig is so much better than the expensive ones. It\u2019s so natural-looking, so easy to work with, and is very long lasting.\u201d This reviewer sums the praise up: \u201cThis is easily my favorite wig. It\u2019s comfortable, realistic, and super cute. I\u2019ve had people tell me my hair\u2019s grown so long since they last saw me, not having a clue it\u2019s just a wig! Little do they know, I\u2019m still bald as ever.\u201d It\u2019s available in 31 different hues.", "description": "The best Halloween costume wigs on Amazon, from Marie Antoinette to a Kardashian to cosplay to the Little Mermad looks and more, from brands including Yopo, K\u2019ryssma, eNilecor, Rubie\u2019s Costumes and others.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/17/pc-costume-wigs/17-costume-wigs-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
