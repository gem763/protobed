Everything silenced and terrified, except for the intermittent sound of Turkish artillery fire, whose craters almost swallow up the horizon.\n\nThis is Qamishli, a border town controlled in part by Kurdish forces and in part by the Syrian regime. Here the strikes are random. There are no shelters. There is nowhere to hide. The Syrian regime is banning people from exiting the town to other places.\n\nLike many border areas under attack since the Turkish army and its Syrian rebel allies launched an incursion into northeast Syria on Wednesday, the displacement of people increases day by day.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Innocent people have been turned into the fuel of war, to be consumed and burned.\n\nMonitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) says 64 people, including 21 children, have been killed in the fighting.\n\nAmong those are nine civilians who were shot dead \u201cexecution-style\u201d, the SOHR added.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 130,000 people have been displaced as a result of the fighting, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe UN\u2019s humanitarian office estimates in total 400,000 civilians in the Syrian conflict zone may require aid and protection in the coming period.\n\nThe fighting so far has reached the main highway that runs between Hassakah, a major town and logistical hub, and Ain Eissa, the administrative centre of the Kurdish-led areas.\n\nIt is chaos. Kurdish authorities said on Sunday afternoon that some 785 people affiliated with the so-called Islamic State have escaped from a camp in Ain Eissa.\n\nLike thousands of others, I don\u2019t know what I will do or where I shall go. There is no safe place after the Turkish strikes. Every place is a potential target.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Everyone has given into death and pain, it seems.\n\nI spoke to a wounded Christian family whose neighbourhood in Qamishli was bombed three days ago.\n\nThe husband Fadi Habsuno described the moment he experienced \u201cdeath while still alive\u201d when two shells landed on his street during the Turkish army\u2019s bombing of al-Bashiriya district.\n\n\u201cWhen the bombardment started, I had nightmares my two children would be orphaned or worse and so I took them with my wife to the safest place I could find \u2013 a friend\u2019s house,\u201d he says.\n\nBut it turned out the entire street was under fire.\n\nWith the shrapnel still puncturing his body, he describes how he bled for an hour as he desperately searched for his family. He says everything around him had turned to dust.\n\n\u201cI felt heat in my body, dizzy in my head, I remember stumbling upon the body of my dusty neighbour who had his brain outside the skull on the ground while I was looking for my wife and children.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Juliet, was badly wounded in her back and abdomen. Her condition was still critical even after a six-hour operation.\n\nHe later found his two children cowering in a corner of the building which was partially standing and so \u201chugged them as if they were reborn\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere were no ambulances, and no means of transport,\u201d he continues, adjusting his bandages with pain. His tears mingle with the blood dried stiff on his face. Behind him his wife\u2019s groans fill the room.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have anything. My house has become rubble. I lost everything I had, now Juliet and I are at the hospital and don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the sparrows that I took care of were burned and our canary birds,\u201d he adds, his voice trailing off.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Do you have any idea what it means for a child to lose a leg? Do you know she will remain handicapped for the rest of her life?\u201d\n\nThe children\u2019s aunt, who asks not to be named, says she will relive that moment she saw her nephew\u2019s body torn open by shelling.\n\n\u201cThat day will puncture our reality every second of our lives.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs told to Bel Trew", "description": "The markets, the once-crowded streets and the public parks are now empty.
