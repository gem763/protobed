Forget the Ooshies, because Woolies are slinging 25% off everything for the rest of September if you use the Woolworths Scan & Go app.\n\nThe promotion is currently offered at Mona Vale, Double Bay Woolworths stores, as well as Metro stores in Pitt St, George St and the MetCentre. So it looks like you won\u2019t be spring cleaning out your bank account this month if you live in Sydney.\n\nWoolworths said the discount is valid on every shop \u201cup to a limit of $1000\u201d between September 4 and 30, IT News reports.\n\nThe app technically can only process payments of under $250, but if you\u2019re preparing for a zombie apocalypse and spending $1000 in a single shop, you can still use the app but will need to pay with a physical card at checkout.\n\nThe Scan & Go service already sounds like a great idea because you literally just whip out your smart phone and scan your shit without the need for the whole \u201cunexpected item in bagging area\u201d issue. But if that wasn\u2019t already a sweet enough deal, they\u2019re literally slashing a quarter of the price off your shop (which means you can definitely afford to chuck in a box of those fancy Belgian seashell chocolates that cost an arm and a leg).\n\nThere are a few exclusions, but considering they\u2019re offering such a large discount, the list is pretty minimal. Basically you can\u2019t buy alcohol, ciggies or gift cards, but that\u2019s all pretty normal when it comes to promotions like this. You can read the full list on the website.\n\n\u201cA key part of the trial is testing the accuracy and reliability of our Scan&Go app. From time to time we will conduct scan checks to see how this new technology is performing,\u201d Woolworths said.\n\nTo use the app and score that extra 25% off, you just need to download the app, link it to your Woolworths Rewards account and add a payment method.\n\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I might just have to take a month-long holiday to Mona Vale because I am a cheap bitch\u2122 who will do anything for 25% off.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-05-at-4.03.44-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
