The charts saw some new closing highs as well as violations of resistance, leaving them in positive trends. The data remains generally neutral as well with the exception on the NASDAQ OB/OS being overbought. Yet with all of these positive factors present, we are maintaining our near term \u201cneutral\u201d outlook or the major equity indexes due to issues discussed below that suggest better buying opportunities may lie ahead.\n\nOn the charts, all of the indexes closed higher Monday with the one exception of the DJT (page 4) posting a minor loss.\n\n\u00b7 Positive events occurred on the SPX (page 2) and NDX (page 3) with both hitting new all-time closing highs.\n\n\u00b7 The DJI (page 2), COMPQX (page 3), MID (page 4) and RTY (page 5) closed above their respective resistance levels as well.\n\n\u00b7 As such, all of the charts are in near term uptrends as are the cumulative advance/decline lines for the All Exchange, NYSE and NASDAQ. We reiterate our concern, however, on the NSDAQ\u2018s A/D making a notably lower high as discussed previously.\n\n\u00b7 The stochastic levels remain a concern as all are well into overbought conditions. While they can stay that way for a while, we have seen these conditions four times this year, each of which was followed by a notable correction.\n\n\u00b7 The is sending the same signal as its Friday close below 13.00 was seen twice this year with the same eventual result.\n\nThe data remains mostly neutral including most of the 1-day McClellan OB/OS Oscillators with the exception on the NASDAQ 1 day now being overbought (All Exchange:+43.24 NYSE:+31.24 NASDAQ:+57.36).\n\n\u00b7 The detrended Rydex Ratio (contrary indicator) remains neutral at +0.4.\n\n\u00b7 This week\u2019s AAII Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicators) remained bullish at 34.33/29.33. However, the Investor\u2019s Intelligence Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicator) stayed bearish at 17.2/47.6 suggesting an excess of bullish sentiment on the part of investment advisors continues.\n\n\u00b7 The % of SPX stocks trading above their 50 DMAs is a neutral 64.6%. Insider buying has cooled as it slipped to a 36.2 neutral Open Insider Buy/Sell Ratio.\n\n\u00b7 Valuation continues to compress with forward 12 month earnings estimates for the SPX slipping down to $172.65 via Bloomberg, leaving the forward p/e at a 17.6 multiple while the \u201crule of twenty\u201d finds fair value at 18.2.\n\n\u00b7 Said SPX estimates have been shrinking daily over the past several sessions.\n\n\u00b7 The stands at 1.85%.\n\n\u00b7 The earnings yield is 5.68%.\n\nIn conclusion, while the charts are sending a positive message, the , stochastic levels, insiders cooling on their buying activity and the consistent slide in forward SPX estimates suggest we maintain our \u201cneutral\u201d outlook.\n\n: 2,994/NA\n\n: 26,742/27,212\n\n: 8,173/8,330\n\n: 7,911/NA\n\n: 10,657/10,858\n\n: 1,939/1,983\n\n: 1,529/1,588\n\nVALUA: 6,190/6,318", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Guy S.
