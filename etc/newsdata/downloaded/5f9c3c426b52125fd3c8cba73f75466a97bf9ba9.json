You are taking more of your environment in consideration to be ready for a surprise if there\u2019s one.\u201d\n\nThe responding officers did examine the Fort Worth property, with body-camera footage released by the police and shared by multiple outlets showing them walking around the side of the house.\n\nAs one officer approached a closed first-floor window with a flashlight, he raised his gun and screamed, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d The officer, later identified as Dean, apparently never identified himself as police before firing.\n\nHowever, that response raised questions by many officials, including Jeff Halstead, a retired Fort Worth chief of police and police consultant.\n\n\u201cThey were standing literally at the front door, they could see whether the door was kicked on or not. The lights were on, there was evidence that people were living there, there were toys,\u201d Halstead told CNN. \u201cWhy they advanced to an extremely dark backyard area without at least ringing the doorbell or checking the entrance? That\u2019s extremely concerning.\u201d\n\nAaron Dean | Fort Worth Police More", "description": "Officer Who Shot Atatiana Jefferson Wasn't Asked to Do Wellness Check", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6yrPexjutMoKnqIciRmWLQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/3ff42ef281c8feeacaaebd78900fb703", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
