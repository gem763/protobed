John Bel Edwards vied for re-election against two Repbulicans \u2014 Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone \u2014 as voters headed to the polls Saturday.\n\nEdwards is the only Democratic candidate involved in Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nLouisiana holds what\u2019s called a jungle primary, meaning all candidates run against each other, regardless of party affiliation. If Edwards secures more than 50 percent of the vote, he wins the election outright. If not, he\u2019ll face one of the Republican candidates in a runoff election Nov. 16.\n\nLouisiana leans Republican, but 2019 polling shows Edwards in the lead over Republican candidates.\n\nAn October poll shows Edwards with 48 percent support compared to Rispone\u2019s 25 percent and Abraham\u2019s 23 percent, leaving about 4 percent who said they would support someone else.\n\nThe race could be tight if gets to a runoff and Republicans unify their vote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told voters not to vote for Edwards at a rally Friday in Louisiana, and he may end up endorsing the lead Republican candidate if it gets to a runoff.\n\nTrump won Louisiana by 20 points in 2016.\n\nEdwards won the office four years ago against Republican candidate David Vitter, who was embroiled in a prostitution scandal at the time.\n\nEdwards has a conservative, pro-life and pro-guns stance, which appealed to Republicans or Independents who lean conservative, Michael Henderson, a Louisiana State University professor, told The Advocate.\n\nHowever, his conservative stance could hurt his Democratic vote. Earlier this year, Edwards signed a bill tightening restrictions on abortion, upsetting pro-choice Democrats, especially women.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 Democratic Louisiana Gov.
