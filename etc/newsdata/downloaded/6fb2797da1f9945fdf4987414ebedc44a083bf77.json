These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow.

Its journey means that it will be nearby for much longer, giving astronomers a chance to observe it more fully and hopefully understand more of its story.\n\n2I/Borisov was first seen at the end of August by Gennady Borisov, from Crimea. He noticed that it appeared to be a comet, based on the haze that surrounded it, and he turned out to be right \u2013 since comets tend to be named after the person who first spotted them, it was given his name.\n\nThat distinctive tail is helping astronomers understand more about how the comet is making its way through the universe. Its current orbit suggests that it will be flying around the solar system for months, coming close to the Sun on 7 December and then flying out of the solar system.\n\nDuring that time, astronomers are scanning the visitor to learn as much as they can about it. That could help illuminate its origin and its destination, more about what it is made of, and how it could have been sent all the way to us \u2013 questions that could not be fully answered about Oumuamua, since it was spotted so late and was already heading out of the solar system before researchers could turn their attention to it fully.", "description": "An object speeding around near Earth is officially the second ever known visitor from another solar system, astronomers have said.
