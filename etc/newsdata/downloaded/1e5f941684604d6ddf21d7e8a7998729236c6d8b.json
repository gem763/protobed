Pictured is the Gupo dog meat market in Busan when more than 80 dogs were rescued when local authorities shut it down\n\nDogs are shown locked in a cage at a dog meat farm in Namyangju, South Korea, last October. Canines destined to be killed for meat were rehomed from the farm to the UK by the HSI/Korea\n\nEach year, 8,500 dogs are abandoned in Seoul and a quarter of them are euthanized because they cannot be adopted.\n\nLast year animal rights organisation Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth (CARE) were accused of euthanizing more than 200 stray dogs without authorisation.\n\nThe scandal led to the trade in canine meat facing increasing opposition across South Korea.\n\nWhen Gupo was closed, the mostly Korean Jindo mix dogs, were freed by charity workers after they were found cowering in their cramped cages.\n\nDog meat consumption is declining rapidly in South Korea, particularly among younger generations as attitudes towards the practice are changing.\n\nA survey by Gallup Korea conducted in June 2018 showed that 70 per cent of South Koreans say they will not eat dog meat in future.\n\nDespite the trend moving away from eating dogs, it remains popular in South Korea during July and August, when it is eaten as a soup called bosintang.\n\nDog meat is officially classed as 'detestable' by Seoul, as is snake, but the designation has no legal ramifications.\n\nA mother dog and her puppies are shown locked in a cage at a dog meat farm in Namyangju, South Korea, in August 18, 2018\n\nDogs looking out from a cage at a dog farm during a rescue event, involving the closure of the farm organised by the Humane Society International (HSI), in Hongseong, in February\n\nThe move to end the last remaining dog meat butcheries has been welcomed by leading animal charity Humane Society International/Korea.\n\nThe organisations has been active in the country since 2015, working with dog meat farmers to close farms, rescue dogs and change government policy.\n\nNara Kim, dog meat campaign manager for Humane Society International/Korea says: 'I am so happy to see Seoul's last remaining dog meat shops end dog slaughter.\n\n'Although these shops can still sell dog meat, it is nonetheless wonderful to see South Korea take one step further away from this dying industry that most Koreans want nothing to do with.\n\nTwo month old puppies openly for sale in the Seongnan market, South of Seoul, for pets or for meat. The puppies cost just $9.20, or \u00a36.50\n\n'It gives me hope that South Korea's future is dog meat-free. HSI/Korea will continue working with the government, and supporting farmers who no longer want to work in the dog meat trade, so that one day we will be able to celebrate the closure of South Korea's final dog slaughterhouse.'\n\nHSI/Korea has so far closed 15 dog meat farms in South Korea, helping farmers to close down their dog meat slaughterhouses and move to alternative livelihoods.\n\nIncreasingly, dog farmers are keen to exit the controversial trade due to societal shame, family pressure and decreasing profits, the HSI said.\n\nAuthorities have invoked hygiene regulations or animal protection laws that ban cruel slaughter methods to crack down on dog farms and restaurants.\n\nDog farm owners have been protesting a potential ban of the meat sale as many Koreans traditionally eat dog in the summer as it is believed to increase energy.", "description": "Seoul's last three dog meat shops said they would end canine slaughter on-site, following over a year of campaigning from the city's mayor, Park Won-soon.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/15476772-0-image-a-65_1572439390463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
