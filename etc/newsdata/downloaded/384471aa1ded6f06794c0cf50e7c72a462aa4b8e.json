It cut its dividend by more than half and said second-half trading has \"started slowly\" due to unseasonably warm weather.\n\nAnalysts at Liberum Capital slashed their pretax profit estimate for the full year by about 39%. \"Forecasts and outlook have been impacted by a very tough market backdrop where discounting is prevalent, and consumer uncertainty has led to unpredictable trading patterns,\" the brokerage said.\n\nTed Baker shares have now lost 74% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe large-cap FTSE 100 meanwhile dropped 0.37% to 7096.11, after suffering its worst percentage decline in two-and-a-half years on Wednesday.\n\nMiners including Glencore (GLEN.LN) and Anglo American (AAL.LN) paced declines.\n\nDiageo shares (DGE.LN) rose 1.4% as tariffs imposed on the beverage maker by the U.S. were not as steep as analysts had feared.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 06:36 ET (10:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
