If ignored, its ripple effect will spread in the sub-region given the country\u2019s important role in the continent,\u201d she said.\n\nSpokesman for the ministries of justice, military and police did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Callamard\u2019s findings.\n\nThe Islamist insurgency waged by Boko Haram began in northeast Nigeria in 2009 but has spread to parts of neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger where members of the group and militants allied to Islamic State carry out attacks.\n\nThe rapporteur also condemned what she said was the \u201carbitrary deprivation of life\u201d and the excessive use of lethal force in the case of processions held by banned Shi\u2019ite Muslim group the Islamic Movement in Nigeria.\n\nCallamard said the move to ban the group appeared be based on what the authorities thought IMN could become rather than its actions. She said she had not been presented with any evidence to suggest the group was weaponised and posed a threat to the country.", "description": "Nigeria's multiple security problems have created a crisis that requires urgent attention and could lead to instability in other African countries if it is not addressed, a United Nations rapporteur said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
