And one of only six women.\n\nBut that is not why she is back for more. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it to prove that it\u2019s possible,\u201d she says of her 2020/21 Vendee campaign, which takes another significant leap forward on Sunday when Davies sets off from Le Havre in the two-handed Transat Jacques Vabre. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it to prove that women can compete with men, or anything like that. Tracy [Edwards] and Florence [Arthaud] already did that. I\u2019m doing it because I want to. Because I love it.\u201d\n\nNot that it is not without its complications. Now 45, Davies lives in Tregunc in Brittany with her partner, the French sailor Romain Attanasio. He, too, is entering the next Vendee Globe, which means they are both flat out planning, sailing, fundraising. Not easy when they also have an eight-year-old son. Ruben was a baby when Davies last entered the Vendee (she was dismasted while running 13th in the 2012/13). Now he is fully conscious of what his parents are doing, the risks they are taking, the time they spend away from home.", "description": "It has been over a decade since Sam Davies shot to prominence, her fourth place finish in the 2008/09 Vendee Globe, sailing\u2019s toughest, most gruelling, single-handed race, catapaulting her into some very rarefied company.", "authors": ["Tom Cary", "Sir Ben Ainslie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/sailing/2019/10/26/INITIATIVES-COEUR-ROUTE-RHUM-2018-026-1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpiVx42joSuAkZ0bE9ijUnGH28ZiNHzwg9svuZLxrn1U.JPG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
