That information, it seems, is still coming. And there\u2019s still plenty of time and lots of gaming-centric shows in which the company can spill more about the system. \u201cThese updates may not be a huge surprise,\u201d SIE President and CEO Jim Ryan writes, \u201cbut we wanted to confirm them for our PlayStation fans, as we start to reveal additional details about our vision for the next generation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a smattering of additional details. Ryan highlights the upcoming system\u2019s controllers, for one thing. There\u2019s new haptic feedback on board, in place of the more traditional rumble technology that\u2019s been around for some time. That should give a better approximation of the simulated experiences during game play.\n\nAlso new is \u201cadaptive triggers,\u201d which are being added to the L2 and R2 buttons. Ryan again,\n\nDevelopers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain. In combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions. Game creators have started to receive early versions of the new controller, and we can\u2019t wait to see where their imagination goes with these new features at their disposal.\n\nThe PlayStation 5 will be available in time for the 2020 holiday season. More information soon, one assumes.", "description": "Part of me wishes Sony had gone for something a little flashier. The PlayStation Unicorn or PlayStation Trebuchet or something.
