With some 40,000 residents living on 19 square miles, it is the largest military installation in the world.\n\nFort Bragg also happens to be named for a pro-slavery Confederate officer, Braxton Bragg. A slave owner who fought for the South in the Civil War, Bragg rose to the position of general and commanded the Army of Tennessee. An infamously poor tactician, he has been called \u201cthe most hated man of the Confederacy.\u201d\n\nDespite that, his name graces one of the most prominent military installations in the United States. Nor is Bragg alone. Nine other military bases are named after Confederate figures, including Fort Hood in Texas. And those are part of a greater network of some 1,500 symbols commemorating the Confederacy across the country.\n\nStates and municipalities have tried to get rid of Confederate monuments, even as others have maintained that they are a necessary reminder of history. Now, a congressman from New York wants to make sure that the federal government is not paying money to maintain Confederate monuments on public lands.\n\nThere are, to be sure, no Confederate highways passing through the district of Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat who represents a heavily immigrant section of Manhattan. Yet he has recently introduced legislation called the No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act. Were it to become law, it would \u201cprohibit the use of Federal funds for Confederate symbols, and for other purposes.\u201d The bill does not say what those \u201cother purposes\u201d are.\n\nIntroduced in August, the bill specifically targets \u201cthe creation, maintenance, or display\u201d of Confederate flags and other symbols of the Confederacy on \u201cFederal public land, including any highway, park, subway, Federal building, military installation, street, or other Federal property.\u201d Museums would be exempt.\n\nThe legislation has 13 co-sponsors, including influential progressives like Ro Khanna of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island, as well as Florida\u2019s Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. Yet the bill has not moved since its introduction two months ago, in part because Congress has had periods of recess, not to mention the president\u2019s impeachment inquiry to contend with.\n\nThere is also the recognition that even if the legislation passes the House, it will be little more than a statement of moral principle, as it stands virtually no chance in the Senate.\n\nFor all that, Espaillat\u2019s proposal is relatively modest, focusing only on federal lands. It would do nothing about the monument to Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Va., that became the site of violent far-right protests two years ago, because it sits on city land. So do most other controversial Confederate memorials, giving Espaillat\u2019s law a limited reach.\n\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (Photo: Caroline Brehman/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images) More\n\nBut 10 military bases, including Fort Bragg and Fort Hood, would have to change their names. The other eight installations named after Confederate generals are Fort Rucker in Alabama; Fort Benning and Fort Gordon in Georgia; Camp Beauregard and Fort Polk in Louisiana; and Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Lee and Fort Pickett in Virginia.\n\nA name change would also be necessary for Pickett Peak Campground, a site honoring Confederate Gen. George Pickett in the Mokelumne Wilderness of Northern California, which is maintained by the U.S. Forest Service. Though nowhere near the slave-owning states of the South, the area was home to Confederate sympathizers and also contains a peak named after Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. Also consigned to oblivion would be a plaque installed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., where John Brown led a doomed slave uprising in 1859.", "description": "Rep.
