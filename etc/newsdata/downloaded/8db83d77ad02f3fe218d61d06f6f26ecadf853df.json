Global Climate Strike draws out hundreds of thousands of protesters in New York, DC", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Students from an estimated 156 countries marched in the Global Climate Strike. USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 A boisterous crowd of at least 200,000 people turned out to chant and march in Manhattan on Friday, joining hundreds of thousands of protesters from Australia to Thailand to London in Global Climate Strike rallies.\n\nWhile supporters of all ages turned out, the day was billed as a walkout by high school students to call on world leaders to step up their efforts against climate change, carbon emissions and other environmental issues.\n\nGreta Thunberg, the noted 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist whose efforts have been raising environmental consciousness around the globe, spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands in New York City's Battery Park.\n\n\"Around the world today about 4 million people have been striking,\" Thunberg said. \"This is the biggest climate strike ever in history and we all should be so proud of ourselves because we have done this together.\"\n\nNew York City schools excused the city's 1.1 million students from class to participate.\n\n\"Climate change is worse than homework,\" read one homemade sign among the crowd marching from Foley Square to City Hall, and another said, \"Stop denying the Earth is frying.\" At one point, the crowd, gathered on a breezy, sunny afternoon outside federal courthouses, chanted: \u201cThat\u2019s bulls--t, get off it, our planet\u2019s not for profit!\u201d\n\n\"We are not in school today, and we have some adults who are not at work today either,\" Thunberg told the crowd. \"And why? Because this is an emergency. Our house is on fire.\"\n\nKatie Elder, 19, from Milwaukee, was in New York, where she is taking two gap years between high school and college to work for Future Coalition, a network of youth organizations. She called the turnout \"amazing\" that was turning into a \"really, really powerful day.\"\n\nPig-tailed, nine- year-old Sophia of Queens, New York, who was carrying a hand-drawn \"We speak for the trees\"sign, said she'd begged her mother to let her skip school: \"Mommy, can we pleeeease go to the climate march?\" She said she already bugs her not to use plastic plates or forks, and her mom agreed they could go together, along with her sister.\n\nThe global protests were timed to begin a week of activism at the United Nations, including a Youth Climate Summit on Saturday and a U.N. Climate Action Summit on Monday. A second worldwide walkout called Earth Strike is planned for Sept. 27.\n\n'It's our future that's at stake': US students plan to skip school Friday to fight climate 'emergency'\n\nIn Washington, D.C., several thousand young people marched to the Capitol building carrying signs reading \u201cThere is no Planet B\u201d and \u201cThis can\u2019t wait until I finish high school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically our Earth is dying and if we don\u2019t do something about it, we die,\u201d said A.J. Conermann, a 15-year-old sophomore. \u201cI want to grow up. I want to have a future.\u201d\n\nAnd in Chicago, crowds grew as the young people led the march through the streets to Federal Plaza. At the front of the marches stood Isabella Johnson, who told USA TODAY that her goal is to pressure politicians to combat the climate crisis, particularly by passing a proposed bill in the Illinois legislation for a Clean Energy Jobs Act.\n\n\"I want this country's leaders to realize that the youth will not back down, we will strike and strike and strike until they take action,\" she said. \"And if they refuse to take action that would ensure my generation a healthy future, then we will vote them out of office first chance we get.\"\n\nKatie Eder, 19, is from Milwaukee.

To mark the day, Poland\u2019s president Andrzej Duda and first lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda helped remove trash from a forest.\n\n\u2022 In Prague, protesters gathered in the Czech Republic's downtown Old Town Square, waving numerous banners that read \u201cMore love, less coal,\u201d \u201cScience, not silence,\u201d or \u201cWhy should we go to universities when they don\u2019t listen to the educated?\u201d before marching through the city.\n\n\u2022 In Kabul, the capital of war-ravaged Afghanistan, a young generation, worried that if war doesn\u2019t kill them climate change will, took part in the global climate strike. About 100 young people, with several women in the front carrying a banner emblazoned with \u201cFridays for future\", marched through central Kabul. They followed behind an armored personnel carrier deployed for their protection.\n\nClimate and change: As temperatures rise, expect public health problems to soar\n\n\u2022Thousands of school students and adults gathered outside the British Parliament in London to demand \u201cclimate justice.\u201d There were also rallies in U.K. cities including Birmingham, Glasgow and Belfast. Some demonstrators held home-made placards with slogans including \u201cDon\u2019t be a fossil fool.\u201d\n\nThe British government said it endorsed the protesters\u2019 message, but didn\u2019t condone skipping school.\n\nMore around the US\n\nIn Chicago, ahead of the main march, several labor groups rallied outside Amazon's downtown offices in support of Amazon workers who planned to walk off the job to demand Amazon take action against climate change. Employees at the Amazon headquarters in Seattle also planned to walk out Friday.\n\nDozens of protesters, led by Warehouse Workers For Justice and Sunrise Movement Chicago, held signs and chanted \u201cFossil fuels have got to go\u201d and \u201cAmazon\u2019s a big polluter, do your part to save our future.\u201d They also planned to join the city\u2019s larger climate strike.\n\nThe protest, which was planned days ago, comes one day after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced a new plan for the company to tackle climate change.\n\nThough billed as a walkout, many public schools backed the effort as a civic exercise and learning exercise.\n\nChicago Public Schools said it sought to \"respect and support our students\u2019 desire to voice their opinions and participate in the wider conversations taking place about important social issues.\"\n\nCPS allowed students to join the march but said they would receive an unexcused absence if they didn\u2019t return to class afterward, according to a letter sent to principals earlier this week.\n\nRead this: As Earth faces climate catastrophe, US set to open nearly 200 power plants\n\nElsewhere in the U.S., individual strikes were being organized by young people in their own towns and cities, similar to last year's national school walkouts aimed at combating gun violence.\n\nIn San Francisco, organizers said their march would start at the local office of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who represents the area.\n\nConsider this: There are 3 billion fewer birds in North America than there were in 1970\n\nIt\u2019s not just students who are protesting. Susan Sattell, 59, a mother and member of participating organization Extinction Rebellion, planned to strike Friday. She said she joined the group after reading a United Nations report on species extinction this past May.\n\n\u201cI overheard my daughter Emily and her friend talking about the report. They were counting, and her friend said \u2018Wow, we\u2019ll be 24 when extinction starts.\u2019 And my daughter said, \u2018that\u2019s pretty old, but I want to live longer than that,\u2019\u201d Sattell said.\n\nInspired by Greta Thunberg\n\nCLOSE At only 16-year-old, the Swedish teen is taking a stand and letting Congress and the world know about climate change. USA TODAY, Wochit\n\nThe face of the worldwide effort is Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, who came to New York on a solar-powered sailboat to attend the strike in New York City and then the summit.\n\nWhile Thunberg is not the organizer, she is a major motivating force. She gave the global movement a push starting in August 2018 when she began skipping school on Fridays to stand outside the Swedish parliament holding a sign protesting inaction on climate change.\n\nYou may like: 6 things to know about climate change activist Greta Thunberg\n\nShe has also met with Pope Francis who, she said, expressed support for the climate protests and has addressed the European Parliament.\n\nIn a worldwide walkout in March, Thunberg said over 1 million people took part in 125 countries, citing numbers from climate action group 350.org.\n\nThunberg was in Washington to demonstrate in front of the White House and to testify before Congress. She also grabbed a meeting with former president Barack Obama, who ended the session with a fist bump.\n\nThunberg told the Associated Press on Friday that the large turnout worldwide was \"a victory.\"\n\n\u201cI would never have predicted or believed that this was going to happen someday and so fast,\u201d she said.\n\nThunberg added that it was now up to world leaders to take action. She said if they don\u2019t, they should \u201cfeel ashamed.\u201d\n\nContributing: Morgan Hines in New York\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/20/global-climate-strike-students-school-walkout-new-york-chicago-san-francisco/2373323001/", "description": "At least 100,000 people joined the Global Climate Strike in New York City as high school students around the world skipped class to protest", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Grace Hauck", "Janet Wilson", "Published A.M.
