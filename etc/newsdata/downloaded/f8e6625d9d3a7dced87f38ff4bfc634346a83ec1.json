As passengers reached for the one working lifeboat, its floor \u201cfailed\u201d as well, the commission said.\n\nOthers clung to the capsized hull of the ferry.\n\nAuthorities did not commission a search-and-rescue operation until Jan. 26 when the catamaran\u2019s arrival in Tarawa became clearly overdue.\n\nThat operation included help from U.S., Australian and New Zealand aircraft and lasted for six days.", "description": "An overloaded ferry that sank near the Pacific island archipelago of Kiribati last year, killing 95 people, was not allowed to carry passengers in the open sea, and had twice run aground before its fateful journey, an inquiry has found.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
