Widespread dry, hot and windy weather is expected to affect the utility's service Saturday evening through Monday.\n\n\"This wind event is forecast to be the most serious weather situation that Northern and Central California has experienced in recent memory,\" said Michael Lewis, PG&E's senior vice president of Electric Operations.\n\nThe weekend outage is the second major shutoff by PG&E this month, after the company two weeks ago cut power to nearly 2 million people to avoid fires sparked by its electricity lines.\n\nLos Angeles County and Sonoma County have been under a state of emergency since Friday.\n\nThe Kincade Fire that started on Wednesday night in Sonoma County prompted officials to evacuate about 2,200 people as of Friday, with more expected evacuate. As of Saturday morning, the fire was 10% contained and had consumed 25,455 acres.\n\nHundreds of miles south, in Los Angeles County, the Tick Fire has destroyed 4,300 acres, forced about 50,000 people to evacuate and consumed nine homes since Thursday.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that an extreme and potentially historic offshore wind event was expected in mountain regions of Northern and Central California between Saturday night and Monday morning. The strong winds could bring explosive wildfire conditions and make the job of firefighters significantly more difficult and dangerous.\n\nShares of PG&E plunged to $5 on Friday, a 30% decline that could hamper the company's attempt to make its way out of bankruptcy. The stock decline followed reporting that PG&E's transmission lines were active in the area where the Sonoma County fire sparked. The company's stock has declined by almost 90% over the past 12 months.\n\nPG&E's equipment has sparked 19 major fires in 2017 and 2018, and the company was blamed for last year's Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86 people.\n\nPG&E said that customers can now expect rolling power outages for another 10 years as it upgrades its electrical systems in response to more extreme weather conditions in California.\n\nThe company's preemptive outages have come under severe scrutiny by those who argue that electricity shutoffs threaten lives and local response efforts to fire emergencies, and shift responsibility away from PG&E and onto the public.\n\nBut PG&E has defended the outages as critical for the safety of its customers.\n\n\"We would only take this decision for one reason \u2013 to help reduce catastrophic wildfire risk to our customers and communities,\" Lewis said. \"There is no compromising the safety of our customers, which is our most important responsibility.\"", "description": "PG&E has been shutting off power to residents to avoid fires sparked by electric lines.
