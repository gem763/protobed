He added he was working hard to save every single penny of public money and so far recovered Rs10 billion of NHA.\n\nAfter five years, Murad said, NHA will be able to build highways and motorways with its own resources.\n\nHe said the present government chose a difficult task of making the country economically stable first which required hard work, selflessness and dedication.\n\nSpeaking about the recent government initiatives, he said recently launched Kamyab Jawan Programme would provide jobs and business opportunities to millions of youth of the country. Likewise, the government has earmarked Rs192 billion for the Ehsas Programme which reflected its seriousness towards the welfare of the common man of the country.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Communications Murad Saeed says National Highway Authority (NHA) would soon achieve a revenue target of Rs100 billion.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Murad-Saeed-750x369-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
