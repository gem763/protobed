There is so much dust on this thing we\u2019ll have to work hard to dig out the nucleus.\u201d\n\nHUNDREDS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES, DATING FROM STONE AGE TO 19TH CENTURY, UNEARTHED IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe two comets, 2I/Borisov and \u2018Oumuamua,' are reportedly the first two objects that have traveled from outside of our solar system into ours that have been observed.\n\nThat's possible because scientists\u2019 knowledge and equipment are far better than they ever have been.\n\nOne study apparently claims there are thousands of such comets in our solar system at any given time, but most are too faint to be detected with current telescopes.\n\nComets are icy bodies believed to be fragments left behind when planets form in the outer regions of planetary systems.", "description": "An astronomer captured one of the sharpest looks at a comet from outside our solar system.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/comet-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
