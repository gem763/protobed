And now the company is following that up with a new appliance, the $249.99 Alexa Smart Oven: a combination microwave, convection cooker, air fryer, and food warmer.\n\nLike the Alexa microwave, the Alexa Smart Oven doesn\u2019t offer Echo hardware on board \u2014 there\u2019s no microphone or speaker \u2014 but rather is controlled through a separate Alexa device.\n\nIn addition to the fact that the Alexa Smart Oven offers more cooking options, Amazon has also expanded the Alexa integration on offer: there\u2019s a new \u201cscan to cook\u201d feature that will work with \u201chundreds\u201d of prepackaged food products (including ones sold by Amazon-owned Whole Foods, of course). You\u2019ll also be able to do things like set the temperature and preheat the oven through voice controls.\n\nAnd like the microwave, the Alexa Smart Oven is intended as a reference design \u2014 other Alexa-integrated devices will be able to use these APIs, too.\n\nAmazon is bundling an Echo Dot (not the new one with a clock) alongside the Amazon Smart Oven, so you\u2019ll have a device to control it with. You\u2019ll be able to preorder the Amazon Smart Oven today, priced at $249.99.\n\nThe Amazon Smart Oven is a microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and food warmer that you can control with your voice using any Alexa-enabled device. https://t.co/ugT22XhFIn pic.twitter.com/n2PcLUtcZ8 \u2014 Amazon News (@amazonnews) September 25, 2019", "description": "Amazon is launching its own Alexa Smart Oven.
