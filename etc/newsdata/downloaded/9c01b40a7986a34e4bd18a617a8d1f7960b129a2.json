Gandhi never visited the U.S., but few non-Americans have had such a great impact on American life. His work as a freedom fighter and social reformer in India was closely followed in the U.S.\n\nIn the 1920s, when Gandhi launched a nonviolent mass movement against British colonial rule in India, his struggle was widely reported in the African-American press. Thinkers such as W.E.B. Du Bois and E. Franklin Frazier wrote about him, and several influential African-Americans visited him to seek advice, including Howard Thurman, later a mentor to Martin Luther King, Jr. Thurman wrote of how he had been subjected to an intense examination by the Indian leader: \u201cpersistent, pragmatic questions about American Negroes, about the course of slavery, and how we had survived it.\u201d As Thurman prepared to leave, Gandhi offered him this hopeful prediction: \u201cIt may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world.\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr., at the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi, 1959.

In 1958, as he was making his name as a civil rights leader in the American South, King published a tribute to Gandhi in an Indian newspaper describing the deep influence the \u201cFather of the Indian Nation\u201d had on his thought: \u201cI came to see at a very early stage that a synthesis of Gandhi\u2019s method of nonviolence and the Christian ethic of love is the best weapon available to Negroes in this struggle for freedom and human dignity.... His spirit is a continual reminder to oppressed people that it is possible to resist evil and yet not resort to violence.\u201d\n\nDuring Gandhi\u2019s lifetime, however, his most fervent American admirer was another clergyman, the white New York pastor John Haynes Holmes, who in 1920 helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union. The following year, Holmes delivered a sermon titled \u201cWho Is the Greatest Man in the World?\u201d His answer was Gandhi, who reminded him of Jesus: \u201cHe lives his life; he speaks his word, he suffers, strives, and will some day nobly die, for his kingdom upon earth.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Gandhi was in the middle of the Non-Cooperation Movement, his first major campaign against British rule in India. This involved the burning of foreign cloth to promote indigenous Indian industry, the nonpayment of colonial taxes, and the withdrawal of Indian patriots from serving in colonial offices, universities and law courts. The struggle was widely covered in the American press. In a \u201ccynical, materialistic and disillusioned\u201d age, wrote the liberal journal the Nation, there had emerged a man \u201cwhose singular devotion, unselfishness and spiritual power have won him the almost superstitious reverence of his own people and the respect of the skeptical critics.\u201d\n\nGandhi appealed to American radicals because of his anti-colonialism, and to American Christians because of his simple life and message of brotherhood. While he opposed British imperialism, he often said that he had no hatred for individual Englishmen. Indeed, his closest friend was a British priest, C.F. Andrews, who wrote several books and many articles praising Gandhi for an American audience. The Chicago-based magazine the Christian Century repeatedly proposed Gandhi\u2019s name for a Nobel Peace Prize, though it failed to persuade the Anglophilic Norwegians to award him the honor.\n\nGandhi with fellow protesters in the Salt March, 1930.

Following the Salt March, Gandhi spent many months in prison. When he was released, he received a flood of letters conveying the admiration of Americans for his struggle. A particularly moving letter came from a Chicago resident named Arthur Sewell. The \u201cNegroes of America,\u201d Sewell wrote, were \u201ckeenly and sympathetically\u201d following Gandhi\u2019s movement. African-Americans \u201csympathize and suffer\u201d with India and Indians, \u201cfor here, in America, they not only rob us of our possessions and hurdle us into the prisons unjustly, but they mob, lynch and burn us up with fire.... May God Bless you,\u201d Sewell declared, \u201cand enable you to carry on the great battle for righteous adjustment until you win a glorious victory for the common cause of the lowly.\u201d\n\nThe Salt March made Gandhi immensely famous in America; Time Magazine named him Man of the Year. A certain James B. Pond of New York\u2019s Pond Bureau, self-professed \u201cManagers of American Tours for World Celebrities,\u201d urged Gandhi to capitalize on this acclaim by making a tour of the U.S. \u201cWhen you visit this country,\u201d Pond promised, \u201cyou will receive a welcome such as no man has ever had, and it is going to require the utmost knowledge, the utmost sympathy and utmost tact on the part of a manager to meet the situation.\u201d But the idea of a lucrative lecture tour didn\u2019t appeal to the austere and ascetic Indian.\n\nDespite never setting foot in the U.S., Gandhi remained much on the mind of Americans. In 1932, a charming tribute appeared in the form of an advertisement by Saks, the New York department store, playing on the fact that Gandhi made his own clothes. Filling almost a whole page in the New York Times in 1932, the ad featured an illustration of four men wearing suits, each reading a newspaper, with the slogan \u201cEVERYBODY BUT GANDHI. \u201d The text underneath said, in part: \u201cThe Mahatma chooses to spin his own\u2026such as it is\u2026and that\u2019s his business! He needn\u2019t read this ad. But all the rest of you gentlemen prefer to wear good suits\u2026and that\u2019s our business.\u201d Evidently, the well-dressed man in New York knew very well what the Indian leader wore\u2014or didn\u2019t wear.\n\nGandhi following his release from prison in 1931.

Six decades later, an African-American became president of the U.S., his rise made possible by the struggle for racial equality that had Gandhi as one of its exemplars. In an interview shortly after taking office, Barack Obama was asked to choose a figure from history he would like to dine with. Gandhi, he answered, adding that of course it would be a frugal meal.\n\nToday there are statues of Gandhi in many American cities, and courses on him are taught in numerous colleges and universities. His name and example once inspired the civil-rights movement; now it animates environmental debates. Visiting Arizona State University in Tempe, I saw a campaign for public transportation that invoked my most famous countryman with the tagline \u201cEven Gandhi walked.\u201d\n\nGandhi wore little and ate even less. Yet he may have influenced the citizens of the most prosperous society on earth more than any non-American in modern times.\n\n\u2014Mr. Guha is the author, most recently, of \u201cGandhi: The Years That Changed the World\u201d (Knopf), the second volume of his biography of Gandhi.", "description": "He never set foot in the U.S., but the Indian leader\u2019s life and ideas inspired millions and provoked social change", "authors": ["Ramachandra Guha"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FB244_GANDHI_SOC_20190924145448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
