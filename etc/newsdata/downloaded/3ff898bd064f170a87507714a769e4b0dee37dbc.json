Charlie Baker (R) passed a temporary four-month ban on all vaping products on Sept. 24 that took effect immediately and if not stopped, will run through Jan. 25. The ban includes both flavored and non-flavored vaping products, making it the strongest vaping ban in the country.\n\nA statement released at that time indicated there had been 61 cases of vaping-related pulmonary disease reported in Massachusetts alone.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday said that there are over 1,000 cases nationwide of vaping-associated lung injury and that at least 18 Americans have died.\n\nFour out of 5 of all cases involve THC, one of the components in cannabis. The CDC has recommended that Americans stop vaping, especially if THC is involved.\n\nThe ban, however, is not out of the woods yet.\n\nTalwani will hear arguments related to the preliminary injunction against the ban on Oct. 15.", "description": "A U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/govcharliebaker_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
