So far, no arrests have been made and the Kuwaiti family have not been named.", "description": "A 31-year-old native of The Gambia told police she had been kept as a slave by a Kuwaiti family for four years, including for three months inside an apartment building in Cleveland.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20332960-0-image-a-57_1572364411033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
