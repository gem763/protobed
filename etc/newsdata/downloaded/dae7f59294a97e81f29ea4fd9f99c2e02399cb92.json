Then he opened the floor to questions from the media, only to repeatedly dodge a query about just how many times he had painted himself in the image of a black or brown person.\n\n\u201cI am wary of being definitive about this, because the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,\u201d Trudeau finally admitted, leaving open the possibility that more offensive images might emerge. \u201c[A]nd I think the question is, how could you not remember that? The fact is, I didn\u2019t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, it is absolutely stunning and headline-worthy that Trudeau\u2014the son of a Canadian prime minister now serving in that role himself\u2014may have worn brown and blackface so often that he\u2019s now iffy on how many times he did so. On the other, despite the media\u2019s treatment of the entire Trudeau blackface controversy as a shocking betrayal of the Canadian prime minister\u2019s pristine progressivism, it\u2019s not particularly surprising that a white liberal did something racist (or, rather, enough racist things that he\u2019s not sure he can remember them all).", "description": "The progressive prime minister says he \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d that painting himself as a caricature of an entire race would feel \u201churtful\u201d to the very people he was caricaturing.", "authors": ["Kali Holloway"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568960393/190919-holloway-trudeau-tease_wxskof", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
