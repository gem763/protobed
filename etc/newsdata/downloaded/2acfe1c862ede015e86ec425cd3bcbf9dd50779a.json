At the outset, he condemned the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s role in Ukraine at a time when his son Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nMr. Trump repeatedly referred to the whistle-blower and condemned the news media reporting on the complaint as \u201ccrooked.\u201d He then said the whistle-blower never heard the call in question.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?
