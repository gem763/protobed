According to a Facebook post by the police, Belford has dementia and is mostly non-verbal.\n\nAs members of the community helped police look for the woman, four young friends created their own search party.\n\nLogan Hultman, 10, and his friends, Kashton, Hope, and Mackenna, were quick to join the efforts.\n\n\"They dedicated their afternoon and early into their night to help somebody in need and I think they understood the severity of the situation, just how dangerous it was,\" Logan's mother, Alyssa Hultman, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \"They understood [Belford] was in danger and it was a reality that she needed to be found.\"\n\nAt one point during the search, Logan, speeding down a hill, fell off his bike. The friends regrouped at his house where his older brother helped patch him up before heading back out to continue their search.\n\n\"They were willing to take their time and canvas the neighborhood, even after falling down, getting hurt, and hitting some roadblocks,\u201d Alyssa tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThey went back out and continued to make that effort. I think it\u2019s really amazing what they did. I'm extremely proud.\"\n\nIt wasn't long after the group returned to the streets that they spotted Belford. Hope, 11, called 911 and police were able to reunite Belford with her family. A representative of the Roseville Police Department did not return a media request from Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\n\u201cThis is a great example of our exceptional community coming together to lend a helping hand. This proves a great point, age is just a number, and anyone can help out in a time of need,\u201d the police wrote on Facebook, including a photo of the crew, from left to right, Logan, Kashton, Mackenna, and Hope. The little one is Kashton and Hope's brother, Crew, who couldn't help but share in their victory when the photo was taken.\n\nWhile they have been receiving plenty of praise online and lots of media attention, the kids are all a bit confused.\n\n\"The kids have all told me that they\u2019re kind of surprised and that they don\u2019t deserve the attention. They feel they just did something that they feel everyone should do\u2014they helped someone in need,\" Allyson says. \u201cThat says a lot about their character and the families they\u2019ve been raised in. They decided to go help somebody, as a neighborhood crew, our junior detectives.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Four neighborhood friends hopped on their bikes to locate a missing 97-year-old woman with dementia.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r6umNXhkn4IHrdcY7CAS2Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/ktxl_sacramento_834/e38854f7ad49fb538bcb93271a948522", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
