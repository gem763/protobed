She was admitted to hospital for treatment, but was reportedly declared dead at the Government Multispeciality Hospital 16 in Chandigarh, and certified as medically deceased.\n\nHer grieving family reportedly waited at the hospital for some three hours until an ambulance was free to take her remains to their home so they could prepare the woman\u2019s funeral arrangements.\n\nEn route to the family home, however, her already distraught relatives saw that the woman\u2019s remains were twitching, and they rushed to another hospital.\n\nSadly, after two hours of attempted emergency resuscitation, the woman was then declared officially deceased for the second time at the Emergency of the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh.\n\nAlso on rt.com Grieving father finds another newborn alive in shallow grave while burying his own daughter\n\n\u201cIn medical terms, this is called \u2018Lazarus phenomena\u2019 and worldwide only 38 such cases have been reported so far,\u201d said Dr Dasari Harish, head of the hospital\u2019s forensic department.\n\nA committee was established to determine whether any form of malpractice had occurred throughout the episode, but no improprieties were uncovered.\n\nHarish postulates that some \u201clifesaving drugs\u201d administered to patients in crisis situations can have longer-lasting effects than previously thought, and may indeed revive patients temporarily after they have been officially declared dead.\n\nLike this story?
