Nice and autumnal but much of the day feels like 50s (November-like). I\u2019ll pine a little for our 68-degree average high temperature. \ud83c\udf83\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: More sun than clouds. Very breezy. Highs: Near 60 to mid-60s.\n\nTonight: Clear. Dying breeze. Lows: Mid-30s to Mid-40s (downtown).\n\nSaturday: Increasing clouds late. Highs: Mid- to upper 60s.\n\nSunday: Cloudier, with a rain chance. Highs: 60s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed to dress in layers. Our bodies are adjusting to what will feel GREAT, come November. Patchy frost is even possible tonight outside the Beltway. And we\u2019ve got a chance of some more rain ahead as well \u2014 woo!\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Friday): Northwesterly winds thankfully come down a notch from Thursday, but gusts around 25 to 30 mph are possible. Sunshine dominates for the most part, but a morning batch of clouds and even a quick spit of rain can\u2019t be completely ruled out. Some upper-level energy may move through the region, pinwheeling from the New England storm. Afternoon high temperatures top out generally near 60 to a few mid-60s. Thanks to winds \u2014 gustiest through midday \u2014 we start out feeling chilly. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Any last breezes calm quickly after sunset. Given clear skies, combining with calming conditions, the atmosphere relinquishes its heat very quickly. So, grab a light coat as temperatures head toward perhaps the low to mid-40s downtown. Frosty mid-30s are possible outside the Beltway, and a few spots might even get colder, like along the Interstate 81 corridor.

Temperatures should get into the mid-60s for most of us, with a few upper 60s possible \u2014 especially south of town if sunshine can effectively beat out clouds. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Clouds continue to build. Any showers probably hold off until after midnight. Steadier light rain may arrive around sunrise. Temperatures steady out, for much of the night, near 50 degrees to mid-50s downtown. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: Tropical remnants from a Gulf of Mexico system may move through our region, but for now it seems the bulk will try to pass south and east. Rain could be steadiest in the morning, and it\u2019s looking largely light at this time. It should taper slowly and surely, with the risk ending in the afternoon or at least by sunset. This moisture could still change speed and course, and it wouldn\u2019t take much to get heavier stuff into the area, so stay tuned. Around 60 to low 60s may be the warmest we see, if clouds and rain dominate the day. If we turn drier and sunnier quickly by midday, we could see a few spots try for 70. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nSunday night: Plan on more clouds than stars, as it appears now. It may stay dry, but check back this weekend if you need higher confidence that showers fully avoid us during the nighttime hours. Upper 40s to low 50s are currently our likeliest low temperature range. The air is a bit moist (dew points around 50) but it\u2019s doubtful it will feel muggy. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nUpper 60s to low 70s should feel comfortable Monday, which has a chance of staying dry and rather sunny as a cold front slowly works this way from the west. Pretty ideal, except for the Monday part. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nTuesday is looking gray and potentially wetter, with clouds and showers possibly hanging around much of the day. The timing and intensity of any rain is still subject to change, but we\u2019ll watch it as highs try to rise into the 60s, although they may get held back quick if rain arrives early. The jet stream is moving closer to us this time of year, providing a \u201ctrain track\u201d for cold fronts and storms to come and go more quickly and (hopefully) more regularly.
