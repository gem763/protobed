Transformations in the character of warfare have always attracted varying levels of attention and opposition, and plenty of hubris. In general, the national security, intelligence and defence community has muddled through. Some of that\u2019s been due to the best combination of analytical rigour, intuitive talent and a wisdom that only experience and time can bring. But, as Andrew Davies has pointed out, some of it\u2019s due to blind, random luck.\n\nOne aspect of the current shift that Australia\u2019s security community should be paying attention to is developments in the application of cognitive neuroscience to national security. The landmark U.S. study on this topic was the National Research Council\u2019s Emerging cognitive neuroscience and related technologies, published in 2008. A comprehensive overview was provided in the book Mind wars by Jonathan D. Moreno, first published in 2006 and updated in 2010, which was followed by a number of other excellent studies by other authors. And since 2007, the annual conference organised by the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Strategic Multilayer Assessment program has brought the national security and cognitive neuroscience communities together for wide-ranging discussions.\n\nThe insights of the cognitive neurosciences over the past two decades have been rich and enlightening. Many of them will be used in pursuit of furthering human wellbeing. But many, of course, will be employed in the everchanging means by which human beings make war. A \u2018neuro-weapon\u2019, as described broadly by James Giordano, is anything that accesses the brain to contend with others. Defence dual-use neuro-technology has been the subject of numerous DARPA and IARPA research programs for years now.\n\nUsing the tools of neuro-weaponry involves the three A\u2019s\u2014access, assess and affect. For a long time most have intuitively thought of accessing the human brain in terms of direct proximity\u2014sticking things inside or aiming things at the human skull and tinkering. This is a misconception. Insights into cognitive processes have suggested ways to achieve the three A\u2019s at a distance. One of the fundamental enablers here has been the advent of the digital age\u2014acting as connective tissue, substrate or medium through which effects are propagated.\n\nThe constant connectivity provided by the internet and mobile devices, combined with the attention-based economic models that now dominate internet platforms, has since the mid-2000s accelerated societies to a state of hyper-connectivity unprecedented in human history. Contrary to early hopes, nothing about global connectivity is inherently emancipatory.\n\nWhat the digital substrate amounts to is access to the human brain at a distance. As more has been learned about the neurophysiology of cognitive states, much has been gleaned from the deluge of data produced by the now ubiquitous practice of \u2018lifelogging\u2019 underpinning much of the digital human\u2013computer interface that makes up our daily lives. DARPA\u2019s Biological Technology Office studied these processes under its \u2018Narrative networks\u2019 and \u2018Social media in strategic communications\u2019 projects, among numerous others.\n\nIn the commercial space, the engineering of human\u2013computer interaction has been a growth industry for two decades. Every interaction people have with computers, particularly computers connected to the internet, is taking place in a zone of cognitive manipulation. There are very few neutral or benign interactions\u2014opportunities for cognitive exploitation and control are built into the way we built the digital age. It is exploitable by design, and that\u2019s a huge problem.\n\nAwareness of this shift is growing inside Australia\u2019s security agencies. Those at the front line of contemporary conflict in the defence organisation have a sharpening understanding of the imperative to act. What the shift to the cognitive domain reveals, however, is that the previous orientations towards vying for information in the electromagnetic spectrum and in the human domain, as episodic and separate lines of effort in support of lethal effects delivered on the conventional battlefield, will be insufficient.\n\nContending in the cognitive domain, in which the whole of Australian society is situated, will require a coordinated effort and alignment of strategic intent across the whole of government, as retired major general and former senator Jim Molan writes. Meanwhile, we face an adversarial environment in which unscrupulous, agile and imaginative actors are investing in the ways and means of cognitive warfare at an accelerating rate.\n\nWhat mustn\u2019t be overlooked in this unfortunate turn of events is the foundation of the society Australia is aiming to defend. Open democracy is based, more than anything else, on conventions\u2014expectations about how people interact with one another and with the state. The fabric of these conventions is trust. The same goes for a middle power like Australia in its international interactions.\n\nTrust is a strategic resource, not an auxiliary luxury. The world of digitally manipulative cognitive warfare is profoundly complex. Effects vary\u2014side effects and accidents are impossible to control. Interventions in complex human systems involve deep uncertainty and should be approached with extreme caution. In the haste to react, the risk of undermining the very thing we are aiming to defend is real. Which would amount to doing the adversary\u2019s job for it. There are ways and means of acting defensively in the digital age. Many of them have little to do with technology.\n\nAdversarial information operations aimed at sowing discord and disruption in open societies create a narrative signature that can be modelled and mapped as it transits the digital terrain. We currently have the technology to identify and track these signatures, but we are yet to put it to full use. Full control of the narrative in the digital terrain is, however, a fantasy. Open societies like Australia\u2019s can pursue denial of hostile narratives transiting cyberspace without harbouring hubristic expectations about \u2018winning\u2019 the cognitive contest.\n\nWe already know what the fabric of open society is made of: human relationships. Understanding how these are being warped and transformed by digital technologies, with or without an adversarial narrative attached, is the key to democratic resilience. A little-acknowledged strategic capability of great importance for Australia as it navigates its digital future will be the transformation of our current societal approach to the development and deployment at scale of technologies with immense implications for the lives of individuals, families, communities and the nation.", "description": "The parameters of contemporary conflict, as ASPI\u0092s Tom Uren noted recently, are shifting.
