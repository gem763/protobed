And in the big fat binder were instructions that Lilya brailled by hand on a braille typewriter.\"\n\nHis mind was blown. As a blind kid, Shifrin had never before been able complete a Lego set on his own.\n\n\"I never thought that I'd be able to build Lego sets as a blind person. I mean, it was about as likely as being able to drive a car,\" he said.\n\n\"Once she gave me these instructions, I realized that I could do it and that blind kids deserved these kind of sets and these kinds of experiences.\"\n\nNow the 22-year-old Boston-based Lego enthusiast and accessibility advocate is partnering with the Danish toy manufacturer to make sure the next generation can have that.\n\nHonouring his friend's memory\n\nLego announced Wednesday it is launching a pilot program to provide accessible audio and braille instructions, inspired by Finkel and Shifrin.\n\nThe company has posted the new, AI-generated instructions for four major Lego sets online. Users can access them using a screen reader that reads text out loud, or a braille reader that converts text to braille on a touch pad. People who don't have access to either can play the audio instructions directly on the site.\n\nThe company says it will gather user feedback on the first sets, and then release more accessible instructions in the first half of 2020.\n\nShifrin, front, is pictured here as a child with his family friend Lilya Finkel. The pair spent years posting braille Lego instructions online before Finkel died in 2017. (Submitted by Matthew Shifrin)\n\nIt's a new initiative for Lego, but one that was a long time coming for Shifrin.\n\nFor years after that first Lego experience, he and Finkel worked together to translate Lego kit instructions to braille and post them online for other fans to use.\n\nThen Finkel died in 2017.\n\n\"When she died, I thought to myself that I need to reach out to Lego. I need to keep this project going because blind kids don't have Lilyas in their lives,\" Shifrin said.\n\nHe would email the company regularly, he explained, but struggled to get past the customer service reps and talk to someone who could really make it happen.\n\nBut the fanfare over a short PBS documentary about Finkel and Shifrin's work called How Lego Helps Blind People See inspired him to keep trying. Eventually, he made contact with someone at Lego and pitched his idea.\n\n\"It has been an honour to work with Matthew, his passion and energy are truly inspiring,\" Fenella Blaize Charity, creative director of Lego Group, said in a press release.\n\n\"But most importantly his project will help visually impaired children around the world experience the same joy of building and pride of creation that all our fans feel.\"\n\n'A sense of what the world is like'\n\nShifrin says working with Legos helps blind and visually impaired kids better understand the world around them.\n\n\"Lego sets enable blind children to really get a sense of what the world is like, to get a sense of things that they can't see \u2014 buildings, cars, spaceships, all these things that sighted people see every day but blind kids know of, but have never personally experienced,\" he said.\n\nA person assembles Legos using the accessible instructions on the website legoaudioinstructions.com. (Lego )\n\nA blind child might have an idea that certain structures \u2014 like the Empire State Building \u2014 are culturally important, but it's hard for them to grasp how they look or take up space in the world.\n\n\"But when they build these buildings themselves, they become intimately familiar with the shaping of these buildings and why these buildings matter,\" he said. \"It's kind of a mix of an architecture lesson and history.\"\n\nShifrin is now working with Lego to test the new instructions with blind and visually impaired children.\n\n\"I had a building event last week that I ran, and these kids were on fire,\" he said.\n\n\"They were having aha moments left and right, and they really had that same experience that I'd had on my 13th birthday.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
