It is a Uefa tournament so they would say they've set the fixtures,' said Roberts.\n\n'I wrote to UEFA asking them to reconsider the Friday night kick-off in exactly the same way that the FA Cup or Premier League have a basket of fixtures and they can normally work it out so they have the right game at the right time to minimalise it.\n\n'That's not something we've been able to do. We're going to take that up again with UEFA just to make sure that they're conscious of when they're making the scheduling decisions they look at what games present a particular risk and try to reschedule it.\n\nEngland fans will be under scrutiny after violent clashes during recent fixtures abroad\n\n'If it came to it in the UK, certainly England and Wales, if we had real concerns about the scheduling of a game, then potentially, regardless of Uefa, we could seek to impose some conditions via a Safety Advisory Group. We'd be loath to do that but ultimately, if Uefa aren't willing to have the dialogue, and the police force thought there was a real risk of disorder, we could impose conditions about the kick-off.'\n\nThe FA have been pro-active in trying to eradicate the sort of anti-social behaviour that has marred a number of England's away trip in recent months, launching their 'Don't be that idiot' campaign.\n\nAhead of Friday's clash against Czech Republic and next Monday's clash against Bulgaria in Sofia, the FA are urging supporters to 'Report that idiot' if they see any England fans behaving unacceptably.\n\nOfficially, 3,731 supporters will be in Czech Republic and 3,130 in Bulgaria - but more ticketless fans are expected to arrive.\n\nPolice have been given licence to film in certain areas of both cities and stadiums which will allow them to easily identify trouble makers which could lead to banning orders, while police can enforce \u00a3200 on the spot penalties for being drunk on the street in Prague.\n\nRacist behaviour from fans is also likely to be firmly in focus in the coming days.\n\nOfficially, 3731 fans will be in Czech Republic but many ticketless fans are expected to arrive\n\nAnd Tony Conniford, the FA's head of security, has warned supporters that UEFA's eyes will be firmly fixed on them in Prague and Sofia this week.\n\n'I think we have to be aware the behaviour of our fans is on UEFA's radar,' said Conniford.\n\n'They will be monitoring what happens over the weekend. Everyone saw what happened in Portugal and UEFA monitor fan behaviour like they monitor teams.\n\nThe behaviour we've seen recently is different from what we've seen in the past.\n\n'For me there's risk of endangering that reputation so that we are policed on behaviour rather than being policed on the reputation.' UEFA and fellow nation's governing bodies could look to restrict England's ticket allocation for away games if England fans continue to misbehave abroad.\n\nAnyone witnessing anti-social behaviour before, during or after matches, can report it by emailing englandsupportersclub@thefa.com or by calling or texting +447970146250.", "description": "UEFA have ignored pleas from British police to reschedule England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Czech Republic in Prague amid the worrying prospect of hooliganism.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19371602-0-image-a-12_1570395432118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
