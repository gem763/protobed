You say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I meant to say him.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrincipal Jonathan Hochman later told a school board meeting considering whether to fire Vlaming he could not \u201cthink of a worse way to treat a child than what was happening\u201d.\n\nAfter Vlaming was fired, the West Point schools superintendent, Laura Abel, said: \u201cDiscrimination \u2026 leads to creating a hostile learning environment. And the student had expressed that. The parent had expressed that. They felt disrespected.\u201d\n\nAccording to the TV station WWBT, Vlaming\u2019s firing led to student petitions on either side of the issue and a walkout in which around 100 students carried signs that said: \u201cMen are men. Women are women.\u201d\n\nIn his lawsuit, Vlaming says his rights to speak freely and exercise his religion were violated. The suit states that Vlaming \u201csincerely believes that referring to a female as a male by using an objectively male pronoun is telling a lie\u201d.\n\nAmong remedies sought by Vlaming are $1m damages, reinstatement in his job and a declaration that his rights were violated.\n\nHe is being represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based group which the Southern Poverty Law Center watchdog has called \u201cone of the most influential groups informing the [Trump] administration\u2019s attack on LGBTQ rights\u201d.", "description": "Peter Vlaming lost his job after claiming his religion prohibited him from using male pronouns for a student who transitioned", "authors": ["Associated Press In West Point"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3e59ec36a621da935624494ddb7791d276c85d/0_240_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11d1a33b1d4caf0d81846c26d37f91fb", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
