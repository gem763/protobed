He kept them talking for six days and bought us time.\n\n\"He deserves more credit than he ever got. Without that extra time the outcome could have been very different.\"\n\nMax was a serving officer with the Metropolitan Police and throughout his career rose to the rank of Chief Superintendant.\n\nOne of his toughest challenges was dealing with the Iranian Embassy seige gunmen.\n\nMax said: \"I was aware that if I said the wrong thing then someone could die.\n\n\"People talk about building up a rapport. I wasn't seeking a rapport.\n\n\"That type of individual I detest because of what they were doing. All I wanted to do was control the situation and communicate.\"\n\nAs well as keeping the gunmen, and in particular their leader, talking Max also took on a far more dangerous role.\n\nPolice, who were running the operation, had very little intelligence on who the terrorists actually were.\n\nOfficers made a decision that getting photos of those responsible would help identify them and could help secure the release of the hostages, which included a BBC journalist and a police officer.\n\nMax was the man who volunteered to carry a carton of cigarettes up to the door of the embassy and hand it over so snaps could be taken.\n\nHe said: \"They could have shot me, or they could have taken me hostage or they could have not done anything at all but I was prepared to do it.\n\n\"Looking down the barrel of a machine gun certainly wasn't very pleasant. The one thing I did forget about was the pressure on my family.\n\n\"At one point my wife turned the TV off saying to the children 'if dad is going to get himself killed, I don't want to see it'.\"\n\nOver the six days of the seige the gunmen did free some of the 26 hostages - women and a BBC soundman who pretended he was suffering from stomach cramps.\n\nBut there were still many held inside and the SAS were ready for when the time came for them to intervene.\n\nAfter the three shots were fired, the body of Abbas Lavasani was dumped in the front of the building.\n\nHe was the chief press officer for the Iranian Embassy and is believed to have argued with his captors before he was shot dead.\n\nLavasani's death dramatically changed the state of play.\n\nMax was still in contact with the terrorists.\n\nHe said: \"When we had a dead person I said 'we have a different position now, you have gone over the line, and he said 'yes, I know'.\"\n\nUntil this point the running of the operation had been managed by the Met but with the murder command switched to the SAS.\n\nWithin minutes the elite force was in place, ready to storm the building from the ground floor, upper floors and the roof.\n\nAnd for the first time since the SAS's creation during the Second World War, the eyes of the world were on them as press teams had flocked to the building.\n\nThere was an almighty explosion and the troops burst into the embassy.\n\nRusty said: \"We entered the building and our job was to go in the back. You could hear genuine fear.\n\n\"There was a lot of screaming, a lot of shouting and people crying.\"\n\nRusty was leading the team that was tasked with clearing the ground floor.\n\nHe shot one of the gunmen who was carrying a grenade in his hand - thankfully, the pin was still in.\n\nThe heroic actions of the SAS on that bank holiday in 1980 saved the lives of the 19 people still being held hostage.\n\nBut modest Rusty insists he has never seen himself as a hero.\n\nHe said: \"I had a job to do, and that was to rescue the hostages. We did what we were supposed to do.\"\n\nAfter the siege was finally over, Max finally succumbed to the pressure he'd been under.\n\nHe said: \"I sat in in the corner and I cried. I didn't know why I was crying. My boss came in and said 'you have one minute to let your wife know you're OK then get out because this place is going up in flames.\n\n\"The next thing I remember, I was at home but I have no memory of how I got there.\n\n\"I kept most of the hostages alive through negotiating but it wasn't a peaceful end.\n\n\"It wasn't until later that I realised I'd kept them alive and gave the SAS six days of time to plan and gave them the best possible chance with little or no injury to the teams.\"\n\nThe fact Max kept the gunmen talking for so long undoubtedly save lives, agrees Rusty.\n\nHe said: \"If we had gone in one day one it would have been very bloody.\"", "description": "Gunmen took 26 people hostage on April 30, 1980, and six days later explosive images of the SAS rescue heroes were beamed around the world", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Ap Photo", "Ap Photo Schaber"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20643518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ONE-TIME-USE-ONLY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
