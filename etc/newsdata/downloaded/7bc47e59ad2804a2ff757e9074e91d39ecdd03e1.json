Biden Jr. But his uncompromising position also threatens to alienate voters who are pleased with the Affordable Care Act, or who do not want to give up their private insurance. His own state of Vermont so far does not have a single-payer program.\n\nDespite skepticism about his views, however, Mr. Sanders has consistently resolved to reform the health care system, even before being elected to public office. In 1972, when he was running for Senate as a candidate from Vermont\u2019s left-wing Liberty Union Party, The Bennington Banner, a local newspaper , reported him taking an uncompromising stance: \u201cThere is absolutely no rational reason, in the United States of America today, we could not have full and total free medical care for all.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of paying medical bills\n\nThe first seeds of Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern were sown in Brooklyn.\n\nA high-school track and cross country star with an emerging political streak, Mr. Sanders had wanted to go to Harvard, friends said. But by his senior year, his mother, Dorothy Sanders, had become sick, her heart damaged from having rheumatic fever as a child.", "description": "The Vermont senator has staked his presidential campaign, and much of his political legacy, on transforming health care in America. His mother\u2019s illness, and a trip he made to study the Canadian system, help explain why.", "authors": ["Sydney Ember"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/us/00sandershealthcare-congress/00sandershealthcare-congress-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
