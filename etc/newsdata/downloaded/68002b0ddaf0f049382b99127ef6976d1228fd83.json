Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, who was sacked by Francis in 2017 as the Vatican\u2019s doctrine chief, said the \u201cgreat mistake\u201d was to bring the \u201cidols\u201d into the church in the first place.\n\n\u201cTo throw it out can be against human law, but to bring the idols into the church was a grave sin, a crime against divine law,\u201d he told the conservative US Catholic broadcaster EWTN.\n\nThe Vatican has insisted the statues were symbols of life, fertility and Mother Earth, and denounced the theft as a hate-filled, \u201cviolent and intolerant gesture\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the name of tradition and doctrine, they contemptuously threw away a symbol of maternity and sacredness of life,\u201d said the Vatican\u2019s editorial director Andrea Tornielli.\n\n\u201cWe do not use the term \u2019racists\u2019 lightly, but what else is it?\u201d asked the National Catholic Reporter, a progressive Catholic magazine, in an editorial this week.\n\n\u2018Save Catholic church' by lifting ban on female priests, activists say Read more\n\n\u201cCan you imagine the conservative outcry if someone tossed the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa into the Tiber?\u201d it said, referring to the \u201cblack Madonna\u201d icon that was particularly dear to Pope John Paul II, a hero to many conservatives.\n\nEarlier this month the pope hit out at \u201coffensive words\u201d spoken against the Amazon\u2019s indigenous people, noting that a feather headdress is no more ridiculous than hats worn at the Vatican.\n\nThe theft of the statues underscored the depth of conservative opposition to Francis and his agenda focusing on the poor, migrants and the environment.\n\nAny decision to open up the priesthood to married men or to ordain women deacons is likely to fuel more anger and increase calls for a future pope who is more rooted in orthodox doctrine like John Paul II and Benedict XVI.", "description": "Incident at end of Francis\u2019s Amazon synod blamed on conservatives and \u2018racists\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc1789e1a309b27072947378625431a6b2a3bb5d/268_44_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=44521acc1d38bda8ccf50ec4c9ec9abc", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
