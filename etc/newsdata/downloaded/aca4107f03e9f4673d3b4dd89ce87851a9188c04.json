The person admitted in the complaint released today that he/she wasn\u2019t on the call so anything could only at best be second hand information or hearsay. In other words rumor and innuendo.\n\nYet media was elevating that complaint over the representations of the people who actually were on the call and the transcript of what was really said. Adam Schiff even found that transcript so bland and non-impeachable that he had to make up his own version full of lies to deceive people.\n\nNow, a specific fact alleged in the complaint of the \u2018whistleblower\u2019 claimed is being called false by a government official, according to a new breaking report.\n\nAccording to Christina Ruffini, the State Department and Foreign Affairs Reporter for CBS News, a senior government official is saying that one of the people the whistleblower claimed was on the call was not in fact on the call.\n\nScoop: Senior Govt Official tells @CBSNews Counselor to the State Department Ulrich Brechbuhl was NOT on the @POTUS call with #Zelensky, as the whistle blower complaint states. \u2014 Christina Ruffini (@EenaRuffini) September 26, 2019\n\nAnother problem in the story also emerged today, according to Fox.\n\nAnd according to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s outreach to Ukraine. But a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine \u2014 even sending Giuliani a message reading, \u201cconnecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.\u201d Additionally, the complaint said Trump \u201csuggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep\u201d his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript.\n\nThere were of course other things wrong with the claim to begin with, such as the claim that there was a quid pro quo offered when there was none, as the transcript shows. Ukraine has also made it clear that they did not in any way feel pressured in the phone call, despite the whistleblower saying differently. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was a \u201cnormal call\u201d and \u201cno one pushed me.\u201d\n\nBut now with these very specific items not holding up, will the mainstream media and Democrats finally admit that this is folly to string impeachment talk based on hearsay and rumor? Pretty hard to be a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d about an event you weren\u2019t even a part of. Could it possibly be that the people who were on the call and who actually heard what were said are more accurate than this alleged CIA person who wasn\u2019t?\n\nAnd there\u2019s a far greater question media is missing here as well.\n\nWhy is this person being told about the call to begin with? What right did he/she have to be informed about any of this? How leaked to him and why? This indicates a problem within the intelligence community. And is this part of the IC rift with President Trump?\n\nIs there any wonder that the Trump White House would want to shift information into more secure servers when you have leakers like this out there?\n\nCongressional Republicans needs to start asking those essential questions and get our IC community in order. And Democrats and media need to find reality and stop pushing these kinds of stories based on nothing but what looks like pure political agenda.", "description": "Whistleblower Story Implodes: Gov\u2019t Official Specifically Calls Part of Story False, Other Claims Fall Apart", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Brandon Morse", "Sister Toldjah", "Alex Parker", "Stu Cvrk", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lies-word-cloud.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
