Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and fellow Republican members cited several documents, including letters from Democrats on the committee, sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and others. The Republicans also cited letters requesting depositions for several key officials.\n\nIn addition, a motion to censure Schiff for his \u201cparody\u201d reading of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during a hearing last month has garnered support from 173 co-sponsors.\n\n\"This is a serious matter and it ought to be treated seriously, and the way that Adam Schiff is doing it is highly partisan and not conducive to creating a credible record for the American people to look at,\" Rove said, noting that while there is a role for private depositions or private interviews, those conducted in this inquiry are \"not fair and honest.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The country is in a critical moment. This requires statesmanship. This requires somebody who is going to rise above hyperpartisanship. That person ain't Adam Schiff,\" the Fox News contributor concluded. \"And, he is ill-serving our country and ultimately ill-serving his political party by being so partisan and being so fundamentally unfair.\"\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is the wrong person to lead House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against President Trump, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff\u00a0Karl Rove said Saturday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/karl-rove-adam-schiff-FOX-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
