The coordinated student \u201cstrike\u201d culminated in New York\u2019s Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry.\n\nMassive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, chanting \u201cSave our planet!\u201d while anticipating an address by Thunberg, an international figure who sailed across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of next week\u2019s climate summit at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cRight now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,\u201d Thunberg told tens of thousands of people gathered at a park with a view of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nOnce she took the stage, the crowd chanted her name, then went silent to hang on her every word. As she paused between sentences, people erupted into applause.\n\n\u201cIf you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you. Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not,\u201d she concluded.\n\nDemonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, a halo around her head reading, \u201cOur house is on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like the icon of our generation,\u201d New York protester Fiamma Cochrane, 17, said, highlighting the leadership role of young people in the international movement to reduce consumption of fossil fuels.\n\nFour million people participated worldwide including 300,000 in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350.org said. Reuters could not verify the crowd sizes.\n\nConcern has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the international Paris Accord on climate change and took a series of steps to dismantle environmental protections, including moving on Thursday to block stricter vehicle emissions standards in California.\n\nTrump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are among the world\u2019s only national leaders who publicly question the science of climate change, and they are not taking part in next week\u2019s U.N. climate summit.\n\nThousands gathered across Brazil to take aim at Bolsonaro, who they say is allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest to clear space for soy beans and cattle ranching. In August, fires there surged to their greatest level since 2010.\n\nEnvironmental activist play dead as they participate in a Global Climate Strike near the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment office in Bangkok, Thailand September 20, 2019.

The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.\n\nGlobal warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, according to scientists.\n\n\u201cThere is no Planet B,\u201d read a sign hoisted by a young woman in London.\n\nIn Kenya, around 500 activists marched to demand that the government cancel plans for a coal plant and investigate corruption in hydropower dams.\n\n\u201cIn Samburu there is a lot of heat, the grass has dried up, there is little water,\u201d said Francis Lentel, a young herdsman in traditional beads, holding a picture of the Earth weeping.\n\nThe protest movement is putting increasing pressure on governments and companies to respond.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition during all-night talks.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nPrivate industry has also responded. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon neutral by 2040.\n\nHundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday criticized their industry for being slow to tackle climate change and joined marches in San Francisco and Seattle calling for action.", "description": "Millions of young people flooded the streets of cities around the world on Friday to demand political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, uniting in a worldwide protest inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431971451&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0Y1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
