It\u2019s devastated entire countries, millions of lives lost, refugee crises, our enemy al-Qaeda/ISIS strengthened,' she added.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard continued to ream into Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, sharing a second campaign video where she slammed the former Secretary of State's foreign policy as a 'disaster' that cost millions of lives.\n\nThe one minute clip, entitled 'Hillary, Acknowledge the Damage You\u2019ve Caused', sees the Hawaii Congresswoman blames Clinton for the deaths of servicemen overseas.

She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,' she said, not naming Gabbard directly.\n\nOn Sunday Gabbard released a furious campaign video in which she suggested that Clinton has been after her since 2016, when she left her position in the Democratic National Committee and endorsed Sen.

But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.'\n\nOn Monday Gabbard said she\u2019s open to confronting Clinton face to face.\n\nClinton's spokesperson Nick Merrill downplayed the beef between the two telling Fox News, 'The short of it is that she\u2019s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind. It\u2019s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it\u2019s as simple as that. She\u2019s out there telling the truth.'\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, Sen.
