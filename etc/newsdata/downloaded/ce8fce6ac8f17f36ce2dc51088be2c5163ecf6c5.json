Chisora would bob and weave under the jab, step to Price, and wail away short-range punches that peppered Price's head and body.\n\nThen, in the third, Chisora went for power. Chisora used that distance knowledge from the first two rounds to throw his heavier shots, cronking Price to the side of the head with a punch so hard the thud could be heard from press row.\n\nChisora opened Price up further by attaching powerful hook shots after the jab, forcing his opponent backward, almost defenseless, against the ropes.\n\nIt was only until the fourth when Price remembered what he was good at. The textbook one-two \u2014 an orthodox jab followed by an overhand right. He threw two in a row shortly after the bell to start the round, but slipped into bad habits when he let Chisora back him into a corner, to the ropes, then the inside, where he could just work his short, crisp, point-scoring punches.\n\nA knockdown was coming. And it all happened midway through the fourth, sending Price crashing to the canvas but though it looked like he could continue, his corner threw a white towel into the ring.\n\nThe fight followed a Chisora controversy\n\nChisora, 35, hit headlines this week for saying he was \"going to kill\" and \"murder this guy\" at a news conference in Canary Wharf, London, on Thursday.\n\nChisora made the controversial comment just eight days after the death of Patrick Day, who passed away in hospital because of injuries sustained in a boxing ring.\n\nChisora apologized to BBC Sport, saying: \"It just rolled off my tongue.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nKhabib Nurmagomedov calls Conor McGregor an alcoholic and a rapist following second allegation, reigniting an ugly UFC feud on Twitter\n\nConor McGregor's coach still thinks he's the best fighter in the world despite his heavy beating by Khabib Nurmagomedov\n\nThe real Tyson Fury is quiet, shy, and introverted, according to an Irish boxer who knows him well\n\nA second successive loss would finish Carl Frampton, but he fights to be called Ireland's greatest boxer: 'It's make or break'\n\nRory MacDonald warned that Douglas Lima's leg kicks are so hard they sound like someone firing a shotgun", "description": "Dereck Chisora defeated David Price with ease in London's 02 Arena on Saturday just days after threatening to murder him at a media event midweek.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db4b9b4dee01921700db8c2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
