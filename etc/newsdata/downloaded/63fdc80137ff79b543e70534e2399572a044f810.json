We feel that state security in South Africa is not quite responsive, especially in these attacks.\u201d\n\nWhile a woman describes the sentiments of her countrymen.\n\n\u201cPeople were booing because we are very angry about what South Africans are doing. We are very angry. We are all Africans.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa apologised on behalf of South Africans, but Zimbabweans say they want his government to act on perpetrators and ensure the protection of their foreign nationals.\n\nThe man said the President\u2019s apology is simply not enough.\n\n\u201cAn apology is not sufficient, we need more action.\u201d\n\nA woman at the stadium said the killing must stop.\n\n\u201cThat apology must be a true apology. Please, they must not kill people like dogs.\u201d\n\nThe President promised them government would do all it can to get to the root of the attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the late Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe is now lying in state in his home village of Zvimba.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post An Apology Is Not Enough, Zimbabweans Tell Ramaphosa appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "An Apology Is Not Enough, Zimbabweans Tell Ramaphosa", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_8_800x533_L_1420026210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
