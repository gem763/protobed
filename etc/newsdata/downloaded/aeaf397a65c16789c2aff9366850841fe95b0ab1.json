But it has been.\n\nIt said anything that replaced the backstop plan for the Irish border would have to meet the same standard of ruling out the return of a hard border \"under all circumstance\".\n\nBut this new deal does not quite do that.\n\nThere is a mechanism that would allow a simple majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote against these proposed new economic arrangements in the future.\n\nIf it did so, there would be a two-year notice period to find a new solution. That makes it, if you like, a form of time-limited backstop - although the EU would argue that it is highly unlikely that the Assembly would ever vote to trigger such uncertainty.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button\n\nThe other big difference though - which is an important point of principle for Mr Johnson - is that Northern Ireland will leave the EU's customs union with the rest of the UK.\n\nYes, it will continue to apply EU rules on customs, tariffs and regulations under the auspices of the European Court of Justice.\n\nBut - through diplomatic manoeuvring - it will remain part of the UK's customs territory.\n\nThat means it will be able to take a full part in any future trade deals the UK government negotiates around the world.\n\nBut there is no denying that this is not the most elegant of solutions. It is not only the DUP in Northern Ireland that is unhappy. Such is the nature of a negotiated compromise.\n\nFree trade agreement\n\nOne other issue is worth highlighting - promises by the UK to stick close to the EU's regulatory system after Brexit have been removed from the legally binding withdrawal agreement text.\n\nThey still appear in broad form in the political declaration on future relations - but the EU is well aware that Mr Johnson is looking for a looser economic relationship with the EU than his predecessor was.\n\nThat may well cause problems in the future, as several EU countries are concerned that the UK - a major economy on their doorstep - could seek to gain a competitive advantage by undercutting the EU's system of regulation.\n\nThe revised text of the political declaration says the aim is to complete a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK in the future.\n\nA high-level meeting will be convened in June 2020 to assess progress towards such a deal, before the end of the post-Brexit transition period.\n\nDuring trade negotiations, the UK will be treated as a potential competitor as well as a partner.\n\nIn that sense - as has been said before - even if this deal passes in the next few weeks (still a big if) it will not \"get Brexit done\".\n\nMuch of the hard work, including negotiating that future trade deal, is still to come, and it will last for many years.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "After tense negotiations, both sides made concessions to reach a new deal.", "authors": ["Chris Morris", "Reality Check Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10911/production/_109275876_gettyimages-1176351761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
