You all believe that the war on drugs has put too many Americans behind bars. Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison. Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough. Your response? BIDEN: Well, first of all, let me say that, when I came back from law school, I had a job with a great -- a big-time law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated. We were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman -- as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate, et cetera. The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As -- when we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. (Transcript via WaPo)\n\nMany were shocked and quickly pointed out not only how extreme that statement was, but that as a lawmaker, he helped put many of those people in jail.\n\nThe RNC sent out a quick reality check for Biden:\n\nJoe Biden spent his career being a \u201ctough-on-crime Democrat\u201d culminating with his 1994 crime bill which \u201cmany experts now associate with mass incarceration.\"\n\n\u00b7 \u201cFrom 1970 to 1994, the rate of imprisonment exploded 400 percent, to 387 per 100,000 people. From 1994 to 2009, imprisonment continued to rise, doubling.\u201d (MSNBC, 4/14/16) \u00b7 Biden\u2019s Crime Bill \u201cauthorized the death penalty for dozens of existing and new federal crimes, and instituted a federal \u2018three strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 provision.\u201d (MSNBC, 4/14/16) \u00b7 Biden\u2019s Crime Bill \u201cinfluenced states to increase their prison rolls. The bill granted states $12.5 billion to build prisons if they passed \u2018truth-in-sentencing\u2019 (TIS) laws, which required inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.\u201d (MSNBC, 4/14/16) o \u201cA 2002 Urban Institute study found that between 1995 and 1999, nine states adopted TIS laws for the first time, and another 21 states changed their TIS laws to comply with the crime bill\u2019s requirements and then apply for funding. By 1999, a total of 42 states had such laws on the books, sustaining an increase in imprisonment.\u201d (MSNBC, 4/14/16) Biden spent his career as a proponent of the death penalty and said that his crime bill would do \u201ceverything but hang people for jaywalking.\u201d But Biden recently flip-flopped.\n\nBiden just said: \u201cNobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs he insane? Bernie Madoff and other fraudulent crooks have hurt millions of people and have caused them their life savings and their roofs over their heads. Those people belong in jail to. #WhiteCollarCrime \u2014 Lisa Guerrero ???? (@4lisaguerrero) September 13, 2019\n\nPresident Trump also signed the historic #FirstStepAct into law, which undid much of the damage from the Biden crime bill and created a \u201cfairer justice system for all and enacted programs to reduce recidivism and make our communities safer.\u201d \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 13, 2019\n\nJoe Biden says far too many people are in prison than should be\n\n\n\nAlso Joe Biden: \"It provides 53 death penalty offenses. We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill\"pic.twitter.com/pQv2boh6Vl \u2014 Elizabeth Harrington (@LizRNC) September 13, 2019", "description": ".09/13/2019 14:04:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/a05cb514-9782-40e6-bec7-38bbd4b3b7e5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
