The first being his decision to dress up as Aladdin at an \"Arabian Nights\"-themed party by putting on brownface during his tenure as a teacher at West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver in 2001.\n\nExclusive: Justin Trudeau wore brownface at 2001 \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party while he taught at a private school, Canada's Liberal Party admits https://t.co/j3UobfYNIF \u2014 TIME (@TIME) September 18, 2019\n\nThe second was a video of him dressed in blackface for a performance of \"Day-O\" at a high school talent show.\n\nThen, Global News found another video of Trudeau wearing blackface. The Liberal Party again confirmed that that was their guy.\n\nBREAKING: Global has a video of a third instance of blackface.\n\n\n\nTrudeau was asked last night if there were any other occasions.\n\n\n\nHe said there was just two -- as a teacher and as a high schooler.\n\n\n\nThis video shows a third occasion.\n\n\n\nHe's still lying.https://t.co/L2ie5sJxkj \u2014 Ezra Levant ?? (@ezralevant) September 19, 2019\n\nTrudeau addressed the first two images on Wednesday night, acknowledging he made two mistakes, and that he was sorry.\n\n\"I shouldn't have done that,\" he said.\n\nPundits have noted that the prime minister's humble apology is miles away from how Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam responded to his own controversy. The latter has failed to acknowledge whether he was even in a racist yearbook photo.", "description": ".09/19/2019 19:03:02PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/269/feb4b3cd-6b39-47e0-821a-5422f76d8fc2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
