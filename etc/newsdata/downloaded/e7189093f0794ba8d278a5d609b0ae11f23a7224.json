He\u2019ll have a much harder time repeating the trick in Parliament this week.\n\nThe price of Johnson\u2019s concessions to the European Union became clear on Saturday. Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, whose interests were sold out by the British prime minister so he could strike the deal, gave their backing to a parliamentary amendment that vastly complicates Johnson\u2019s task. The Letwin amendment, named after the former Conservative lawmaker who drafted it, says the new Brexit deal isn\u2019t done until Parliament passes the legislation to implement it.\n\nThat had two effects. First, it forced Johnson to ask the EU for an extension to the Oct. 31 deadline, as required by a law that he said he\u2019d rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than comply with. Second, it has set up another epic battle between the executive and Parliament that will determine whether Britain leaves on Halloween. It might also determine the shape of future U.K.-EU customs arrangements, whether there\u2019s a second referendum and even the timing of new elections.\n\nThe new battlefield is over the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would turn Johnson\u2019s agreement into British law, including things such as controversial new customs arrangements and institutional frameworks, among many others.\n\nUnlike the U.K.-EU deal itself (a formal treaty), the withdrawal bill can be amended by Parliament. Given the bitter opposition to Johnson\u2019s administration from many lawmakers, expect it to be larded with attempted amendments to tie his hands in implementing the new treaty. The two most important ones being discussed are an amendment from the opposition Labour Party that would seek to keep the U.K. in the EU customs union and one to put the deal to a referendum. Johnson would probably abort the effort rather than submit to either.\n\nFor those who just got their heads around the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d \u2014 the guarantee in former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s deal to keep the Irish border fully open \u2014 my sympathies. Her backstop would have effectively locked the whole of the U.K. into the EU customs union (anathema to Brexiters), while Johnson\u2019s deal effectively does that only for Northern Ireland, to the displeasure of his erstwhile allies in the DUP. There was no wriggling out of May\u2019s backstop in a way that satisfied Brexiters without exactly these consequences.\n\nThe central feature of Johnson\u2019s deal is a permanent customs arrangement that leaves Northern Ireland in the U.K.\u2019s customs regime legally but that creates a complex customs system in the Irish Sea between the U.K. mainland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe system will require the filling in of detailed customs forms for each good being transported from the mainland to Northern Ireland that might end up in Ireland and the EU. And it creates an entirely untested system by which EU tariffs would be paid for those goods, and then refunded if they didn\u2019t go to the EU in the end.\n\nAnd people thought the backstop was a brain twister.\n\nThis arrangement imposes a new barrier on mainland-Northern Ireland trade, however much Johnson tries to dress it up as a simple matter of box-ticking. As such, it drives a cart and horses through the DUP\u2019s one main demand: that Northern Ireland be treated no differently from the rest of Britain. It would be surprising, to put it mildly, if the famously recalcitrant DUP moved at all.\n\nJohnson has two strong cards, however. First, momentum. Such is the general exhaustion with Brexit (and fear that further delay will see it never delivered) that his parliamentary support is already greater than any registered for May\u2019s deal. The European Research Group of hard-core Brexiters, most of the Conservative moderates he booted out of the party for defying him and some Labour MPs seem to be on board. His deal could squeak through if given the chance.\n\nThe prime minister had hoped to keep the momentum going with a vote on Monday to show his deal could pass Parliament. But the House of Commons speaker John Bercow disallowed the motion. Tuesday will see the government seek approval from lawmakers for the so-called second reading of the withdrawal bill \u2014 which would be a huge win for Johnson. If it passes, a second vote would follow immediately on an expedited three-day timetable to try to get the legislation through this week. If his attempt to speed up the legislative process fails, then it will be up to the EU to offer an extension.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It turned out last week that the key to getting a new Brexit agreement in Brussels wasn\u2019t so complicated: Boris Johnson simply gave in\u00a0on a couple of major negotiating red lines and then declared victory.
