But Ryaboshapka said the decision to review the cases was not specifically related to the time Hunter Biden spent on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private natural-gas firm, or allegations from the Trump administration that Joe Biden improperly applied pressure on Ukraine to have an investigation into Burisma halted.\n\nThe allegations from Trump and his lawyer Rudolph Giuliani have played a key role in the impeachment inquiry into Trump by Democratic lawmakers.\n\nUkraine:Text messages show U.S. diplomats believed U.S. aid was linked to Trump's demand for Biden probe\n\nUkraine\u2019s previous general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, closed a money-laundering and tax-irregularity probe into Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, in 2016. The case did not focus on Hunter Biden. There is also no evidence that Joe Biden acted improperly in applying pressure on Ukraine to dismiss Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin was widely and publicly viewed by international organizations such as the European Union and International Monetary Fund, and anti-corruption investigators in Ukraine, as an impediment to reforming the country\u2019s culture of graft.\n\nRyaboshapka said the audit has been planned since he took office one month ago. Friday\u2019s press conference was his first public one since taking up the role.\n\nImpeachment testimony: Intelligence watchdog to testify about 'credible' whistleblower complaint before key House committee\n\nVitali Kasko, Ryaboshapha\u2019s deputy, told USA TODAY after the news conference that an affidavit by Shokin highlighted in recent days by Giuliani\u2019s office that claims he was fired in 2016 because he was leading a \u201cwide-ranging corruption investigation\u201d into Burisma had no merit.\n\n\u201cShokin is not a reliable figure,\u201d he said.\n\nShokin was not available for comment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ukraine official to review probe tied to Joe Biden's son Hunter", "description": "Ruslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, said the decision to review the cases was not specifically linked to Hunter Biden or Trump's allegation.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JNA8HZbkcsN33GNV.cy.yw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/108b9f84-bd19-4868-b4ff-6f9db7cf1565/b27eb801-d367-5bc3-992c-8ee37c99aeb2/data_3_0.jpg?s=752134ee3eead11ed1d421f3a8911193&c=b26f5e13f2294622ec8602ab486ed50d&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
