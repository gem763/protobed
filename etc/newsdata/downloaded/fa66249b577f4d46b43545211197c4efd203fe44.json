It needs to spend an estimated 8 trillion yen (\u00a359bn) to decommission the plant and 6 trillion yen (\u00a345 billion) for decontamination.\n\nThe Fukushima disaster sparked discussion in Japan over its production and use of nuclear energy.\n\nJapan\u2019s new minister for the environment and nuclear issues, Shinjiro Koizumi, vowed to look into reducing Japan\u2019s output of nuclear power.\n\n\u201cI would like to study how we will scrap them (nuclear reactors), not how to retain them,\u201d he said in his first press conference, according to Kyodo News.\n\n\u201cWe will be doomed if we let nuclear accidents recur.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Three executives have been cleared of professional negligence in the only criminal trial stemming from the\u00a0Fukushima nuclear disaster.
