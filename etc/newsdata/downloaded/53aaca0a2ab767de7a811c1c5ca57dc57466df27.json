The system measures blood sugar levels and delivers insulin automatically when levels rise. Insulin delivery is temporarily stopped if blood sugar levels drop too low.\n\nPeople using the artificial pancreas were able to have good blood sugar control for almost an extra three hours each day compared to using just an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor.\n\n\u201cPeople with type 1 diabetes have to think every day about their blood sugar and how they need to manage it. Automated delivery systems can make a big difference and help ease the daily burden of managing blood sugar,\u201d said study lead author Dr. Sue Brown, an endocrinologist and associate professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nType 1 diabetes develops when the body\u2019s immune system \u2014 which normally protects you from disease \u2014 mistakenly turns against the healthy cells that produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to control blood sugar levels.\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes have to replace that lost insulin \u2014 either with shots or through an insulin pump. But getting the right amount can be tricky. Too much insulin can send blood sugar dangerously low, while too little can set people up for serious diabetes complications.\n\nThat means people with type 1 diabetes spend a lot of time testing and adjusting their insulin levels throughout the day. That\u2019s where the artificial pancreas can help, by taking over some of this work.\n\nThese systems aren\u2019t yet completely automated, though. Diabetics still need to count the carbohydrates in their food and enter that information into their insulin pump.\n\nBut it will control blood sugar levels, giving more insulin when needed and pulling back when there\u2019s enough.\n\n\u201cThis system can give a more normal way of life,\u201d said study co-author Boris Kovatchev, director of the University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology. Kovatchev led the team that developed the system.\n\nOnly one artificial pancreas system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the Medtronic 670G. This study didn\u2019t compare the two systems, but the authors said there are important differences in the algorithms controlling each device.\n\nThe latest study used Control-IQ artificial pancreas system. It uses an insulin pump made by Tandem Diabetes and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) from Dexcom.\n\nFor the study, 168 people with type 1 diabetes were randomly chosen to wear either the new artificial pancreas system or an insulin pump and glucose monitor alone. The patients were between the ages of 14 and 71.\n\nThe study lasted six months. Both Brown and Kovatchev said they didn\u2019t ask participants to change their diet or other lifestyle factors.\n\nThe average daily time in-range (a blood sugar between 70 and 180 milligrams per deciliter) averaged 61 percent at the start of the study for those using the Control-IQ. During the trial, that rose to 71 percent. That meant participants had good blood sugar control for an additional 2.6 hours a day.\n\nThe group who just used an insulin pump and CGM had no change in their in-range time.\n\nThere were no severe low blood sugar events. One person in the Control-IQ group had a complication called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), because the site where the insulin pump tubing goes into the skin was blocked and insulin couldn\u2019t get through, Brown explained.\n\nDr. Mary Pat Gallagher is director of the Pediatric Diabetes Center at Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital at NYU Langone in New York City. She said the newest device is more user-friendly than the 670G and the algorithms are significantly different.\n\n\u201cEach design that is approved by the FDA will be slightly better than the one before,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cThey\u2019re building on the successes that came earlier.\u201d\n\nDaniel Finan, a research director with JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), said that what\u2019s most important for people with type 1 diabetes is choice. \u201cThis study is a meaningful step forward, and there are more good innovations on the horizon,\u201d he said.\n\nFinan noted it was significant that no one dropped out of the study. \u201cThis system was designed with usability in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t reap the benefits if you don\u2019t want to wear the device.\u201d\n\nTandem Diabetes has filed paperwork with the FDA for approval of the Control-IQ device.\n\nThe study was published online Oct. 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine. It was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about the artificial pancreas system from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
