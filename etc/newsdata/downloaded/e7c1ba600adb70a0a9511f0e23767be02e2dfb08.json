Because stretched right across the road in front of me, blocking any traffic, is a huge yellow banner embossed with the slogan: \u2018We\u2019re F*****\u2019.\n\nI had imagined this might be a short-lived stunt when I first saw it yesterday lunchtime. Naively, perhaps, I assumed there might be some sort of by-law prohibiting the defacing of our greatest national landmarks with profanities.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists are seen at their make-shift camp outside Westminster Abbey\n\nYet come 6pm it was still there, surrounded by a tented village on the junction of Victoria Street and Tothill Street. The police seemed to have no inclination to remove it.\n\nAnd the protesters who proudly put it there simply cannot fathom why this might not be the best way of winning over the wider world to their apocalyptic cult of self-denial. \u2018Tough situations demand tough language,\u2019 said one.\n\nThere were two sorts of people in central London yesterday. There were those who went about their business as normal, moving around via the Underground or on foot.\n\nThe other, high on unimpeachable self-righteousness, were Extinction Rebellion set on bringing the heart of the capital to a halt.\n\nBy last night, I could not find a single person who had switched camps. All agreed, however, this simply cannot last for a fortnight without some sort of showdown.\n\nLondon proved to be wearily long-suffering. We have seen this umpteen times with assorted Brexit demonstrations plus all the anti-Trump stuff in June.\n\nThis Extinction Rebellion operation is on a different scale. Targeting key landmarks and bridges over the Thames, they seem very well-organised while having no one in overall charge. To make things harder for the authorities, they are all assiduously polite to divide and overwhelm police resources while being as non-confrontational as possible.\n\nOn the Thames, human barriers erected themselves at either end of Westminster Bridge while a camp set up shop around a white van in the middle. Within hours, it was staging a makeshift wedding ceremony as two women took their vows. Who says romance is dead?\n\nAnother group attempted to disrupt Changing the Guard as the Household Cavalry made their way up the Mall. I suspect they won\u2019t be trying that sort of stunt next Monday when the whole regiment turns out to accompany the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament.\n\nIn Trafalgar Square, I found the most bizarre protest of the lot. A hearse had parked across the junction with Whitehall carrying a coffin labelled \u2018Our Future\u2019 while the driver had padlocked his neck to the headrest. Five hours later, he was still there, surrounded by police and clearly in discomfort.\n\nIn Trafalgar Square, I found the most bizarre protest of the lot. A hearse had parked across the junction with Whitehall carrying a coffin labelled \u2018Our Future\u2019, writes ROBERT HARDMAN\n\nThrough his steamed-up window, he told me he was Al, a 69-year-old Londoner who had nothing to do with the funeral industry.\n\n\u2018We are just acting as undertakers for the planet,\u2019 said his sidekick.\n\nI found Northumberland Avenue blocked by a band of students performing energetic Maypole-style dances. Nearby, a rather more elderly dance troupe \u2013 plenty of cagoules and grey beards \u2013 tried to look as if they were having fun in the drizzle, gyrating gently to a band of drummers.\n\nBy yesterday evening, tents and marquees had gone up in St James\u2019s Park alongside Buckingham Palace. In one, I came across off-duty medical staff listening attentively to a lecture on the medical impact of climate change.\n\nNormally, the police move in at the first sign of a bivouac or sleeping bag. The Royal Parks are, emphatically, not a campsite.\n\nBy yesterday evening, tents and marquees had gone up in St James\u2019s Park alongside Buckingham Palace\n\nHaving allowed all this to take root, however, the police are going to find it harder to evict this lot.\n\nLocal patience was already wearing thin. In Parliament Square, an altercation was taking place between a protester and tourist guide Fabrizio Gallozzi as he persisted in showing a party of Italians the great statue of Churchill.\n\n\u2018Why the hell are you protesting outside this great Parliament?\u2019 he asked. The demonstrator mumbled something about climate change but Mr Gallozzi replied: \u2018I don\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s. Just let people get on with their jobs.\u2019\n\nThere were upsides for Parliament, however. The anti-Brexit megaphone mob realised they had met their match so they went down the road to spend the day shouting at Tory Central Office instead.", "description": "ROBERT HARDMAN: In Trafalgar Square a hearse had parked across the junction with Whitehall carrying a coffin labelled 'Our Future' while the driver had padlocked his neck to the headrest.", "authors": ["Robert Hardman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19419202-0-image-a-108_1570492805810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
