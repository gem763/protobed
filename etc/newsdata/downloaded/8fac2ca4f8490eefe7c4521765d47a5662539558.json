But Van Laar\u2019s shift from reporting on Hill, and publishing what some have deemed \u201crevenge porn,\u201d to promoting Republicans for Hill\u2019s old job is a blurring of roles that would be unacceptable in mainstream newsrooms.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2018 election, Van Laar wrote an op-ed on why she supported Knight in his race against Hill, and in July, she praised a Republican who at the time was planning to run against Hill in 2020. \u201cHanging out with our future Congresswoman Suzette Valladares today!\u201d she wrote, along with hashtags such as \u201c#runsuzetterun\u201d and #savecalifornia.\u201d\n\nVan Laar did not respond to a Twitter direct message request to discuss her coverage. Multiple representatives from Townhall Media, which oversees RedState, did not respond to phone and email requests.\n\nHill\u2019s swift political downfall highlights the way in which allegations and images that might not meet the bar for publication in traditional newsrooms, the one-time media gatekeepers, can find a wide audience online and spark a scandal covered by mainstream reporters.\n\nHill, who is bisexual, admitted last week to having an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a female campaign staffer, but has denied having a sexual relationship with legislative director Graham Kelly, the latter of which would violate House ethics rules and became the subject of an investigation.\n\nHill\u2019s estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, accused her having a relationship with Kelly, as RedState\u2019s Miranda Morales wrote on Oct 10. Just over a week later, Van Laar reported that Hill had been in a long-term \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with her husband and the female campaign staffer, in a piece which included a photo of a naked Hill brushing the hair of a woman whose face is intentionally blurred.\n\nThe photo, which spread online and on social media, dramatically increased pressure on Hill, who said she decided to resign so that \u201cthe good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.\u201d\n\nWhile many Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, endorsed her decision to leave Congress on the grounds of having had a relationship with a campaign staffer, some others depicted her as a victim of cyber-bullying by RedState and her estranged husband.\n\nBrianna Wu, a video game developer who lost a bid for Congress in 2018 and is running again in 2020, tweeted Monday that conservative outlets that published private photos of Hill \u201cenabled her ex-husband's abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cHill was exploited by her abusive ex-husband who used nude photos of her to smear her,\u201d Wu added. \u201cNo one would argue that it's proper to have a consensual relationship w/ a subordinate. That doesn't change the fact that Hill is a victim of revenge porn.\u201d\n\nThe conservative outlets that published enabled her ex-husband's abuse.\n\n\n\nWhat he did should be illegal and punishable as a criminal offense at the federal level. Right now it's not. \u2014 Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) October 28, 2019\n\nLawfare managing editor Quinta Jurecic wrote that the Hill photograph on RedState appeared to be \u201cthe first instance in which a politically aligned publication \u2014 or, indeed, any publication \u2014 has released nonconsensual pornography depicting a politician of the opposing party affiliation.\u201d And that, she wrote, \u201cis an ugly line to have crossed.\u201d\n\nIn her RedState piece that included the photograph, Van Laar justified sharing this \u201cinformation obtained from multiple confidential sources\u201d because Hill was now a member of Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is this writer\u2019s view that events that occur within a marriage or affairs that lead to its demise should be kept between the parties involved and are not the business of the general public,\u201d Van Laar wrote. \u201cWhen those events or affairs occur within one of the parties\u2019 workplace, though, and that workplace is the United States Congress, the public should know about them as they determine that elected official\u2019s fitness to serve.\u201d\n\nVan Laar noted that RedState didn\u2019t publish other \u201cintimate photographs of the women.\u201d\n\nThe Oct. 18 piece also included text messages posted on Heslep\u2019s now-deleted Facebook account in which he is purportedly speaking to a friend about Hill having a relationship with Kelly, the former finance director who worked as Hill\u2019s legislative director in Congress.\n\nHill denied having an improper relationship with Kelly to POLITICO on Oct. 22 and said her \u201cabusive husband seems determined to try to humiliate me.\u201d\n\n\"I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain,\u201d she said. \u201cThis coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed.\u201d\n\nHill said she notified the Capitol Police to investigate how \u201cintimate photos of me and another individual were published by Republican operatives on the internet without my consent.\" Hill later threatened legal action against The Daily Mail, which published the same photo of Hill and the staffer, albeit without the woman\u2019s face blurred, along with others, including one in which Hill is nude and holding a bong.\n\nThe Daily Mail also suggested Hill had a tattoo representing Nazi imagery, a claim her lawyers described as \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 24, RedState\u2019s Joe Cunningham accused news outlets of either ignoring his site\u2019s reporting or spinning coverage in defense of Hill.\n\n\u201cIt is because of that hostility to places like RedState, where we do not hide our partisan lean, that actual, real journalism can so often get ignored or butchered,\u201d Cunningham wrote. \u201cIt is journalistic malpractice to pretend that the story Jen broke is anything other than how she has covered it.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO first reported Sunday night that Hill planned to resign, which she later announced in a letter, saying it was \u201cthe best thing for my constituents, my community and our country.\u201d\n\nPelosi responded with a statement saying, \u201cCongresswoman Katie Hill came to Congress with a powerful commitment to her community and a bright vision for the future, and has made a great contribution as a leader of the Freshman Class.\u201d\n\n\"She has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable,\" Pelosi continued. \"We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8e/f0/aeda0a9548e4ac5e1b354eec5cac/20191027-katie-hill-campaign-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
