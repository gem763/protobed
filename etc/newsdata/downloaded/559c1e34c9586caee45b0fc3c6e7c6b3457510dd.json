As CTU president Jesse Sharkey and vice president Stacy Davis Gates returned to Malcolm X College to continue contract talks, Mayor Lori Lightfoot visited a West Side youth development group\u2019s basketball program \u2014 and students took a break from shooting hoops to ask when their schools will reopen. \u201cI think if we really work hard at it, we could get a deal done this weekend,\u201d Lightfoot told them. But speaking to reporters afterward, the mayor said she would be \u201cvery surprised if classes are going to be open on Monday.\u201d\n\nClasses were cancelled for the 361,000 K-12 students who attend CPS on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe CTU, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers, is seeking more pay for its 25,000 teachers and has several other demands, including more support staff. An additional 10,000 CPS support staff workers, who are members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) are also on strike.\n\nBut, as Breitbart News reported in August, performance of CPS students has been well before the national average for years.\n\nMailee Smith, staff attorney and director of labor policy for the Illinois Policy Institute, said on Saturday that raw politics may play a role in the CTU\u2019s decision to strike.\n\n\u201cChicago Teachers Union backed Toni Preckwinkle for mayor of Chicago, donating nearly $300,000 to her campaign. But Lori Lightfoot won\u2013and now CTU is on strike for the third time in seven years despite her generous offer,\u201d Smith wrote.\n\nChicago Teachers Union and its political action committee donated over $291,000 in 2019 to mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle, according to Illinois State Board of Elections records. Of that amount, over $164,000 came from CTU itself, and not from funds its members donated specifically for political activity. The union gave nothing to candidate Lori Lightfoot. But CTU\u2019s candidate lost, and now it won\u2019t take a generous deal offered by Mayor Lightfoot. Instead, it walked out on students to press not just for legitimate contract issues such as higher compensation, but also for city action on unrelated issues such as affordable housing for students.\n\nBoth the leadership and rank and file members of the CTU have embraced far left socialist policies for decades.\n\nIn July, a CTU delegation traveled to Venezuela to support the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nCTU has also been closely tied to the #RedforEd teachers union movement, whose \u201cstated goals\u2013higher teacher pay and better education conditions\u2013are overshadowed by a more malevolent political agenda: a leftist Democrat uprising designed to flip purple or red states to blue, using the might of a significant part of the education system as its lever,\u201d as Breitbart News reported in February.", "description": "The strike by the Chicago Teachers continued into its third day as negotiations with Chicago Public Schools failed to reach a resolution.", "authors": ["Michael Patrick Leahy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Chicago-Teachers-Strike-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
