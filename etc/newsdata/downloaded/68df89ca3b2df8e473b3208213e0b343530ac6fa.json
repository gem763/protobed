We will not be endangering the lives of other Australians. It's that simple,\" said Foreign Minister Linda Reynolds.\n\nEstablishing the right to return\n\nIf diplomatic officials do succeed in establishing contact, the next stage is to establish the legal parenthood and nationality of the child.\n\nBut this can be complicated if\n\nthe parents' identity documents no longer exist\n\nthe child was born to parents from two different nationalities\n\nthe child is an orphan with no adult established as a legal guardian\n\nthere is no access to DNA testing facilities to establish parenthood\n\nIn the UK, the government says it can be extremely difficult to establish the nationality of children.\n\nThe Home Office told the BBC: \"We look at all evidence to determine nationality and will examine every single case where we are asked for consular assistance, but this process is far from straightforward.\"\n\nIn a report in July, King's College's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation said only four children had returned to the UK, but also pointed out that this figure might not accurately represent the true number.\n\nIn February, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, told parliament he had sympathy for innocent children caught up in a war zone.\n\nBut he added: \"If we were to do more to try to rescue these children, we have to think about what risk that places on future children in the UK and the risk that they may be taken out to war zones by their parents.\"\n\nIn the case of Shamima Begum, who was deprived of UK citizenship to prevent her return, the government indicated that her child born earlier this year would remain British.\n\nBut the child died in a Syrian refugee camp when he was less than three weeks old.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAfterwards, the UK government said it would have been too dangerous to send officials into the camp where Shamima Begum was detained to bring the child out.\n\nRepatriation to other countries\n\nA number of children from various countries have been repatriated this year.\n\nRussia has brought back between 145 and 200 on organised flights.\n\nSeveral central Asian states have also taken back children.\n\nIn May, Kazakhstan organised the return of more than 230 of its citizens - most of them children - from camps in Syria.\n\nAustria agreed to take back two orphaned children recently following DNA tests and a court ruling on who would take custody of the children once they returned.\n\nGermany has also taken back children, as have France, Belgium, Sweden and Norway.\n\nThese cases usually require much co-ordination involving the Kurdish-led forces controlling the camps, as well as others who might be needed to facilitate the logistics, such as the Iraqi government, the Red Cross and other international agencies.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "Returning foreign children from detention camps in Syria involves legal and political obstacles.", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qyvgz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
