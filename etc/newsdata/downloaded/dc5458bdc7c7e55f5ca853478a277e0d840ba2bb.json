It\u2019s constant management,\u201d Harry told ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby about his mental health during the special which gives a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse of the royal couple\u2019s recent tour of southern Africa. \u201cI thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back and I suddenly realized, \u2018Actually this is something that I have to manage.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTowards the end of the royal tour, which saw the Duke and Duchess of Sussex visit South Africa with 5-month-old son Archie (Harry also traveled solo to Angola, Botswana and Malawi), it was revealed that Meghan had launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter she sent to her father.\n\n\u201cLook, part of this job and part of any job, like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff. But again, for me and for my wife, of course, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that hurts \u2014 especially when the majority of it is untrue,\u201d Harry said of the media scrutiny as of late.\n\n\u201cBut all we need to do is focus on being real, focus on being the people we are and standing up for what we believe in. I will not be bullied into carrying a game that killed my mum,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED: Inside Prince Harry\u2019s Fight to Defend Meghan Markle: \u2018He Wants to Protect His Nest\u2019\n\nITV More\n\nHarry is also suing News UK (owner of The Sun newspaper) and MGN (former owner of The Mirror) over alleged illegal interception of voicemail messages.\n\nIn a rare statement, Harry criticized the British tabloid press for the \u201cruthless\u201d treatment of Markle \u201cover the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son\u201d.\n\nThe royal added that the couple has \u201ccontinued to put on a brave face \u2013 as so many of you can relate to \u2013 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.\u201d\n\nIn An African Journey \u2014 which airs in the U.S. on ABC on October 23 at 10:00 p.m. ET \u2014 Meghan also made reference to the toll that negative tabloid coverage has taken on her.\n\n\u201cAny woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging. And then when you have a newborn, you know. And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo, you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed. It\u2019s um\u2026yeah. I guess, also thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I\u2019m okay, but it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Meghan Markle Gives Archie a Kiss in Intimate Never-Before-Seen Footage from New Documentary\n\nBradby asked if it \u201cwould be fair\u201d to say that she\u2019s \u201cnot really okay, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle?\u201d to which Meghan responded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Meghan who has been affected by media attention, either. In a touchingly honest moment, Harry \u2014 who has lived with the British tabloids since birth \u2014 opened up about the pressures of his royal role and how the memory of his mother Princess Diana was at the forefront of his mind throughout the Africa tour.\n\n\u201cI think being part of this family \u2014 in this role, in this job \u2014 every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\u201d said Harry, adding that it is a \u201cwound that festers.\u201d.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

But everything that I do reminds me of her,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut as I said \u2014 with the role, with the job and sort of the pressures that come with that \u2014 I get reminded of the bad stuff.\u201d", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Speak Out in Africa Documentary", "authors": ["Phil Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7mL_U4oOhfsIvikzkNuIEA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/9b14f93ef4fd648644afd8dc0b2fa153", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
