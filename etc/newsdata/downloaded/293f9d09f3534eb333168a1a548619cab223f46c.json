A new law, known as the Benn Act, requires the prime minister to request an extension from EU leaders if he has failed to secure a deal by the next European Council meeting on October 17 and 18.\n\nAsked about how the U.K. government would bypass the law, Cleverly said: \"I'm not going to tell you ... what we've seen is parties distorting the parliamentary process, breaking conventions, taking a very creative interpretation of parliamentary procedures, to prevent the government discharging a promise the prime minister made \u2014 and indeed the promise that all parties made at the referendum. And I'm not going to help them by showing them our homework.\"\n\nReferring to the Benn Act, Cleverly warned: \"Legislation passed in a rush tends to be bad legislation.\"\n\nBut his strongest comments were over concerns of civil unrest if Brexit does not happen on October 31. Asked if he shares those concerns, Cleverly said: \u201cYes I do.\u201d He added: \u201cCivil unrest could happen. I\u2019m not saying it will \u2014 or that it\u2019s even likely \u2014 but it is possible.\u201d\n\nCleverly said a failure to deliver Brexit would \u201cundermine the confidence that people have in our democracy.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cThe British people \u2014 millions of them \u2014 said to us in 2016 that the current relationship with the EU is not working, and also by extension they were saying our kind of relationship with politics isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cWe either listen to that and show people \u2014 the millions of people who voted \u2014 that if you want to initiate change, the best and most appropriate and most effective way of doing so is in the ballot box.\n\n\u201cAnd if the message we are sending to them is the ballot box is not the best possible way to initiate change, it might be \u2014 I\u2019m not saying definitely or possibly \u2014 that they will look at other ways of initiating change.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, an unnamed Cabinet minister told the Times a failure to deliver Brexit could lead to a \u201cviolent popular uprising\u201d like the Yellow Vest movement in France or the L.A. riots in 1992.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible in this country just because it has not happened before,\u201d the minister told the paper. \u201cNow they have a model \u2014 gilets jaunes \u2014 they have encrypted phones to coordinate it, and it only takes a couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take the U.K. out of the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d on October 31 \u2014 but opposition MPs voted through a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit on that date.", "description": "The danger is the people \u2018will look at other ways of initiating change\u2019 than the ballot box, says James Cleverly.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Annabelle Dickson", "Jack Blanchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1172035253-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
