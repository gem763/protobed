Tim Scott. | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress Republican senators accuse whistleblower of 'hearsay'\n\nSenate Republicans are questioning the credibility of the whistleblower who filed a complaint that triggered an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, parroting the rhetoric of the White House and Trump's allies in the media.\n\nTheir questions about the whistleblower's credibility are the latest line of defense against the bombshell report, which detailed concerns over Trump asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his family during a phone call. The president himself attacked the whistleblower in a closed-door meeting Thursday, calling him \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and suggesting he committed treason, according to the Washington Post.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe whistleblower wrote in the complaint that his concerns were based on conversations with more than half a dozen U.S. officials. The whistleblower further alleged that senior White House officials tried to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call to keep quiet the nature of the president's conversation.\n\nBut Republicans have argued that because the whistleblower was not personally on the call, he lacks credibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually clear. He\u2019s not really a whistleblower, so it\u2019s really more hearsay,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Friday. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about someone who actually is not a whistleblower, someone who\u2019s only heard it [through] hearsay, then that brings everything into question.\u201d\n\nHe added that the \u201cconcept of someone who heard it secondhand does not make them a credible person on the topic.\u201d\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), too, described the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as \u201chearsay\u201d and argued he \u201cdoes not fulfill\u201d the definition of a whistleblower.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. \u201cIt's somebody who talked to somebody else who said they were there and this is what happened. So I think that undermines it.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators have grappled this week with how to address the substance of the whistleblower's complaint, which was released Thursday morning, and a White House-released summary of Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president that confirmed he did indeed ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent. According to the report and the summary, Trump asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son.\n\nOnly a handful of Republicans expressed concern about the summary's content, among them Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah).\n\nMost others in the GOP argued there was no \"quid pro quo\" on the call \u2014 even though Trump's prodding about an investigation came in the form of a \"favor\" request and immediately followed conversation about U.S. military aid to Ukraine \u2014 and suggested that the controversy would ultimately be more damaging for the Biden family. Several Republicans said Thursday that they hadn't read the complaint as they left the Capitol for a two-week recess.\n\nSome senators were more diplomatic about the whistleblower's credibility. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a longtime advocate for whistleblowers, said that until a lawyer tells him otherwise, he\u2019ll believe the author of the complaint meets the definition of a whistleblower. But he also described the information in the complaint as \u201csecond and third-hand\u201d and said he needed more corroboration before coming to a conclusion about the complaint's allegations.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has refrained from discussing whether the content of the president\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president is impeachable, did come to the defense of whistleblowers in light of Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\n\u201cThat is a gross mischaracterization of whistleblowers,\u201d said Collins, who Democrats believe they can beat next year. \u201cWhistleblowers have been essential in bringing to the public\u2019s attention wrongdoings, fraud, waste, abuse, law breaking, and I very much disagree with the president\u2019s mischaracterization.\u201d\n\nShe added that while federal law grants the whistleblower protection from workplace retaliation, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make the president\u2019s comments acceptable in any way.\u201d\n\nThus far, little is known about the actual identity of the whistleblower. Citing unnamed sources, The New York Times reported Thursday that the whistleblower is a CIA officer but did not further identify him. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire and intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday in a closed-door session, after which Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the committee's chairman, said more information was needed.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the president's closest allies on Capitol Hill, said this week that the question is no longer about the whistleblower but about the people who spoke to him.\n\n\u201cI want to know who is the person who went to the whistleblower,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWho is the person who went to the whistleblower? Why did they pick that person and what did they talk about? Because this is a fairly sophisticated effort to write a narrative rather than blow a whistle.\u201d", "description": "Republicans have argued that because the whistleblower was not personally on the call, he lacks credibility.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine", "Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/22/5a/91cb9de94b22b4a32abde7f3f4b4/190111-tim-scott-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
