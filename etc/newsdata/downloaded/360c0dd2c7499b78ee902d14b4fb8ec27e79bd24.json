This is stupid. I don\u2019t care who you are, you don\u2019t text during a play or a movie. It\u2019s disrespectful and you condoning it is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nOthers who were in the audience confirmed that the Diamonds singer used her phone during the performance.\n\nThe 30-year-old has since defended himself and the singer, explaining that he is \u201cnot interested in policing\u201d how someone watches theatre.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in policing anyone\u2019s relationship to watching a play ESPECIALLY someone who isn\u2019t part of the regular theatre-going crowd,\u201d Harris wrote, adding that he is \u201cfamously ambivalent about phone use in theatre\u201d.\n\nThe playwright also explained his decision to delay the play until Rihanna arrived, writing: \u201cTo dead this weird discourse that has popped up\u2026 The patron saint of the play I wrote is literally a pop star, fashion icon, and Demi-goddess named Rihanna. Her words are all over it. She\u2019s a ninth character in the play.\n\n\u201cWhen Dionysus is coming you hold the curtain.\u201d\n\nHarris summed up his thoughts on theatre protocol by explaining on Twitter that there is \u201cno right or wrong way to watch the theatre\u201d.", "description": "Rihanna is facing criticism for texting during a Broadway play, after the playwright revealed the singer had messaged him during the show.\u00a0 Over the weekend, Rihanna went to see a performance of Slave Play in New York City, where she later posed with the cast.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/15/gettyimages-967995556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
