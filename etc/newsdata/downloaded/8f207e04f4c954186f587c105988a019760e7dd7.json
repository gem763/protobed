The aim is to create better racing.\n\nThe use of standardised parts to cut costs and other measures to reduce the competitive gap between teams have also been discussed, but there are concerns that the rules are too restrictive.\n\nSome fear cars could be significantly slower than at present and look identical.\n\n\u201cWe need to have the ability to differentiate one car from the other otherwise they\u2019re all going to look the same and go seven seconds a lap slower,\u201d Racing Point team principal Otmar Szafnauer told reporters in Singapore last month.\n\nThe governing FIA and commercial rights holders Liberty Media can force the changes through if an agreement is not reached. But Ferrari also have a veto, a special privilege granted to the team due to their historic status.\n\nBinotto has said more than once that he would rather not resort to using it.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a good and open discussion with the stakeholders at the moment and I\u2019m as well somehow hopeful that we can find the right compromise at the end,\u201d he said.", "description": "Formula One teams will seek to overcome their divisions at a meeting in Paris on Wednesday that represents a last chance to find agreement on a 2021 rules overhaul before an end-October deadline.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440783059&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1CV", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
