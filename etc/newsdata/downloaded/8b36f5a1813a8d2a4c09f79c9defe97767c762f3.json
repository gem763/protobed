I am worried about a customer getting our food and if it is cold or they get sick I am not sure who is responsible,' Mr Soh said.\n\nDoorDash Australia general manager Thomas Stephens said restaurants will be removed from listings upon request.\n\nFoddies Cafe owners found out their popular cafe (pictured) was signed up to the app after receiving a call to say a driver was on their way to pick up an order\n\nA Doordash spokesman told Daily Mail Australia: 'The listing is at no cost to the restaurant as Dashers on our platform have a card that they use to pay for these orders like any other customer would.\n\n'Should a restaurant not want to be included in this service, we will remove them from our listings immediately upon being notified.'\n\nCurrently only serving Melbourne, the company's website states the service is 'coming soon' to Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nFounded in 2013, DoorDash operates in 4,000 cities across America, where the business is valued at around $US12.6 billion.\n\nIt has 700,000 drivers and 310,000 restaurants on its books in the US.", "description": "Australia's newest\u00a0food delivery service DoorDash has already sparked fury from Melbourne restaurant owners within weeks of being launched.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19397590-0-image-a-39_1570455394097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
