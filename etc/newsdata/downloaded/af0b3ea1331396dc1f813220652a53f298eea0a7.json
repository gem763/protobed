Every time there's been a bit of bad Brexit news, the skittish sterling drops. The currency has been at three-decade lows in the past month alone.\n\nThat's good news for Britain's listed behemoths, because collectively they make about 70 per cent of their profit in US dollars \u2013 so a falling pound means the sterling value of those profits goes up.\n\nFor some companies, of course, a falling pound means their supply chain imports become more expensive. But for others, their exports become more competitive. The profit factor seems to be key.\n\nSince August, though, the inverse correlation has largely evaporated. The currency and stockmarket are moving in the same direction. It's not the first time this has happened, and what it signals is that investors are seeing signs of global stress all over the place.\n\nYou can also tell that from Britain's incredible bond market rally. The yield on Britain's 10-year government bond was just 0.44 per cent on Friday, and heading back down towards the record intraday low of 0.34 per cent posted last month.\n\nThe gloom that has settled over London markets has yet another side to it, too: it's not just that share prices are dropping \u2013 the amount of stock out there is ebbing.\n\nOnly 25 companies have floated on the London Stock Exchange so far this year, compared with 55 in 2018. More companies have delisted than listed. The net supply of equity is down 3 per cent this year as companies use cheap debt to buy back stock. That saps liquidity, so trading volumes are lower than in other major European markets.\n\nThese are not cheerful times.", "description": "All year, the FTSE 100 has remained impervious to Brexit, even as sterling twists on a dime.
