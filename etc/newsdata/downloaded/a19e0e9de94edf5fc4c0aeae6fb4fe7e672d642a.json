Rask stopped 34 shots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great two points and feels real good right now,\u201d Lightning defenseman Ryan McDonagh said. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty top end unit that we played tonight and they made us pay.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay has won three of four and back-to-back games for the first time this season. The Lightning also notched their 12th win in 64 tries in Boston, improving to 12-46-6.\n\nBruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy was on the ice for all three Lightning regulation goals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take one point and reflect on it,\u201d he said.\n\nShattenkirk gave Tampa Bay a 3-2 lead with 4:47 remaining in regulation. The Bruins\u2018 Pastrnak scored 1:42 later, tying the game at 3-3.\n\n\u201cGood things happen when you shoot and I had a good screen there,\u201d Shattenkirk said. \u201cTheir power play is lethal and they won that battle tonight, but we felt we were outplaying them.\u201d\n\nPastrnak has 13 points, including eight goals and five assists, in the last five games.\n\n\u201cThey were fast tonight and were in our face every time we had the puck,\u201d Bruins defenseman Torey Krug said. \u201cThey are a great team, have the majority of the lineup they had last year and they know how to win.\u201d\n\nPoint tied the game at 1 with 1.6 seconds remaining in the first when he converted a feed from Yanni Gourde and flipped the puck past Rask.\n\n\u201cIt was a great pass by Gourde,\u201d Point said. \u201cWe played a complete game tonight and competed the way we needed to.\u201d\n\nBoston\u2019s top line of Pastrnak, Bergeron and Brad Marchand has accounted for 14 of the Bruins\u2018 19 goals this season.\n\nNOTES: Boston F David Krejci was out of the lineup for Boston with an upper-body injury. \u2026 Lightning forward Cedric Paquette began skating but missed his seventh straight game. \u2026 Pastrnak scored five consecutive goals for the Bruins spanning two games. \u2026 Marchand and Torey Krug chipped in with two assists for Boston.
