By contrast, in the United States, no S &P 500 companies have all-male boards.\n\nMr Armour said there was no easy explanation for the fall in female director appointments. Anecdotally, given the economic challenges such as low growth and the trade war between the US and China, many companies are looking to recruit former chief executives to their boards. The strategy naturally works against women, few of whom have CEO experience.\n\nMr Armour said the headwinds facing corporate Australia might also have led to directors falling back on past habits or looking for the safe option when appointing colleagues, which was more likely to result in plumping for individuals in their networks \u2013 often males.\n\n\"Companies need to have a conversation about what their gender diversity target is. They need to be diligent about making sure biases have been identified and use recruitment firms to identify diverse candidates. It's about getting outside their network,\" Mr Armour said.\n\nThe AICD chief said he was particularly concerned at the board make-up of the 107 companies that joined the ASX last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What concerns me most is that companies are saying they are progressive and growing and extending their reach to the broader community, but if you look at how the board is composed, it is not aligned to that message,\" Mr Armour said.\n\nYasser El-Ansary, chief executive of the Australian Investment Council, which represents private equity investors, agreed the industry needed to work harder to improve diversity. Private equity firms were behind many of the companies that floated on the ASX last year.\n\nMr El-Ansary argued many of the newly listed companies were small and directors were often consumed by the need to raise capital and bring products to the market and lacked the resources to focus on bigger issues such as board diversity.\n\nHowever, he said that private equity and venture capital investors understood the economic benefits of diversity. Investors were already enforcing some change on the make-up of companies in their portfolios, Mr El-Ansary said, but warned it was a \"slow burn\" issue. The Australian Investment Council was collaborating with Women on Boards in an attempt to drive greater gender diversity, he said.", "description": "Fewer than 5 per cent of companies that listed on the stock exchange last year had a female chairman, while only 17 per cent of directors on those newly floated businesses were women.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2983%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_261%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4a0f1fb9852922f33edbf8a0b9bb5961a7e88667", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
