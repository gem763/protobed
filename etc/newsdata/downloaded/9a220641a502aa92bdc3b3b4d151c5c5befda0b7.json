Attacking Mr. Biden might not serve either goal. In the debate, Ms. Warren spent far more time highlighting her upbringing in a working-class Oklahoma family than engaging on any level with Mr. Biden. She must also still navigate the enduring presence of Mr. Sanders on the left.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden may have more immediate challenges. On Thursday night, he repeatedly expressed himself imprecisely \u2014 saying at one point that no nonviolent criminals should be in jail, when he meant to refer only to nonviolent drug offenders. He also referred to himself as the vice president of the United States, without appending the modifier \u201cformer.\u201d\u2026\n\nIn Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, there is a persistent sense that his rivals and the news media are underestimating him and giving him too little credit for the blocs of support he has already claimed. Whatever the flaws in Mr. Biden\u2019s performance in Houston, there was no exchange in which an opponent obviously routed him, as Senator Kamala Harris of California did in the first debate and Mr. Booker did in the second.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Joe-Biden-Elizabeth-Warren-Debate.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
