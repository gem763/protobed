It may be you are never released. You will be in prison until there is any hope of you not being a danger to young girls.\u2019\n\nBrexit: The final countdown as Boris Johnson races against clock for a deal\n\nYou are guilty of a horrible catalogue of offences. What you did was betray the trust of a family and what you did harmed these children.\n\n\u2018You present a risk to the public and are likely to continue to do so even after work is done with you.\u2019\n\nDuring their investigation police found 34 indecent images of children and they also discovered he had preyed on two girls between 2006 and 2018 on children aged four and six.\n\nSolicitor advocate Douglas Thomson, defending, said: \u2018He now recognises there was manipulation of the children and his actions will have consequences for them for many years to come.\n\n\u2018When he is released into the community, if ever, he will be monitored and subject to the most stringent conditions.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
