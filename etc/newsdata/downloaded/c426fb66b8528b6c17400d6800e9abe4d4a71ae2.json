Looks like a lego helmet!\"\n\n\"Anton\u2019s hair is so dark, it makes Darth Vader look albino! Jesus wept,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"I can only assume Anton's stylist was called away to some sort of emergency....that hair dye is about 2 hours over developed\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnton admitted he had not had much opportunity to practise with his celeb partner this week because of her commitments for EastEnders.\n\nHe explained that Emma had been shooting scenes on Monday and Tuesday so they only got into the training room on Wednesday.\n\nThis could prove problematic for their Paso Doble at the weekend, but Anton is confident it suits Emma's strengths.\n\nHe said: \"She\u2019s doing really well. Constantly working on EastEnders. A busy schedule there. Doing two massive jobs.\n\n\"This week has been a struggle. She was filming Monday and Tuesday. We only got into he studio on Wednesday. Before you know it it's going to be Saturday. She\u2019s such a hard worker.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Kieron McCarron)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nAnton also admitted he was glad to be progressing a lot further than usual in the competition.\n\nHe said: \"It's a different story for me. We're doing great dances. I can put away the humorous side now and do something else.\n\n\"As a choreographer, dancer a perfomer. It gives me a new feel which is lovely.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The Strictly Come Dancing professional caused a stir on social media while discussing Emma Barton's progress", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Bbc Kieron Mccarron", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641236.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_This-Morning-Anton-Du-Beke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
