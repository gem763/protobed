This was six years after she tried to claim compensation without success,\" she said.\n\nMkhwebane also mentioned her findings against former embattled ministers Malusi Gigaba, Des van Rooyen, and Lynne Brown.\n\nShe also recalled her findings against Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula regarding his controversial Dubai holiday, paid for by a company which was doing business with SASCOC while he was Minister of Sport.\n\n\"I have also made adverse findings against the City of Tshwane, which is under the control of the Democratic Alliance, especially the former Executive Mayor, Solly Msimanga's irregular appointing of executives.\n\n\"I have investigated governments that are under the control of other political parties. For instance, on two occasions, I made adverse findings against the former Premier of the Western Cape, Helen Zille,\" she said.\n\nMkhwebane said her office has thus far succeeded in strengthening constitutional democracy.", "description": "Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane claimed the good work done by her office is being overshadowed by media focusing more on matters involving the so-called high profile people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7930/6cd9bdf140aa4494be13f6d8ef6f24fa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
