(Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nThe U.S. military will place additional air defense systems in Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said Thursday, in the Trump administration\u2019s first known military response to what it says was a brazen Iranian assault on the kingdom\u2019s oil industry.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper\u2019s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration\u2019s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions.\n\nThe administration has maintained that Iran launched a complex attack, involving multiple drones and missiles, against two important Saudi oil sites on Sept. 14. Officials say they have compiled a convincing intelligence dossier on the assault but have not released details.\n\nIran has repeatedly denied involvement, pointing instead to a claim of responsibility by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have fired thousands of missiles and artillery pieces in their war with neighboring Saudi Arabia.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would \u201caugment the kingdom\u2019s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHoffman said Esper also put additional U.S. forces on a \u201cprepare to deploy\u201d status, meaning that two more Patriot batteries, along with a different missile defense system called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), could be sent in short order.\n\nThomas Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, characterized the move as more symbolic than militarily significant.\n\n\u201cThis kind of deployment is a political statement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt communicates that we\u2019re there with our partners.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon declined to address whether it was considering additional steps, such as extending the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying ships or dispatching additional surveillance aircraft to the region.\n\nOverall, the United States has more than 60,000 U.S. troops deployed across the Middle East and South Asia in what it calls the U.S. Central Command region.\n\nThe attack on facilities belonging to Saudi oil firm Aramco, which U.S. officials saw as particularly provocative given the kingdom\u2019s role in global oil supply, was the latest in a long series of moves heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.\n\nPresident Trump has described Iran as a significant U.S. rival, pulled out of the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor and authorized a campaign of sanctions that has constricted the Iranian economy.\n\nBut especially since the departure of national security adviser John Bolton, a well-known Iran hawk, Trump\u2019s has pointed to his desire to avoid war with Iran, a conflict that military leaders have warned would be unpredictable and potentially bloody.\n\nThe deployment will add to Saudi Arabia\u2019s existing suite of Patriots, which U.S. officials say number at around two dozen.\n\nThose systems can attempt to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles but have a fixed radar scope and have been mostly oriented south toward Yemen rather than east toward Iran, Karako said. The Sentinel radar systems, meanwhile, have a 360-degree radar capability, allowing them to detect attacks from multiple directions.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump hinted the United States may be taking other, potentially covert, steps against Iran.\n\n\u201cLet me just put it this way, a lot of things are happening with respect to Iran, a lot more than you would know, a lot more than the media knows,\u201d he said, speaking during a visit to New York for the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nEarlier this summer, the United States conducted a cyber attack against Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps following an incident in which Iranian forces downed an American drone.\n\nAlso speaking in New York, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters on Thursday that Iran had nothing to do with the missile attack on Aramco facilities in Saudi Arabia and demanded proof of the country\u2019s alleged involvement.\n\n\u201cI ask, where is your evidence?\u201d he said, through an interpreter. In an implicit rebuke to the United States, he also called for those who have supplied weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are jointly battling the Houthis in Yemen, to halt the arms sales and press for a peace settlement. The Gulf countries\u2019 coalition has come under widespread criticism for repeatedly striking civilian sites in Yemen.\n\nRouhani repeated his demand that the United States lift sanctions before Iran would agree to negotiations. \u201cIf the time comes when they are taken off the table, of course the possibility exists to talk to America,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Iranian president said Iran would be open to taking steps \u201cabove and beyond\u201d the 2015 nuclear talks Trump abandoned, but only if the United States returns to its commitments under the deal. But he said Iran would not discuss ending its missile activity until the United States and Europe stop arms sales to the region.\n\nThe administration has also sought assistance from other countries, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, to counter what they depict as increasingly dangerous Iranian actions. In the wake of the drone incident in June, the United States launched a partnered operation to enhance vigilance against Iranian attacks at sea.\n\nIn his statement, Hoffman placed the onus on U.S. allies to \u201ccontribute assets\u201d to Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with his British counterpart on Thursday.\n\nCarol Morello in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "The move represents the Trump administration\u2019s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions.", "authors": ["Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "Dan Lamothe", "The U.S. Military", "September At Pm", "Missy Ryan Writes About The Pentagon", "National Security For The Washington Post.
