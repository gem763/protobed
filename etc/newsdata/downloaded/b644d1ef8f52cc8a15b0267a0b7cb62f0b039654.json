Lindsey Graham on Monday predicted that President Trump will disclose more information about a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that doing so would be in the president\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cI would just urge the president \u2014 he\u2019s talking openly about the conversation \u2014 to release as much as possible,\u201d Mr. Graham told radio host Hugh Hewitt.\n\n\u201cI believe that President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call, [because] I think he did nothing wrong and he has nothing to hide,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. \u201cSo get ready for some disclosures from the president that I think will exceed every expectation.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump on Sunday appeared to confirm reports that he discussed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden with Mr. Zelensky, but said he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe phone call is reportedly part of a whistleblower complaint that House Democrats are trying to obtain to find out if Mr. Trump threatened to withhold military aid unless Mr. Zelensky agreed to look into the business interests of Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s son.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham would not say on Monday if Mr. Trump would release a transcript of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent,\u201d Ms. Grisham said on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do it, I think, but there\u2019s a lot of other people, lawyers and such, that may have a problem with it. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham said he likes Mr. Biden and his family, but that his ties to Ukraine should be investigated.\n\n\u201cIf Don Jr. got 15 cents from some foreign entity while Trump was president, it\u2019d be front-page news and we\u2019re talking about a prosecutor being dismissed in the Ukraine, bragging about it, at the same time a member of Biden\u2019s family receiving a substantial amount of money from that part of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nAs vice president in 2016, Mr. Biden had threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Ukrainian leaders dismissed a top prosecutor who had been reportedly eyeing an energy company where Hunter Biden was on the board at the time.\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Biden had bragged about the episode during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d he said then.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Sen.
