For me, that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d\n\nLater on, the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host took aim at Lara Trump, wife of Eric, spokesman of Trump Productions\u2019 not-so-suitably-titled Real News Update propaganda show, and the Trump-Pence Women\u2019s Empowerment Tour during the 2016 campaign (yes, that is not a joke).\n\n\u201cHe has the best people defending him\u2014people like his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, wife of Eric,\u201d said Kimmel, before throwing to a clip of Lara on Fox News saying of Trump\u2019s decision to abandon America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria at the behest of Turkey, \u201cI think we should start with the fact that if you asked the average American out there, I think they would have to google, \u2018Who are the Kurds?\u2019 and \u2018Why is America even over there fighting this war?\u2019\u201d\n\nKimmel seemed pretty fired up by that statement. \u201cThey\u2019d also have to google, \u2018Who is the heartless imbecile with lip injections on my TV right now?\u2019\u201d he offered. \u201cThe Kurds, Lara, are our allies, and if they get slaughtered ISIS moves in. They\u2019re really scraping the bottom of the Trump-family barrel on the news.\u201d", "description": "The late-night host was not amused by the Trump daughter-in-law\u2019s response to a Fox News query about the president leaving our Kurdish allies to the slaughter.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_162/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571199651/153712_4950_ewwrwz", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
