Yesterday, Manju Rani bagged a silver medal at the World Boxing Championships in the 48-kg category. The 19-year-old lost to Russia's Ekaterina Paltceva who was seeded second, while Rani was seeded sixth in the category. Manju is the only Indian woman to make it to the finals after six-time champion MC Mary Kom (51 kg), Jamuna Boro (54 kg), and Lovlina Borgohain (69 kgs). The total haul for the Indian contingent at the Women's World Boxing Championships was one silver and three bronze medals.\n\nManju reached the finals after beating Thailand\u2019s Chuthamat Raksat with a 4-1 score, and the Thai pugilist won the bronze medal. Manju said to a leading news site, \"I had already played her in Thailand Open semi-finals so I had the experience and knew what to expect. I managed to land a few uppercuts in the first round but she caused me trouble in the second round. I followed the strategy of the coaches in the last round and won the bout.\"\n\nPost winning her silver medal she told the Times of India, \"It was a massive learning curve for me. Since the day I joined the national camp, my life has changed completely. It was a dream to watch my idol Mary Kom. What I have learnt during this World Championships is that is that I need to work on my defence also. Even Mary Di told me after the final that sometimes defence is your biggest weapon in the ring. I want to become a complete boxer just like Mary Kom.\"\n\nManju is a self-confessed super fan of Mary and wants plenty of selfies with her: \"I have more than 100 photos with her. All the girls, including myself, just love to be around her.\" She isn\u2019t setting sight on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics just yet, saying, \"Apna time aayega (my time will come). I will aim to compete in the 2024 Olympics. I have not thought about changing my weight [to 51 kg to fit the Olympic category] I will try to get set in 48 kg first before thinking about thinking of switching. The next challenge for me is to keep consistency, just want to win as many medals for the country, and hopefully I will be able to hear the National Anthem very soon.\u201d\n\nThe 19-year-old who hails from Rithal Phogat village in Haryana\u2019s Rohtak district has battled abject poverty and personal loss. Her father, who was with the Border Security Force, passed away in 2010 because of cancer. Her win was celebrated by her mother Ishwanti Devi who distributed sweets in the village.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Yesterday, Manju Rani bagged a silver at the World Boxing Championship in the 48-kg category.
