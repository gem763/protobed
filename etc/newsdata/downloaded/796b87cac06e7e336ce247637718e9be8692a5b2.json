Wall Street went on to open in positive territory, but struggled to hold on to the advance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.09% eking out a rise of around 24 points, or 0.1%, after flipping between gains and losses while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.28% advanced 0.3%.\n\nRead: Brexit deal has been reached, EU and U.K. leaders say\n\nEuropean equities rose, while the British pound GBPUSD, -0.2017% built on recent, strong gains, only to give them up as concerns emerged over the path to completing the deal.\n\nRelated: British pound turns lower in volatile trade on concerns Parliament will spurn Johnson\u2019s Brexit pact\n\nGranted, the deal faces a tough hurdle in the U.K. Parliament as early as this weekend, but if a deal does get done, should investors outside of Britain get excited? For some economists, an agreement would certainly be a positive, at least at the margins. Brexit, after all, is woven into the fabric of interrelated global worries over strained trade relations and weakening global growth.\n\nAs Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, put it on Twitter, the initial move higher by U.S. stock-index futures is \u201cconsistent with the view that investors are looking for policy progress to offset weakening global fundamentals, and growing central bank ineffectiveness\u201d to be offset by progress on trade and fiscal policy.\n\nMove up in US #stocks future on the back of the latest #Brexit headlines is consistent with the view that #investors are looking for\n\nPolicy progress to offset weakening global fundamentals, and\n\nGrowing central bank ineffectiveness to be offset by progress on #trade and fiscal. https://t.co/oTtBHLWAF3 \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) October 17, 2019\n\nThe unexpected outcome of the June 2016 U.K. Brexit referendum certainly shook up financial markets. Losses of more than 3% for all main U.S. indexes that wiped out year-to-date gains for both the S&P 500 and the Dow on those headlines.\n\nThe battle over the terms of Brexit contributed to political chaos in the U.K. and a deterioration in relations between London and Brussels. The Brexit vote was followed in November 2016 by Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential election, rising trade tensions around the world, political upsets in Europe, and mounting fears of slowing global growth and a potential recession.\n\nWhile Thursday\u2019s action hasn\u2019t been a scratch on the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote, analysts say there are reasons for U.S. investors to take an interest in the hot-button topic, even if they lost track of where Brexit stood months ago.\n\nWith various relationships around the world going sour, the fact that the U.K. and Europe are setting aside past tensions in an effort to reach an agreement is a hopeful thing for all investors, Nordea Investment\u2019s senior macro strategist, Sebastian Galy, told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the form of a light divorce, in a way. It\u2019s a very civil relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother plus is that investors don\u2019t have to worry about U.K.-Europe acrimony adding to global issues already out there. \u201cThe problem with the U.K. economy slowing is not helpful for U.S. exports,\u201d he said as investors there don\u2019t really need any economic shocks right now.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened is there are so many negative narratives going around and they\u2019ve had a significant impact on producers in the U.S. and on consumer households who are affected by these bad stories\u2026it has had an impact on their psyche,\u201d said Galy.\n\nBut others contend that a deal, while offering some relief after three years of worries over the potential for a chaotic, ungoverned Brexit, still poses significant economic and political challenges that investors will find difficult to ignore.\n\nThe \u201creal disruption\u201d in terms of redirected capital investment and supply chains, along with increased business costs and the loss of business for the City of London, still lies ahead, Lena Komileva, chief economist at G+ Economics, told MarketWatch.\n\nIf a deal is completed, the markets will switch from trading the \u201cpolitical risk\u201d of Brexit to trading that economic and financial disruption.\n\n\u201cAt a time when global investors are worried about weaker trade flows, business investment and capital flow disruption, Brexit adds more policy uncertainty, which will take another gear off the global growth engine,\u201d she said.", "description": "Should investors outside of Britain get excited?", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "William Watts", "Markets Reporter", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT524_boris__ZG_20191017103250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
