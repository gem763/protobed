People buying burial plots now for future use also impacts on cemetery capacity,\" Ms von Helle said.\n\nConstruction of the 113-hectare cemetery is expected to commence next year and open in 2021.\n\nA second cemetery at the Wallacia Golf Course, which would have added an extra 88,000 graves, was knocked back by the NSW Independent Planning Commission in July.\n\nCatholic Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust planned to appeal the decision, Mr O'Meara said.\n\nSupply deadlock\n\nAlthough space is less of a problem in regional areas, all Australian cities are running out of places to bury the dead, according to Kate Ryan, urban planning consultant at Urbis.\n\n\"It\u2019s come to a point in time where we\u2019re critically running out of space yet we haven't been planning for it. Unlike demand for housing, which is always a big picture issue in planning, cemetery space is one of those things that we just haven\u2019t had to think about in the past,\" Ms Ryan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelbourne's east will run out of burial land in about 25 years, according to The Greater Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust chief executive Deb Ganderton.\n\n\u201cLand for burials is an urgent infrastructure need given our ageing society,\" she said.\n\n\u201cNew cemetery land needs to be set aside as part of the normal planning process as it was when our cities and towns were first developed.\"\n\nThe supply squeeze has driven the price of burial plots up, with Sydney prices doubling over the past five years.\n\nWhile two-thirds of people in NSW opt for cremation, some faiths such as Judaism and Islam require a grave burial.\n\n\u201cThe religious beliefs of Australia\u2019s diverse and expanding communities are such that society will never totally adopt cremation, so we will always need land for burials,\" Ms Ganderton said.\n\nMs Ryan said there are two solutions to the burial space deficit \u2013 develop land in regional areas or start considering alternatives to traditional cemeteries, such as 'natural' burial parks.\n\n\"I think there's scope for us to look at burial entirely differently and I think that will help with land supply in the future,\" Ms Ryan said.", "description": "Approval to build the second-largest necropolis in NSW will help address a looming crisis in the supply of graves in the state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3566%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/069723631871ec866e4a4a0c56554c7b33813596", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
