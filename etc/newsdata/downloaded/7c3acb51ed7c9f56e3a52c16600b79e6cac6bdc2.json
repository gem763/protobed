China responded with anger over the tweet, unleashing a variety of threats on the NBA. Morey was quick to apologize and players also made clear their love for China.\n\nThe message that emerged was not one of solidarity for democracy and freedom. Instead, it was clear that the league needs the emerging market of China and was willing to do anything to hang on to it.\n\nSo too does Nike, the largest brand in basketball and a major player in China\u2019s apparel and sneaker market. And in turn, James, Nike\u2019s biggest ambassador for the sport, felt the need to weigh in Monday night on Morey\u2019s tweet and the ensuing firestorm.\n\n\u201cWe all talk about freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen you\u2019re not thinking about others and only thinking about yourself,\u201d James said on Monday night in his first comments on the situation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand when he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do.\u201d\n\nHis comments were met by surprise and dismay from the protesters in Hong Kong. But perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise given how much China means to Nike.\n\nThe footwear sales alone for Nike in China are $4.26 billion, which represents 68.6 percent of the company\u2019s revenue in the country. The China has an estimated 300 million basketball players, there is only room for that number to continue to grow, which it did along with footwear revenue up that was up 22 percent compared to 2017. That $6.2 billion in 2017 revenue in China represents 40 percent of the company\u2019s growth.\n\nThree years ago, James signed an endorsement deal with Nike that will pay him $1 billion over the next three decades. There are a lot of reasons for James to bow to Nike as well as China\u2019s whims.\n\nIn later comments, James went on to say that Morey was \u201ceither misinformed or not really educated on the situation\u201d when he tweeted in support of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. The bottom line for James, however, is the bottom line of his checkbook. Nike\u2019s endorsement deal with James will pay him north of $30 million in 2019.\n\nNike stands to lose billions if China should suddenly cut ties with anything and everything American basketball. On global revenue of $34.5 billion in 2018 for Nike, $6.20 billion came from China. Much of that is attributed to the growth and popularity of the NBA in the world\u2019s largest nation.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers superstar, one of the biggest pitchmen in the business, is all in on the Chinese market and understands its importance. In years past, James has traveled to China on behalf of Nike, appearing at camps and clinics as well as engagements to promote their global brand. The Chinese market is massive for Nike and one which the sneaker and apparel company wants to not just safeguard but also expand.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nJames also has reportedly signed endorsement deals with Chinese interests in the past, such as media company Tencent that inked the NBA superstar to promote the NBA2K video game.", "description": "NBA star LeBron James takes the side of China in the league's recent flap with the Communist country.
