Previously, a \"Site Reliability Engineer - M&A\" was posted back in September of 2015, toward the end of a year in which the company made 8 acquisitions.\n\nRecent Twitter Job Postings\n\nPrior to that, Twitter was on the lookout for only one other M&A-focused position, when it was on the hunt for Legal Counsel last September.\n\nPrior Twitter M&A-Focused Job Posting\n\nTwitter is no stranger to acquisitions. It famously acquired Vine in 2012 and, more recently, Periscope in 2015. Overall, the company has made 57 acquisitions since 2008.\n\nBut given the nature of the new hire and its placement in Twitter's \"People\" department, one may surmise that the company is readying for an acquisition that will require some serious talent retention and attrition strategy. Indeed, the job listing calls for \"recommendations to ensure successful transactions\" and to lead an effort for \"Change Management to support all M&A activity\". It also insinuates a new deal, with language about \"project kickoff\", \"cultural integration\" as well as evaluating and coming up with a retention strategy and associated costs. Finally, it calls for this new lead to \"Quantify any potential liability that may results as a consequence of the transaction\".\n\nAs for what the transaction may be, we don't know, of course. But Twitter may have shown its hand in terms of an upcoming deal here.\n\nAnother indicator here may be found in overall hiring activity at Twitter, as large M&A deals are often precipitated by hiring slowdowns. Twitter job openings have indeed slowed a bit since last summer, especially when quantified on a month-over-month basis.\n\nTwitter Hiring Activity\n\nAbout The Data\n\nThinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Thinknum covering: Twitter Inc.
