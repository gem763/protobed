Prosecutors say Sackler then redirected substantial amounts to shell companies that own family homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons.\n\nThe filing, made in a New York court, follows decisions by that state and others to reject a tentative settlement with Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, announced this week, arguing it does not do enough to make amends for the company\u2019s and family\u2019s alleged roles in flooding US communities with prescription painkillers.\n\nNew York, Massachusetts and others contend that the Sacklers drained more than $4bn from Purdue since 2007, moving much of it offshore to avoid future claims.
