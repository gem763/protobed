Mistakes happen, whatever, but what ensued can only be described as an iconic 30-second vignette of breaking from Bryant, with Cecily Strong\u2019s stifled off-screen laughter as a key supporting player. Even Woody Harrelson was holding back his toothy grin by the end! Live television, amirite?\n\nRelated", "description": "An SNL (Saturday Night Live) sketch turned into a bit of chaos after a wardrobe woman came out too early to change Aidy Bryant\u2019s outfit.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/28/29-aidy.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
