Katie Hill to resign amid allegations of inappropriate relationships with staffers", "language": "en", "text": "Hill did not specify a resignation date in her letter but multiple people with knowledge of her plans said she could step aside as soon as Nov. 1.\n\nHill was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of an improper sexual relationship with a male congressional staffer, a claim she denied. Hill admitted to and apologized for an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a female campaign staffer earlier this week.\n\nIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\n\n\n\nSee my official statement below. pic.twitter.com/nG97RQIwvO \u2014 Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) October 27, 2019\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, Hill blamed the ongoing scandal \u2013 which included several nude photos of the lawmaker published in conservative online news outlets \u2013 on an \u201cabusive husband\u201d whom she is in the middle of divorcing.\n\nAttorneys for Hill even issued a cease and desist letter earlier this week to a British tabloid after the outlet published several intimate photos of Hill, including one that allegedly depicted her holding a bong while naked.\n\nSources with knowledge of Hill\u2019s resignation said her decision to step down was prompted, in part, by hopes of stemming the flow of embarrassing and defamatory reports that have popped up in multiple outlets, starting with conservative site RedState.org last week.\n\nThe outlet accused Hill of having a sexual relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, which the website claimed was uncovered by Hill\u2019s husband, Kenny Heslep. Hill vehemently denied the relationship with Kelly, who also worked on her congressional campaign.\n\nHill said the publication of personal and intimate photos was an \u201cappalling invasion of my privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options,\u201d she added in her resignation letter. \u201cHowever, I know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d\n\nWhile Hill denied the relationship with her congressional staffer, she issued an apology for having a relationship with a female staffer on her campaign earlier this week.\n\n\u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,\u201d Hill wrote in a letter to her constituents.\n\n\"I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view, even the false allegations of a relationship with my congressional staffer, which I have publicly denied, and I am fully and proactively cooperating with the Ethics Committee,\u201d she added.\n\nSome of Hill\u2019s colleagues, including Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, defended her after the leaked photos, saying the California Democrat was the victim of \u201crevenge porn\u201d and a political smear campaign at the hands of her husband.\n\nI serve on Armed Services with Katie and while we frequently disagree on substance, she is always well-prepared, focused and thoughtful. \u2014 Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) October 24, 2019\n\nHill, 32, was a rising start in the 2018 freshman class, with position in both House Democratic leadership and as vice chair of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nHill was one of the \u201cmajority makers,\u201d flipping a GOP-held seat that contributed to House Democrats\u2019 romp back to the majority last year.\n\nHill trounced Republican Rep. Steve Knight (R-Calif.) by 9 points in a district in the northern exurbs of Los Angeles that was once reliably Republican. The seat, which Hillary Clinton won it by 7 points in 2016, has trended toward Democrats but is still considered competitive.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/88/97/fdb69a924424aa0b6016a4c53512/20191027-katie-hill-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
