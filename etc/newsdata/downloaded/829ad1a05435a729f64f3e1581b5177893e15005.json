Is the truth dawning on you, or are you still in the dark?\n\nSee if you can put it all together from the resumes of those in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s closest political circle so far:\n\nTreasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin: Goldman Sachs.\n\nChief strategist Steve Bannon: Goldman Sachs.\n\nTransition adviser Anthony Scaramucci: Goldman Sachs.\n\nCommerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross: Rothschild & Co.\n\nPossible budget director Gary Cohn: Goldman Sachs.\n\nPotential secretary of state Mitt Romney: Bain Capital.\n\nTrump is just getting started. Check out that \u201cswamp draining.\u201d The whole thing is just draining before our eyes! Take that, Wall Street! Take that, \u201cinternational financial cabal!\u201d\n\nTrumpkins, you\u2019ve been scammed. There\u2019s a sucker in this game \u2014 and it\u2019s you.\n\nAnd by the way, what\u2019s the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95% since the election?\n\nGoldman Sachs. GS, +0.03%\n\nYes, really. Shares are up 24%, to $225 from $182 when the market closed on November 8. The next biggest gainer: Wall Street powerhouse JP Morgan Chase JPM, +0.17%\n\nHalf of the Dow\u2019s gain since the election, in fact, is due to just those two Wall Street stocks. By contrast, shares of \u201cMain Street\u201d companies Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -6.22%, Procter & Gamble PG, +0.72% and Coca-Cola KO, +1.84% are down.\n\nAccording to company documents, the partners at Goldman own 30.65 million shares. Which means that the partners at Goldman Sachs, in total, are $1.3 billion richer than they were on November 8, thanks to Trump\u2019s election.\n\nRemember when Trump and his proxies assailed Hillary Clinton for allegedly being too close to Goldman Sachs because she gave a couple of speeches there? Trump even singled out Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, plus other Jews, in a sinister campaign commercial that inveighed against an \u201cinternational financial structure\u201d that cheated ordinary American workers. The 2016 election is \u201ca choice between Donald Trump and Goldman Sachs,\u201d insisted NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden earlier this year.\n\nWhat a number Trump has played on the \u201cpoorly educated.\u201d No wonder he said he loves them.\n\nTrumpkins are learning the hard way what happens when you buy an investment scheme from a con-artist. I\u2019ve been writing about scam artists for more than 20 years. They always promise you the moon \u2014 that is, until your check clears.\n\nWhen will these voters get it? Maybe never. Author Maria Konnivoka notes in her book The Confidence Game that many victims refuse to admit they\u2019ve been scammed \u2014 no matter what the evidence. Indeed, she says, many just keep coming back for more. This is something I\u2019ll bet Donald Trump knows full well, and which he\u2019s banking on (pun intended) in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, give credit where credit is due. Trump is fattening the bank accounts of the elite, but he also may have saved 1,000 jobs at Carrier . If he really did, good for him. Those who opposed Trump should stop being so churlish. After all, on President Barack Obama\u2019s watch the U.S. economy generated 8.6 million net new jobs \u2014 equal to 2,945, or about three Carrier deals, every day, including Sundays, for going on eight consecutive years. And who can forget all of those patriotic Republicans congratulating Obama for that?", "description": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 on Wall Street and in Washington is all wet, writes Brett Arends.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EX676_trump__ZG_20161012134216.jpg", "published_at": "2016-12-02"}
