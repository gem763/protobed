The Spanish media are on his case, which represents an indication of what Real's hierarchy are thinking.\n\nWhere Zidane would go next is up for debate. Former club Juventus, perhaps? Or eventually cash-rich Paris Saint-Germain? It remains to be seen whether he stays in management at all.\n\nZinedine Zidane has Real Madrid top of La Liga - but they have been poor in Europe this season\n\nJose Mourinho\n\nMourinho has maintained throughout the year that he is waiting for a top job following his sacking at United last December. The former Chelsea boss has turned down a number of offers already, with the most high profile being the \u00a389.6m contract at Guangzhou Evergrande in China.\n\nThe Portuguese's managerial future appears to be in the hands of Pochettino and Zidane to an extent, with Real and Tottenham both linked with moves for him.\n\nThere is unfinished business in Madrid, while Mourinho has emerged as the bookies' favourite to take over at Spurs. For now, he seems content reinventing himself in the Sky Sports studio - albeit with one eye on any vacant spots on the touchlines of the top teams...\n\nJose Mourinho is happy working in punditry for now - until a big managerial job comes up\n\nMassimiliano Allegri\n\nAllegri certainly has his eyes on the United job. The former Juve boss has been learning English in readiness for a move to the Premier League during a year out from coaching.\n\nYou wonder whether his desire to work in England may work in the favour of others \u2013 namely Tottenham \u2013 should United keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the longer term.\n\nAllegri's stock remains high after five Serie A titles and taking Juventus to two Champions League finals.\n\nMassimiliano Allegri is keen on a Premier League move and has been learning English\n\nEddie Howe\n\nHowe's position is an interesting one. The Bournemouth boss is rarely talked up for the bigger Premier League jobs with any sort of gusto and is almost viewed as a left-field alternative.\n\nAside from a year at Burnley he has managed the Cherries since 2008, solidifying them as a top-flight club and playing attractive football with it.\n\nHowe is known to be settled down on the south coast but when does the time come for him to kick on and further his career? The London clubs must be looking at him when their next cycle of managerial switches come around. Arsenal are often mooted but Daniel Levy is an admirer, too.", "description": "JACK GAUGHAN: One top manager moving can trigger a raft of switches across Europe and, with a number of jobs up in the air, that could play out this season - starting with Mauricio Pochettino.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/15/19300304-0-image-a-8_1570198538219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
