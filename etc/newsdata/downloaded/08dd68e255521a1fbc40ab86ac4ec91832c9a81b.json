Meanwhile, three-quarters of the new jobs created, including delivery drivers and warehouse workers, have gone to men.\n\nHowever, he said the RSA is \u201coptimistic\u201d that the high street\u2019s decline can be reversed.\n\n\u201cIf retailers collaborate more with each other, offer exciting in-store experiences and make customer service roles higher-skilled \u2013 with staff becoming more like in-store 'influencers' \u2013 then we still see a vibrant future for the British high street.\u201d\n\nEdward Story, partner at law firm Taylor Wessing, was similarly upbeat, saying there is \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d for UK high streets.\n\n\u201cArguably retail is the sector most enhanced and disrupted by technology and the online revolution,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many retailers this has yielded opportunities to connect with new markets, engage with customers in fresh ways, revolutionise how they do business and change working practices.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In response, high street shops become more experiential, leading to new, more highly skilled roles. Independent businesses thrive and workers see conditions and job satisfaction improve.\n\nBy contrast, in the \u201cbig tech economy\u201d scenario high streets face increased competition from technology firms like Amazon.\n\nDelivery drones, autonomous trucks and other technology are introduced, resulting in a decline in demand for manual jobs.\n\nMany workers are made redundant and, while new hi-tech roles emerge, the opportunities for employees to transition are limited, the RSA suggests.", "description": "The decline of UK high streets has disproportionately impacted women and people in regions outside of London, especially England\u2019s North East and East Midlands, according to new research.
