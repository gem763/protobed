Over the course of a single day\u2019s time, $400 million worth of BitMEX positions were liquidated, Bakkt volume surged to fresh all-time highs, blockchain became a topic of discussion for Chinese President Xi Jinping, amongst other crazy events that managed to fall into the time span of a single. freaking. day.\n\nThis zaniness, if you want to call it that, was reflected in the market for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency saw a daily trading range of $7,300 to $10,600 \u2014 a jaw-dropping $3,300, around 40% if measured from the bottom. This surge represented the cryptocurrency\u2019s third or fourth-largest gain in its history, depending on who you ask.\n\nHowever, it seems that bulls are exhausted. How could they be not?\n\nBitcoin Bulls Take a Rest\n\nAs of the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is resting on its laurels. The thing is, it\u2019s not working.\n\nSince the daily peak of $10,600 seen some seven-odd hours ago, the cryptocurrency has slumped by 13%, falling by $1,300 from said peak. Bitcoin is now trading for $9,300, and seems poised to breakdown further unless bulls step in.\n\n$9,400 is purportedly a key resistance area that Bitcoin will need to close a daily candle above to verify that the bearish correction is most likely over and that continuation to $10,000 and beyond is possible.\n\nImportantly, though, this pullback corroborates an analysis done by Nunya Bizniz, a popular analyst. He noted, as reported by NewsBTC, earlier on Saturday that a Bitcoin four-hour candle which reached as high as $10,600 on BitMEX, is a \u201cperfected Tom Demark Sequential 9.\u201d\n\nBizniz remarked that \u201ca TD 9 typically indicates trend exhaustion,\u201d implying that there may be some stagnation or a healthy pullback before a resumption of the uptrend.\n\nIndeed. He added that according to Tone Vays\u2019 take on the indicator, \u201cwe may see a one to four candle pullback (four to 16 hours) and then resume up.\u201d\n\nBTC 4hr: Current candle is a perfected TD9. A TD9 typically indicates trend exhaustion. However, It has occurred well above the TDST line (red dots). Which is a signal that the trend may continue. According to @ToneVays we may see a 1 to 4 candle pull back and then resume up. pic.twitter.com/BgtybbvcBi \u2014 Nunya Bizniz (@Pladizow) October 26, 2019\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has seen an absolute whirlwind 24 hours.
