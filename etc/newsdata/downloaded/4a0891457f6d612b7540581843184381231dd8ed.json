It was time.\u201d\n\nStarring on the short-lived series \u201cRinger\u201d and \u201cThe Crazy Ones\u201d in 2012 and 2013 led Gellar to \u201ctake a break, reassess and try a different things.\u201d Pressing pause on acting allowed her to flex some entrepreneurial muscles like launching her food crafting company, Foodstirs, while she kept busy raising two children with fellow \u201990s teen idol Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nBut the shadow of her performances in projects like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d \u201cCruel Intentions\u201d and \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d still looms large over Gellar\u2019s career, which she considers to be the ultimate compliment.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, all you ever want to do is have a legacy,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou want to do something that resonates, means something and holds up to the test of time. I\u2019ve had that more than once and that\u2019s the greatest gift. I could retire tomorrow and be super happy because I have Buffy, Katherine and all of these stories.\u201d\n\nThe beloved WB series was recently invoked by former Democratic candidate for Georgia governor and diehard fan Stacey Abrams, who said the show can be seen as metaphor to understanding political activism in the age of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI was shocked. That\u2019s where I get the fangirl moment,\u201d Gellar said of her reaction to Abrams\u2019 comments. \u201cI sent [the video] to Freddie and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s Stacey Abrams. Did you see?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the Emmy winner never reached out to Abrams personally (\u201cStacey\u2019s a little busy\u201d), she did have a message for her, from one fan to another.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Gellar said she would tell Abrams. \u201cThank you for standing up for what\u2019s right and things you believe in and never backing down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, fighting for what\u2019s right is all we can do,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor that \u2018Buffy\u2019 still holds that same relevance, importance and passion today. I hope in this world that Buffy always wins because I hope that good will always triumphs over evil.\u201d\n\nGellar, however, is reluctant to dive too deep when it comes to politics, preferring to keep her beliefs to herself as a public figure who, as she puts it, doesn\u2019t have the \u201cqualifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to stay out of the political fray in the sense that everyone is entitled to their political opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cI have my own, but because I\u2019m a celebrity I don\u2019t want people to base their opinions on something that I feel, which is why I usually stay fairly quiet unless it\u2019s something I can\u2019t watch one more second of.\u201d\n\nGetty Images via Getty Images Sarah Michelle Gellar in the Season 3 premiere of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nAnd while \u201cBuffy\u201d continues to be summoned as a rebuke against the forces of evil, both real and imagined \u2015 a reboot of the series is currently in development \u2015 Gellar says that she\u2019s hung up her leather fighting pants for good.\n\n\u201cMy story with Buffy about representing horrors of adolescence has been told,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s another story to tell, I think that\u2019s awesome and will only eventually trace back to the original and people will probably realize that [Whispers] it\u2019s not as good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s more story to tell, then tell it,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it just won\u2019t be told with me.\u201d", "description": "The actor is set to return to TV in two buzzy new projects \u2014 \u201cSometimes I Lie\u201d and \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses.\u201d", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f7b50210000c30734398a.png?cache=e1ybmfwdvi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
