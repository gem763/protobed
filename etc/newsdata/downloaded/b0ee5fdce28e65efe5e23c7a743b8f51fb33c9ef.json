The work that led the venue Playwrights Horizons to reassure its riled subscribers \u2013 The Flick, set in a shabby, old-fashioned Massachusetts cinema \u2013 went on to win the Susan Smith Blackburn prize and was staged at the National Theatre in London, where it has been followed by two more Baker plays: John, and, opening this week, The Antipodes.\n\nBaker, a rare and reluctant interviewee, eventually agrees to have an email conversation. Although she engages generously \u2013 even while looking after a new baby, and struggling with a bug caught in London \u2013 the precise replies suggest that her public reticence may come from a fear of being over-specific about details that the work blurs. The 38-year-old is the most original and significant American dramatist since August Wilson, but her plays should still be avoided by people who like plot and theme clearly signposted. John, set in a weird B&B near an American civil war battle site, has a trick ending that led to people walking out who hadn\u2019t meant to. The Antipodes depicts a corporate brainstorming session for an unspecified product (movie? political party?) and ends in a startlingly unexpected place.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An unexpected place \u2026 The Antipodes by Annie Baker at the National Theatre, London. Photograph: Manuel Harlan\n\nHas Baker had to fight for the right to be trusted to defy conventions? \u201cI have always tried to make the kind of theatre I want to see,\u201d she says, \u201cand although I haven\u2019t always succeeded, it\u2019s obvious to me that, if you\u2019re making a choice from a place of fear or obedience, it\u2019s the wrong choice. I know at times this has frustrated people.\u201d\n\nOne thing that frustrates her detractors but excites her admirers is her defiance of generic categories. John has developments that could be seen as supernatural, and if a film is ever made of The Antipodes, different scenes could be classified as arthouse-indie and horror. \u201cI\u2019m not really that interested in genre,\u201d Baker admits. \u201cI guess it goes back to my resistance to rules and conventions. If people say my plays span or incorporate different genres, I hope that just means they\u2019re surprising. I do think both John and The Antipodes start out as somewhat innocent-seeming and then get a bit more mischievous, but that happened naturally.\u201d\n\nReferences to the external world are also oblique. Characters in The Antipodes observe \u201chow messed up everything is right now\u201d and reflect on the \u201ccrazy weather\u201d, and there are clear undercurrents of discussion about gender and race in the workplace. Audiences seem likely to take these lines as allusions to Trump, Brexit, the climate emergency and #MeToo. But, where other dramatists might specify the background, Baker prefers to allude to them. To what extent does she see the plays as political or social reflections on what is going on?\n\n\u201cMy plays are very much that,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, though. I wrote this play before #MeToo and before Trump was elected, and yet it does seem to incorporate both events, and anticipate them somehow. I think of my plays as incredibly political, but I have no interest in trying to convince anyone of anything.\u201d\n\nWhen I wonder if references in The Antipodes to an off-stage character who found everything \u201coffensive\u201d might be taken as a reference to a culture some people think is prone to over-sensitivity, Baker\u2019s wily reply is: \u201cThe guys in the play claim she found everything offensive. We never find out if she actually did.\u201d\n\nIn both her cagey explications and the beguiling ambiguity of the narratives, she reminds me of Harold Pinter, and of Edward Albee, who, when asked what his play was about, liked to reply: \u201cabout two hours.\u201d In Baker\u2019s The Antipodes, we never find out what the business meetings are about, and, in John, a character\u2019s climactic speech of apparent revelation can be interpreted as a fantasy or lie. So is there, somewhere in the playwright\u2019s mind or laptop, the \u201ctruth\u201d about what happened, or is it the case, as Pinter once said to me in an interview, \u201cI\u2019ve never deliberately held anything back from an audience. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, then I didn\u2019t either\u201d?\n\nShe is happy to borrow from another theatrical obscurant to clarify her own position: \u201cI\u2019m totally with Pinter on this one.\u201d\n\nAlthough The Antipodes is Baker\u2019s third play at the National in three years, for a long time, British theatres were scandalously short of women\u2019s voices; Caryl Churchill had a lonely prominence, apart from one-offs such as Shelagh Delaney. Did Baker see a similar imbalance in American theatre? \u201cThings have changed enormously since my first play was produced in 2008,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was pretty bad back then.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sinead Matthews as Eleanor in The Antipodes.

Her credits include While We\u2019re Young (2014), a movie in which her actor husband, Nico Baumbach, also appeared, directed by his brother, Noah Baumbach. Her preferred medium, though, is obviously the stage, even if her reason is the sort of provocative surprise often found in her dialogue: \u201cI like theatre because it\u2019s so unprofitable.\u201d\n\nShe means the type of show that she writes. \u201cThe only reason to do it is to make something surprising and strange. I don\u2019t understand commercial theatre, theatre that\u2019s bound to do anything other than surprise and innovation.\u201d Then comes a provocative qualification: \u201cWait. That\u2019s not true. Hello, Dolly! on Broadway was one of my favourite things I\u2019ve ever seen. And also one of the weirdest. But, with the exception of Hello, Dolly!, I don\u2019t get commercial theatre.\u201d\n\nOne mark of popular theatre is that a second actor doesn\u2019t start speaking until the first one stops. But, as is increasingly common in non-commercial theatre, Baker\u2019s scripts ask the speakers to interrupt and talk over one another. Is her acting experience useful in getting the dialogue exactly how she wants it to sound? \u201cI do still record myself reading every scene out loud after I write it, and before I make edits. But the handful of times I\u2019ve acted have influenced my work much more as a director than a writer.\u201d\n\nBaker is co-directing the National production of The Antipodes with its designer, Chloe Lamford. This pairing reflects the strong visual element of her plays: the precise architecture of an antiquated picturehouse in The Flick, walls covered in strange bric-a-brac in John, and the exotically sterile blue-sky-thinking HQ in The Antipodes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Excitement about a set comes first\u2019 \u2026 Baker and designer Chloe Lamford in rehearsals of The Antipodes. Photograph: Manuel Harlan\n\n\u201cI almost always think of the environment and stage picture before anything else comes to me,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThe specifics are, of course, a collaboration with designers and directors, but for me, excitement about a potential set comes before excitement about character, or dialogue, or story.\u201d\n\nThe audience is allowed unusual leisure to enjoy the stage images because it is a habit of Baker\u2019s to leave us alone with the set. In both The Flick and John, the characters leave the stage to do something and we wait until they come back. Each scene of an early play, Circle Mirror Transformation, starts in an empty dance studio. I have never seen the stage vacated so regularly, so I wonder if the \u201ceveryone out\u201d moments come to her during rehearsal or writing? \u201cOh \u2013 that always emerges at the writing stage. I just really like looking at empty rooms!\u201d\n\nLeaping out of Baker\u2019s CV, before her acting and writing credits, is the fact that she was once a \u201cguest wrangler\u201d, supervising the would-be lovers on the US TV dating show The Bachelor. \u201cI had dozens of jobs between 15 and 28 that still provide great fodder for my writing,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a nanny, a camp counsellor, a script reader, a cashier at a bakery and a dorm mother for young ballerinas at the New York City Ballet\u2019s training school.\u201d\n\nThe Antipodes seems sure to confirm she has now found her ideal career, though. Audiences should not expect it easily to reveal a meaning, but those who balked at the length of her earlier work will be pleased that this one is said by the National Theatre website to last \u201cabout two hours\u201d.", "description": "In a rare interview, Baker explains why she hates commercial theatre (except Hello, Dolly!) and how she anticipated Trump and #MeToo in her new work at the National, The Antipodes", "authors": ["Mark Lawson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/709fec960ec16693fefd582f3fb1cdd0c5d55965/0_133_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=610a720338940adeb055f1e0ab199684", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
