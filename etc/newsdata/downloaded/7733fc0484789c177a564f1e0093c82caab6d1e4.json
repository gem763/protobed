The US president has also said the experience was \u201cas though you were watching a movie\u201d.\n\nWhat Mr Trump saw, according to military and intelligence officials, was overhead surveillance footage on several video screens that provided various angles from above and in real time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It is not clear whether the dog that followed Baghdadi into the tunnel was wearing a body camera.\n\nThe US president said he did not have to make any decisions in the moments of the raid, while troops were on the ground. (Military officials said they would never have asked him to.)\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr Trump said in response to whether he had to make decisions on the fly. \u201cWe were getting full reports on literally a minute-by-minute basis. \u2018Sir, we just broke in. Sir, the wall is down. Sir, you know, we\u2019ve captured. Sir, two people are coming out right now. Hands up.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThen, Mr Trump said, he was given a report: \u201c\u2018Sir, there\u2019s only one person in the building. We are sure he\u2019s in the tunnel trying to escape.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe was also told it was a dead-end tunnel.\n\nIn the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader, in 2011, Leon E Panetta, who then was serving as CIA director, narrated the events unfolding in Abbottabad, Pakistan, to former president Barack Obama and his national security advisers in the Situation Room.\n\nMr Panetta was on a video screen as he spoke from CIA headquarters, and was the one who informed the president when the al-Qaida leader, code-named \u201cGeronimo,\u201d was positively identified by Navy Seals as being in the house \u2014 and, later, when he was killed.\n\n\u201cGeronimo EKIA,\u201d Mr Panetta said, for Enemy Killed in Action.\n\nIt was unclear Sunday whether Baghdadi was given a code name for the Idlib raid.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "In describing the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday, Donald Trump used dramatic, even cinematic language to portray the daring American commando raid that brought down the Isis leader who, the president said, died \u201cscreaming, crying and whimpering\u201d.", "authors": ["Helene Cooper", "Julian E.
