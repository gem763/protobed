As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nOne day later, Bruce Arians is still annoyed.\n\nThe head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers again addressed an apparent officiating mistake that may have cost the team the game in a 27-23 loss Sunday to the Tennessee Titans.\n\n\u201cNot to beat a dead horse, but an inadvertent whistle, if we had in the last three minutes and some change, a three-point lead and win the game, I think everybody is writing different stories, talking different things,\u201d Arians said. \u201cSo it was more than just a play. Everybody except for one guy saw the ball out. Blew a quick whistle.\n\n\"My biggest thing is, referees aren't held accountable. Coaches get fired. General managers get fired. Players get cut. Referees aren't accountable. And it's a shame. It's been that way for 40 years and now that we've got a new agreement, it'll be that way for 40 more years.\u201d\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 8 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 8 winners, losers: Drew Brees shined in his return; Browns are total disappointment\n\nWith 3:45 left to play in the game, the Titans ran a fake field goal in which punter Brett Kern was stopped short of the line of scrimmage. An official blew the whistle quickly, effectively ending the play and calling the runner down by contact.\n\nTelevision replays, however, showed that Buccaneers linebacker Devin White had jarred the ball loose before Kern hit the ground. Tampa safety Andrew Adams scooped the ball and had a clear path to the end zone in what almost certainly would have been a touchdown. But because the play was blown dead, the return was not reviewable.\n\nThough the Buccaneers got the ball back, they couldn\u2019t score a touchdown and eventually lost the game.\n\nDespite Arians' comments, the NFL does go through a process of grading officials, and determines their potential assignment to high-profile games like the Super Bowl based on their track record.\n\nBlowing plays dead, however, has been an issue for NFL officials this season. The New Orleans Saints also had an apparent touchdown wiped away because of an early whistle in Week 2, when defensive end Cameron Jordan had a clear 87-yard fumble return for a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams negated.\n\nNew Orleans went on to lose that game, 27-9.\n\nThough a different circumstance, in last week\u2019s Houston Texans-Indianapolis Colts game, quarterback Deshaun Watson tried to extend a play and also had a score wiped off the board because of a quick whistle. On that play, Colts defensive end Justin Houston had Watson\u2019s ankles as he tried to bring him down, but Watson fired a quick pass to receiver DeAndre Hopkins for what would\u2019ve been a 4-yard touchdown.\n\nInstead, an official blew the play dead and counted it as a sack. The Texans then had to settle for a field goal. Houston lost, 30-23.\n\n\u201cAgain, it was an inadvertent whistle,\u201d Arians continued. \u201cSo, yeah, why has it continued? Since the Rams-Saints game the second week, when the Saints got the touchdown that they didn\u2019t get, there\u2019s been an emphasis on letting the plays go. If you can answer why it\u2019s not happening \u2013 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIn a pool report after the Titans-Bucs game, referee Adrian Hill confirmed that replay review would only have been able to give the Buccaneers the ball based on a disputed fumble, but that Tampa wouldn\u2019t have been able to advance it any further.\n\n\u201cCertainly after the whistle, we definitely saw a ball come out afterwards, but the ruling on the field was that the runner was down by contact before the ball came out, and that's why the whistle blew,\u201d Hill said. \u201cSo the whistle was blown because the ruling was \u2018runner down by contact.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
