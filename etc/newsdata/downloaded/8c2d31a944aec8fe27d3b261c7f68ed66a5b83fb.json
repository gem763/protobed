One even fainted. And despite trying to comfort the group, Ray himself was reduced to tears, convinced the roof of the truck was going to cave in at any minute.\n\n\u2018I remember children just screaming and crying,\u2019 Park recounted for CBS. \u2018The sides of the van were bowing in\u2026 I knew that I was going to die. I knew it.\u2019\n\nThe kidnappers, all from wealthy Bay Area families, planned to ask for a $5 million ransom for their hostages.\n\nBut their plot, which had been 18-months in the making, unraveled when they took a nap - leaving the students and bus driver a short window in which to secure their escape.\n\nThe kidnappers made each of the children given their names and a piece of clothing, and then climb down a ladder into the buried moving van, 12-feet below the ground.\n\nWhen the last of the children was inside, Woods and the Schoenfeld brothers began shoveling dirt over the roof, weighing down the hatch-door by placing two 100-pound industrial batteries on top\n\nOne of the eldest children, Mitchell Marshall, bravely announced to the group that he wasn't going to die without putting up a fight.\n\nInspiring the frightened cohort into action, under the instructions of Ray the group stacked the mattresses inside the truck on top of one another and used wooden slats to dislodge a steel plate on the roof of the van that was covering the hatch through which they\u2019d entered.\n\nFighting heat exhaustion, they poured water over their heads and kept pushing until they were able to knock the batteries off of the top of the hatch.\n\nHaving been buried alive for an agonizing 16 hours, Ray and the children finally found themselves back above ground. They walked to the quarry\u2019s guard station near the Shadow Cliffs East Bay National Park where authorities were called.\n\nThe escape took place before the kidnappers had even been able to call in their ransom demands, because the Chowchilla Police Department telephone lines had been overloaded with calls from the media and family members looking for the children.\n\nSoon after arriving at the quarry, Police discovered that the buried truck was registered to the quarry owner\u2019s son, Frederick Woods.\n\nA draft ransom note was also found at the scene, with some of its phrasing seeming to make reference to Hugh Pentecost\u2019s story, \u2018The Day the Children Vanished\u2019, which had been published in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Daring Detectives and was displayed in the Chowchilla public library.\n\nUnder hypnosis, Ray was also able to remember one of the license plates of the vans that had taken them to the quarry, which was tied to Woods once more, and both of his accomplices.\n\nOne of the eldest children, Mitchell Marshall, announced to the group that he hasn\u2019t going to die without putting up a fight. With the help of Ray (above) and the older boys, the group stacked the mattresses inside the truck on top of one another and used wooden slats to dislodge a steel plate on the roof of the van that was covering the hatch through which they\u2019d entered\n\nAfter an agonizing 16 hours of being buried alive, Ray and the children finally found themselves back above ground. They walked to the quarry\u2019s guard station near the Shadow Cliffs East Bay National Park, and were all \u2018in good condition\u2019. The escape took place before the kidnappers had even been able to call in their ransom demands, because the Chowchilla Police Department telephone lines were tied up with media calls and family members looking for their children\n\nWoods was arrested weeks later after fleeing to Vancouver, British Columbia. The Schoenfeld brothers surrendered to authorities in California after several days in hiding.\n\nAll three men received life sentences after pleading guilty to kidnapping charges.\n\nAt Woods\u2019 parole hearing in 2012, victims of the kidnapping described the suffering they still felt 39-years-on in a heartfelt let to the board, expressing their desire to that Woods never be made a free man.\n\n'I wrote that they buried me alive, they stole my childhood and caused me immense emotional pain over the years. It affected my life, my parents\u2019 lives and my children\u2019s lives,\u2019 Hyde Brown later revealed.\n\n'For me, it\u2019s having to deal with hatred and anger toward other human beings, and that\u2019s a struggle that almost 40 years later I still have to deal with,' she added.\n\n'Until recently I slept with a night light. I have anxiety attacks when I\u2019m in a confined space, and it\u2019s a problem living in the South when we have tornado warnings and we have to take cover in storm shelters. \u2026 They took away my ability to be free.'\n\nHyde said the kidnapping also affected her ability to be a mother to two children since she did not have what she considers a normal childhood.\n\n'You don\u2019t go from being buried alive and thinking you\u2019re going to die to having a normal childhood,' she said.\n\n'I\u2019m fortunate I\u2019m not incarcerated or hooked on drugs, which is how some of the kids dealt with it. I\u2019m as OK as a broken person can be.'\n\nSoon after arriving at the quarry, Police discovered that the buried truck was registered to the quarry owner\u2019s son, Frederick Woods\n\nVictim Jennifer Brown Hyde (left), who was nine at the time, said she \u2018felt like and animal going to the slaughterhouse.\u2019 Similarly, Larry Park (right) remembers sitting in darkness of the back of the van wondering \u2018how it was going to feel to die\u2019.\n\nAt Woods\u2019 parole hearing in 2012, victims of the kidnapping described the suffering they still felt 39-years-on in a heartfelt let to the board, expressing their desire to ensure Woods is never made a free man (pictured: Victims of the Chowchilla bus kidnapping pictured at a reunion in 2012)\n\nFrank Edward Ray received a California School Employees Association citation for outstanding community service, for his heroics that fateful day.
