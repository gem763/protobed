Reuters\n\nBeijing has accused American lawmakers of a \u201cpolitical plot\u201d to thwart China\u2019s development after the US House of Representatives approved legislation that could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the Hong Kong government.\n\nThe lower chamber of Congress on Tuesday backed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, moving it a significant step closer to becoming law.\n\nThe bill, which Beijing considers an attempt to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs and contain the country\u2019s rise, passed the House on a voice vote.\n\nIntroduced in June by Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, the bill would require the US government to assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify Washington changing its treatment of the city as a separate trading entity from the Chinese mainland.\n\nThe legislation also paves the way for sanctions against individuals deemed responsible for actions to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, such as the rendition to the mainland of anyone exercising \u201cinternationally recognised human rights in Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nThe bill awaits a vote in the Senate, where it currently enjoys the bipartisan co-sponsorship of 23 senators, and is expected to pass.\n\nYang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, which is China\u2019s cabinet, said it expressed \u201csolemn protest and strong condemnation\u201d over the passage of the act.\n\n\u201cThis kind of behavior has grossly interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs and is openly adding support to the opposition forces and radical forces in Hong Kong,\u201d Yang was quoted as saying in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt has exposed the political plot of the US House of Representatives and some politicians to use the Hong Kong to contain China\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nYang said the turmoil in Hong Kong had intensified because the US had sided with the anti-China chaotic forces in Hong Kong. He called on the US to halt the bill.\n\n\u201cWithout US intervention, Hong Kong will be more prosperous and stable,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a lengthy statement responding to developments in Washington, the Hong Kong government \u201cexpressed regret\u201d over the passage of the act.\n\nIt said the government had implemented \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle \u201cfully and successfully\u201d in accordance with the Basic Law, the city\u2019s mini constitution.\n\nThe statement issued on Wednesday also warned foreign lawmakers they should not interfere in Hong Kong internal affairs in any way.\n\nLawmakers in Washington also approved a bill that blocked the export of crowd control equipment such as tear gas to Hong Kong authorities.\n\nKnown as the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, it was introduced by Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.\n\nA resolution was also passed in the House to recognise the city\u2019s bilateral relationship with the US and \u201ccondemn the interference of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs\u201d.\n\nApplauding the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticised those who sided with Beijing for fear of jeapordising their economic interests.\n\n\u201cTo those who want to take the repressive government\u2019s side in this discussion, I say to you: What does it profit a person if he gains the whole world and suffers the loss of his soul?\u201d she said on the House floor.\n\nAn attempt by US President Donald Trump, who last Friday said that relations with the Chinese government were now a \u201clove fest\u201d after the announcement of a partial trade agreement, to veto the legislation could be overruled by a two-thirds majority in both congressional chambers.\n\nTuesday\u2019s action in the House came a day after tens of thousands of Hongkongers took to the streets to urge US lawmakers to pass the legislation. In the first police-sanctioned rally since authorities imposed emergency laws earlier this month, protesters waved American flags and chanted slogans lauding the US as a \u201cprotector of freedom\u201d and \u201cregulator of world order\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re simply urging the Chinese president [Xi Jinping] and the Hong Kong chief executive [Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor] to faithfully honour the government\u2019s promises,\u201d Smith told lawmakers ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nThe handover of the city from British to Chinese rule in 1997 was premised on an agreement that Hongkongers would continue to enjoy a high degree of autonomy until at least 2047.\n\nBeijing has pounced on the legislation as an example of American interference in the continuing unrest.\n\nAn opinion piece published ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote by People\u2019s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, said that passage of the bill would only end up hurting the US\u2019 own economic interests, citing the presence of American citizens and businesses in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIn a crucial period in which China and the US are meeting each other halfway [on trade], some American politicians are effectively putting the car in reverse by pushing this bill and flagrantly meddling in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d it said.\n\nThe commentary also accused Republican senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, both of whom are backing the bill, of \u201cselective blindness\u201d after they criticised authorities\u2019 handling of protests during visits to the city over the weekend.\n\nTensions in Hong Kong, triggered in June over a now-withdrawn proposal to amend the city\u2019s extradition laws, have spiked in recent weeks, both leading up to and following on from the October 5 implementation of emergency laws and a ban on wearing face masks.\n\nIn the same week the ban was enacted, two young protesters were shot by live police rounds, while demonstrators\u2019 tactics have expanded to include targeting police officers with petrol bombs and vandalising establishments they perceive to be supportive of Beijing.\n\nOn Sunday, two demonstrators were arrested after a police officer was stabbed in the neck.\n\nA senior US defence official for Asia said on Tuesday that violent actions by some protesters were a cause for worry.\n\n\u201cCertainly we have some concern about some of the tactics that the protesters have been using and may use, and I think in single instances where that becomes a real problem we would point that out,\u201d Randall Schriver, assistant secretary of defence for Asian and Pacific security affairs, said at a conference in Washington.\n\nYet the US remained \u201c100 per cent\u201d behind protesters calling for fundamental rights, Schriver said, expressing concern that Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities had taken a heavier hand in dealing with the unrest.\n\nRecognising that some protests had turned violent, Cruz urged demonstrators \u201cto resist the urge to respond to brutality in like kind, but instead stand with dignity\u201d.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act includes a stipulation that the US should not deny entry to anyone on the basis of their arrest or detention resulting from their participation in \u201cnonviolent protest\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mark Magnier and Zoe Low\n\nSOUTH CHINA MORNING POST", "description": "Business Insider - The legislation paves the way for sanctions against individuals deemed responsible for actions to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy..
