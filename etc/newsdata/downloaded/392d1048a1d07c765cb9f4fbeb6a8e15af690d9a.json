He signed with Milwaukee in Janaury, spent most of the season in the minor leagues and made his first appearance for the Brewers on Aug. 24.\n\n\u201cPlaying in the playoffs is all the motivation I need,\u201d Spangenberg said. \u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever had a chance, so I want to do everything I can to get there and be able to experience that.\u201d\n\nSpangenberg, now 28, got his chance after rookie second baseman Keston Hiura strained his left hamstring\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a player who got an opportunity because of injuries, and he has taken advantage of it,\u201d Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cNow it\u2019s hard to take him out of the lineup.\u201d\n\nSan Diego got just two hits and dropped to 68-82, tying the franchise record with its ninth consecutive losing season. The Padres also finished under .500 from 1969-77, the first nine years of the expansion franchise.\n\nPadres starter Garret Richards (0-1) allowed three runs and five hits over 3 2/3 innings in his first major league appearance since Tommy John surgery in July 2018. The 31-year-old right-hander struck out five and walked none, throwing 42 of 61 pitches for strikes.\n\n\u201cA huge step back into making him a big part of what we do in the future here,\u201d Padres manager Andy Green said. \u201cI think we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw today.\u201d\n\nSpangenberg had an RBI single in the second and followed Eric Hosmer\u2019s tying double in the fourth with a triple in the bottom half for a 3-1 lead.\n\nTravis Shaw stopped an 0-for-20 slide with a pinch-hit home run leading off the fifth against Ronald Bola\u00f1os, and Orlando Arcia doubled in a run in the sixth.\n\nZach Davies (10-7) allowed two hits in five innings, Freddy Peralta struck out four over two innings, Alex Claudio pitched a perfect eighth and Jay Jackson struck out the side in the ninth.\n\n\u201cZach set the tone,\u201d Counsell said.\n\nJosh Naylor\u2019s second-inning single was San Diego\u2019s only other hit.\n\n\u201cDavies was executing well, not missing much over the plate, really mixing it up good,\u201d Hosmer said. \u201cThe guys out of the bullpen did a great job tonight. They were real effective getting strikes early.\u201d\n\nBOOING MACHADO\n\nManny Machado of the Padres was booed loudly before every plate appearance and was cheered when he struck out in the sixth and ninth innings. While playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Brewers during last year\u2019s NL Championship Series, Machado stepped on first baseman Jes\u00fas Aguilar\u2019s foot, prompting the benches to empty.\n\n\u201cBrewers fans have a good memory,\u201d Counsell said.\n\nPADRES MOVES\n\nSan Diego recalled C Luis Torrens from Double-A Amarillo and transferred LHP Adrian Morejon (left shoulder impingement) to the 60-day injured list.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPadres: OF Hunter Renfroe took batting practice, ran the bases and chased fly balls. Out with a sprained his right ankle since Sept. 7th, he is expected to be in Tuesday\u2019s starting lineup.\n\nBrewers: C Manny Pi\u00f1a (concussion) worked out before the game and then the team doctors checked him out.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: RHP Chris Paddack makes his 26th start of the season. He is 2-0 with a 0.49 ERA and 23 strikeouts in his three previous starts.\n\nBrewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (left oblique strain) is scheduled to come off the injured list and take the mound. He is 11-3 with a 3.75 ERA in 20 starts, but will give way to LHP Gio Gonzalez (2-2, 4.01 ERA) who is 4-2 with a 3.12 ERA in eight career starts against San Diego.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Corey Spangenberg helped the Milwaukee Brewers keep pace in their playoff push and ensured another losing season for his old team", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Totoraitis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/padres_brewers_baseball_34522_c0-106-2030-1289_s1770x1032.jpg?0ad43829f5460b0d880c8e762a332722a99b7001", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
