YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\n\u201cOur transportation is broken and it sucks \u2013 nobody loves to travel anymore. We just want to get to our destination.\u201d\n\nYou just have to look at Cape Town\u2019s metro to see what SingularityU South Africa Summit speaker Andres de Leon means \u2013 travelling in the city by train is a heavily calculated experience, weighing up factors like time and safety very carefully \u2013 especially when being squished like a sardine during peak time.\n\nWATCH: This is what a Hyperloop station might look like in the future\n\nTraffic jams, road accidents, air pollution \u2013 these are critical headaches brought on by the transportation industry, but what is the solution?\n\nThe hyperloop was envisioned by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and SpaceX companies, but they open-sourced the design so that other companies could also jump onboard this possibly world-changing technology.\n\nThe concept is a high-speed capsule transportation system inside a low vacuum tube. Electromagnetic propulsion enables emission-free transport while the levitated capsule reduces friction.\n\nSEE: Virgin Hyperloop One is set to launch their first European research centre in Spain\n\nHere are a few fast facts.\n\nInfographic: Gabi Zietsman\n\nThe first wholly hyperloop company to be established was Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HyperloopTT) which De Leon is COO of \u2013 it\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s first crowd-sourced companies, made up of a combination of worldwide collaborators, full-time employees and those who offer their services in exchange for stock options. About 70 000 hours were contributed to the dream before a single investor dollar was accepted.\n\nWhile hyperloop aims to reduce transit time and revolutionise public transport, it will have other wider ramifications \u2013 the density of city-living will be eased as more people would be able to live further away from city centres and still only take 20 minutes to get to work.\n\n\u201cWhere distant friends become neighbours and countries become neighbourhoods,\u201d says a very flashy promo video from HyperloopTT. Suburbs will become part of megacities and megacities will become megalopolis, breaking the limit of continental distance.\n\nBasically, it would take roughly an hour from Cape Town to Johannesburg with hyperloop. You\u2019d be able to live anywhere and still work in a city centre with a comfortable commute.\n\nWhile it may sound like it\u2019s decades away, De Leon says it\u2019s already here and they are ready to build. They already have partnership agreements in place for Abu Dhabi, India, Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cWe are starting from scratch without having to worry about legacy materials,\u201d adds De Leon.\n\nThey even created a brand new sensor-embedded carbon fibre material to make the capsules, aptly naming it after the super metal from Marvel comic books \u2013 Vibranium.\n\nThe capsule itself can be imagined as an airplane without wings, with windows that will have personalised augmented reality to make the experience of travel more enjoyable.\n\n\u201cBut we need to make sure that we can build the infrastructure without creating more problems.\u201d\n\nThe whole system needs to be adaptable to the cities and countries they will be built in, with minimal impact on the surrounding environment.\n\nSEE: Musk's Hyperloop project goes to China\n\nWhat are the criticisms of the hyperloop?\n\nWhile companies are gearing up hard and fast to make hyperloop a reality - like HyperloopTT - some have raised concerns that the rush to be the first to build it could overlook crucial issues.\n\nAnother issue raised is that the speeds of the hyperloop could affect certain parts of the population - especially the elderly - who would not be able to tolerate the strain put on the human body. Emergency exits are also another priority that hasn't been adequately addressed, as well as the need for willingness from governments to come onboard with constructing this system.\n\nREAD: Should SA invest in a hyperloop between Cape Town and Joburg?\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nHyperloopTT first needs to show off its prototype and license their designs to other transport companies for it to really take off, but it\u2019s not that far in the future. In fact, human trials are expected to start next year already.\n\n\u201cIf somebody tells you \u2018you can\u2019t do it\u2019, it\u2019s just because they haven\u2019t figured it out yet.\u201d\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
