It was still heading towards its worst weekly performance since mid-August, though.\n\nEurope's STOXX 600 index fared better, adding 0.5% as London's bourse outperformed on a weaker pound and hopes grew of progress towards resolving the trade war. Wall Street futures also suggested a bright start for U.S. markets, gaining around 0.3%. NQcv1\n\nInvestors focused on a whistleblower report that said Trump abused his office in trying to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit, and that the White House tried to \"lock down\" evidence about that conduct. report came after the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi this week launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has denied wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, chances of his being removed from office look slim given that the Republicans control the Senate, where any impeachment trial would be held. we are waiting to see is how this might impact the U.S.-China trade negotiations,\" said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\"It's that combination this week of weakening economic data and rising political uncertainty that has caused some tricky periods in markets.\"", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares rise as trade optimism muffles impeachment noise", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1Q06W_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
