The test ended in a draw Getty\n\nTube drivers are provided with ear defenders if required. Passengers are not.\n\nThe next worst stretch in The Independent survey was on the Central line between Liverpool Street and Bethnal Green, which hit 102 decibels.\n\nThere are no legal limits on the amount of noise or vibration that can be emitted from trains operating on existing railways.\n\nLike the Northern, the Central is one of the older deep Tube lines. For reasons of economy while building, the tunnels were dug directly beneath streets on the surface.\n\nBetween Bank and Liverpool Street, for example, the Central turns by 90 degrees to change course from Cheapside to Old Broad Street.\n\nThe Victoria and Jubilee lines are more modern with fewer curves.\n\nThe maximum readings on both these lines were in the high 90s \u2013 well above the level at which Health and Safety Executive (HSE) rules come into effect for workers in factories.\n\nDistorted public-address announcements added to the din.\n\nBut passengers waiting on the platform could experience even higher levels of noise for departing trains, especially at the end of the platform where trains are accelerating away.\n\nOn the northbound Jubilee line platform at Green Park, a peak reading of 98 decibels was taken.\n\nThe RMT union says the problem is particularly acute on stretches when a particular kind of rail fastening, known as Pandrol Vanguard, is fitted. The go-slow applies only to those sections.\n\nThe union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cMy members will be instructed to drive trains in manual mode at an appropriate reduced speed to mitigate the creation of excessive noise and to alleviate the distraction, discomfort and anxiety caused in the affected areas.\u201d\n\nThe drivers\u2019 industrial action is likely to disrupt the affected lines severely, particularly in rush hours. The Tube system is tuned to operate at maximum efficiency with trains running at the shortest intervals possible.\n\nTrains running at reduced speed on some sections will sharply reduce the number of services that can run, increasing waiting times and crowding on trains and platforms.\n\nIn terms of passenger complaints, the Northern Line is regarded as by far the noisiest. In the year to June 2019, Transport for London received a total of 331 complaints for the Northern Line. In second place with 46 was the Jubilee; third, with 31, the Victoria Line; and fourth, with 27, the Central Line.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe have met with the RMT on a number of occasions on the plans we have to tackle Tube noise and look forward to continuing to work with them to find a resolution.\n\n\u201cWe have already agreed to provide a broader range of ear protection to drivers who wish to use it alongside plans for longer-term solutions.\n\nThe HSE says: \u201cNoise at work can cause irreversible hearing damage. It is one of the commonest health problems and can be difficult to detect as the effects build up gradually over time.\n\n\u201cWherever there is noise exposure at work employers should be looking for ways of working that would reduce the noise or mean that people are exposed for shorter times.\u201d\n\nNoise on the Tube has increased since a programme of replacing old wooden sleepers with the current industry standard of concrete sleepers began early in the 2000s.\n\nBut Ian Robins, a former civil engineer on the London Underground, said: \u201cNoise has been a problem ever since the system opened in 1865, with steam locomotives.\n\n\u201cEven with electric trains, it\u2019s always been a problem with steel wheels running on steel rails in a confined space, particularly going around tight bends.\u201d\n\nMore modern lines on the Paris Metro run on rubber tyres, though these are neither as efficient nor as long-lasting as steel wheels.", "description": "Screech, rattle and grind: as Tube drivers on four London Underground lines prepare to go slow on key stretches of the network, The Independent has recorded sound levels for passengers of up to 107.7 decibels.
