The internet has sabotaged the long-held narrative that Adults Don\u2019t Take Drugs. The truth is out there, on every Facebook group and Instagram photo and Twitter joke: drugs are not the vice of the poor, forever falling at hurdles because they put addiction ahead of anything else. Such a premise is foolhardy and cruel, one that hopes to lean on ancient talking points with the goal of encouraging an equally ancient voting block, and one that discounts why many take drugs in the first place. But it worked for him in the last election, so it makes sense not much else has changed.\n\nThese are the words of a man desperate to pass something he promised and equally desperate to please conservatives. It doesn\u2019t matter that experts in the field have insisted drug testing welfare recipients does not work. It doesn\u2019t matter that other countries have tried and failed. It doesn\u2019t matter that the government has previously created guidelines for itself that Australia would not stigmatise or criminalise addiction.\n\nAll that matters is that the Australian people see Scott Morrison standing up for everyone Having A Go To Get A Go, rapidly encouraging a class divide that he and the people that work around him hope will benefit him in the months going forward.\n\nHere\u2019s to another class war.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1164124550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
