Gaal is coming forward for the first time.\n\nFranco\u2019s publicist did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. He has previously called similar allegations inaccurate.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the name of the school Franco founded is Studio 4, not Studio 24.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two actresses have sued James Franco and the acting and film school he founded, saying the actor intimidated his students into gratuitous and exploitative sexual situations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dalton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/james_franco_22384_c0-629-4568-3292_s1770x1032.jpg?6adf100ded9662c29a71ca414c4017a87d0196b3"}
