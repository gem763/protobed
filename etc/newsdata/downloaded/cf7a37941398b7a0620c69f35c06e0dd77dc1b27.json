In English, Bass only said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s views \u201cdeeply offended\u201d many in China.\n\nMorey tweeted a now-deleted image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d in reference to four months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, which has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement. As a result of the tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 whose president is Yao Ming, the former Rockets center \u2014 said Sunday it was suspending its relationship with the team, and Chinese media giant Tencent and Chinese state television said they would no longer be broadcasting Rockets games.\n\nBoth Morey and the NBA then said his tweets do not represent the Rockets or the league.\n\nThe divergent language in the NBA\u2019s Chinese Weibo statement appears to be an effort to assuage people in China who have expressed outrage over Morey\u2019s initial tweet, though Monday\u2019s post appeared to be insufficient for many on Weibo. Commenters accused Morey of supporting Hong Kong independence and called on Chinese basketball fans to boycott the NBA.\n\nCalls to the NBA\u2019s offices in Beijing and Shanghai rang unanswered Monday, a national holiday.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet prompted a wave of censure from Chinese companies.\n\nA search Monday for Houston Rockets merchandise on Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao turned up zero results. Li-Ning, a major Chinese sporting goods brand, said in a statement Sunday that it was suspending cooperation with the Rockets because of Morey\u2019s \u201cmistaken remarks.\u201d Hupu, a sports news website, has likewise suspended all coverage of the Rockets and locked the section of its website previously dedicated to the team.\n\nMeanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers have condemned the NBA for succumbing to Chinese censorship.\n\nThe NBA has allowed its players and coaches to be outspoken on social and political issues in the United States, which makes this move stand out.\n\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the framework of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d which promises the territory certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland. Some anti-government protesters in recent months have violently expressed their opposition to the ruling Communist Party.", "description": "In English, the NBA said Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey\u2019s comments were \u2018regrettable.\u2019 On its official Chinese social media account, it said they were...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS775_ap_roc_ZG_20191007093536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
