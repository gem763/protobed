The report says growth is expected to rise to 1.0 % in 2020, which is 0.7 percentage point lower than in April.\n\nGrowth is seen reaching 1.3% in 2021, 0.5 percentage point lower than the April estimate.\n\n\"These large downward revisions reflect the sharp slowdown in real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019, low investor sentiment, and persisting policy uncertainty, including whether a solution could be found for Eskom, fiscal slippages would be averted, and structural reforms would be undertaken,\" said the report.\n\nIt noted that a combination of power cuts, low business confidence, and political uncertainty prolonged the decline in investment and dampened consumption and export growth.\n\nWeak recovery\n\nIn September, ratings agency Moody's cut down the country's growth forecast for 2019 from 1% in June to 0.7%, because of slow pace in policy implementation and low investor confidence.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s fragile economic growth has faced headwinds from different directions, including the ongoing challenges of high unemployment and inequality.\n\nThe National Treasury forecast growth of 1.5% in the February budget, and a new estimate is likely to be announced in the mid-term budget later this month.\n\nImpact on Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nAverage growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was expected to rise modestly, from 2.5% in 2018 to 2.6% in 2019. This would reach 3.1% in 2020 and 3.2% in 2021. Excluding Nigeria, South Africa and Angola, growth in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa is projected at 4.0 % in 2019.\n\n\"Africa\u2019s economies are not immune to what is happening in the rest of the world, and this is reflected in the subdued growth rates across the region,\" said Albert Zeufack, Chief Economist for Africa at the World Bank.\n\nThe World Bank added that recovery in these countries, which are the region\u2019s three largest economies, \"has remained weak and is weighing on the region\u2019s prospects\". South Africa's overall fiscal deficit is expected to increase significantly, it said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The World Bank has revised down South Africa\u2019s growth prospects for this year and the next two years, citing continued policy uncertainty and the financial burden presented by Eskom to the fiscus.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8995/9399c6aaabdd4d79ab9938523fdc85d3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
