You\u2019ll lose it.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys will face an Eagles team which has also struggled with erratic form this year.\n\nThe 2018 Super Bowl champions were humbled 38-20 by Minnesota last week, prompting head coach Doug Pederson to offer a bold prediction for this weekend\u2019s showdown in Texas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going down to Dallas and our guys are gonna be ready to play,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win that football game and when we do, we\u2019re in first place in the NFC East.\u201d\n\nGarrett refused to take the bait when told of Pederson\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the challenge,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThey are a great football team. We are going to focus on the challenge to play great football Sunday night.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Roadtrip to recovery? \u2013\n\nWhile the Cowboys remain very much in the hunt at the top of the NFC East, the Los Angeles Rams have a smaller margin for error.\n\nAfter three straight losses, last season\u2019s Super Bowl runners-up are in danger of being left behind in the NFC West, where the San Francisco 49ers (5-0) and the Seattle Seahawks (5-1) are setting the early pace.\n\nA leaky offensive line has left quarterback Jared Goff struggling for form, with the 2016 No.1 draft pick throwing as many interceptions (7) as he has touchdowns in six games so far.\n\nA niggling injury to star running back Todd Gurley has also blunted the Rams\u2019 cutting edge, while injuries and departures have compromised the defense.\n\nThe Rams moved to address some of the personnel issues this week by pulling off a blockbuster deal for Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey while acquiring linebacker Kenny Young.\n\nThe good news for the Rams is that they are heading into a run of games where they will be expected to pick up wins, starting with this Sunday\u2019s assignment in Georgia against the Atlanta Falcons (1-5), followed by the Cincinnati Bengals (0-6) on October 27, which will take place in London.\n\nGoff hopes the long stint on the road for the Rams can help knit the squad back together.\n\n\u201cYou hope it\u2019s galvanizing,\u201d Goff said. \u201cWe will be in Atlanta for a little while, but it\u2019s one week at a time. We got to go out and get better and do a lot of things better next Sunday to beat Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re another good team and we\u2019ll be in their place. It\u2019s another good opportunity for us and we\u2019ve got a good chance to make it happen.\u201d\n\nEven a win this weekend however may not alter the Rams pursuit of the 49ers, who will be heavily favoured to extend their perfect start at the Washington Redskins (1-5_ on Sunday.\n\nThe league\u2019s only other unbeaten team, the New England Patriots, travel to the New York Jets on Monday chasing a 7-0 start.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Rams will attempt to get their faltering seasons back on track on Sunday after a run of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/2433c2_dak-prescott-ezekiel-elliott-aim-get-dallas-cowboys-offensive-game-on-track-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
