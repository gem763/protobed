If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nThe first time I hosted Thanksgiving dinner, I was a wreck. You would think that years of working in restaurant kitchens would have prepared me for the big day, but it really hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have anything I needed and I resorted to barking out orders to my family members as if they were line cooks in my restaurant. Not exactly the way I wanted to spend my day off! After the chaos dissipated, I reflected on the day to see what went wrong. It all came down to my cooking tools, and I didn't have what I needed to get the job done.\n\nIn addition to the intangible things (like making a to-do list, doing prep work in advance, and clearing out room in the refrigerator for all the turkey-day food), there are a few equipment necessities that will make your Thanksgiving Day go that much smoother, like the Viking Culinary Stainless Steel Roasting Pan\u2014the best roasting pan we've tested here at Reviewed.\n\nAnd, since we'd rather not recommend any unitasker tools that are only useful once a year, we tested over 125 products (and researched countless more) to make sure you can put this stuff to good use all year long.\n\nHere are the best Thanksgiving tools that we've tested here at Reviewed. I've also added a few of my personal favorites, too.\n\nFor the Turkey\n\nEveryone knows the turkey is the star of the show, and these tools will help you prepare the perfect bird! From cooking to carving, we tested all the essential equipment you'll need to make this iconic Thanksgiving main dish.\n\n1. The Best Roasting pan: Viking 3-Ply Roasting Pan w/ Non-Stick Rack\n\nA good roasting pan is a Thanksgiving essential. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMost people think of a roasting pan as a Thanksgiving essential, and it definitely is: Talk about a fuss-free way to cook up a turkey! But, you can also use a well-built one year-round for sheet pan meals or cooking a roast for a crowd, making it worth investing in a good one. The tri-ply stainless steel construction definitely gives it some heft, but the handles are super wide and comfortable, distributing the pan's weight nicely. It had excellent heat distribution as well. It's big and sturdy enough to handle a 20-pound turkey and it's capable of cooking anything you throw at it.\n\nGet the Viking 3-Ply Roasting Pan w/ Non-Stick Rack on Amazon for $99.98\n\nSee all of the roasting pans tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n2. The Best Probe Thermometer: ThermoWorks ChefAlarm\n\nDon't undercook your turkey! Confidently toss it into the oven and forget about it until it beeps by probing it with this top-performing probe thermometer. In addition to being the most accurate probe we tested, it also has a nice backlight display. You can use it as a timer, adjust the alarm's volume, or use it to keep track of the minimum and maximum readings. We especially love its hinged tilting screen for easy viewing on the countertop, but it also has a magnet and a clip if that works better for your kitchen. Spending $60 on a thermometer might not be for everyone, but, this model is well worth the price tag, not only for your Thanksgiving Day meal but also if you're serious about barbecue, making cheese, or boiling sugar for candy.\n\nGet the ThermoWorks ChefAlarm from ThermoWorks for $64\n\nSee all of the probe thermometers tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n3. The Best Digital Thermometer: ThermoWorks ThermoPop\n\nIf monitoring your turkey's temperature from inside the oven isn't important to you, pick up a ThermoPop instead. It immediately impressed us with its super quick, accurate readings and its beautiful appearance. The probe is long enough to keep your hands safely away from any hot steam. It also features a super thin tip that didn\u2019t allow for many poultry juices to escape after probing. With a click of a super soft button, the display rotates 360 degrees for ease of viewing. Another click and the backlight illuminates the large numbers.\n\nGet the ThermoWorks ThermoPop from ThermoWorks for $34\n\nSee all of the digital meat thermometers tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n4. The Best Fat Separator: OXO Good Grips Good Gravy Fat Separator \u2013 4 Cup\n\nFat separators might not be the sexiest gadget in the kitchen, but you'll need one if you're hoping to make a killer gravy this year. By design, bottom-draining separators make it almost impossible to pass a lot of fatty-liquid through their valves because the fat floats on the top. Some of them have temperamental levers, but the trigger on this model is super easy to control and by design will minimize splashing, creating less mess than some of the other models we tested. There's also a pour spout on the top, which makes it much easier to remove the fat left behind. And, since the lever mechanism is located on the outside of the separator, we had no problems when it came time to clean everything up.\n\nGet the OXO Good Grips Good Gravy 4-Cup Fat Separator on Amazon for $24.95\n\nSee all of the fat separators tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n5. The Best Poultry Shears: J.A. Henckels International Poultry Shears\n\nIf you prefer preparing a spatchcocked turkey, you\u2019ll need a good pair of poultry shears. It's easy enough, but you do need to cut out the backbone (which, as the name implies, is lined with a bunch of bones that'll destroy your expensive knives). I love my J.A. Henckels set because they\u2019re easy to handle and their super-sharp blade cuts through tough turkey bones like they\u2019re butter. They're easy enough to sharpen when they get dull and they lock for safe, easy storage. It\u2019s always nice when you don\u2019t cut your hand digging through your gadget drawer!\n\nGet the J.A. Henckels International Henckels Poultry Shears on Amazon for $19.95\n\nSee all of the knife sets we tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n6. The Best Carving Knife: Mercer Culinary Renaissance 11\" Granton Edge Slicing Knife\n\nThis carving knife came in my culinary school knife kit, and it\u2019s so sharp I\u2019ve never had reason to replace it! After you\u2019ve spent all that time and money to prepare your turkey, you definitely want to present it just right. You could use your Chef\u2019s knife, but there\u2019s something ceremonious about pulling out a good carving knife. Plus, since you don\u2019t use it as frequently, chances are good it\u2019s razor-sharp when you need it. You\u2019ll quickly and easily be able to carve up your turkey and present perfect slices.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t come as a set, but you can also pick up the matching carving fork. I usually use a set of kitchen tongs, but the fork certainly looks nicer and gives you better control.\n\nGet the Mercer Culinary Renaissance 11\" Granton Edge Slicing Knife on Amazon for $27\n\nSee all of the chef knives we tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n7. The Best Electric Carving Knife: Black & Decker EK500B\n\nThere are two stand-out factors that make the Black and Decker EK500B 9-Inch Electric Carving Knife our favorite. First, it aced all of our performance tests, but that's not what impressed us the most. The Black and Decker also has the most comfortable handle and was the quietest knife we tested. The round handle fit perfectly in our hands and stayed put, even when our hands were covered in chicken grease. The knife created little to no vibrations, making it easy to keep our finger locked onto the trigger without slipping. Since the Black and Decker is regularly priced at under $20, it also happens to be the best value, too. I would happily use this knife regularly to slice homemade bread or quickly break down a roast, but that price makes it attractive even if you only pull it out on the holidays.\n\nGet the Black & Decker EK500B on Amazon for $17.99\n\nSee all of the electric knives tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n8. The Best Carving Board: Teakhaus Rectangle Carving Board With Hand Grips\n\nWhen we tested cutting boards, we split the winners into three categories. Our favorite bamboo cutting board was great for any task in the kitchen, but the Teakhaus' size and heft made it more of a specialty board than a catch-all winner. It happens to be perfect for resting and carving a Thanksgiving turkey, though, because it can easily hold a 25-pound bird! It also happens to be a gorgeous piece that makes a stylish addition to your kitchen counter. The use of teak (a high-oil wood) fought off moisture better than the other wooden boards and it held the largest amount of liquid (2/3 cup) in its groves before spilling over.\n\nGet the Teakhaus Rectangle Carving Board With Hand Grips on Amazon for $108.95\n\nSee all of the cutting boards tested on Reviewed.com.\n\nFor the Side Dishes\n\nSometimes, I swear I like the side dishes more than the turkey itself. I know, I know, blasphemy! But these gadgets will help your mashed potatoes, vegetables, and casseroles turn out as delicious as the turkey!\n\nThe side dishes are just as important as the turkey. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n9. The Best Potato Ricer: Chef'n FreshForce Potato Ricer\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm serious about my mashed potatoes. It's my favorite side on the Thanksgiving table! And a potato ricer is the gadget you need to make fluffy, airy mashed potatoes. We loved the way this potato ricer effortlessly pushed the potatoes through the hopper, thanks to a gear-powered mechanism that requires less arm strength to use. It was the only ricer we tested that we could use one-handed with a whole potato (with the others we tested, we had to chop the potatoes up into small pieces to achieve one-handed pressing). The comfortable handle is made from a heavy-duty plastic, but the hopper itself is stainless steel, which is easier to clean and should last a long time. The simple two-construction design allows you to take the stainless steel basket out, making it both easy to fill and a breeze to clean.\n\nGet the Chef'n FreshForce Potato Ricer Press on Amazon for $20.50\n\nSee all of the potato ricers tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n10. The Best Mixing Bowls: Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids, Set of 3\n\nIf you ask me which I prefer (glass or stainless steel bowls), I'll say stainless every time. There\u2019s nothing to shatter or chip, making them both durable and long-lasting, and their lightweight profile makes them easy to use. While they shouldn\u2019t go into the microwave, they can be used on the stovetop as a double boiler\u2013and the small- and medium-sized bowls in the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids worked perfectly for melting butter and chocolate over a 2-quart saucepan. As a bonus, the bowls come with air-tight plastic lids, so each bowl doubles as storage and transportation container (always helpful when you're planning a large meal).\n\nGet the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids, Set of 3 on Amazon for $22.53\n\nSee all of the mixing bowls tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n11. The Best Glass Baking Dishes: Pyrex Easy Grab Bake 'N Store 8-pc Set\n\nThe best part about making casseroles for Thanksgiving? You can make them ahead of time and reheat them when it\u2019s time to serve the big meal! That means less scrambling on Thanksgiving Day (which, hopefully, gives you more time to mingle with your guests). These Pyrex casserole dishes certainly aren\u2019t fancy to look at, but I\u2019ve been using my set for years. They heat evenly, they're easy to clean, and those snap-on lids to make food storage a breeze.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a more presentation-worthy dish, pick up a Le Creuset Stoneware Rectangular Dish. It looks great when you want to go from oven to table, and it can also be put under the broiler (the one thing the Pyrex can't do).\n\nGet the Pyrex Easy Grab Bake 'N Store 8-pc Set from Home Depot for $22.97\n\nSee how to cook with Pyrex on Reviewed.com\n\n12. The Best Food Processor: Cuisinart DFP-14BCNY\n\nIf you don't feel like cutting anything this year, hook up your food processor instead. You can chop onions, celery, and garlic for stuffing and use the included attachment to slice potatoes or shred cheese. In fact, you can even make your pie crust in it! In our testing, the Cuisinart \"Custom 14\" food processor (model DFP\u201114BCNY) is the best on the market. It excels at almost every task, from chopping onions and slicing tomatoes as well as a razor-sharp chefs' knife, to kneading pizza dough into a smooth elastic ball. As an added bonus, the Cuisinart is so quiet while it's running that it won\u2019t shut down conversation in the kitchen! Cleanup is a cinch, as Cuisinart is the only manufacturer that actually encourages you to wash the parts in the dishwasher.\n\nGet the Cuisinart DFP-14BCNY on Amazon for $150.90\n\nSee all of the food processors tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n13. The Best Cast Iron Skillet: Lodge 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet\n\nI don't know about you, but I love my cast iron skillet! Some years, I skip the casserole dishes entirely and make my mac and cheese, stuffing, or cornbread straight in the cast iron. Lodge has been making its cast iron cookware since 1896, but its durability is one reason why Lodge has become a household name\u2014and why they make our favorite cast iron pan. The Lodge Logic 12-inch skillet sells for just under $20 on sale, but it's likely to last for generations. Our only complaint? It comes with no written warranty, though Lodge claims it will always stand behind its products.\n\nGet the Lodge 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet from Home Depot for $26.97\n\nSee all of the cast iron pans tested on Reviewed.com.\n\nGeneral Cooking Must-Haves\n\nWhether you're setting up your first kitchen or you're looking to make some upgrades, these cookware essentials will definitely come in handy on Thanksgiving Day. These staples can be used with multiple courses and make a great addition to your kitchen.\n\nYou'll need pots and pans to prepare all your favorite sauces and side dishes. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\n14. The Best Cookware Set: Cuisinart MCP-12N Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set\n\nYou'll need pots and pans to prepare all your favorite sauces and side dishes, so consider it a great excuse to upgrade your cookware set. The Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set is regularly on sale for just above $200, and you should definitely snatch one up if you see it hovering around that price. We love how easy thee pans are to use. The tri-ply construction gives the pans the benefit of heat conductivity, but the aluminum core ensures they\u2019re not too heavy to handle. The set includes everything you need to cook a meal: two saucepans (1 1/2- and 3-quart), an 8-quart stockpot, a medium-sized 3.5-quart saut\u00e9 pan, two skillets (8- and 10-inch), and a steamer insert\u2014all with comfortable handles and a design that creates a nice balance when holding the pan.\n\nGet the Cuisinart MCP-12N Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set on Amazon for $26.97\n\nSee all of the cookware sets tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n15. The Best Knife Set: Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic 18-pc Knife Block Set\n\nYou don't need every knife in the block to prepare Thanksgiving dinner, but this set gives you everything you'll need at a great value\u2014especially considering that it comes with eight really nice steak knives and a killer set of kitchen shears. The chef\u2019s knife (the one you'll probably use most often) is lightweight and easy to wield while also being one of the sharper knives in our test group. The paring knife fits perfectly in our hands for off-the-cutting-board activities like peeling apples, and the serrated bread knife made quick work at slicing crusty baguettes.\n\nGet the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic 18-pc Knife Block Set on Amazon for $279.99\n\nSee all of the knife sets tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n16. The Best Baking Sheet: Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker's Half Sheet\n\nPlanning on making cookies for Thanksgiving? Roasted vegetables? Tossing out your roasting pan in lieu of a spatchcocked turkey? You'll need a good baking sheet, and there\u2019s a reason this American-made baking sheet tops charts around the internet. It\u2019s lightweight, large enough to fit more than a dozen cookies, and distributes heat like a dream. Measuring 12 by 17 inches, we feel confident you could cook enough vegetables for a small crowd. Like all baking sheets, the biggest concern is always cleaning. We'd recommend using parchment paper or a Silpat mat under my cookies to ensure that nothing sticks. For meats and vegetables, you could also line the sheet with aluminum foil.\n\nGet the Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker's Half Sheet, 2-Pack on Amazon for $21.99\n\nSee all of the cookie and baking sheets tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n17. The Best Baking Rack: Checkered Chef Half-Sheet Stainless Steel Cooling Rack\n\nWire racks aren\u2019t just for cooling your cookies and cakes: Use one to line a baking sheet and you'll create the perfect convection cooking space. You see, the air will be able to circulate underneath your food, creating the crispiest bacon or Brussels sprouts on the block. You can also use it to cook a spatchcocked turkey. How could you say no to a method that creates perfectly crispy skin on 100 percent of your turkey? I can't!\n\nGet the Checkered Chef Half-Sheet Stainless Steel Cooling Rack on Amazon for $11.86\n\nFor Delicious Desserts\n\nI'm not sure you can call it Thanksgiving if you don't finish the meal with pie! Whip up your favorite apple pie, pumpkin bread, or other treat with these essential dessert-making tools.\n\nWhat's Thanksgiving without a pie? (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n18. The Best Pie Pan: Emile Henry Modern Classics Pie Dish\n\nIt's almost a Thanksgiving requirement to serve pie, so why not do it in style? You can't beat the Emile Henry Pie Dish for looks or turning out a pie with a crispy, flaky crust. It\u2019s made in France of ceramic and comes in lots of pretty colors. While this 9-by-2 inch dish is deep enough to hold almost two quarts of filling, we didn\u2019t find our pies came out skimpy looking. Its large capacity and attractive appearance make it a good choice for baking and serving other items like scalloped potatoes or candied sweets. As it can withstand high temperatures, you can run the Emile under the broiler if you want to brown off a lemon meringue pie or a mac and cheese casserole. Plus, it\u2019s microwave and dishwasher safe.\n\nGet the Emile Henry Modern Classics Pie Dish on Amazon for $29.99\n\nSee all of the pie dishes tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n19. The Best Loaf Pan: Rachael Ray Yum-o! Nonstick Oven Lovin' Loaf Pan\n\nIf you're more into pumpkin bread than pumpkin pie, a good loaf pan will be essential on Thanksgiving. This pan has a silly name and it doesn\u2019t look like a professional tool, but when it came to results and ease of use, we liked everything about it. The Rachael Ray Yum-o! Oven Lovin' Loaf Pan has large handles and silicone inserts in Rachael\u2019s signature orange color that make it super easy to get a firm grip on the pan. The nonstick finish never faltered, even when we didn\u2019t grease the pan. And the Rachael Ray is roomier than some of the others we tested, so meatloaf juices never bubbled over onto the oven floor. As it\u2019s safe up to 500\u00b0F, you can quickly brown off a crumb topping on an apple loaf, if need be.\n\nGet the Rachael Ray 54079 Yum-O Nonstick Bakeware Loaf Pan on Amazon for $29.99\n\nSee all of the loaf pans tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n20. The Best Rolling Pin: J.K. Adams Plain Maple Rolling Dowel\n\nWhen they say there\u2019s beauty in simplicity, they\u2019re talking about this rolling pin. It\u2019s really just a sturdy wooden cylinder of a medium-heavy weight, nothing more, nothing less. But during testing, it rolled out perfect dough every time. The simple design of this rolling pin, combined with its weight, makes it easy to control the amount of pressure you use based on what you need for your dough. Its long body and lack of handles also mean that you'll never cut an edge through your dough the way you sometimes might with smaller, handled rolling pins. This translates to an even, non-lumpy dough that's easy to shape however you want. Flour sticks to the pin just fine, which keeps dough from sticking while in use. The pin also cleans up easily. The only downside is that, depending on the size of your kitchen, it might be tough to put this beauty away. Its 19-inch length simply makes it harder to tuck into a drawer.\n\nGet the J.K. Adams Plain Maple Rolling Dowel on Amazon for $22.76\n\nSee all of the rolling pins tested on Reviewed.com.\n\nDon't Forget the Leftovers (and Cleanup)!\n\nEvery year, I forget about storing the leftovers! You can totally make it work with aluminum foil and plastic wrap, but this is a better option. And once you've tucked those away, we have a few suggestions for a better cleanup.\n\nDon't forget about storing the leftovers! (Photo: Getty Images / JodiJacobson)\n\n21. The Best Storage Containers: Pyrex Ultimate 10-pc Storage Set\n\nA really nice set of reusable containers should be ready during dinner cleanup. We love that these containers nest within each other for easy storage, they don't impart off-flavors into our food, and they're marked as dishwasher-, microwave-, and oven-safe. It also doesn't hurt that they aced every test we could think of. They didn't leak water when we sloshed them around and didn't burst open or shatter when we dropped them from a countertop. When we froze them, expanding food didn't break through the seal and they resisted stains.\n\nGet the Pyrex Ultimate 10-pc Storage Set on Amazon for $84.55\n\nSee all of the storage containers tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n22. The Best Dish Towels: Williams Sonoma All-Purpose Pantry Towels\n\nWashing the Thanksgiving dishes can be a daunting task, but the classic pantry towels from Williams Sonoma can help you get the job done without any fuss. Not only do these towels look good in any kitchen (choose from six colors), but they're a pro at drying irregular objects like wine glasses and vases while still feeling soft to the touch. Made from ribbon cotton terry, the towels retain more water than its competitors, which means it should be able to wipe water from plenty of dishes before you need to grab another one.\n\nGet the Williams Sonoma All-Purpose Pantry Towels from William Sonoma for $19.95\n\nSee all of the dish towels tested on Reviewed.com.\n\n23. The Best Dish Rack: PremiumRacks Professional Dish Rack\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to run your good china, crystal, and silver through the dishwasher (or you don\u2019t have a dishwasher), a good dish rack is essential for an organized post-Thanksgiving dinner cleanup. Our favorite is this PremiumRacks Professional, a smartly designed double-decker that holds more dishes than others we tested, without leaving a very large countertop footprint. The bottom portion is your standard featureless rack, but the top holds plates more securely than most of the racks we tested. A cutlery basket hooks onto the side, as does a second basket that can be topped with a lid specifically designed for sharp knives. There\u2019s even a special attachment to dry your cutting boards. The rack also comes with two drain board options\u2014one meant to let water pool, and the other designed to tip any water into the sink\u2014plus a microfiber cloth to set underneath.\n\nGet the PremiumRacks Professional Dish Rack on Amazon for $59.99\n\nSee all of the dish racks tested on Reviewed.com.\n\nFor more kitchen cleanup favorites, including paper towels, sponges and trash cans, check out our guide, The Best Kitchen Essentials.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
