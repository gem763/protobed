Bill Flores announces retirement from House", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Bill Flores announced his plans to retire on Wednesday, becoming the fifth Texas Republican to leave Congress.\n\nMr. Flores, elected in 2010, said when he first ran for Congress, he planned to only serve at most six terms. He wants to honor that commitment by ending his time in office on his fifth term.\n\n\u201cFollowing the end of my current term in January 2021, I look forward to spending much more time with my family and our grandchildren. I also intend to resume business activities in the private sector and to stay politically active on a federal, state and local level,\u201d he wrote in a statement.\n\nSo far in 2019, about a dozen Republicans have already announced their plans not to run for reelection, including several from Texas.\n\nThe Democratic campaign arm has dubbed the surge \u201cTexodus\u201d as the party eyes vulnerable purple districts.\n\n\u201cCongressman Flores is now the fifth Texas Republican to retire as the DCCC\u2019s early and aggressive investment in Texas\u2019s swing districts lays the groundwork for victory in 2020,\u201d DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos said in a statement. \u201cAs more and more of their colleagues consider leaving Washington early, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that the Texodus will continue.\u201d\n\nMr. Flores\u2018 seat, in a solidly Republican district, should be safe for the GOP.\n\nHowever, according to The Cook Political report, three Texas districts \u2014 currently held by Reps. Pete Olson and Kenny Marchant \u2014 are toss-ups, while Rep. Will Hurd\u2019s district is leaning Democratic.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
