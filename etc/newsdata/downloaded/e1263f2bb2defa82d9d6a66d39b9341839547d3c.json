Their monetary policy is decided by the ECB, which is based in Frankfurt. However, their fiscal policies are decided at the national level \u2013 which often creates discrepancies and makes the region more exposed to financial shocks.\n\nWhile some countries argue that they need to share more when it comes to fiscal policy, other capitals are reluctant to delegate more power to European institutions, fearing to lose control over their economies or having to finance high-indebted nations.\n\n\"To have a stronger EMU (economic and monetary union), we need a common euro zone budget. Clearly the political debate on that still has a long way to go. But I am optimistic,\" Draghi said, supporting a plan that the French President, Emmanuel Macron, has tried to implement.\n\nLed by the French delegation, European finance ministers agreed to create a common euro zone budget earlier this year. However, details of how it will be financed and how big it will be have yet to be agreed upon. Nonetheless, the compromise that has been achieved between the 19 capitals is far less ambitious than the original proposal from President Macron.\n\nDraghi has often criticized member states for not doing enough to support the euro economy. He said that monetary policy alone cannot lift the moribund growth and inflation levels seen in the region.\n\nHe told the FT that more government support \"could greatly help\" lower the pressure on the central bank.\n\nDraghi ends his eight-year mandate at the ECB on October 31. Christine Lagarde will take over from Draghi on November 1.\n\nRead the full FT story here.", "description": "The outgoing president of the European Central Bank (ECB) has called on euro countries to commit to further integration \u2013 in what's a controversial and dividing topic among the 19 nations.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105624028-1544647618742gettyimages-1032784398.jpeg?v=1560954228", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
