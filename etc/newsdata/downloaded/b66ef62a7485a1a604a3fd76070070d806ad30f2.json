By invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union, the British government began a two-year process, which was supposed to end with its departure from the 28-member bloc in March 2019.\n\nLawmakers, however, have twice delayed Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, repeatedly rejecting a deal struck between former prime minister Theresa May's government and the trading bloc. The EU eventually agreed to postpone Brexit until Oct. 31; current Prime Minister Johnson says the UK must leave the EU by the end of October -- even if there\u2019s no deal in place that sets up the parameters of the divorce, like trade and the rights of European citizens living in the UK.\n\nWhile campaigning, pro-Brexiters played up fears about a rise in immigration, promised to secure more money for the publicly funded National Health Service, restore national sovereignty, free the island nation from European oversight and spark economic growth.\n\nWhat does a no-deal Brexit mean?\n\nA no-deal Brexit means that if the UK and EU are unable to strike an agreement before the end of October, the UK will just leave without one.\n\nBasically, within an instant, the UK would lose access to the EU\u2019s single market and customs union arrangements, which could have serious ramifications for international commerce, the Irish border, the divorce settlement (it\u2019s estimated the UK owes roughly 39 billion pounds to the EU), immigration and the British economy.\n\nWithout a deal, trade between the UK and the EU would fall under parameters set by the World Trade Organization -- meaning tariffs would apply to most goods sent from the UK to the European bloc.\n\nMost economists believe a no-deal Brexit -- also referred to as a \u201chard\u201d exit -- would result in economic calamity.\n\nRight now, the UK has less than two months to negotiate a deal with the EU before the scheduled Oct. 31 departure. And last week, Johnson said he would suspend Parliament for five weeks, starting as early as Sept. 9, giving opposition lawmakers far less time to come up with a plan to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday, though, opposition lawmakers managed to take control of the government -- dealing a major blow to Johnson and allowing them to introduce a bill on Wednesday forcing him to seek a delay on Brexit until at least Jan. 31, according to the BBC.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, exactly, happens next: Immediately afterward, Johnson told reporters he would move forward with a call for a general election in October if the legislation to block a no-deal Brexit succeeds, possibly giving him the chance to solidify his base in Parliament.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost the parliamentary majority. What does that mean?\n\nIn the latest twist in the Brexit saga, the Conservative Party lost its working majority while Johnson was in the middle of a Parliamentary address.\n\nIn theory, losing his majority jeopardizes his ability to remain prime minister. But as Bloomberg News reported, Johnson will likely remain in power a little bit longer: There are still 20 independent members of Parliament, many of whom will likely be reluctant to oust Johnson with a no-confidence vote and risk an election that could allow the Labour Party to take control.\n\nWho is Phillip Lee?\n\nAt the center of Tuesday\u2019s drama was Phillip Lee. After 27 years in the Conservative Party, Lee publicly defected (in the middle of Johnson\u2019s speech) to the Liberal Democrats, leaving the government with no majority.\n\nIn a statement, Lee said he made the decision over concerns about the referendum and Brexit.\n\n\u201cSadly, the Brexit process has helped to transform this once great party into something more akin to a narrow faction, wherein an individual\u2019s \u2018conservatism\u2019 is measured by how recklessly one wishes to leave the European Union,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps most disappointingly, it has increasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism.\u201d\n\nCould Brexit affect U.S. consumers?\n\nIt depends whether the UK leaves the EU with a deal, and once the split is finalized, what type of trade agreement it strikes with the U.S.\n\nAt the beginning of June, President Trump vowed to double or triple trade with the UK.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous promise in that trade deal,\u201d Trump told reporters during his state visit to Britain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about Brexit.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/brexit-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
