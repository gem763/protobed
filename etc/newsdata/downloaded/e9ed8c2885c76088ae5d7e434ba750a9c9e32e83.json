It said fiscal spending at the end of the month will offset maturities, according to a statement. Another 290 billion yuan is maturing in the next three days.\n\nWhether China will act to slow the sudden downward spiral in government debt has become a key question for investors. Monday\u2019s effective net withdrawal spooked a bond market already under pressure from returning risk appetite, with China\u2019s 10-year yields surging the most since April. Selling momentum on sovereign notes was the strongest since late 2017.\n\nStill, analysts expect the central bank will inject one-year cash via a targeted tool this week. Zhaopeng Xing, a markets economist at ANZ Bank China Co., predicts more than 300 billion yuan in targeted medium-term loans will be offered Wednesday. A spike in 12-month interest-rate swaps shows traders are pricing in tighter liquidity.\n\nThe yield on China\u2019s benchmark government bonds has jumped about 30 basis points since a low in September, as optimism increases that the country will soon sign a partial trade deal with the U.S. Accelerating inflation also adds pressure to the bond market, as it means Beijing won\u2019t want to inject too much liquidity and risk inflating prices further.\n\nBonds were little changed in early Tuesday trading.", "description": "China Bonds Steady as Central Bank Lets $35 Billion Funds Mature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic93b0aec87b040be2876e448658aaf614.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
