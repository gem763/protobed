Thanks to Rafael Behr.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n3. \u201cNigel Farage is the Brexit Icarus. Here\u2019s how he can see us fly out of the EU to freedom.\u201d Tweet from Telegraph Politics advertising an article by Hunter DuBose last month. The article itself got the story right, warning Farage against hubris. Nominated by David Lister and Trevor Greetham.\n\n4. \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d Chris Rowland nominated \u201cFDR\u2019s recursive rhetoric from his first inauguration\u201d in 1933.\n\n5. \u201cThe French president has more influence over the length of our extension than the British prime minister.\u201d David Lammy, Labour MP, on Thursday. He voted for the Benn Act and the Letwin amendment, and against any Brexit deal, which meant Boris Johnson was required to agree an extension with the EU leaders, any one of whom had a veto. \u201cThis is a teeny bit like Tostig accusing his brother of losing control of the Humber to Harald Hardrada,\u201d commented Tom Holland, the historian. Thanks to Tom Harris.\n\n6. \u201cWe will do precisely what the British nation has done all through its history when it had its back to the wall \u2013 turn round and fight.\u201d John Major really said it, after poor local election results, 5 May 1995. From David Boothroyd.\n\n7. Nominating Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader to \u201cbroaden the debate\u201d, as Margaret Beckett and others (including Sadiq Khan) did in 2015, although only she was honest enough to admit afterwards that she had made a mistake. Nominated by Max Calo.\n\n8. \u201cYou can\u2019t win anything with kids.\u201d Alan Hansen, Match of the Day presenter, in August 1995, criticising Sir Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United. Often mocked for getting it wrong, but it qualifies for inclusion here because it is also self-refuting.\n\n9. \u201cGetting seriously worried that HMG will pull the bill if the programme motion is defeated. Surely best for all of us who regard this deal as the least of the evils to vote for the programme motion, whatever we really think of it.\u201d Sir Oliver Letwin, independent Conservative MP, on Tuesday, three days after his amendment to delay the Brexit vote was passed. According to Matt Chorley of The Times, Sir Oliver received his knighthood for \u201cservices to overcomplicating things\u201d.\n\n10. \u201cIf you set up a school and it becomes a good school, the great danger is that everyone wants to go there.\u201d John Prescott, deputy prime minister, explained his worries about academy schools in December 2005.\n\nNext week: TV series that changed lead part way through, starting with Doctor Who.\n\nComing soon: Telegrams, such as Lord Charles Beresford declining an invitation from the Prince of Wales: \u201cCan\u2019t possibly stop lie follows by post.\u201d\n\nYour suggestions please, and ideas for future Top 10s, to me on Twitter, or by email to top10@independent.co.uk", "description": "Thanks to Niall, who spotted Flick Drummond\u2019s fairytale, No 1 on this list.\u00a0 1. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly popular; he\u2019s like the Pied Piper.\u201d Flick Drummond, Conservative former MP, defended Boris Johnson last month, saying: \u201cThey are all out to get him at the moment.\u201d There are several versions of the medieval legend of the \u201cPied Piper of Hamelin\u201d, but they tend to end badly, with the", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/12/pied-piper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
