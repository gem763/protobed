Header tanks mounted in tip of nosecone to offset engine weight at rear,\u2019 Musk shared in the tweet\n\nAlthough Musk has high hopes for this rocket, scientist recently poured cold water on the extravagant plans, saying the first manned trip to Mars would not happen for at least a decade and that Musk\u2019s project was \u2018a fantasy\u2019.\n\nDavid Whitehouse, a former BBC science correspondent, said: \u2018Elon Musk talked about sending thousands of people to Mars in a few years... That\u2019s not going to happen at all. When will we land on Mars? Not in the 2020s.\u2019 He explained that \u2013 unlike trips to the Moon, which 12 people have now walked on \u2013 Mars is a \u2018different kettle of fish\u2019.\n\nBut it seems the billionaire is not giving up.\n\nThe short clip appears to show Musk standing in the center of the cargo bay as he swirls his smartphone around to give users a good look.\n\nUp until today, Musk has only shared images and video of the ship's exterior.\n\nWHAT IS ELON MUSK'S 'BFR'? The BFR (Big F***ing Rocket), now known as Starship, will complete all missions and is smaller than the ones Musk announced in 2016. The SpaceX CEO said the rocket would take its first trip to the red planet in 2022, carrying only cargo, followed by a manned mission in 2024 and claimed other SpaceX's products would be 'cannibalised' to pay for it. The rocket would be partially reusable and capable of flight directly from Earth to Mars. Once built, Musk believes the rocket could be used for travel on Earth - saying that passengers would be able to get anywhere in under an hour.\n\nOn Saturday, September 28, the tech tycoon shared pictures of the completed rocket as it sits waiting at SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas facility -- with hopes of hitting orbit within six months\n\nHowever, the latest video gives the public the first look of just how massive this prototype, stainless steel rocket actually is.\n\nMusk livestreamed the official unveiling of the spacecraft and said that the space venture's Starship is expected to take off for the first time in about one or two months and reach 65,000 feet before landing back on Earth.\n\nThe short clip appears to show Musk standing in the center of the cargo bay as he swirls his smartphone around to give users a good look. Up until today, Musk has only shared images and video of the ship's exterior\n\n'This is the fastest path to a self-sustaining city on Mars,' he said Saturday night.\n\nHe explained that it's essential for the viability of space travel to be able to reuse spacecraft and that it's important to take steps to extend consciousness beyond our planet.\n\nTech entrepreneur Musk and his SpaceX team have proposed developing infrastructure on Mars and aim to get humans on the red planet by 2024.\n\nWhitehouse told an audience at Henley Literary Festival just days ago that \u2018The Moon is three days away and you can get back with no problem.;\n\nMusk says September 28 marked the 11th anniversary of a SpaceX rocket reaching orbit for the first time\n\n'Mars is at least nine months away... It\u2019s probably a three-year round trip \u2013 so there is no coming back if there is a problem.'\n\nIt means you need a much better spacecraft, it means you have to have life cycles and recycling, because you can\u2019t take all the food you need to go there.\n\nFlash in a pan: Rocket in TV series in 1936\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t take all the oxygen you need, you need to recycle it. Experiments show the degradation of the human body is worse than we thought, particularly mental impairment \u2013 and that\u2019s after just a year in space.\n\nAlso there\u2019s radiation and that\u2019s worse than we thought. And the expense.\u2019 However, at the SpaceX launch pad in Texas on Saturday, Musk told a crowd: \u2018We need to make space travel like air travel.\u2019\n\nHe said the critical breakthrough would be making \u2018a rapidly reusable orbital rocket\u2019.\n\nSpaceX currently flies two kinds of rocket \u2013 the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, the world\u2019s most powerful rocket \u2013 for NASA, the US Air Force and private satellite firms. It is planned that Starship will eventually fly atop a new booster rocket, the Super Heavy.", "description": "SpaceX CEO has shared numerous images of Starship's exterior - but today Elon Musk took us inside.
