I wouldn't answer the phone. I wouldn't answer the door. I didn't wash, I didn't get dressed. It was sordid. Awful.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"Eventually, I realised that if I carried on for a couple more days, I'd either overdose or have a heart attack. I had no idea how to live, but I didn't want to die.\"\n\nElton started using cocaine in 1974, but now the 72-year-old has been sober for almost 30 years.\n\nHis sobriety was kick-started when he was hospitalised in Chicago to be treated for cocaine, alcohol and food addictions.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for EJAF)\n\nElton, who is now married to David Furnish and has two children, was then put on the Alcholics Anonymous 12-step programme and spent six weeks attending group meetings to turn his life around.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
