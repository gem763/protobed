(Sara Brunetti / CBC NEWS)\n\nThe Norad commander asked Gen. Jonathan Vance to \"identify and mitigate\" Infrastructure Control Systems (ICS) vulnerabilities on Canadian military bases, particularly at \"installations that are critical for accomplishing Norad missions.\"\n\nThe March 24, 2016 letter also urged Canada's top military commander to \"advocate developing capabilities to respond to cyber incidents on CAF [infrastructure control systems] and defend CAF [infrastructure control systems] if required.\"\n\nGourtney's concern was not limited to defence installations; he asked Vance to \"work with Public Safety Canada to identify civilian infrastructure that is critical to CAF and Norad missions. This includes developing processes for reporting cyber incidents on the identified civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nVance responded to Gourtney (who has since retired and was replaced by U.S. Air Force Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy) three months later and directed the military to hunt for vulnerabilities.\n\n\"I share Norad's concerns for the cybersecurity\" of critical defence infrastructure, Vance wrote on June 10, 2016, in a letter obtained by CBC News under access to information legislation.\n\nHe noted that the Canadian government has identified \"adversaries\" that pose \"a significant threat and efforts have been made to identify and develop protective strategies for Canadian critical infrastructure.\"\n\nThe Liberal government \u2014 through its defence strategy and overhaul of security legislation \u2014 tackled some of the concerns raised by Norad.\n\nThe Communications Security Establishment Canada has new powers to conduct offensive cyber operations. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nIt gave the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and the military new powers to conduct offensive cyber operations. Perhaps more importantly, it set up the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security for civilian infrastructure, which \u2014 according to CSE \u2014 aims to \"be a place where private and public sectors work side-by-side to solve Canada's most complex cyber issues.\"\n\nDavid Masson, a cyber expert, said minimizing the vulnerability of civilian, privately operated infrastructure continues to be an extraordinarily complex task.\n\nThe major vulnerability is in what's known as operational technology systems, the kind of computer-driven tasks in utilities and other infrastructure that open and close valves or perform remote functions.\n\nThe task of securing them is made extraordinary difficult in part by the wide variety of operating systems out there.\n\n\"There's lots of them,\" said Masson, the director of technology at Darktrace, a leading cybersecurity company. \"Look at it as 50, 60, 70 different bespoke communications systems. There's no real standardization because they're so old. Many of them were never expected to be connected to the internet.\"\n\nHe pointed to the 2015 and 2016 cyberattacks on Ukraine's power grid, which in one instance cut electricity to 225,000 people, as examples of what's possible when hackers go after operational technology systems.\n\nRCAF Col. Travis Morehen speaks in the North American Aerospace Defence Command command centre inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., on May 10, 2018. (Dan Elliott/The Associated Press)\n\nIt is also the kind of event that Norad is concerned about.\n\n\"The kinds of equipment and machinery that supports the transport of natural gas or the provision of air conditioned services, or our water supply \u2014 all of those are critical to Canadians and our militaries,\" Lt.-Gen.Christopher Coates, the Canadian deputy commander, said in a recent interview with CBC News.\n\nHe said Norad is focused on the capabilities that are essential to doing its job of defending North America against attack, and they try to \"minimize those vulnerabilities where we can.\"\n\nThere is, Coates said, an interesting discussion taking place at many levels of the military about what constitutes critical infrastructure.\n\n\"You asked if we're satisfied. I get paid to be concerned about the defences and security of our nations. I don't think I should ever be satisfied,\" he added.\n\nChristian Leuprecht, a defence expert at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., said defining critical infrastructure is a complex and evolving task.\n\nHe pointed to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election; prior to that event, he said, the definition of critical infrastructure was limited to power plants, electricity grids and even the financial system.\n\n\"A lot of things people are wrestling with the question of what institutions \u2014 take, for example, democratic institutions \u2014 become critical infrastructure,\" said Leuprecht.\n\nThe Ukrainian attacks, in the view of many defence experts, are a blueprint of what the opening shots of a future war would look like.\n\n\"There's a considerable and growing awareness that our defence and critical infrastructure systems are closely tied together because countries, such as China, preserve cyberattack as a first-strike option,\" Leuprecht said.\n\nMasson said there are ways to limit the vulnerability of operational technology systems. Not connecting them to the internet would be a start, but many companies are choosing not to do that for efficiency reasons.\n\nHe said they also can be protected with \"robust\" security systems.", "description": "Norad sought reassurance that Canada was doing all it could to guard critical civilian infrastructure from crippling cyberattacks.
