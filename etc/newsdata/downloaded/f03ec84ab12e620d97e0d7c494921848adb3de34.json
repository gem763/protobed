But what she\u2019s shared lately is harrowing. For the Harper\u2019s Bazaar series, #GoToBedWithMe, the budding skin-care entrepreneur (she\u2019s allegedly working on a line) washed her face on-camera and internet commenters cannot forget what they saw.\n\n\u201cI think I might have barfed a bit in my mouth. Literally the worst thing ever on the internet,\u201d tweeted one person. \u201cI love Bella but this was a dumpster fire omg,\u201d says another.\n\nThere were a few surprising things in her nighttime skin-care routine (and it\u2019s not because she is using zero Glossier), let\u2019s go through them all.\n\n1. She wears two diamond watches on one wrist.\n\nDon\u2019t her wrists ache? But both watches appear to be set to the same time, so they seem to be serving a purpose. Strange flex, but carry on.\n\n2. She\u2019s letting water actually touch her face.\n\nWhen was the last time you saw a celebrity actually washing their face, for real? She splashes water on her face not just once, but twice, and for longer than five seconds.\n\n3. She makes a homemade face wash.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a face wash. It\u2019s a scrub. Brandishing a little tupperware container, Thorne pulls out a homemade mixture of lemon juice, sugar, and olive oil, a sure-fire combination dermatologists recommend for creating micro-tears and enlarged pores. \u201cI started using it on my new assistant. He just loves it so much. It makes his skin so smooth,\u201d she says. Somewhere, cosmetics cop Paula Begoun is shaking and weeping into a muslin cloth.\n\n4. She makes a second homemade face wash.\n\n\u201cListen to the product,\u201d Thorne says, as she whisks together (using a mini!) coconut oil, honey, and cherries into a small bowl. \u201cCherries are anti-inflammatory and have antioxidants,\u201d she says, as she smears the drippy, blood-red mixture to her face. It\u2019s a mask? It\u2019s the start to Cherry Garcia? It\u2019s something.\n\n5. Moisturizing is optional.\n\nAfter making two beauty \u201cproducts\u201d completely from scratch, noted minimalist Thorne, her neck dripping with the bling of an extra large cross, says, \u201cI don\u2019t do anything [else] extra.\u201d Considered over the top would be putting anything on your skin at night that you don\u2019t immediately wash off. \u201cI don\u2019t use moisturizer or anything.\u201d\n\nLike many celebrities in the wellness and beauty space, Thorne is a passionate advocate for \u201cnatural\u201d beauty products. Well, don\u2019t call Goop, Bella, they\u2019ll call you. I think Reddit\u2019s Skincare Addiction board is still dry heaving. Watch the whole, very unique video below.\n\n.", "description": "Bella Thorne shows off her nighttime skincare routine in a video for Harper\u2019s Bazaar and the internet and her fans are horrified.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/29/29-bella-thorne-1.w1200.h630.jpg"}
