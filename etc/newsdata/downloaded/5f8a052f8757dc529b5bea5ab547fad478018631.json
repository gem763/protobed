Mitt Romney has a secret alter ego he's been using on Twitter. Take a look at our favorite jokes, then vote for yours at usatoday.com/opinion. Mike Thompson, Detroit Free Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Mitt Romney laughed off being outed as the owner of an anonymous Twitter account, telling USA TODAY in an interview that he didn't put much thought into the account's name when his son created it for him eight years ago.\n\nTwitter user Pierre Delecto was found out to be Romney after the Utah senator and GOP presidential candidate mentioned using a private account to follow what was happening on the social media website. It didn't take long for Slate reporter Ashley Feinberg, who also outed former FBI Director James Comey's secret account, to discover Delecto was in fact Romney.\n\nDuring a 30-minute interview with USA TODAY, Romney said the account was set up by his son, Matt, in 2011.

Pierre, OK. Delecto means delightful.\"\n\nHe noted the name has both Latin and French roots, offering clues that helped unmask him. Romney spent two years as a missionary in France.\n\n\"It's not like I spent a lot of time on this,\" he added, explaining his son, Matt, asked what the handle would be as he set up the account. \"I just gave him a name.\"\n\nA Q&A with Mitt Romney: Utah senator talks impeachment inquiry, legacy and his relationship with Trump\n\nAsked Romney about the reaction among his GOP colleagues to news he had a secret Twitter account.\n\n\n\nHe said Tillis ribbed him at lunch today, telling him that \u201csteak au poivre\u201d (pepper steak) was on the menu \u2014 Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) October 22, 2019\n\nHis Republican colleagues in the Senate poked fun at Romney for the name.
