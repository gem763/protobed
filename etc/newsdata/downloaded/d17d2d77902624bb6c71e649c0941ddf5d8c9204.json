Kinzinger: \u2018We All Know\u2019 Turkey Wouldn\u2019t Have Attacked if U.S. Troops Remained at Border", "language": "en", "text": "On Sunday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to remove U.S. troops from northeastern Syria.\n\nKinzinger argued that if U.S. soldiers had remained in Northern Syria, Turkey would not have attacked.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But we want to go now to Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He is in Ottawa, Illinois. Good morning to you, Congressman.\n\nKINZINGER: Good morning.\n\nBRENNAN: You wanted the president to rethink his position. We know from Secretary Esper this decision to pull out was made last night. What is the implication going to be?\n\nKINZINGER: Well it\u2019s going to be terrible and you know the secretary is doing his job and you know he has to follow orders. But the reality we all know that if there were still those 30 or 40 soldiers in that part of Syria that Turkey wouldn\u2019t attack. We actually had a pretty good kind of joint security situation being setup to de-escalate that area. In fact, pulling back those 50 troops or whatever it was has given license to Turkey and then now I think pulling out the remaining thousand in Syria is simply an excuse to get out. Look at it this way. You hear the president and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time and it\u2019s kitschy, but actually we were preventing an endless war. An- and that actually commenced on Sunday now a week ago and so it\u2019s really depressing. And you know, for me as a guy that served in the military and really, got into politics because I believe in the role America plays, to see this yet again you know leaving an ally behind, abandoning people that we frankly told that we were gonna be with is disheartening, depressing. Frankly it\u2019s weak and I don\u2019t see how it follows through on the president\u2019s promise, his biggest promise in the campaign to defeat ISIS because I think it is going to resurge.\n\nBRENNAN: Is the president putting U.S. national security at risk?\n\nKINZINGER: Yes, I certainly I- I think so yeah. And I mean look- look at what\u2019s going to happen out of here. Now we have another group that now believes they can\u2019t rely on the United States. Th- there\u2019s a lot of complication in the Kurd situation and I\u2019ve seen all this Russian misinformation now on the Internet that\u2019s being picked up by some of these political blogs that these are the bad Kurds and there\u2019s good Kurds. Well look, there are Kurds that aren\u2019t- aren\u2019t the best folks in the world. But there are also people that we have chosen to equip to fight ISIS that we were with. We had created a situation in which there was stability and out of an impulsive decision I think that the president made- otherwise it was cold and calculated because he\u2019d been thinking about it for a while and nobody else knew. The Kurds found out on Twitter for goodness sakes. We have left them to the wolves. And- and the message this is sending to our allies around the world I think is- is really going to be bad.\n\nBRENNAN: So what are Republicans in Congress going to do about it? Are you completely powerless?\n\nKINZINGER: No we\u2019re not powerless. I mean the president has a lot of power though and I said that no matter- even under President Obama, I said the president\u2019s got a lot of power that\u2019s in the Constitution. The things we can do we are going to do. We\u2019ve got a resolution of condemnation I think next week, as well as some significant sanctions. The president tweeted about sanctions this morning but I think he needs to make sure he\u2019s following through on them and they\u2019re not going to be surface sanctions. They\u2019re going to really hit Turkey hard. And then the other thing we can do is be outspoken about this. The American people you know who want strength and leadership, who were promised by this president that we would defeat ISIS, deserve to hear the truth and not these things like end with- endless war that you hear some on the kind of libertarian spectum- spectrum talk about. There is now a war that\u2019s been commenced in Syria because we have pulled 50 troops out from being able to prevent that war.\n\nBRENNAN: You heard the secretary acknowledge war crimes. The State Department has said they\u2019re afraid of ethnic cleansing. So looking at all of that, aren\u2019t sanctions just punitive? They\u2019re not preventative.\n\nKINZINGER: Yeah.\n\nBRENNAN: Is there a responsibility here to do something?\n\nKINZINGER: Yeah. Well I think there is. I think it is not necessarily going to prevent Turkey from doing what they\u2019re doing. This has been Turkey\u2019s dream for a long time. And the president basically gave the green light to do it. They\u2019re going to be important. But I think we also have to continue to say this which is when the United States backs away, chaos follows through. And we had a situation of stability there. It wasn\u2019t perfect. Erdo\u011fan probably didn\u2019t want to have to do joint patrols with the U.S.\u2013\n\nBRENNAN: Right.\n\nKINZINGER: \u2013because he wanted to attack. But we\u2019re the United States of America and we can prevent things like that. We have to remember the strength we have and not just try to run away from every conflict we could have.\n\nBRENNAN: So, the Wall Street Journal had an editorial that was pretty strong here in sharply criticizing the president quote \u201cfor his habit of impulsive judgment.\u201d And they argued that his judgment can be so reckless that many voters who took a risk on him the first time will ask if he\u2019s worth a second gamble in 2020. \u201cImpeachment won\u2019t defeat Donald Trump in 2020, but Donald Trump might.\u201d Does this make you question whether you\u2019re going to support President Trump in 2020?\n\nKINZINGER: Well, I\u2019m- I\u2019m not going to go there and question whether I\u2019m going to support, but it does, you know- I think the president needs to be aware that in- and I know Republican base voters. I represent both Republicans and Democrats. I have a Republican district. One of the things they loved about Donald Trump is- they\u2019re like he says what he means. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s taken the fight to ISIS and I\u2019m having a hard time seeing how basically pulling out of Syria- and it\u2019s not just about protecting the Kurds. It\u2019s about getting intel and fighting ISIS. And I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s gonna be a position of strength. So we\u2019ll have to see how 2020 plays out on that.\n\nBRENNAN: Yes no, should Erdo\u011fan come to the White House next month as planned?\n\nKINZINGER: No, absolutely not.\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you Congressman.", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of \"Face the Nation,\"\u00a0Rep.
