(Photo: Universal)\n\nDinosaurs are just running around America now. That\u2019s what happens at the end of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and, before we see how that plays out in Jurassic World 3 in 2021, the first hint will be online next week.\n\nYesterday, the surprising news broke that director Colin Trevorrow had made a Jurassic World short film called Battle at Big Rock which would be airing on the American FX network on Monday. At the time we had a title, poster and cast, and that\u2019s about it.\n\nToday, Collider spoke with Trevorrow, who explained exactly what the movie is, how it came about, and more. Here\u2019s a taste.\n\nBattle At Big Rock is a short film that takes place one year after the events of Fallen Kingdom. It\u2019s about a family on a camping trip to Big Rock National Park, about 32km from where the last film ended. There have been a few sightings, but this is the first major confrontation between dinosaurs and humans.\n\nSo the eight-minute short shows the immediate aftermath of Fallen Kingdom. Trevorrow co-wrote the film with Emily Carmichael, who he\u2019s co-writing Jurassic World 3 with, and shot the film in Ireland over five days last year on a shoestring budget. It features two new dinosaurs: a Nasutoceratops and an Allosaurus.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a first step into a larger world after the last film,\u201d Trevorrow added. \u201cYou have these animals loose in an unfamiliar environment, they\u2019re disoriented, struggling to adapt. The first people they run into are bound to be camping. I wanted to see that.\u201d\n\nI have to say, I\u2019m intrigued. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom felt like a huge misfire to me when it was released but the potential story it set up was undeniably cool. This feels like a fun table-setter of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cThis is the movie I\u2019ve been wanting to make since we started,\u201d Trevorrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of everything we love about the franchise and I\u2019m thrilled to be a part of it. You\u2019ll hear more about it soon.\u201d\n\nRead more about the short over on Collider. It\u2019ll air Monday on FX after Jurassic World and be online Tuesday, September 16. We\u2019ll have it for you here.", "description": "Dinosaurs are just running around America now.
