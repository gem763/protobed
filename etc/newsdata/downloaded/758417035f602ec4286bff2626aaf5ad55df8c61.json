While you may be mourning the loss of pool days and vacations, you can look forward to plenty of highly anticipated movies coming to theaters this fall.\n\nMovie studios are releasing blockbusters, biopics and films with awards buzz throughout the season. In a special edition of \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers,\u201d the Rolling Stone film critic previews some of the upcoming movies with the most chatter.\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTERS \u201cIt: Chapter 2\u201d Release date: September 6\n\nThe 2017 adaptation of Steven King\u2019s novel made waves when it opened two years ago. This sequel is set 27 years later when the children from Derry in the first movie are all grown up.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nJames McAvoy, Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader square off against Pennywise the clown. And Bill Skarsgard\u2019s Pennywise is \u201cscarier than it ever was before,\u201d Travers says.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d Release date: October 4\n\nWe\u2019re all familiar with the Joker from the \u201cBatman\u201d franchise. But this iteration of \u201cJoker\u201d stands alone, without ever mentioning Batman.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix embodies the villain as a failed stand-up comedian who takes lessons from television host Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just the part that brings out the best in actors, but Joaquin Phoenix, as we know, is one of the best we have,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cAbominable\u201d Release date: September 27\n\nThis animated film tells the story of a little girl who befriends the Yeti and wants to take him back to Mount Everest. The animations of an adorable child and her behemoth furry friend make this one \u201cirresistible,\u201d Travers said.\n\nDreamworks Animation\n\n\u201cFrozen 2\u201d Release date: November 22\n\nElsa and Anna are ready to \"let it go\" again. This time, the beloved Disney characters are back in action to search for the source of Queen Elsa\u2019s icy superpower.\n\nDisney/Walt Disney Animation Studios\n\nThe second film in the franchise is again voiced by stars like Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell and Josh Gad.\n\n\u201cGemini Man\u201d Release date: October 11\n\nIt\u2019s Will Smith versus Will Smith in this film about a hitman pursuing a younger version of himself. \u201cGemini Man\u201d is directed by acclaimed director and screenwriter Ang Lee, and leverages technology to tell the story.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n\u201cThey use that de-aging process so Will Smith can basically be fighting himself back in the years he played the \u2018Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u2019\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cZombieland 2\u201d Release date: October 18\n\nSuperstars Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, Abigail Breslin and Woody Harrelson are back after almost 10 years to fight more zombies. The \"Zombieland\" writers and director returned for this sequel.\n\nJessica Miglio/CTMG\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re back fighting zombies, and I\u2019ll be back cheering them on,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d Release date: October 18\n\nIt\u2019s diva versus diva in this live-action movie about one of Disney\u2019s favorite villains. Angelina Jolie reprises her role as the fierce Maleficent who is feuding with another queen, played by Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nWalt Disney Studios\n\n\u201cTwo divas. Again, irresistible,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cTerminator: Dark Fate\u201d Release date: November 1\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger said he\u2019d \u201cbe back\u201d and now he is. He returns as the Terminator in the franchise\u2019s sixth movie. But this is the first time since \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d that he and Linda Hamilton have shared the screen in the series.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to see Arnold and Linda Hamilton return to the parts that basically made them in the movies?\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cDark Fate\u201d is a sequel to the second \u201cTerminator\u201d film, extending those storylines into contemporary times.\n\n\u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d Release date: December 20\n\nThe Skywalker saga is coming to a close. \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d is coming to theaters this December so that fans can spend the holidays with Kylo Ren and Rey.\n\nLucasfilm\n\nAdam Driver and Daisy Ridley star in the ninth Skywalker film. Travers predicts that this movie could make the most out of all this season\u2019s blockbusters because the characters and story are so widely beloved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the days of Darth Vader. It\u2019s like the days when we would see these movies and these characters would become part of our consciousness,\u201d Travers said.\n\nOSCARS BUZZ MOVIES\n\n\u201cThe Irishman\u201d Release date: November 27\n\n\u201cThe Irishman\u201d is a gangster epic following the Bufalino crime family and Jimmy Hoffa over multiple decades. The film\u2019s strong lineup in front of, and behind the camera, already make it an Oscars favorite: Robert De Niro stars, flanked by Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, and Martin Scorsese directs.\n\nMaking this film likely cost a lot of money, with some reports saying it cost much as $200 million.\n\n\u201cFord v. Ferrari\u201d Release date: November 15\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t a car buff, don\u2019t let this title scare you away. \u201cFord v. Ferrari,\u201d tells the story of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and British racecar driver Ken Miles, played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale respectively, who team up to build a powerful Ford car.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of movie, you know, based on the fact that the Academy really loves with two just spectacular actors. So it\u2019s more than promising,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cMarriage Story\u201d Release date: December 6\n\n\u201cMarriage Story\u201d follows a theatre director and actress as they fall in love, get married, get divorced, and then fight for the custody of their child. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give outstanding performances in the leading roles.\n\nNetflix\n\n\u201cIt sounds like something we saw back in Kramer v. Kramer, but you cannot believe what performances like this do to transform it,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cClemency\u201d Release date: December 27\n\nAlfre Woodard plays a death row prison warden who supervises lethal injections in \u201cClemency.\u201d This unrelenting job tests Woodard's spirit until she can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n\u201cWhen you watch [Woodard's] face, when you watch her do this and see what a career she has had and uses it to get inside a character, you\u2019ll just be astonished by her,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cLittle Women\u201d Release date: December 25\n\nLouisa May Alcott\u2019s classic novel gets its eighth film adaptation this Christmas. The film again tells the story of the four Laurence sisters\u2019 coming-of-age.\n\nThis version was written and directed by Greta Gerwig of \u201cLadybird\u201d acclaim. Saoirse Ronan, who starred in \u201cLadybird,\u201d plays the leading Laurence sister, Jo. Meryl Streep\u2019s supporting role as Aunt March is highly anticipated, and Laura Dern plays the beloved Marmee.\n\nWilson Webb/CTMG\n\nEven though we\u2019ve seen this story told time and time again, Gerwig\u2019s comes from the perspective of a current \u201cworld of feminism and women standing up for themselves,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201c1917\u201d Release date: December 25\n\nThis war epic transports audiences to a suicide mission in 1917, the bloodiest year of World War I.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nWith Sam Mendes directing and Steven Spielberg as a producer, Travers said this is \u201ca formidable competitor for the best picture Oscar.\u201d\n\n\u201cTOTALLY ORIGINAL FILMS\u201d\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d Release date: October 18\n\nThe story of a German boy during World War II who imagines his best friend is Adolf Hitler might sound off-color and potentially offensive, but Travers predicts it could be funny and charming with director Taika Waititi at the helm.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to do more than offend people. It\u2019s going to illuminate something,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d Release date: November 1\n\n\u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d has been Edward Norton\u2019s passion project for more than a decade. Norton himself plays a detective with Tourette syndrome. Travers said the film is completely unique.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\u201cEverything that happens is something I\u2019ve never seen before,\" he said.\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d Release date: September 20\n\nBrad Pitt takes off as an astronaut in this James Gray-directed film. His character goes to outer space in search of his flyboy father, played by Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nGray said he set out to make the most realistic vision of being in space ever done in a movie.\n\n\u201cUncut Gems\u201d Release date: December 13\n\nAdam Sandler portrays a gambling New York City jeweler in this crime comedy-drama. The charismatic character must balance wealth and family while looking out for his adversaries.\n\nBrothers Josh and Bennie Safdie, who Travers called \u201clittle young versions of Martin Scorsese,\u201d directed the film.\n\nBIO PICS\n\n\u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d Release date: November 22\n\nCould the nicest guy on television actually be that nice in real life? That\u2019s what journalist Lloyd Vogel sets to find out when he reports a tell-all story on Mr. Rogers in \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\u201d\n\nTom Hanks stars as the beloved Fred Rogers -- a nice guy playing the ultimate mister nice guy. And Emmy winner Matthew Rhys stars as the Esquire journalist.\n\nLacey Terrell/CTMG\n\n\u201cThe contrast of Mr. Rogers and who he is and this guy going after him will make for a really interesting combination,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d Release date: September 27\n\nRenee Zellweger portrays the classic movie star, Judy Garland, as her star is dimming. \u201cJudy\u201d highlights the final year of Garland\u2019s life in 1969.\n\nPathe UK\n\nTravers calls Zellweger\u2019s performance, \u201cincredibly moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people have played Judy Garland. I think she plays her in a way that nobody has even tried yet,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cHarriet\u201d Release date: November 1\n\nTony winner Cynthia Erivo stars as slave-turned-abolitionist Harriet Tubman.\n\nFocus Features\n\nThe film has been in the works for years with various stars rumored to play the lead. Erivo\u2019s casting was controversial because she\u2019s British and some argued an African-American woman should play Tubman.\n\n\u201cLook, if somebody is talented and they can do it, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Travers said.\n\n\u201cBombshell\u201d Release date: December 20\n\nThis biopic highlights when Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson took down Roger Ailes at Fox News.\n\nCharlize Theron plays Kelly, and Nicole Kidman transforms into Carlson.\n\nLionsgate Movies/YouTube\n\n\u201cJust Mercy\u201d Release date: December 25\n\nPowerhouses Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx co-star in this true story of a black man wrongly accused of murder. Jordan plays attorney Bryan Stevenson, and Jamie Foxx is Walter McMillian, a man imprisoned for murder.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\u201cSparks fly between those two\u201d actors, Travers said.\n\n\u201cPain and Glory\u201d Release date: October 4\n\nIn \"Pain and Glory,\" director Pedro Almodovar directs a movie about himself, played by Antonio Banderas.\n\n\u201cPut Antonio Banderas really high on the list of the best actor contenders,\u201d Travers said.\n\nWILL THESE WORK? At least three films hitting the silver screen this fall still have to prove themselves, Peter Travers said.\n\n\u201cRambo: Last Blood,\u201d the fifth of the franchise, again stars Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo. But Travers said another \u201cRambo\u201d movie seems more like a \u201cmarketing ploy\u201d than anything else.\n\nYana Blajeva/Lionsgate\n\nAnother \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d reboot seems iffy to Travers, too. And the film adaptation of \u201cCats,\u201d whose trailer revealing stars as CGI felines left some viewers unsettled, could flop.\n\nWatch the fall movie preview with Peter Travers in the video above.
