However, the secrecy around Area 51 was due its testing aerial surveillance to use against the Soviet Union \u2014 not because the government had captured extraterrestrials.\n\nThe Air Force has warned that the Area 51 site was highly secure, and that anyone attempting to bypass security would be unwise.\n\n\"The Nevada Test and Training Range is an area where the Air Force tests and trains combat aircraft. As a matter of practice, we do not discuss specific security measures, but any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous,\" Air Force spokesman Maj. Ethan Stroker previously told Insider via email.\n\nTwo men from the Netherlands have already been arrested for trespassing three miles inside a restricted zone at the Nevada National Security Site near Area 51. One of the men told police he was a YouTuber, and according to a release from the Nye County Sherriff's department, the two men had taken footage of the site.\n\nRoberts, the creator of the original Storm Area 51 event page and organizer of the Alienstock event, distanced himself from the event on its website.\n\n\"Due to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees, we decided to pull the plug on the festival,\" the website says.\n\nRegardless of whether anyone actually confirms extraterrestrial life at Area 51, they can at least get a commemorative T-shirt, or listen to Storm Area 51's official song, \"They Can't Stop Us All.\"", "description": "Alienstock and Storm Area 51 Basecamp began as a Facebook joke.
