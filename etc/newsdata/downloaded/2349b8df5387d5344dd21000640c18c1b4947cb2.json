But he\u2019s still not going home.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that she would be formally withdrawing the extradition bill that sparked months of protests in Hong Kong. This bill would have allowed for criminals wanted by the central Chinese government to be sent to the mainland.\n\nLam, a bookseller who specialized in books that were banned by the Chinese government, would have been a target.\n\n\u201cI am wanted by the Chinese government,\u201d Lam told VICE News. \u201cThey charged me with the crime of selling illegal books. So it's obvious that if I stayed in Hong Kong, I'd be dead for sure.\u201d\n\nLam fled to Taiwan in April. And despite the bill being dropped, he says he has no plans of returning to Hong Kong, saying that he no longer feels safe there.\n\nInstead, he is hoping to open a bookstore in Taipei, which will allow him to not only legally stay in Taiwan, but also make a defiant statement about political freedom.\n\nRead: Hong Kong's Students Skip School as Protests Spread to the Classroom\n\nSome Hong Kong protesters have been looking to Lam as an example, exploring Taiwan as a potential safe haven. But Taiwan does not have an asylum process, and Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen has avoided making any announcements about changing the policy.\n\nVICE News visited Lam as he searched for a new home for his bookstore, and spoke to him about whether he feels he will ever truly feel safe in his newly adopted home.", "description": "\u201cThey charged me with the crime of selling illegal books.
