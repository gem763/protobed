The campaign led to the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, in May, apparently because she\u2019d expressed concerns that the administration was seeking foreign help to influence elections at home.\n\nSondland did not comment as he was shuttled into the Capitol.\n\nDemocrats are eager to press Sondland on his involvement in the Ukraine affair, as they seek to determine whether the Trump administration used financial aid as leverage to press Kiev to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says lawmakers should censure Schiff Schiff says committees will eventually make impeachment inquiry transcripts public Trump threat lacks teeth to block impeachment witnesses MORE, a leading 2020 presidential contender, and his son, Hunter.\n\nSondland is the sixth witness to be deposed by the three committees since Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry late last month. While Democrats, through much of the year, had focused their investigative efforts on Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, they\u2019ve shifted their sights since a government whistleblower alleged that Trump threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine if its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, declined to investigate the Bidens.\n\nText messages turned over to Congress this month by Kurt Volker Kurt Volker Perry says Trump directed him to discuss Ukraine with Giuliani: report Sondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy The comments and actions of Schiff demand his formal censure MORE, the administration\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, revealed a conversation last month between Sondland, Volker and William Taylor, currently the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, in which Taylor seemed to express grave concerns that Trump was hinging the release of U.S. military aid to Ukraine on Zelensky\u2019s willingness to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote in a Sept. 9 message.\n\nHours later \u2014 and reportedly after Sondland spoke directly with Trump \u2014 he pushed back on the suggestion, replying that Taylor was \u201cincorrect.\u201d The administration was interested in fighting Ukrainian corruption in general, Sondland said, not the Bidens in particular.\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland wrote. \u201cThe president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, however, reported this month that Sondland had told Sen.

But he will deny knowledge of efforts to withhold aid as leverage and the extent to which the pressure campaign for a Biden probe went.\n\n\u201cLet me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,\u201d he will say, according to a copy of his opening remarks, which were obtained by The Hill.\n\n\u201cI did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings,\u201d he will add. \u201cIn my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason.\u201d\n\n--This report was updated at 10:09 a.m.", "description": "The U.S.\u00a0ambassador to the European Union arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday morning to testify on the administration\u2019s controversial dealings with Ukraine, becoming the latest witness in the Democrats\u2019 quickly evolving impeachment investiga", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sondland1_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
