Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThis is the first time that a president hasn\u2019t had the ability to have his party to call witnesses in the preliminary phase. It sounds like they\u2019re singling him out for unfair treatment.\u201d\n\nConstitutional scholars, though, were not impressed. \u201cIt looks like a pathetic attempt to make a legal argument when the president is really expressing rage at the Congress for trying to stop him,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, an impeachment expert at Brown University. \u201cWhat\u2019s sad about it is it\u2019s so poorly drafted and the legal arguments are so nonexistent that you wonder who\u2019s advising the president.\u201d\n\nJack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump\u2019s position was more political than constitutional.\n\n\u201cThe White House letter\u2019s legal objections don\u2019t have merit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe letter, like the \u2018official impeachment inquiry\u2019 itself, is a hardball tactic designed to achieve maximum political advantage\u201d before the public.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Case-Against-Impeachment.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
