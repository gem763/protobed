There was also a high element of planning to his behaviour.\u2019\n\nIn a victim impact statement read at court Ms Pollyn described the devastating toll Coffin\u2019s campaign of control had on her life.\n\nShe said: \u2018It has been terrible. Everybody believed him and not me. I am truth itself \u2013 you could not meet anyone more truthful than me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am very strong and very determined that justice will be on my side and he will be served with what he deserves for ruining my life.\n\n\u2018I want him totally away from me forever.\u2019\n\nAs well as a two year jail sentence Coffin was also slapped with a restraining order preventing him from having any contact with his victim.", "description": "A jilted former Royal Yachtsman was arrested for stalking his ex-girlfriend after following her straight to a police station.", "authors": ["Metro News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88461722_1570264860.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
