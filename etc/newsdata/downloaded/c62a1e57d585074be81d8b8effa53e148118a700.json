But more than that, the dissents lay the groundwork for a profound shift in how the commission approaches the giants of the tech industry, should it eventually go back to Democratic control.\n\n\u201cWhat Slaughter and Chopra are doing is exceptional,\u201d said David Balto, who was an FTC policy director during the Clinton administration. \"It's not just a question of voting 'no,' but of articulating sound antitrust policy that would, hopefully, strengthen enforcement in the future.\"\n\n\u201cIf the election flips, you\u2019ve got two people who are really ready to kick it into fifth gear,\" he added.\n\nChopra and Slaughter issued loud dissents in two recent, headline-making tech cases: the $5 billion settlement in July with Facebook over privacy violations and this month\u2019s $170 million fine for Google's YouTube over its handling of children's data. In both cases, Chopra and Slaughter sought to dismantle the Republican majority's arguments, concluding that the penalties fall far short of fixing what they see as the companies' dangerous practices.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The commission's 15-person technology task force, launched in February to gather information about the industry, has shifted to investigating potential anti-competitive behavior among Silicon Valley's leading firms.\n\nThe Democratic presidential field, meanwhile, is also auguring a much more hostile future for the tech industry than the easy relations it enjoyed under the Obama administration. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has pledged that her administration would break up Amazon, Google and Facebook, calling them \"monopolies.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has staked out a similar position, while former Vice President Joe Biden has said dismantling Facebook is \"something we should take a really hard look at.\"\n\nRepublicans at the FTC reject the notion that they're soft on tech, pointing out that the fines in the Facebook and Google cases are record-breaking \u2014 the $5 billion Facebook penalty, for instance, was more than 200 times greater than any comparable fine in a privacy case. They also argue that the concessions extracted from the companies, such as Facebook's promise to create a privacy oversight board, will serve as a check on future misbehavior.\n\nNegotiating such settlements is a better deal for the public than taking the cases into a lengthy and uncertain legal battle, FTC Chairman Joe Simons has argued.\n\n\u201cThe only real world choice here was to take a historic settlement that provides immediate and important protection to American consumers or wait for years to get far less relief,\" said Simons, a Republican who was a veteran FTC lawyer before President Donald Trump nominated him for the panel, in announcing the Facebook decision.\n\nHe and fellow Republican Commissioner Christine Wilson said after the YouTube deal that the fine and required changes in Google\u2019s conduct were \"almost certainly better\" than what the agency could have gotten through litigation. \"We choose not to gamble the protection of children now in hopes of hitting a jackpot in the future,\" they wrote.\n\nFTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo\n\nThe agency\u2019s Democrats, however, have called not only for harsher penalties against the Silicon Valley giants but also fundamental changes to their core business model, particularly the targeted online advertising that Chopra refers to as \"mass surveillance.\"\n\n\u201cThe behavioral advertising business model is broken, and we cannot let it continue to tear us apart,\u201d he wrote in his dissent of the agency\u2019s settlement with Facebook.\n\nBoth Democrats have also argued that to deter companies from behaving badly, it's sometimes necessary to hold high-profile executives liable for privacy breaches and other corporate failings. That's a particular threat to major tech companies where CEOs are often the companies' founders and hold enormous sway over how they're run.\n\nIn the case against Facebook, Chopra wrote, the lack of legal liability for Zuckerberg and his fellow executives amounted to a \"giveaway\" by the FTC.\n\n\"Rather than accepting this settlement, I believe we should have initiated litigation against Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg,\" Slaughter wrote, adding that she backed that strategy even if there was a chance of losing in court.\n\nAt a recent Media Institute lunch in Washington, Slaughter said that where \"views diverge\" at the FTC, the Democrats will \"stick with what we believe is the right outcome and try to articulate that respectfully and clearly \u2014 rather than agreeing to do something we don\u2019t think is the right thing to do for the sake of consensus.\"\n\nChopra's office declined to comment.\n\nSome FTC watchers say the Democratic commissioners\u2019 approach has been a long time coming. They contend that the agency fell down in policing the rapidly rising tech industry during the Obama era, and that it ignored issues ranging from Google\u2019s amassing of consumer data to Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe Obama FTC also drew criticism for declining to bring an antitrust case against Google in 2013, following a nearly two-year investigation of the company's business practices. The Wall Street Journal later reported that an internal FTC staff report had recommended suing the company.\n\n\u201cThe FTC\u2019s track record in the tech sector is unbelievably weak, and this administration has inherited that and needs to move much more aggressively to shift course,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former chief counsel in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. \"The strength of the dissents should be a wake-up call.\"\n\nBut others, including some fellow Democrats, say Chopra and Slaughter are overindulging in their objections, knowing they\u2019re not going to be casting deciding votes.\n\n\u201cThe partisanship is pretty striking, and the string of partisan dissents is a pretty big departure from tradition at the FTC,\u201d said one Obama administration official who worked on competition issues and spoke anonymously to discuss intra-party differences.\n\nThe former official warned the sharp splits seen at the FTC on tech cases risk turning the agency into something akin to the highly politicized FCC, whose more than decade-long regulatory ping-pong match over net neutrality has produced head-spinning policy changes and years of litigation.\n\nWhile individual FTC commissioners are said to be personally close, as a whole the group has had little chance to bond, according to people close to the agency. Federal transparency laws limit their ability to meet in private, and even on major cases they don\u2019t vote in person but through electronic forms completed by staff. Because the five sitting commissioners arrived at the agency at about the same time, it did not have a bevy of veteran members on hand to welcome newcomers.\n\n\n\nChopra, a long-time consumer advocate, was meant to be the pick of the Democratic left and a concession to Warren. He had spent five years working at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau set up by the now-Massachusetts senator.\n\nSlaughter, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, was Schumer's choice for the FTC and seen as a more moderate pick.\n\n\n\nChopra was always expected to be an outspoken agitator, but a memo he issued in his early days on the job, setting out what he saw as the commission's past mishandling of ill-behaved companies, rattled many inside and outside the agency. \"FTC orders are not suggestions,\" he wrote, criticizing what he viewed as the agency's history of lax enforcement.\n\nSlaughter\u2019s forceful dissents in tech cases have also surprised some FTC observers given her previous role as a behind-the-scenes congressional staffer. But anyone shocked at her statements hasn't been paying close enough attention, according to another Obama administration official who dealt with competition issues in government.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a bomb thrower because she\u2019s a smart tactician, and some people on the extremes read that as \u2018Oh, she\u2019s going to be moderate. She\u2019s not going to rock the boat.\u2019 But that\u2019s misunderstanding her, frankly,\u201d said the official who requested anonymity to discuss internal FTC dynamics.\n\nThe Democratic dissents may be particularly vexing for Simons, who has shown signs of being even more interested than past chairmen in winning unanimous decisions in major cases. During his Senate confirmation process, he pointed with pride to the \"high degree of bipartisanship\" that characterized his previous stint as director of the FTC's competition bureau. Simons was not available for comment.\n\nBalto, the former FTC policy director, said even if Trump wins reelection, Chopra and Slaughter will wield influence at the agency given that Simons is eager for 5-0 votes.\n\n\u201cEven on the margins, it\u2019s going to make a difference,\u201d said Balto, pointing to the FTC\u2019s Republican majority. \u201cThey will behave differently because they want to have unanimous decisions.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/e3/6a13cbfb4dd6aa68702ff0685147/190925-chopra-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
