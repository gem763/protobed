What an amazing night for rugby in general!!\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dark places\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Japanese pace, allied with the ability of half-backs Yu Tamura and Yutaka Nagare to exploit the shortside before changing the direction of play, was crucial to the hosts\u2019 attacking gameplan.\n\nSuch tactics, however, mean teams tire. Japan did just that, letting Scotland back into the game with two second-half tries.\n\nBut the team skippered by the inspirational flanker Michael Leitch dug deep and showed another side of their make-up: a mental fortitude and defensive tenacity that effectively shut down the game.\n\nIt is not easy to train such combative cohesiveness, but Japan\u2019s veteran lock Luke Thompson explained that everything had been well planned.\n\n\u201cWe have been to some dark places in preparation \u2014 pretty tough camps and that is modern rugby,\u201d said the 38-year-old Kiwi-born second-rower, who is playing his fourth World Cup.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go out and do that stuff by accident, you have to earn it.\u201d\n\nJoseph said there was no doubt his players had benefited from exposure to Super Rugby with Japan\u2019s Sunwolves outfit.\n\n\u201cIt was the tenacity, I guess, of our team at crucial parts of the Test which helped,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPersistence and confidence and trust the plan is what saw us through. In the last two or three minutes it was a Test match we didn\u2019t want to lose.\u201d\n\nDawson said Japan were playing a \u201cunique\u201d style.\n\n\u201cNot even the All Blacks play at some of the speed they do,\u201d the former scrum-half said.\n\nScotland coach Gregor Townsend predicted a \u201cvery tough game\u201d for South Africa in the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cJapan play a really fast game and create quick ruck ball at the ruck and they execute their set piece really well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a very close game.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Japan weren\u2019t expected to reach the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, but they have confounded their critics and surprised the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/599376_japan-kenki-fukuoka-has-shown-speed-on-wing-magic-japan-how-unique-style-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
