Around halfway into the video, the first sign appears, with Trump\u2019s \u201cKeep America Great\u201d slogan and a \u201cQ\u201d taped onto it. Another shows \u201cQ\u201d\u2019s replacing the O\u2019s on a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d sign.\n\nThe inclusion of the signs in the campaign video could be entirely accidental, as Trump rallies have become prominent gathering spots for believers in the QAnon conspiracy, making it harder to grab footage from the rallies that do not include such images. At a Trump rally last week, for example, a warm-up speaker recited a QAnon slogan during his speech. But the campaign video will, nevertheless, be likely interpreted by the Q community as a cryptic acknowledgement by Trump that their beliefs are real.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s unclear if the ad is being broadcast on TV or is merely an online spot. Total viewership for it on YouTube was just above 7,000 at the time of publication, suggesting it has not been widely seen.\n\nQAnon believers follow ludicrous clues posted online by an anonymous figure named \u201cQ,\u201d who they claim offers proof that Trump is engaged in a secret war against an evil cabal of high-ranking pedophiles and cannibals. QAnon supporters claim to be nonviolent, even though a core part of the conspiracy theory is based around the idea of Trump sending top Democrats to face military tribunals and executions in Guantanamo Bay. QAnon believers have been charged in two murders, and an FBI document published last week described QAnon and other conspiracy theories as a possible source of domestic terrorism.\n\nQAnon believers have been eager in the past to jump on anything they perceive as a potential nod of support from Trump\u2019s campaign. In July, Trump praised a baby wearing an improvised QAnon onesie during a speech. Conspiracy theorists soon identified the baby, dubbed \u201cQBaby,\u201d as QAnon\u2019s new mascot, and saw Trump mentioning the baby as proof that their conspiracy theory is real.", "description": "Whether accidental or not, the Trump campaign keeps nodding to QAnon conspiracy theorists, even after the FBI called them a potential source of domestic terror", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565136063/190806-sommer-trump-ad-tease_lkqi0f", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
