It's virtually a carbon copy.'\n\nThe video then goes on to show both their version and the recording of Kate's Masked Singer performance played side by side.\n\nThey also shared a clip of Kate being interviewed after she was unmasked.\n\nDiscussing how she chose which songs to cover during her stint on the show, Kate said she was inspired by her daughter's music playlists.\n\nThere is no suggestion Kate had any involvement with the accusations.\n\nAs well as making the allegations on YouTube, the duo also have launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for possible legal action.\n\nUnmasked: Kate Cebrano (pictured) who performed as the Lion on the show, wowed judges with her rendition of the Billie Eilish hit in episode three\n\nThey hope to raise $15,000 (USD) to fund 'international legal representation'.\n\nThe band wrote: 'We have simply worked too hard, and too long, to sit by the way side and let a TV show make millions off a show featuring an arrangement we made.\n\n'It's a long shot, we know, but if for some odd reason this gains traction, it'd mean everything to us to be able to have an actual chance at standing up for ourselves.'\n\nWhen approached by the Courier Mail on Wednesday, Channel 10 declined to comment.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.", "description": "A YouTube singing duo has accused producers from The Masked Singer Australia of stealing their composition of Billie Eilish's hit  Bad Guy for\u00a0Kate Ceberano.", "authors": ["Jess Bell For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20370420-0-image-a-7_1572433368813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
