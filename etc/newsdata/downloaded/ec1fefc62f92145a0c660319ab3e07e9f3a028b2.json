My inclination is to get a big deal,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked if he could accept a partial deal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come this far. We\u2019re doing well. I would much prefer a big deal and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for,\u201d he added.\n\nBut he acknowledged that his preferred outcome is not certain.\n\n\u201cCan something happen? I guess. Maybe. Who knows. But I guess it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\n\nWith eight days to go before the next round of punitive tariffs is due to hit, Beijing\u2019s top trade envoy Liu He will meet with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin beginning Thursday, the White House said in a statement.\n\n\u2013 No linkage. Guaranteed. \u2013\n\nLiu has said privately he will make a proposal that makes no commitments addressing the far-reaching reforms to Chinese industrial policy or subsides that Washington is seeking, Bloomberg reported Sunday, citing an unnamed source.\n\nLower-level talks have been underway since last month.\n\nThe discussions will focus on areas where Washington has made far-reaching demands since last year: intellectual property rights, the forced transfer of proprietary technologies, agriculture and enforcement, the White House statement said.\n\nThe next round of US tariff increases is set to take effect October 15, as US duty rates on $250 billion in Chinese goods rise to 30 percent.\n\nTrump has claimed China\u2019s weakening economy puts Beijing under pressure to make a deal.\n\nBut he also has said in recent months Chinese officials are dragging their feet in hopes of continuing negotiations with another administration should Trump fail to win reelection in 2020.\n\nWhite House economic aide Larry Kudlow Monday denied that recent economic data showed the lingering trade war has damaged the US economy, saying the effect had been \u201cminimum,\u201d a position most economists dispute.\n\nUnemployment in September fell to its lowest level in 50 years but US manufacturing has fallen into recession, and GDP growth is forecast to slow considerably.\n\nTrump is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry by congressional Democrats after pressuring Ukrainian authorities earlier this year to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and son Hunter, whom Trump accuses of financial wrongdoing.\n\nTrump last week raised the stakes by openly calling on Beijing to do likewise.\n\nBut Kudlow told reporters there was no connection between the trade talks and Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be no linkage,\u201d he said. \u201cI guarantee it.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 President Donald Trump said Monday he would prefer to strike a comprehensive trade bargain with China, in comments days before", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/c86ab6_china-vice-premier-liu-he-speaks-us-president-donald-trump-in-2019-us-prefers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
