The personal information included was not redacted as required by Section 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nThe committee, led by Chairman Roger Wicker Roger Frederick WickerLawmakers toast Greta Van Susteren's new show Hillicon Valley: Trump official declines to testify on trade protections for tech | Senators call for better info-sharing on supply chain threats | Apple pulls app after Chinese pressure Key Democrat presses FTC over Facebook settlement's 'dangerous precedent' MORE (R-Miss.), was informed of the disclosures in April and subsequently sent letters to the agency and interviewed employees about the breach, concluding that \u201cthe series of improper disclosures is likely attributable to incompetence and mismanagement rather than deliberate, bad-faith efforts by senior managers or commissioners.\u201d\n\nThe committee recommended that the CPSC implement formal training for all new employees on how to handle personal consumer data, review information technology used to process data requests and implement policies to ensure that CPSC management reviews all sensitive data requests.\n\nWicker wrote in a letter to acting CPSC Director Robert Adler on Wednesday that while the data disclosures were \u201cconcerning,\u201d the committee concluded they did not occur due to deliberate steps, but were entirely accidental.\n\nWicker also noted that he intends to review the findings of the CPSC\u2019s inspector general on the disclosures and hopes steps taken as a result of the breach will \u201cprotect the consumers and manufacturers that entrust their sensitive information to the CPSC.\u201d\n\nJoe Martyak, the director of communications at the CPSC, told The Hill on Thursday that \"we take seriously the recommendations of this report and have already been taking action to improve staff training and security measures. We will continue to address these recommendations and look forward to the related report from our Inspector General.\"\n\nThe agency announced the data disclosures in April and detailed the steps it had taken in response, including immediately halting all disclosures through its clearinghouse to entities and immediately requesting the groups accidentally given this information to either return or destroy it. The CPSC also developed an \u201caction plan\u201d to inform all manufacturers that had data disclosed.\n\n\u201cCPSC considers unauthorized disclosure of information to be a serious issue,\u201d the agency wrote earlier this year.\n\n-Updated at 5:35 pm to include a response from the CPSC.", "description": "The Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday issued a report that found the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) failed to properly handle the data of thousands of consumers, leading to an accidental data breach e", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cybersecurityshutdown_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
