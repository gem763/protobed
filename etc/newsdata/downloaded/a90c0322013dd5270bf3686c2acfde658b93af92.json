His other no-no was in 2007 for the Tigers against Milwaukee.\n\nVerlander allowed only one runner, with Cavan Biggio drawing a one-out walk in the first inning. The Blue Jays, with a lineup full of young, aggressive batters, never came close to a hit.\n\nWATCH | Verlander shuts down Blue Jays:\n\nJustin Verlander struck out 14 batters as he twirled nine no-hit innings, leading the Houston Astros to a 2-0 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. 1:53\n\n\"I can't put it into words,\" Verlander said, moments after the final out.\n\nThe 36-year-old Verlander joined Nolan Ryan (seven), Sandy Koufax (four) and Bob Feller, Cy Young and 1880s-era Larry Corcoran (three) in rarefied air on the no-hitter list.\n\n\"Some of the guys I've idolized,\" Verlander said.\n\nAnd it came after a series of near-misses over the years.\n\nno-hitters vs. Blue Jays\n\nSept. 1, 2019 -- Justin Verlander, Houston, 2-0\n\n-- Justin Verlander, Houston, 2-0 May 8, 2018 , James Paxton, Seattle, 5-0\n\n, James Paxton, Seattle, 5-0 May 7, 2011 , Justin Verlander, Detroit, 9-0\n\n, Justin Verlander, Detroit, 9-0 May 1, 1991 , Nolan Ryan, Texas, 3-0\n\n, Nolan Ryan, Texas, 3-0 June 29, 1990 , Dave Stewart, Oakland, 5-0\n\n, Dave Stewart, Oakland, 5-0 May 15, 1981, Len Barker, Cleveland, 3-0-y\n\ny-perfect game\n\nVerlander lost a no-hit try in the eighth inning late in 2011, had bids broken in the ninth in 2012 and 2015 and had another attempt spoiled last May in the seventh by Jose Abreu of the White Sox.\n\n\"I've come so close to the third one so many times,\" Verlander said.\n\nOn this afternoon, he brought it home. Verlander threw a season-high 120 pitches, mixing a fastball that reached the upper 90s mph with a sharp curve.\n\nVerlander retired the last 26 hitters in a row. But he still needed help because the game was scoreless going into the last inning \u2014 according to baseball rules, Verlander had to pitch a complete game to get credit for a no-hitter.\n\n2019 no-hitters\n\nAmerican League\n\nJuly 12 \u2014 Taylor Cole, Felix Pena (3), LA Angels vs. Seattle, 13-0\n\n\u2014 Taylor Cole, Felix Pena (3), LA Angels vs. Seattle, 13-0 Aug. 3 \u2014 Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris (7), Joe Biagini (8), Chris Devenski (9), Houston vs. Seattle, 9-0\n\n\u2014 Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris (7), Joe Biagini (8), Chris Devenski (9), Houston vs. Seattle, 9-0 Sept. 1 \u2014 Justin Verlander, Houston vs. Toronto, 2-0\n\nInterleague\n\nMay 7 \u2014 Mike Fiers, Oakland vs. Cincinnati, 2-0\n\nThat's when Canadian-born rookie Abraham Toro stepped up for the AL West leaders. The Astros newcomer hit a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Ken Giles (2-3) that cleared the way for Verlander to complete the no-hitter.\n\nToro made a routine play on Bo Bichette's grounder to third base for the last out.\n\nVerlander joked the 22-year-old Toro, playing just his eighth game in the majors, was in for quite a nice reward.\n\nThis was Justin Verlander's 2nd career no-hitter at the Rogers Centre.<br><br>He is the 1st pitcher in MLB history to throw multiple no-hitters in the same opposing ballpark. <a href=\"https://t.co/VCkcuKb7y5\">pic.twitter.com/VCkcuKb7y5</a> \u2014@ESPNStatsInfo\n\nThis was the fourth no-hitter in the majors this year. The last one was by the Astros, too, a combined effort from Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini and Chris Devenski (9) against Seattle on Aug. 3.\n\nOakland's Mike Fiers and a tandem effort by Taylor Cole and Felix Pena of the Angels accounted for this year's other gems.\n\nVerlander (17-5) is tied for the big league lead in wins. He tops the majors in strikeouts (257) and innings (193) and leads the AL with a 2.56 ERA.\n\nWith the crowd of 24,104 getting to its feet to begin the ninth, Verlander retired Brandon Drury on an easy grounder and struck out Reese McGuire.\n\nVerlander is mobbed by his Astros teammates after throwing his third major league no-hitter and second in eight years against the Blue Jays in Toronto. (Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)\n\nAfter that second out, catcher Robinson Chirinos went to the mound for a quick visit with Verlander. The count went full on Bichette, who fouled off a pitch before hitting a bouncer to Toro.\n\nVerlander took a couple hops toward first as he watched Toro field the ball, saw the throw on target and then began the celebration in the middle of the diamond.\n\nNot bad for an ace who was ejected in his previous start. Verlander was tossed last Tuesday at home shortly after a close pitch didn't go his way against Tampa Bay.\n\nIt was Verlander's ninth career shutout. This was the 13th no-hitter for the Astros, including one by Ryan.\n\nThe Blue Jays were no-hit for the sixth time. Before Sunday, the last to do it was Seattle's James Paxton, who became the first Canadian pitcher to throw a big league no-hitter north of the border when he beat the Blue Jays on May 8, 2018.", "description": "Veteran pitcher Justin Verlander\u00a0no-hit the Blue Jays in Toronto for the second time in eight years on Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 2-0 win and series victory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267508.1567368344!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/verlander-justin-no-hitter-190901-1180.jpg"}
