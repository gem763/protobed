In 2017, Zwarte Piet defenders blocked a motorway to stop opponents reaching the parade, and last year there were brawls, egg-pelting and arrests in Eindhoven.\n\n\u201cToday is a beautiful, historic day,\u201d said Jerry Afriyie of Kick Out Zwarte Piet, who has been campaigning against Zwarte Piet since 2008. \u201cThis is a victory for everyone who strives for an inclusive parade that will delight all children. We want the tradition to continue for thousands of years \u2013 but adapted to the times.\u201d\n\nAfriyie pledged to continue the fight against Zwarte Piets in blackface until the figure had disappeared completely. \u201cThe national arrival of Sinterklaas is the big one, but there are other, local ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will fight for change.\u201d\n\nPolls show support for the traditional Piet is strong, but fading: in 2013, 89% of the Dutch favoured blackface, a figure that had fallen to 68% by 2017. More than half of young people between 18 and 25 thought the character\u2019s appearance should change.\n\nIn 2015, the Dutch government said it would reflect on the character after a report from the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination said its portrayal \u201creflects negative stereotypes of people of African descent and is experienced by many people of African descent as a vestige of slavery\u201d.", "description": "The Zwarte Piets, or Black Petes, who accompany Santa have been the subject of protests", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e942b264f6a82ce422613c258384b88ad8d0a6/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8337395fd25ddb8286ecd6351c327254", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
