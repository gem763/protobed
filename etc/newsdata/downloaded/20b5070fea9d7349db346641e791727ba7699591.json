Goals from Juan Cuadrado and Blaise Matuidi had Juve dominating deep into the second half.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico fought back through Stefan Savic in the 70th and Mexico midfielder H\u00e9ctor Herrera leveled in the 90th with a header from Kieran Trippier\u2019s cross.\n\nEASTERN PROMISE\n\nClubs from eastern Europe are often overmatched in the Champions League, and Dinamo Zagreb had lost its last 11 group-stage games, scoring just once.\n\nStill, Zagreb gave a painful lesson to Atalanta, thrashing the Italian debutant 4-0. Mislav Orsic scored a hat trick.\n\nAtalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini called it \u201ca nightmare of a game. They were stronger in every aspect.\u201d\n\nLokomotiv Moscow scored a rare away win for a Russian team, winning 2-1 at Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nRed Star Belgrade couldn\u2019t complete the hat trick of wins in Munich. Bayern controlled the game but had only Kingsley Coman\u2019s first-half header to show before late goals from Robert Lewandowski and substitute Thomas Mueller.\n\nEARLY DRAWS\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the unusual kickoff time - at 6:55 p.m. in most of Europe - but all four early evening starts produced draws this week.\n\nTottenham wasted a two-goal first-half lead at Olympiakos on Wednesday, taking control with a penalty by Harry Kane and a smart shot from Lucas Moura in Athens.\n\nThe Greek league runner-up struck back on the stroke of halftime before Mathieu Valbuena beat his former France teammate Hugo Lloris from the penalty spot in the..\n\nIn Belgium, Club Brugge drew 0-0 with Galatasaray, as both teams failed to make a stronger mark on Group A where PSG and Madrid are strongly favored to advance.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City succeeded where storied rivals failed in their opening Champions League games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Graham Dunbar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/aptopix_france_soccer_champions_league_85449_c0-226-5400-3374_s1770x1032.jpg?cb5c7867563b2abf97a00a102051a13af94a4d48", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
