We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 This week will be packed with activity in the House impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, as committees subpoena more documents about the administration's dealings with Ukraine, and lawmakers depose State Department officials as Trump responds with two political rallies.\n\nThe fast-paced developments can be a confusing jumble of foreign names and officials who don\u2019t typically show up in news stories. But the key elements continue to focus on Trump urging Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call July 25 to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, while crucial military aid to that country was frozen. Trump insists he was justified to fight corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThree House panels \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 subpoenaed the White House and State Department for documents about dealings with Ukraine. The panels are also interviewing State Department officials and intermediaries who helped Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, encourage the investigation of Biden.\n\nBut Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt and vowed to fight all subpoenas. The president called Sunday for the impeachment of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for treason, for investigating him.\n\nMore: A visual timeline of the text messages in the Trump-Ukraine affair\n\nHere is a roundup of the key players and events this week, although timing for some is still in flux:\n\nMONDAY\n\nA federal judge in New York dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit to block Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance from gaining access to eight years of tax returns. Trump immediately filed notice he would appeal the decision. Four House committees are also pursuing Trump\u2019s tax returns for evidence of possible corruption in three different federal lawsuits.\n\nThree committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight \u2013 subpoenaed the Pentagon and White House Office of Management and Budget for documents about the administration\u2019s temporary freeze on military aid for Ukraine. The administration froze $400 million in aid in July and released the funding in September. Lawmakers said they are exploring reasons for the cutoff. The deadline for the documents is Oct. 15.\n\nThe three panels earlier subpoenaed Ukraine documents from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani. But the department missed a Friday deadline that the panel set for documents. Pompeo has accused lawmakers of bullying department staffers.\n\nUS Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland addresses the media during a press conference at the US Embassy to Romania in Bucharest on on Sept. 5, 2019.

The whistleblower said Sondland, along with Kurt Volker, the special representative to Ukraine, who gave a deposition Thursday, had met with Giuliani to try to \"contain the damage\" his efforts on Biden were having on U.S. national security.\n\nThe whistleblower said Volker and Sondland also met with Ukrainian officials to help them navigate the \"differing messages\" they were getting through official U.S. government channels and Giuliani's private outreach. Texts that the committees released showed Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, asking: \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Sondland texted back: \"Call me.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell scheduled arguments for the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subpoena for grand-jury evidence behind special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The committee seeks the evidence for Trump\u2019s possible obstruction of Mueller\u2019s 22-month investigation. But the Justice Department opposed the request and said it could jeopardize ongoing cases. House Republicans contend the committee doesn\u2019t qualify for grand-jury evidence unless the full House votes to authorize an impeachment investigation, but Pelosi has said no vote is necessary.\n\nIn a 2017 photo, Donald Trump greets Nancy Pelosi just before Trump's inauguration as president.

The rally has already sparked controversy because the police department prohibited officers from wearing their uniforms at political events or in ads. The police union struck back by creating \"Cops for Trump\" T-shirts.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets the media in Rome, Oct. 2, 2019. Pompeo confirmed that he was on the telephone call between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president that is the subject of an impeachment inquiry. \"I was on the phone call,\" Pompeo told reporters in Rome.

She was pulled from her post in May after working years under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Trump called Yovanovitch \"bad news\" in his July phone call with the Ukrainian president, which followed reports in conservative media that Yovanovitch was disloyal to Trump.\n\nThe three committees scheduled a deposition with Igor Fruman, a Ukrainian-born business partner of Parnas, who helped introduce Giuliani to the Ukrainian prosecutor.\n\nTrump will rally supporters in Lake Charles, La. This would be the third event in a week in the state where members of the Trump administration have rallied voters, including Friday with Vice President Mike Pence in Kenner and Monday with the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., in Lafayette.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Drew Angerer)\n\nMore about the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump:\n\nNancy Pelosi has put the Trump impeachment inquiry on a fast track.
