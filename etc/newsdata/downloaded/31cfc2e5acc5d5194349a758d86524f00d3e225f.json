Music and fashion fans alike were delighted to see that K-pop star, Blackpink rapper Jennie Kim, known by the mononym Jennie, was on deck for all the high fashion hijinks at Chanel, where she met up with fellow front row guest, rapper Cardi B. Ahead of the show, the pair shared a hug and chatted as they posed for pictures before taking their seats next to none other than Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour.\n\nJennie\u2019s presence at the Chanel show was only fitting as she\u2019s been a model for Chanel Korea Beauty since 2018 and became a brand ambassador for Chanel Korea shortly afterwards.
