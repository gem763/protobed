REUTERS/Ryan Woo\n\nThe 45-year-old was among tens of thousands of Tibetan nomads who resettled in rural townships in the early 2000s, wooed by financial compensation from a Chinese government keen to pull the region back from ecological disaster.\n\nYanglo, who makes traditional Tibetan clothing to supplement his income as a park ranger in the upper Yellow River basin, is a model resettler.\n\n\u201cI am used to it now, and I don\u2019t plan to return to the grasslands,\u201d Yanglo told Reuters as he worked at his electric sewing machine in a resettlement village on the outskirts of Madoi county, around 2,000 kilometers from Beijing.\n\nThat is fortunate for Yanglo, as the government plans to declare a 123,100-square kilometer area of alpine grasslands, wetlands and lakes - roughly equivalent in size to England - as a national park by the end of next year. That will officially block him and many other migrants from ever returning to their former pastoral life.\n\nChina says the relocations have been key to saving the grasslands and helping Tibetans escape from poverty, but there is international concern the drive is coming at too high a cost, including the loss of cultural traditions and communities.\n\nThe government was spurred into action at the turn of the century when the upper course of the Yellow River began drying up, depleted by agriculture, industrialization and mining. The 5,464-kilometre (3,395-mile) river even failed to reach the sea in some years.\n\nBlaming global warming and overgrazing, China turned the upper basins of the Yangtze, Lancang (Mekong) and Yellow River into a nature reserve known as Sanjiangyuan. The government has invested more than 18 billion yuan ($2.53 billion) in conserving the local ecology since 2005, and plans to further invest 900 million yuan this year.\n\nThe government gave families who were willing to move from the area tens of thousands of yuan each in one-off compensation payments and thousands more yuan in recurring subsidies for grain and fuel. Almost 100,000 Tibetans have shifted to towns since 2005, according to state media.\n\nYanglo, who like some Tibetans goes by one name, left his home on the shores of Gyaring and Ngoring, a pair of high-altitude lakes near the headwaters of the Yellow River, in 2003. Last year, he was given a brick house with a walled yard in a specially built village of about 1,000 homes.\n\nLOST IDENTITY\n\nThere is little in Yanglo\u2019s home to remind his family of their nomadic past. His three children were all born after he had left the grasslands.\n\n\u201cMy children are too young to know the difference, so I\u2019ve borrowed a few yaks and let my children milk them,\u201d said Yanglo, speaking in Tibetan. \u201cAt least they can be near the animals.\u201d\n\nBut his biggest wish is for his children \u201cto get a better education and acquire some culture\u201d by assimilating further.\n\nIronically, that is what some human rights groups are worried about, fearing permanent mass migration will end a unique way of life.\n\nFor Tibetans, the natural world is more than a source of corporeal sustenance. It is also a spiritual landscape inhabited by deities and demons that demand respect and sacrifice.\n\nSonam Dargyal, who grew up in Lancang before becoming a physician in Yushu county, south of Madoi, has spent years collecting Tibetan folk tales, from stories of why a rock formation resembles a Buddha\u2019s head to flying lamas with magical powers.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t pass down these stories, future generations will have no knowledge of them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur folklore and our traditions will then be truly lost.\u201d\n\nOthers warn that the inability of many of the nomads to adapt to life in the townships effectively leaves them in no-man\u2019s land, culturally and socially, with many unable to communicate in Chinese and lacking skills to widen their employment horizons.\n\n\u201cIn the grasslands, they are free and they are self-assured,\u201d said Meng Xiangjing, a professor in population and development studies at Renmin University in Beijing.\n\nTo generate stable income, nomads are encouraged to explore work in areas such as scientific monitoring and ecological protection, as well as rural tourism and traditional handicraft production, the administration bureau of the Sanjiangyuan National Park said in a faxed statement.\n\n\u201cIn principle, there is no large-scale relocation of nomads,\u201d the administration bureau of the Sanjiangyuan National Park told Reuters. \u201cWe respect the will of the herders and guide them to relocate voluntarily.\u201d\n\nYet the creation of the national park effectively closes the door to return for anyone who lived within designated core zones, which comprise 75% of the park, where human activity will be restricted and livestock herding banned.\n\nSome herding families still reside in the core zones, according to some Tibetans whom Reuters spoke to in the area, but they were unable to say whether or not the nomads are in the process of resettlement ahead of the 2020 opening of the national park. The park\u2019s administration bureau did not respond to a question about whether families remained in the core zones.\n\nTenzin, a nomad who tends a herd of yaks across thousands of acres of grassland just outside the designated core zone of the national park, has resisted moving despite being given a house in Madoi county, which his younger daughters live in during school terms.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nThe 35-year-old, his wife and adolescent son, who spend their days herding and milking yaks and picking up slabs of yak dung for use as fuel, can stay put in the highlands for now.\n\nBut Tenzin is uneasy about the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very sad if my son inherits the land to then give it up,\u201d he said.", "description": "Former nomad Yanglo spent his youth tending yaks and sheep in the highlands of China's Qinghai province, but the Tibetan is now often found huddled over a sewing machine in his modest brick home around 160 kilometers (100 miles) away stitching sheepskin coats.", "authors": ["Ryan Woo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434007437&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P07L", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
