Madness.\n\n\u2018His profile gets bigger every time and he\u2019s doing us promoters a real favour by going on WWE.\n\n\u2018But truthfully, I don\u2019t like the risk of his cut opening up. Tyson\u2019s a law unto himself. It\u2019s risky though, no doubt about that.\n\n\u2018In an ideal world I\u2019d prefer he didn\u2019t do it, but it\u2019s all about the bigger picture for him. He\u2019s a natural wrestling star.\u2019\n\nFury has a particular dislike for Strowman (Picture: WWE)\n\nFury called Strowman out again on social media, urging the 6ft 8in giant to agree to fight him.\n\n\u2018Let me know when you want more of these hands,\u2019 Fury tweeted after coming to blows with the WWE star.\n\nAsked if Fury had a future in WWE and if a showdown with Strowman could actually happen, Warren replied: \u2018I\u2019m still awaiting the call from Tyson to tell me he\u2019s finished with this WWE stuff.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile speculation continues Fury could make further appearances on WWE, the former unififed heavyweight world champion is scheduled to take on Deontay Wilder next February in their much-anticipated rematch.\n\nFury and his team have repeatedly downplayed concerns he may not be fully fit for the rematch, but he will not be able to resume sparring until December at the earliest.", "description": "Frank Warren praised Tyson Fury's forray into WWE as a promotional masterstroke, but conceded he would have preferred his heavyweight concentrated on his injury recovery.
