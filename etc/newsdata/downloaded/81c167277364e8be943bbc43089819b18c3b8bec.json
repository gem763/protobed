Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told the Hong Kong South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201c[It] could pose a challenge to prospective adversaries such as the U.S. Navy and allied underwater activities in waters near the Chinese coast, such as the East China Sea and South China Sea,\u201d Koh said.\n\nAmerican and British UUVs are much bigger than the HSU-001 is. But they have to be, as they would need to sail long distances in order to reach potential conflict zones. The larger size also gives the U.S. and U.K. robo-subs greater potential for carrying weapons.\n\nThe U.S. Navy between 2020 and 2024 wants to spend around $4 billion buying nine unmanned submarines as well as 10 unmanned surface warships.\n\nThe robotic vessels could help the Navy to grow the fleet despite proposed cuts and slowdowns in the acquisition of traditional manned vessels. Senior Navy leaders increasingly worry that big warships, some crewed by hundreds of sailors, are too vulnerable to Russian and Chinese missiles.\n\nThe Navy already has tapped Boeing to build the robotic submarines, using the company\u2019s Orca design as a starting point. The 51-foot-long Orca autonomously can sail as far as 6,500 nautical miles.\n\n\"Eventually, the Navy could also use the Orca ... for mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, electronic warfare and strike missions, according to a Navy outline of the system\u2019s capability development,\" reporter Ben Werner explained at USNI News.\n\nThe U.K. Ministry of Defense in April 2019 launched a $3.3-million competition to begin developing its own robotic submarine.\n\nThe contest could lead to the acquisition of an operational autonomous sub for the Royal Navy -- and could help the British fleet partially to fill the undersea gap resulting from deep cuts to its sub force.\n\nThe ministry asked industry by June 2019 to submit proposals for an extra-large unmanned underwater vehicle, or XLUUV.\n\n\u201cThe Royal Navy says that contract will have two stages, a one-year long research, design and refit stage and a testing and trialing stage,\u201d U.K. Defense Journal explained. \u201cIn the latter stage it is expected that the system will be tested in representative environments for extended periods; the sea trials in stage two may be up to two years long.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s request for proposals sketched three different operational scenarios for the possible, future robo-sub.\n\nIn the covert intelligence-gathering role, the XLUUV \u201cis tasked to gather covert intelligence of traffic transiting in a maritime operational area,\u201d according to the RFP.\n\nIn the anti-submarine role, the XLUUV \u201cis tasked with enacting an anti-submarine barrier in a particular location,\u201d the RFP explained.\n\nFinally, in the \u201cdeploy and recover\u201d role, the robotic submarines \u201cis tasked with covertly deploying a sensor payload to the seabed and recovering it at a later date,\u201d according to the government request.", "description": "How worried should Asia and America be?", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b1jpGI0ELv2Koh0L2luBFQ--~B/aD04NzA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/9d699e2bffb45ee2404a081ada296d55", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
