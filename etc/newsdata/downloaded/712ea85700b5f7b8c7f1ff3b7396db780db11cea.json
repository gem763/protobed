Federal courts have also been preventing Team Trump from pushing through its efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants, let alone to attempt to fix a broken asylum system gamed by economic migrants from Central America who don\u2019t fit the traditional definition of refugees fleeing for their lives.\n\nBut anyone who believes sanctuary-movement backers and Dems seeking to decriminalize illegal immigration are beating the president needs a reality check.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled to permit the administration to go on refusing to accept applications for asylum from migrants who have passed through another country without being denied asylum there, while a case challenging this common-sense policy works its way through the courts.\n\nThat comes on the heels of the court\u2019s decision in July to allow Trump to use money from the defense budget to build the border wall. It was yet another significant victory for the administration\u2019s initiatives and a sign that the left\u2019s judicial guerrilla war that had been stymieing the president is starting to crumble.\n\nExpect liberal efforts to prevent Trump from overturning President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders that effectively granted amnesty to millions of illegals to meet the same fate.\n\nFact is, despite the beating Trump has continued to take from the media about government tactics aimed at stemming the surge of illegal immigrants over the southern border, his policies have started to show signs of success.\n\nWhile no one expects Mexico to pay for Trump\u2019s wall, it is doing something more important: using its resources to stop its people from crossing over into the United States illegally. It has, for example, reinforced security on its southern border and set up checkpoints on highways leading north, dispatching 21,600 police and troops across the nation in the effort.\n\nSo far in 2019, the US Border Patrol has arrested more than 400,000 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for crossing the border illegally. But only 4,300 Mexicans were caught doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s all strong evidence that, far from ignoring or rejecting Trump\u2019s efforts to jawbone them into doing something to stop the flood of illegals, America\u2019s most important southern neighbor is listening to him. Recall that Mexico stepped up actions to control the migrants in a bid to avoid tariffs Trump had threatened to impose.\n\nThe message has also gotten through to those seeking to come to the United States illegally. Mexican officials have said there has been a \u201csignificant decrease\u201d in the number of Central Americans entering their country this year for the purpose of illegally immigrating to the United States.\n\nIt makes sense. The campaign by Obama and other Democrats to grant amnesty and a wide array of benefits to illegal immigrants fueled the surge across the border, with new migrants seeking the same lenient treatment. That led to the crisis in which federal resources were overwhelmed by the sheer number of asylum-seekers, prompting much grandstanding and crocodile tears from the left.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have libelously denounced his attempts to enforce the law \u2014 and restore order at the border \u2014 as reminiscent of the Nazis and evidence of racism. Yet those efforts seem to be having the intended effect on those contemplating coming here without permission.\n\nWith the courts recognizing Trump\u2019s right to use his power to protect the border and with Mexico now cooperating with the United States, perhaps there\u2019s a chance to break the long deadlock over immigration in Washington.\n\nOf course, everyone knows America\u2019s immigration system is badly broken, but Democrats, who hope they will win control of both Congress and the White House next year, have prevented a compromise that would allow the so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d to stay in the country in exchange for the building of a border wall. So a fix may have to wait until after the 2020 election.\n\nBut no matter who wins next year, Trump has shown that, his intemperate rhetoric on the issue not withstanding, strict enforcement policies combined with the help of both the Supreme Court and the Mexicans can provide a way forward to fix an illegal-immigration problem that has long seemed insoluble.\n\nJonathan Tobin is editor in chief of JNS.org and a contributor to National Review.", "description": "No matter who wins next year, Trump has shown that, his intemperate rhetoric on the issue not withstanding, strict enforcement policies combined with the help of the Supreme Court and Mexico can provide a way to fix an illegal-immigration problem that has long seemed insoluble.", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/border-wall-texas.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
