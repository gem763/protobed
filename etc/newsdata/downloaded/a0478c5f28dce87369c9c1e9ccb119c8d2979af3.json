Based on its past records, Washington may at any time decide to cancel the agreement if it thinks the cancellation served its interest best.\n\nSo there remain many potential challenges ahead that will put the wisdom and patience of the two countries to test. In the first place, the US side should cherish the hard-won achievement inked in the latest talks and avoid backpedalling, as it often did in the past.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/13/5da268caa310cf3e97a0f42c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
