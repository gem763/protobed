(Steve Luciano/AP)\n\nAround 6:25 p.m. Sunday, referee Dave Gantar will sound his whistle for the last time and mark the end of D.C. United\u2019s regular season finale against FC Cincinnati. At about the same time, 11 other MLS matches with synchronized kickoffs will also conclude, locking in the standings and the playoff pairings.\n\nIf all goes according to United\u2019s plan, there will be no need to check the out-of-town scores until the players and coaches roll back into the locker room at Audi Field.\n\nUnited is in control, knowing a victory over the league\u2019s worst team will secure a home playoff game.\n\n\u201cThe players understand what is at stake,\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said, \u201cand how a win makes our path a hair easier in achieving our ultimate goal of holding the trophy.\u201d\n\n[D.C. United severs ties with streaming partner FloSports]\n\nSeven clubs in each of the 12-team conferences will march on. First place earns a bye to the conference semifinals; that\u2019s New York City FC and Los Angeles FC. Teams finishing second, third and fourth will host a first-round match Oct. 19 or 20.\n\nBolstered by a four-game unbeaten streak, United (13-10-10, 49 points) stands fourth, with no hope of rising but in danger of sliding to sixth. The New York Red Bulls (14-13-6, 48) and Toronto FC (12-10-11, 47) are on D.C.'s tail. By finishing fourth or fifth, United would face one of those two teams in the opening round.\n\nThe Red Bulls and Toronto will close against Montreal and Columbus, respectively, two teams also out of postseason contention.\n\nA United defeat, or even a draw, probably would send the team on the road in the first round.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s ugly, whether it\u2019s pretty \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 the focus is to win,\u201d midfielder Paul Arriola said. \u201cThe first playoff game could really set us on the right path. It\u2019s easier to start at home.\u201d\n\nAlthough the gap in the standings between United and expansion Cincinnati (6-22-5, 23 points) is large, Olsen is guarding against overconfidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s MLS, and no one is that good or that bad in this league,\u201d Olsen said of a competitive balance that has left two of 24 teams with fewer than 10 defeats. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time as a coach where there has been an easy game.\u201d\n\nIf any game were easy, at least on paper, it would be this one. Cincinnati has won once in 13 matches, a stretch that began with a 4-1 home defeat to United on July 18. Its goal differential is a woeful minus-44. However, the club has earned a victory and two draws in its past four outings.\n\nUnited is far from perfect at home: 7-4-5 for only 26 of a possible 48 points. At 6-6-5, D.C. is MLS\u2019s third-best away team.\n\nOn the road, D.C. has parlayed grit, organization and opportunism into points. It\u2019s unattractive but effective.\n\n\u201cWho gives a [expletive] if no one likes how it looks?\u201d forward Quincy Amarikwa said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. We won. It needs to be that first, then all the other stuff.\u201d\n\nTo win, United must score, and there is concern about the attack, though United is typically more proactive at home than on the road. In its previous appearance at Buzzard Point, United was in top form against playoff-bound Seattle, in sync in the attack and typically resolute on defense.\n\nTied for the fourth-fewest goals in MLS (42), United will be without top scorer Wayne Rooney, who is serving a one-game suspension for accumulation of yellow cards. Amarikwa is the likely replacement, although late-season signing Ola Kamara is expected to be in uniform after missing three games with a hamstring ailment.\n\nUnited\u2019s defending has been almost spotless: four consecutive shutouts, a single-season team record. Bill Hamid is second in MLS in shutouts with 13, one behind Atlanta\u2019s Brad Guzan.\n\n\u201cOur sole focus is to win this game, and then we can move on,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything to this group right now.\u201d\n\nFC Cincinnati at D.C.
