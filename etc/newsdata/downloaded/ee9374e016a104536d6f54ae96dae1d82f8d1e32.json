A joint congressional committee had requested a deposition from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, over text exchanges regarding Donald Trump\u2019s actions with Ukraine. That deposition was set for later this morning, until the State Department ordered Sondland not to testify on the issue. It\u2019s the first real indication that the White House intends to play hardball on Ukraine-Gate on all fronts.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney told the committee that the State Department\u2019s instructions left Sondland no choice but to comply:\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney says that Sondland \u201cis required\u201d to follow the US State Dept.\u2019s direction to avoid testifying, but he is \u201cprofoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today\u201d and he \u201cstands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear.\u201d \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 8, 2019\n\nThe text exchanges in which Sondland participated are mainly noteworthy for what Ukraine charges d\u2019affairs William Taylor wrote. Taylor expressed frustration over what he saw as a quid pro quo involving the held-up US aid to Ukraine, threatening at one point to resign over it. Sondland responded at one point that Trump had explicitly rejected a quid-pro-quo approach, which if true might have made Sondland a sympathetic witness for Trump.\n\nOf course, that one message is not all that would have come up in today\u2019s deposition:\n\nIn one text message, Sondland wrote that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d referring to a clear demonstration from Ukraine that it would undertake the investigations. Sondland worked closely with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, to shape U.S. foreign policy around Trump\u2019s desire to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to undermine Trump\u2019s candidacy. Lawmakers heard last week from Volker after he resigned his position and turned over his communications to Congress. Sondland remains in his post and has turned over the documents that lawmakers want to the State Department instead, setting up a fight between the legislative and executive branches over access to the information.\n\nCould Sondland have also resigned and then been deposed? Probably not. Volker turned his materials over to the State Department despite his resignation, not to Congress. His work at the State Department is still technically controlled by State whether he works there or not, and the same would be true for Sondland. Resignation doesn\u2019t change that fact, nor would it be technically necessary for either to act as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d either, although testifying without permission would presumably result in an immediate termination for a presidential appointee.\n\nState\u2019s order to Sondland will force Congress to get a subpoena, both for the materials and for Sondland\u2019s testimony, which will then force a court fight. If the White House makes an executive privilege claim on this, it will likely lose, but it will drag out for months. The strategy here is to force Nancy Pelosi to hold a House vote for a formal impeachment inquiry, one that will produce a more efficient system with fairer procedures and wider access for White House and Trump attorneys to evidence and testimony.\n\nUntil Pelosi holds that vote \u2014 and put her members on the spot \u2014 the White House has decided to conduct a legal form of trench warfare to freeze the process in place. Since the House decides when it has enough evidence to vote on impeachment, that may not work, but it will definitely matter when it comes to a removal vote. If Republicans can attack the process as patently unfair and a kind of kangaroo court, they can sell an acquittal that much easier.\n\nAddendum: Trump\u2019s tweets on the matter seem to underscore the strategic nature of the decision:\n\n\u2026.to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d That says it ALL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cKangaroo court\u201d is a phrase we will be hearing often, at least until Pelosi holds a formal vote and sets up a proper inquiry. (And let\u2019s face, probably thereafter too, but with less cause.)", "description": "\u201c... profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trump-pompeo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
