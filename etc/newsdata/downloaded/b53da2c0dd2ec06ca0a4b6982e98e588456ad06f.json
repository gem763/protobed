He fled the scene in Tower Hamlets but told police he was a 'murderer' after handing himself in the following day\n\nProsecutor Gareth Patterson QC told Snaresbrook Crown Court: 'On Thursday 25 April of this year he attacked his partner and fianc\u00e9e, a woman called Amy Parsons.\n\n'Unwilling to accept that she was going to leave him, he used a heavy metal bar to hit her repeatedly around the head while she was showering in the Docklands flat which they shared.\n\n'By his blows with that bar he caused her horrific injuries and fractures to the head and to her face and to her brain.\n\n'He left her lying in her own blood in the bath of her flat and walked out of the flat doing nothing to help her or to get her any treatment.'\n\nJurors heard the pair had been in a relationship for several years but he was 'dependent' on his girlfriend, who was born in Australia but had been living in the UK for many years.\n\nThe prosecutor said: 'Before the defendant met her he had had little in the way of relationships with other women and the evidence that you will hear suggests that after he met her and the relationship began that he became extremely dependent upon her.\n\n'The flat in which they lived was owned by her. He did not go out to work. She provided him with financial support, working as a Personal Assistant to a manager in an Insurance Company in the City.\n\n'It was Amy who paid the rent for the flat every month. The evidence suggests he was reliant on her.\n\n'At times he had had depression in the past but he had chosen not to take medication and the dependency on her appears to have been both emotional and financial.\n\nJurors heard the pair had been in a relationship for several years but he was 'dependent' on his girlfriend, who was born in Australia but had been living in the UK for many years\n\n'You will hear evidence about the nature of that relationship from witnesses who knew them both and from witnesses with whom they exchanged messages.\n\n'With those various witnesses they had both discussed the relationship. Amy became increasing unhappy. '\n\nHe continued: 'One bone of contention was he like to engage in cross dressing. She was unhappy about this and this was something he often wanted to do when they were together and they were intimate. She didn't like it.\n\n'A few weeks before her death Amy Parsons began to become increasingly fond of a colleague at work, a man called James Saunders.\n\n'Their feelings and affections for each other developed to a sexual relationship.\n\nIt was heard that one bone of contention was he like to engage in cross dressing. Prosecutors said: 'she was reportedly unhappy about this and this was something he often wanted to do when they were together and they were intimate. She didn't like it'\n\n'Amy Parsons did tell the defendant about this. He told a friend that he blamed himself somewhat feeling that he had pushed her to him. But he became unhappy and told people he felt hurt.\n\n'The evidence suggests that he felt he was losing Amy.\n\n'You will hear from people he spoke with and exchanged messages with. It appears there were rows between the defendant and Amy.\n\n'As time went on his unhappiness deepened and it developed into jealousy of the other man and anger.\n\n'He described the new man in her life as a 'bast***', a 'creep', a 'scumbag', a 'bloody k*** head', a 'complete tool' and a 'f**king twat'.\n\nMiss Parsons was pronounced dead at the scene and a post-mortem examination revealed she had been struck several times\n\n'He messaged him saying 'back off'. He began stalking Amy, following her home from work and going to a restaurant to try to see her with this new man James Saunders.\n\n'He tried to monitor what she was doing, accessing her laptop and studying on her account her use of Uber taxis.\n\n'He described her as a 'sneaky b***h' and as a 'nasty, nasty person'. He wrote to one friend 'why are women so horrible?' and called her 'a f*****g liar' and wrote 'I hate her'.\n\n'To another friend he messaged 'I'm going to do something stupid, I just know I am.'\n\nJurors heard one of the messages Amy sent to her friends read: 'I woke up to 123 text messages and 17 missed calls.'\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Roderick Deakin-White, 38, caused 'horrific injuries' as he repeatedly struck 35-year-old Amy Parsons with a two foot long metal bar on April 25, jurors at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382396-0-image-a-2_1572449674075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
