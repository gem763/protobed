Amazon already said its Echo Dot outsold all other items on its site this holiday season, which hinted toward the sizable growth for the voice-powered speaker market. Today, research firm CIRP is reporting the U.S. installed base for speakers grew to 66 million units in December 2018, up from 53 million in the September 2018 quarter and just 37 million in December 2017.\n\nHowever, holiday sales didn\u2019t have much impact on the market shares for the various speaker brands, the firm found.\n\nAmazon Echo devices still lead the U.S. market with a 70 percent share of the installed base, followed by Google Home at 24 percent, then Apple HomePod at 6 percent, the report said.\n\n\u201cHoliday shoppers helped the smart speaker market take off again,\u201d said Josh Lowitz, partner and co-founder of CIRP, in a statement. \u201cRelative market shares have remained fairly stable, with Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod accounting for consistent shares over the past few quarters. Amazon and Google both have broad model lineups, ranging from basic to high-end, with even more variants from Amazon. Apple, of course, has only its premium-priced HomePod, and likely won\u2019t gain significant share until it offers an entry-level product closer to Echo Dot and Home mini,\u201d Lowitz added.\n\nAlso of interest is that some portion of those buying a smart speaker for their home already own one. According to CIRP, 35 percent of smart speaker owners now have multiple devices, as of December 2018. That\u2019s up from 18 percent in December 2017.\n\nThis figure is key to the device makers\u2019 larger strategies, because it means that once a company is able to get that first sale, the consumer may return to buy more devices from the same vendor.\n\nAmazon had gained an early advantage here, initially convincing more users to buy another speaker compared with Google Home users. A year ago, almost double the number of Echo users had multiple devices, versus Google Home owners. But Google is catching up, and now about a third of Echo and Google Home users have multiple devices.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that CIRP data \u2014 like much that\u2019s produced by market research firms \u2014 isn\u2019t always going to match up exactly with other firms\u2019 estimates and forecasts.\n\nFor example, Strategy Analytics this fall said that Amazon\u2019s Echo market share in the U.S. was 63 percent, to Google\u2019s 17 percent and Apple HomePod\u2019s 4 percent. Meanwhile, eMarketer\u2019s 2019 U.S. forecast predicts Amazon Echo will end up with around a 63.3 percent market share this year, versus Google Home\u2019s 31 percent, with all others, like HomePod and Sonos, reaching 12 percent.\n\nThat said, the broad strokes across all reports point to the same general findings \u2014 that Amazon is leading the U.S. market by a wide margin, and while that margin may be shrinking, it\u2019s not going away soon.", "description": "Smart speakers had a good holiday.
