Let's have an election on December 12,\" Johnson told television stations.\n\n\"What I'm saying to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party is that they have the opportunity now to get this thing done.\"\n\n- Pound slides -\n\nSenior European diplomats who attended a meeting on Friday in Brussels confirmed the 27 non-British members had agreed in principle that some kind of delay was in order.\n\nThey also agreed that their capitals could decide on its length by written procedure, rather than by holding a leaders' crisis summit in Brussels next week.\n\nBut, with France pushing for a shorter delay to keep the pressure on Westminster, and Germany and Ireland backing a three-month pause until January 31, the decision is not done.\n\n\"Depending on how things evolve in the UK, we've given ourselves until the start of next week,\" a senior diplomat said.\n\n\"It's clear that if a decision is taken in the UK on whether or not to hold an election -- the date of the election will weigh on the consultations,\" he said.\n\nThe uncertainty weighed on the British pound, which dropped against the dollar and euro on Friday.\n\nIn the meantime, Johnson has put on pause his efforts to ratify the withdrawal agreement -- after MPs rejected a bid to speed it through in just three days -- leaving Brexit in limbo.\n\nJohnson's Conservative cabinet colleagues, however, backed him on his demands to press on with plans for a vote regardless.\n\n\"We cannot keep on having delay after delay after delay,\" finance minister Sajid Javid told Sky News.\n\nWhen the EU ambassadors last met on Wednesday, Germany and Ireland backed postponing Britain's departure until January 31, France sought a shorter delay and others were on the fence.\n\nJohnson's government, meanwhile, has scrapped plans to present its new budget next month, with Javid arguing that it had been planned with the October 31 departure date in mind.\n\nHis finance ministry accepted the government was set to fail in its plan to leave by the deadline, announcing it had also \"paused\" production of the new Brexit 50p coins bearing the October 31 date.\n\n\"We have paused production of the Brexit coin and will take a final decision in due course,\" a ministry source told the Daily Telegraph.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday told opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to \"man up\" and accept a snap election as EU members delayed a decision on how long to postpone next week's Brexit deadline.
