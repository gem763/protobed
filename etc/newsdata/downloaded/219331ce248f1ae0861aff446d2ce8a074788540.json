But can any rival the real deal?", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s nothing quite like bacon. That smoky smell. The crispy texture. The tantalising mix of savoury and sweet.\n\nIt is why many of us just can\u2019t give up meat for good. So, it\u2019s no surprise manufacturers have been working to create a meat-free substitute \u2014 made from everything from coconut to fungus to pea protein \u2014 to satisfy the most determined carnivores (and vegans with withdrawal symptoms).\n\nPlant-based bacon is often better for our health, too. Processed meats having been labelled a class one carcinogen by the World Health Organization. The NHS also recommends cutting down.\n\nVegan Tanith Carey and her husband carnivore Anthony, gave their verdict on a selection of meat-free bacon including Wheaty Vegan Bacon (pictured)\n\nUK consumers seem to be embracing meat-free meals. One in six food products launched last year contained no animal ingredients \u2014 a higher proportion than in any other country \u2014 according to market research company Mintel.\n\nAs a vegan of four years it won\u2019t take much to convince me to give meat-free bacon a try. But can the fake bacon or \u2018facon\u2019 convince my carnivore husband Anthony?\n\nBacon made from wheat\n\nWheaty Vegan Bacon (\u00a31.79 for 5 rashers, thevegankindsupermarket.com)\n\nWhat is it? The pack doesn\u2019t look promising. Inside there are five stubby strips made of seitan, a wheat protein.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had bacon, but this slightly rubbery texture isn\u2019t taking me back. It has 35.3g of protein, enough to silence any pesky meat-eater asking: \u2018Where do you get your protein from?\u2019\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: The main flavour is onion, summoning up memories of the stuffing I\u2019d have with Christmas dinner, rather than a full English. While tasty, it looks nothing like the real thing.\n\nBacon rating: 2/5\n\nMaple syrup strips\n\nTofurky Treehouse Tempeh Smoky Maple Bacon Marinated Strips (\u00a34.59 for 15, ocado.com)\n\nTanith says Tofurky Treehouse Tempeh Smoky Maple Bacon Marinated Strips (pictured) don't look like real bacon\n\nWhat is it? At first glance, this is baffling as in the packet it looks like vacuum-packed mince. The weird-looking finger-like pieces are made of grains of tempeh, a type of fermented soy bean, marinated in maple syrup.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: These don\u2019t look like anything I\u2019ve seen in my life. They look like little seeds glued together and crumble in the frying pan. This will never convince Anthony to go vegan.\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: This is intensely smoky in flavour, but not bacon as I\u2019ve ever experienced it. Still, at 115 calories per 100g, a quarter of the amount found in many bacons, I could forsake my rashers for these for my arteries\u2019 sake. 3/5\n\nSmoked with beech\n\nSgaia Mheat Streaky Rashers (\u00a34.15 for four, thevegankindsupermarket.com)\n\nAnthony says he wouldn't have initially spotted that Sgaia Mheat Streaky Rashers (pictured) isn't real bacon\n\nWhat is it? A blend of soya and protein, and flavoured with beechwood liquid smoke, as well as onion, garlic, beetroot and molasses.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: It looks like the real thing and cooks and sizzles like bacon, but the beech-wood gives the game away.\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: I don\u2019t think I could have told this facon wasn\u2019t made of pig meat at first sight, though the taste might have alerted me. At just 1.4g total fat, my arteries would have appreciated it though. 4/5\n\nPea protein rashers\n\nThis Isn\u2019t Bacon Plant-based Rashers (\u00a33.19 for 10, ocado.com)\n\nTanith and Anthony were both impressed with This Isn\u2019t Bacon Plant-based Rashers (pictured) for its taste and appearance\n\nWhat is it? Radish, carrot and paprika give this the bacon\u2019s pink hue. The rashers are made of pea and soya protein, so it\u2019s very high in protein, with 24.5g per 100g.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: The rashers looked like slimy kippers but fry it and something magical happens. It gets crispy and streaky, turning into an eerily convincing re-creation of the real thing.\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: This facon could lure me to the vegan side. It\u2019s so finely sliced it became crunchy when cooked, exactly mimicking the real thing. 5/5\n\nFungus the bacon\n\nQuorn Vegetarian Bacon (\u00a31.75 for eight, ocado.com)\n\nTanith says she wouldn't eat Quorn Vegetarian Bacon (pictured) because it contains egg, but she's glad it's available\n\nWhat is it? This is made from mycoprotein, a high-protein fungus, which is then fermented, dried and mixed with egg.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: This facon comes as pink oblong strips. As it contains egg, it\u2019s off the menu for me. Regardless, I am still glad it\u2019s out there as it takes 90 per cent less land and water to make than using pigs.\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: I haven\u2019t seen meat this pink and fake-looking since Spam at school. This one tasted too sugary and lacked the smoky notes of its rivals. 1/5\n\nMore than 30 ingredients\n\nVegan Cartel Vegan Bacon (\u00a34.20 for 12, thevegankind supermarket.com)\n\nAnthony says Vegan Cartel Vegan Bacon (pictured) is sweet, smoky, and every bit as decadent tasting as real bacon\n\nWhat is it? To recreate the \u2018cured\u2019 flavour of bacon, more than 30 extra ingredients have been added to the wheat gluten base.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: Excellent bacon replica, though it has around the same amount of calories as the real thing. It\u2019s delicious, convincing in taste and appearance.\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: Salty, sweet and smoky, this is every bit as decadent tasting as real bacon. Our dog Honey couldn\u2019t tell the difference either. 4/5\n\nRed with added iron\n\nVbites Cheatin\u2019 Rashers (\u00a32.30 for 7, Morrisons)\n\nTanithy and Anthony say Vbites Cheatin\u2019 Rashers (pictured) doesn't remind them of bacon and has a robust texture\n\nWhat is it? A blend of soya, wheat gluten and vegetable fat \u2018formed\u2019 into bacon-flavour rashers, then coloured with iron oxide to give a red hue.\n\nThe vegan\u2019s verdict: This is like no bacon I remember. Still, its robust texture means it would be a good addition to pasta sauce or used instead of pepperoni on a pizza.\n\nThe carnivore\u2019s verdict: It lost its spam-like hue when fried and had the consistency of lightly browned leather. It tasted like salted cardboard. 1/5", "description": "Processed meats are a class one carcinogen.
