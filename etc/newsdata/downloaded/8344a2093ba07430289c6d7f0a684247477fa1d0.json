But if she had to decide again, all three would have been given the triple vaccine\n\nNone of my three sons, now 24, 21 and 15, had the MMR jab as part of their routine childhood immunisations. But if I had to decide again, all three would have been given the triple vaccine.\n\nInstead, like too many others, I was frightened off it by a study published in 1998 that linked it to autism.\n\nIt\u2019s a decision I now regret. For, quite apart from leaving them unprotected for too long, with my first two unvaccinated, it meant I potentially exposed the baby I was hoping to conceive to the risk of rubella.\n\nThe complications of this viral infection are grim, and include deafness and heart problems for the baby, and miscarriage.\n\nNot that I considered that at the time, in my fright.\n\nThe now-infamous \u2014 and fraudulent \u2014 study, published in 1998 in the world-renowned Lancet journal, was led by gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield. He\u2019d looked at 12 children with autism, identifying eight whose parents said their children\u2019s behavioural symptoms had developed within two weeks of receiving the MMR jab.\n\nAt a press conference after publication, Dr Wakefield (as he was \u2014 he\u2019s since been struck off from the UK medical register) called for the MMR vaccine to be suspended pending more research.\n\nThe MMR story seemed to dominate the headlines for weeks on end \u2014 though possibly this was just how it felt to anxious parents.\n\nThe now-infamous \u2014 and fraudulent \u2014 study, published in 1998 in the world-renowned Lancet journal, was led by gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield\n\nBut in any event, like scalded cats, my friends and I talked about it and panicked \u2014 a few became anti-vaxxers and remain so. They\u2019ve since been joined by countless thousands elsewhere, leading to falling rates of vaccination.\n\nOthers like me, who had no qualms about our children\u2019s previous routine vaccinations (against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and the bacterial infection Hib), instead became \u2018single-vaxxers\u2019, getting the measles, mumps and rubella jabs done separately.\n\nWakefield himself suggested doing this, with the jabs a year apart.\n\nSo that\u2019s why my memories of my sons\u2019 pre-school years \u2014 and beyond \u2014 are dominated by endless car journeys to source the single vaccines.\n\nI vividly remember in the early days going to one temporary clinic, set up above a shop in a suburb of London, which felt very fly-by-night. I am not sure it was around even a few weeks later.\n\nWhile I then found other \u2014 legitimate \u2014 clinics, there were problems with supply, particularly of the mumps single jab. My middle son was nine years old when he finally had it.\n\nIt was a fraught business, and expensive \u2014 not much shy of \u00a3100 per jab. (This put me in the privileged minority able to afford the option of single jabs: who\u2019s to say if others were driven to become anti-vaxxers by force of economic circumstance?)\n\nAnd then, against this background, in 2001 there was the major storm over whether the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had given his toddler son, Leo, the triple jab. Mr Blair refused to say, his aides declaring that revealing family details would cross a red line. Stock picture\n\nAs I drove across the country and wrote out yet another cheque, it was with a sense of anger against the manufacturers and the Government who would no longer allow the single vaccines to be provided on the NHS.\n\nI wanted to do the best by my children \u2014 to vaccinate them \u2014 but by making the triple MMR jab the only option, it felt like the Government was forcing me to do something to my children that I thought would do them harm.\n\nAnd then, against this background, in 2001 there was the major storm over whether the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had given his toddler son, Leo, the triple jab. Mr Blair refused to say, his aides declaring that revealing family details would cross a red line.\n\nSeven years later, Cherie wrote in her autobiography that Leo had in fact had the triple vaccine, admitting: \u2018It\u2019s fair to say I was in two minds. [But] I did get Leo vaccinated.\u2019\n\nTo parents like me, the Prime Minister\u2019s silence had been tacit confirmation that the MMR was \u2018problematic\u2019 and that we could ignore official advice to use it on our children. Tony, it seemed until we learned the truth, had probably either avoided the triple jab or had gone to France to get Leo the single jabs to protect him \u2014 which was all we wanted for our children, too.\n\nAs a mother-to-be I\u2019d carefully avoided anything that might even vaguely affect my baby\u2019s health \u2014 everything I consumed was organic, nothing \u2018artificial\u2019; I shunned paracetamol, and even when I developed pneumonia during my first pregnancy, I seriously thought twice about taking the antibiotics. I had no pain relief during labour.\n\nI was \u2018hard-core wholesome\u2019 \u2014 and that continued after my babies were born. All organic food, of course (back then, that was a lot more difficult to do: I even persuaded a Californian friend to bring boxes of organic teething rusks every time she came to the UK, as I couldn\u2019t source them here).\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t have a problem with vaccinations per se, the MMR study hit me and others at our most vulnerable: the desire to protect our babies.\n\nIt was hard to make the case for voluntarily doing harm to your child by risking \u2018giving\u2019 them autism (a lifelong condition) to avoid a minor childhood illness (just a passing misery, we thought, blas\u00e9 thanks to the success of modern medicine).\n\nBy the time Wakefield\u2019s study was being discredited (it was retracted by the Lancet in 2010), I\u2019d moved into health journalism, and the evidence against the autism link was impossible to ignore.\n\nThere are at least ten large studies \u2014 and several smaller ones \u2014 that show the vaccine does not raise the risk of autism.\n\nThe most recent paper, published in March, involved more than 650,000 children up to about the age of eight, and was led by researchers in Denmark and California\u2019s Stanford University.\n\nIt confirmed previous findings that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism \u2014 and that this was even the case with children who might be at higher risk of the disorder (perhaps because they have older parents or a sibling with the condition).\n\nAlthough my sons had completed their full course of single jabs, I thought \u2018just in case\u2019, and made sure that they had booster triple jabs under the NHS\u2019s \u2018catch-up programme\u2019, during secondary school.\n\nThis, to me, seems a way forward: don\u2019t make parents feel guilty or stupid about not giving their child MMR.\n\nOffer them a catch-up. And make it easier to get appointments in the evenings and at weekends \u2014 or even offer the option of healthcare professionals going into the home to give the vaccine. Clearly, there also needs to be an education programme to tackle social-media misinformation. But making MMR mandatory would be a mistake.\n\nI think back to how I felt when the MMR story broke, and I fear that mandatory vaccination will only undermine trust in the medical profession among those who are already sceptical, while doing nothing to convert diehard anti-vaxxers.\n\nAs I write, I think about a relative of mine, now in his 30s, who caught meningitis as an infant and was left deaf, and how different his life has been as a result.\n\nIt was probably meningitis B that was to blame \u2014 back then, it was not part of the standard infant vaccination schedule. It is now, in the UK.\n\nI\u2019m no Pollyanna about vaccines \u2014 like any medical treatment, they can sometimes cause side-effects \u2014 and pharmaceutical companies certainly make money from them.\n\nBut I know that my family and I have benefited from them \u2014 as have vulnerable people, including pregnant women. For these reasons, I firmly believe the MMR is worth having.", "description": "JUSTINE HANCOCK: None of my three sons had the MMR jab as part of their routine childhood immunisations.
