How many plates do you put on each side of the barbell, and what sizes? If you didn\u2019t immediately answer \u201ca 45 and a 20, of course,\u201d then perhaps you would like a little primer on plate maths.\n\nYes, you count the bar\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. When you tell somebody how much weight you lifted, that includes the total poundage that you had in your hands. The bar is part of that.\n\nAt most gyms, a typical barbell is around 2 metres long and weighs around 20kg. If your gym has multiple sizes of bar, check the end for a label giving the weight, or ask somebody. Olympic style weightlifting is done with a 20 kilogram bar for men, and a shorter, narrower 15 kilogram bar for women. (The main advantage of the women\u2019s bar, if you\u2019re a woman, is that it\u2019s easier to grip.)\n\nYour gym might also have smaller training bars \u2014 five kilograms is one common weight. Home exercise equipment sometimes uses a 3 centimetre bar without the wider collars you\u2019ll see on Olympic or powerlifting gear; those bars are lighter, and you should weigh yours or check the package to see what you\u2019ve got.\n\nIf you\u2019re lifting with a Smith machine, or any other kind of machine, don\u2019t bother trying to figure out how much the machine or its bar weighs. Every machine is different, they\u2019re almost never labelled, and the weights won\u2019t necessarily feel the same as they would on a barbell. Just write down the total weight you loaded onto it \u2014 that\u2019s enough for record keeping purposes.\n\nWhat about the clips or collars that hold the weight on? Usually they\u2019re not heavy enough to bother adding into your calculations, but if they\u2019re large and you know the weight, feel free to include them.\n\nAdd \u2019em up\n\nThis may be obvious, but I want to make sure this information is easy to find: to find the total weight you\u2019ve put on the bar, add up the plates on one end, double that number, and add the weight of the bar.\n\nSo if you have a 20 and an 10 on each end, add 20 + 10 to get 30, double that (60), and add the weight of the bar (60 + 20 = 80kg).\n\nMore often, though, you start with a number you\u2019d like to lift, and then have to load the bar appropriately. Start practicing and soon you\u2019ll be able to load a bar correctly without thinking about it too much. Here\u2019s how:\n\nMemorise common combinations\n\nLet\u2019s assume we\u2019re working with a 20kg bar. You\u2019ll end up using the same combinations over and over, and these numbers will start to look really familiar:\n\n24 kilograms: a 2kg plate on each side\n\n30 kilograms: a 5kg plate on each side\n\n42 kilograms: a 11kg plate on each side\n\n60 kilograms: a 20kg plate on each side\n\n100 kilograms: two 20kg plates on each side\n\n140 kilograms: three 20kg plates on each side\n\nAs you warm up for a lift, you can do the maths as you put plates on. Say you do a set with just the empty bar, then with a 10 on each side (that\u2019s 40), then a second pair of 10\u2019s (60), then swap both of those out for a 25 (now we\u2019re up to 70) and you want to do your next set at 80. You know you need 10 more kilograms, so look for a pair of 5kg plates and there you go.\n\nApps and calculators help\n\nYes, there are calculators that will do the job for you. I track my workouts in an app called Strong, and it has a little button that will tell you how to load the bar for your lift. RackMath (free on iOS and Android) looks like a good option for a standalone app.\n\nAn online equivalent is this calculator from ExRx. Note that you have to tell any calculator how heavy your bar is, what sizes of plate you have available, and how many of each there are.\n\nIn a gym the plates may be unlimited, but in a home gym there may be certain numbers you just can\u2019t achieve because you don\u2019t have the right combination of plates.", "description": "Pop quiz: you want to lift 85kg.
