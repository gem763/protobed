Graham, a close ally of the president, has criticized this move as shortsighted and a betrayal of the Kurds living in the region, who have played a crucial role in helping the U.S. in the fight against ISIS.\n\nGraham tweeted the agreement he made with Van Hollen to impose mandatory sanctions on Turkey \"unless the Administration certifies to Congress \u2013 every 90 days \u2013 that Turkey is not operating unilaterally (without U.S. support east of the Euphrates and west of the Iraqi border) in Syria and has withdrawn its armed forces, including Turkish supported rebels, from areas it occupied during the operation beginning on October 09, 2019.\"\n\n\"Most Members of Congress believe it would be wrong to abandon the Kurds who have been strong allies against ISIS,\" Graham wrote in a second tweet. It is not yet clear if this legislation could pass, or if it would have a veto-proof majority in Congress.\n\nThe sanctions would be imposed on the assets of top Turkish officials including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as sanctions on military transactions and Turkey's energy sector. Mr. Trump has threatened to \"destroy\" the Turkish economy if Turkey oversteps in Syria.\n\n\"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,\" Graham tweeted earlier Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump offered no verbal support Wednesday afternoon for Kurdish allies he is accused of abandoning. Instead, Mr. Trump said they have \"wanted to fight, and that's the way it is.\" He also said Turkey is now responsible for keeping ISIS fighters in prisons in the region, which Kurdish allies have been guarding.", "description": "Senators Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen want to sanction Turkey for unilaterally invading Syria", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/a869c98e-4810-4dc8-a547-5ab1c30ac6d6/thumbnail/1200x630/657feb70b5cc3bde0e8e819dabb537ce/gettyimages-1180060981.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
