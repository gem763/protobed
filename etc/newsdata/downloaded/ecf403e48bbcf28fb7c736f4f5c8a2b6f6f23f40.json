On Tuesday, the White House announced it would refuse to cooperate with committees probing allegations that the president withheld aid money in pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nA letter penned by White House counsel Pat Cipollone argued the administration doesn't have to comply with Democrats' requests for documents or in-person testimony from officials because the inquiry is \"constitutionally invalid.\"\n\nThe decision to defy all House Democrats\u2019 requests going forward came hours after the State Department blocked European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland from testifying. The administration has pushed back against individual congressional requests in the past, most notably by withholding documents from the Mueller investigation.\n\nWhy there's debate:\n\nRefusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry is a smart strategy, some argue, for a number of reasons. The most direct benefit is gumming up the works of the investigation, either by denying Democrats potential evidence or by forcing them into long court battles that will bring the process to a crawl. Even though legal experts broadly expect the courts to force the White House to comply with House subpoenas, Democrats might lose public support or risk having impeachment drown out the voices of their presidential candidates if the inquiry drags on too long.\n\nOthers see attacking the legitimacy of the inquiry as providing a unifying message for Republicans to get behind, rather than putting them in the uncomfortable position of defending Trump's behavior with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats, however, see some upside in Trump's act of defiance. The clearly stated refusal to cooperate serves as \"strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said. Obstructing Congress was one of the articles of impeachment filed against Richard Nixon. Democrats may choose to skip potential court fights over subpoenas and move quickly to an impeachment vote with this new argument to bolster their case.\n\nSome have made the case that Trump\u2019s challenging congressional oversight amounts to a \"constitutional crisis.\" This perceived attack on American political institutions could hurt the president's standing with Republican senators in a possible impeachment trial or turn off voters in 2020.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHouse Democrats have said they plan to subpoena Sondland. If the White House still refuses to comply, as expected, the matter will move to the courts. Some Democrats have expressed an interest in completing their inquiry before the end of the year. If the House does vote to impeach, the Senate would then hold a trial. If two-thirds of senators vote to convict, Trump would be forced out of office.\n\nPerspectives\n\nIt will be effective\n\nSlowing impeachment down through court cases plays into Trump's favor\n\n\"The House is overwhelmingly likely in the end to prevail in enforcing in federal court the various subpoenas it has issued. \u2026 But judicial proceedings, even expedited ones, move at best 'with all deliberate speed,' by which lawyers really mean 'at a stately pace.'\" \u2014 Lawrence Tribe, USA Today\n\nThe strategy puts Democrats at political risk\n\n\"Blocking witnesses and ending any cooperation with the probe threatens to bog Democrats down, which could bring them political peril. A number of rank-and-file Democrats have warned that a long-drawn-out impeachment investigation carries risks for the party in a high-stakes election cycle when they\u2019re trying to protect dozens of vulnerable incumbents. And Republicans clearly see an advantage to running out the clock.\" \u2014 Mike Lillis, The Hill\n\nQuestioning the legitimacy of the inquiry is a unified message for Republicans\n\n\"It could finally give the GOP a strategy to respond to a scandal that\u2019s kept most of its rank-and-file on the sidelines, spooked about getting involved in the president\u2019s sloppy defense.\" \u2014 Eric Lutz, Vanity Fair", "description": "The White House announced it won't cooperate with the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.
