A second official said that the Pentagon is working to convince Trump to keep a residual U.S. force in Syria.\n\nTrump tweeted on Sunday that it was, \"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border.\"\n\nMnuchin echoed the president on \"This Week,\" emphasizing that his goal is to get troops out of Syria and end \"long-standing wars.\"\n\n\"I think the analogy that everybody's saying is, we're abandoning the Kurds, like the Kurds are these longstanding allies,\" he said. \"Our role in Syria was not to defend land for the Kurds in historical issues. Our focus was to defeat ISIS.\"\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nOn Friday, Mnuchin announced that Trump had signed an executive order that would allow the Treasury Department to activate \"very significant\" sanctions against \"any person associated with the government of Turkey,\" if the country crosses certain lines in its operation against Kurdish forces in northern Syria.\n\n.@jonkarl on the U.S. imposing sanctions on Turkey: \"What are you waiting for? ...

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who told Axios on Thursday, \"I think he's putting the nation at risk. \u2026 If I hear the president say one more time, 'I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,' I'm going to throw up.\"\n\n\"Lindsey and the president are close. This is obviously an issue that they don't agree on,\" Mnuchin said Sunday, adding that the administration's \"number one issue\" is defeating ISIS.\n\nLate Sunday morning, Trump tweeted that he was working with Congress on sanctions.\n\nDealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey.
