John Shimkus reconsidering retirement", "language": "en", "text": "He likened the opportunity to a minor league baseball player being offered the opportunity to play in the majors.\n\n\u201cWho would not say \u2018no I don\u2019t want to go\u2019\u201d for it, Shimkus said.\n\nA total of 19 House Republicans have decided to call it quits this cycle, a sign of how difficult it will be for the GOP to win back the majority in what\u2019s already shaping up as a tough 2020 election.\n\nLast month, when Shimkus was still expected to retire, he drew national attention when he took his name off President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign\u2019s official list of supporters over disagreements on Syria policy. But on Tuesday, he made clear he strongly supports the president\u2019s domestic agenda despite occasional disagreements on international policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always struggled with the president\u2019s isolationist bent,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a policy difference \u2014 one or two \u2014 but judges, life, tax relief, regulatory burden. I mean, it\u2019s an easy choice against a socialist.\u201d\n\nShimkus is the most senior Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee after Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who is term-limited from seeking the top Republican spot on the powerful panel with jurisdiction over energy, climate change, healthcare, Internet and product safety issues.\n\nWalden\u2019s retirement has set off a scramble among Republicans on the committee: Reps. Michael Burgess (R-Texas), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), Bob Latta (R-Ohio) and Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) all expressed interest in the position on Monday following Walden\u2019s retirement. If Shimkus threw his hat into the ring, he would likely be an immediate front-runner, given his seniority status and ties to leadership.\n\nShimkus, who was first elected to Congress in 1997, represents a heavily Republican district in southeastern Illinois: Trump won 70 percent of the district in 2016. His rebuke of Trump over Syria could come back to haunt him in a primary bid.\n\nShimkus still has $1.1 million cash on hand that he could use toward his reelection bid, according to his most recent filings and the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nBut Shimkus pointed out that he would need to get a petition signed in order to get on the ballot by the December deadline, and acknowledged that could be a challenge.\n\n\u201cRight now, I have no petition, no circulators,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve closed my campaign office.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4e/4f/242096d74a7383c6efc170288a08/191029-shimkus-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
