But how true is that? How many will raise false hope and expectations, based on a catchy news headline? I know I did.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing to know about me, it\u2019s that I\u2019ve always been a writer. After many years of penning subpar poetry, I began my editorial career at the age of 18. For years, I hustled whilst in school, taking on side gigs and freelance opportunities wherever I found them. By the time I graduated, I\u2019d built up a portfolio that I was convinced could rival that of any veteran in the industry \u2014 and therefore command a higher starting salary.\n\n\u201cWith your experience, you\u2019ll easily get a good job that pays at least $4,000 a month. No question about it,\u201d my mother assured me. Coupled with that Straits Times report, I was optimistic about my prospects. Alas, when I finally got around to the job applications, I realised no magazine or copywriting agency was going to offer me anything more than $3,500 a month.\n\nIn fact, the basic pay for writers hovered at around $2,000 to $3,000 a month. How was I supposed to survive on such meagre sums, especially in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities?\n\nSpare yourself the rude awakening and manage your expectations of how much you\u2019ll earn as someone new to the workforce.\n\nHere\u2019s a comprehensive breakdown of the average starting salaries for permanent full-time, entry-level jobs, not including CPF deductions, categorised by university and industry, based on graduate employment surveys by Ministry of Education.\n\nBy University\n\nNUS Graduates (As of November 2018)\n\nDegree Average Basic Monthly Salary
