It will make such a difference to us and our families.'\n\nThe couple, whose children are 23, 19, and 14, said they had dreamed of having their 'own little place in Lanzarote', with Mr Brandish planning a trip to the Canaries to start the property search.\n\nMartin and Debbie Brandist from Nuneaton have won \u00a31million on the lottery just days after their first wedding anniversary. They are pictured on their wedding day\n\nThey are now planning to buy a holiday home in Lanzarote and want to spend New Year at Disneyland Paris\n\nHe said: 'We've always dreamed of having our own little place in Lanzarote where many bar and restaurant owners have become good friends over the years.\n\n'We enjoy the culture, the people, the sunshine. We love everything about it.\n\n'We're now in a position where we can actually do this, we can live our dream and go out there several times a year, perhaps even spend winters out there and our relatives can use the house too.\n\n'Debbie has been learning the language for a while and one day we always said we'd want to move to Lanzarote full time. We still play the lottery. Lightning may strike twice, you never know.'\n\nMr Brandist explained it was the couple's usual lottery numbers which helped bag the money, after they won a free lucky dip chance when matching two numbers on a previous weekend.\n\nHe said: 'The following day it was a lovely sunny morning and I'd gone to our local garage to get some barbecue coals, thinking we'd have our last barbecue of the year rather than a Sunday roast.\n\n'That's when I exchanged the free Lucky Dip for a go on the Wednesday draw - the night our lives were about to change forever.'\n\nMartin and Debbie Brandist from Nuneaton have won \u00a31million on the lottery just days after their first wedding anniversary\n\nMr Brandist, a former NHS materials management officer, is now taking a break from work and is planning on doing more volunteering before looking for a new role.\n\nHe is also planning on entering more angling competitions and, with that in mind, will have more space for his fishing tackle after treating himself to a Volkswagen T-Roc SUV, replacing his old Toyota Yaris.\n\nMrs Brandist said she has already bought some new clothes with the winnings but plans to keep in full-time work to stop her from getting 'bored'.\n\nShe said: 'I would be bored if I was at home full time. I want to see my daughter through school and sixth form too.\n\n'Martin didn't believe that he had won at first. He wanted to check on my phone as well.'", "description": "Martin Brandist, 54, and his wife Debbie, 48, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, are now planning on buying a holiday home in Lanzarote.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20321624-0-image-a-32_1572347944152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
