The change also includes exceptions for people seeking certain types of visas including visas for children of U.S. citizens.\n\nPeople affected by the change would be required to prove that they have met its requirements to a consular officer. The secretary of state will create procedures for making such determinations.\n\nThe White House said the change will take effect Nov. 3.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that refugees or immigrants who have been granted asylum won't be affected.\n\n\"While our healthcare system grapples with the challenges caused by uncompensated care, the United States Government is making the problem worse by admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs,\" the proclamation said.\n\nThe change is the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nIt has similarly attempted to tie immigration to welfare through its \"public charge\" rule which would make a person's ability to receive a green card dependent on whether or not they used certain public assistance programs. Democrats have sought to block the rule.", "description": "The White House on Friday issued a p", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldtwo_10042019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
