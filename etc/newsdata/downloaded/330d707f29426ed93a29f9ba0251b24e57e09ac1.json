Most governors are paid at least $100,000, but leaders of five states receive a five-figure salary. The annual earnings range from $70,000 (in Maine) to $201,680 (in California).\n\nWhile the pay pales in comparison to that of some high-powered CEOs and execs, a stint in the Governor's Mansion can be a great stepping stone in a politician's career. Of the 44 men who have been president of the United States, 17 had previously served as governor. The most recent to do so was George W. Bush, who was working out of the capitol building in Austin, Texas, when he was elected president.\n\nOf the current slate of governors, 27 are Republicans and 23 are Democrats. Prior to the midterm elections last year, 33 were Republicans, 16 were Democrats, and one was an Independent. In total, the Democrats flipped seven gubernatorial races.\n\nIn the past, several governors have refused, reduced, or otherwise donated their earnings. Among them are current governors Andrew Cuomo and Gina Raimondo, who gave themselves five percent pay cuts.\n\nRead on for each governor's salary, listed in alphabetical order by state, along with their party affiliation.\n\nMatthew Michaels contributed to an earlier version of this post.", "description": "The 50 governors in the United States earn different annual salaries ranging from $70,000 to $201,680.", "authors": ["Marissa Perino", "Dominic-Madori Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9a453dee0195ea66888a3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
