Exactly where and when it mattered most.\n\nClinical in front of goal yet again, the Colombian striker secured a fine Europa League point that was the least Rangers deserved for an often excellent performance.\n\nThe storied surroundings of the Estadio do Dragao seemed to inspire Steven Gerrard's side as they advanced their hopes of progression from Group G.\n\nAlfredo Morelos stepped up once again for Rangers as he secured a point away against Porto\n\nThe Rangers striker took a touch to steady himself before firing in clinically from close range\n\nSteven Gerrard will have been pleased with his side's intensity as they were rank outsiders\n\nPre-match, much intrigue had centred on whether Morelos could avoid being provoked by Pepe, that veteran master of football's dark arts. A yellow card away from a suspension, the obvious risk was of him being forced to sit out the return match at Ibrox in a fortnight's time.\n\nBut Morelos will be there for that one after emerging unscathed. And neither Pepe \u2013 booked for fouling the Ibrox forward \u2013 nor his colleagues will much relish that prospect.\n\nConfidently finishing a terrific move to cancel out a stunning strike from compatriot Luis Diaz just before the break, this display was another sign of Morelos' continuing development. Ten of his 16 goals this season have come in the Europa League. Breaching Porto's defence stands as the most high-level entry yet.\n\nMATCH FACTS FC Porto: Marchesin, Corona, Pepe, Marcano, Alex Telles, Otavio (Bruno Costa 60), Uribe, Danilo Pereira, Diaz (Nakajima 63), Marega, Ze Luis (Soares 76). Subs not used: Manafa, Mbemba, Diogo Costa, Silva. Goals: Diaz (36) Booked: Bruno Costa, Telles, Pepe Manager: Sergio Conceicao Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Helander, Barisic, Barker (Ojo 84), Davis, Jack (Arfield 83), Kamara, Morelos, Kent (Aribo 76). Subs not used: Defoe, Foderingham, Flanagan, Katic. Goals: Morelos (44) Booked: Barisic, Jack Manager: Steven Gerrard Referee: Nikola Dabanovic (Montenegro)\n\nIn truth, the 23-year-old was just one of a number of excellent performers against a club that reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League seven months ago.\n\nBorna Barisic, in particular, produced a string of sublime crosses. In midfield, Steven Davis allowed Gerrard's side to control more of the play than many would have expected.\n\nIt still required a brilliant late double save from Allan McGregor to preserve the draw but defeat would have been deeply cruel. Up to second place in the group, Gerrard will feel victory over this Portuguese powerhouse is possible on home turf next month. His demand for courage in possession was confidently answered.\n\nThe Ibrox manager's overall European record now stands as only three defeats in 25 outings.\n\nAfter the self-inflicted nature of their loss to Young Boys in Bern, he would have drawn great satisfaction from the intense concentration invested this time around.\n\nGerrard's team selection caused a degree of surprise. Brandon Barker had made only one previous start following his summer arrival from Manchester City, but was asked to operate alongside \u00a37million man Kent in support of Morelos. Pace was clearly a priority of the game-plan.\n\nAround 2,700 travelling supporters filled an upper section of one stand having done their best to deplete the city's reserves of Super Bock lager during the preceding 24 hours. They spied some early signs of optimism from that lofty vantage point.\n\nClearing a Porto corner allowed Kent to nip in and win possession inside his own half. The ex-Liverpool winger took off, driving deep into enemy territory before being halted by a last-man challenge from right back Jesus Corona.\n\nPorto had earlier taken the lead in sensational style when Luis Diaz scored from distance\n\nRyan Jack (pictured) has his head in his hands as Diaz runs off to celebrate with team-mates\n\nComposure drifted in and out of the Ibrox side's play during the opening period. Under-scrutiny captain James Tavernier receiving an admonishment from his manager after dallying on the ball to lose it in a dangerous zone. This was not an evening for another of his recent lapses.\n\nWhen Rangers did click, however, there was real fluency about their passing. The left flank looked a particularly profitable route. Some smart interchanging was allowing crossing opportunities for Barisic \u2013 something that would later prove vital.\n\nA switch from Morelos to the advancing Tavernier then created an opportunity to strike at goal from the edge of the area. It was wasted when the right back blazed wildly over the bar.\n\nThat miss acted as a signal for Porto to begin ramping up some pressure of their own. Barisic had earlier become the first player shown a yellow card for hauling down the overlapping Corona.\n\nJack then followed him into the book of Montenegrin referee Nikola Dabanovic after nudging over Moussa Marega as the Malian forward sought to drive at the heart of the Rangers defence. It led to a free-kick that Alex Telles whipped too high.\n\nZe Luis then came even closer. The Cape Verde striker peeled off the shoulder of Filip Helander to meet a pinpoint delivery from Telles with a header that struck the outside of McGregor's right-hand post with the goalkeeper stationary. There was a sense of something coming. And it arrived in jaw-dropping fashion nine minutes before the break.\n\nIt proved a combative affair with both sides keen to assert themselves in the group stages\n\nGlen Kamara stretches acrobatically to keep a ball in play as Rangers pushed on for a winner\n\nThe danger didn't seem immediate when Diaz intercepted a loose pass from Jack around 25 yards from goal. But the Colombian winger drifted inside onto his right foot before unleashing an incredible strike that bulleted into the goal precisely at the junction of post and bar. It couldn't have been better placed if Diaz was given use of a cherrypicker.\n\nA reaction from Rangers was needed. And what a reaction it was. They looked a team possessed in pursuit of an equaliser prior to the half-time whistle.\n\nMorelos thought he had claimed it in the 40th minute, but his header from Tavernier's corner came back off the bar. Even so, the desired outcome was only delayed by four minutes.\n\nThe construction of the goal was superb. Kent's clever flick wide put the ball in the path of the accelerating Barisic. He swept in a majestic first-time cross that had too much pace and accuracy for centre-back Ivan Marcano to cut out. It reached Morelos for a thumped finish high past Augustin Marchesin.\n\nThe Ibrox No 20 stood motionless at the edge of the pitch in celebration, drawing an angry reaction from the Porto fans he faced. At least one object was thrown onto the pitch, with Connor Goldson picking it up as delighted Rangers players congratulated their talismanic forward.\n\nGerrard's men re-emerged looking emboldened to enjoy some excellent possession. And they very nearly replicated their breakthrough to claim a 52nd minute lead.\n\nMorelos was the biggest threat to Porto and he was bemused after he fired a header just wide\n\nGerrard gave a thumbs up to the travelling supporters at the end following a successful night\n\nBarisic wrapped his left foot around another cross that was higher than his assist but every bit as lovely. Morelos steamed in to connect with a powerful header that was brilliantly beaten out by Marchesin. On the pitch and in the technical area, Rangers hands were placed to heads in astonishment.\n\nA further chance arose when Tavernier's smart cutback enabled Jack to fire just over the bar. Inevitably, though, the Ibrox defence had to ride out pressure in the final 10 minutes.\n\nNeither Pepe nor substitute Francisco Soares could connect properly with a Telles corner that zipped across the face of goal.\n\nSoares did make contact with four minutes remaining. But his drive and a follow-up attempt from Mateus Uribe were both repelled by outstanding McGregor blocks.", "description": "MARK WILSON AT THE ESTADIO DO DRAGAO: Rangers dug in for a valuable point away at Porto as Morelos was on hand to ensure Gerrard's side did not leave Portugal empty-handed.", "authors": ["Mark Wilson For The Scottish Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/19/20146178-0-image-a-46_1571942858276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
