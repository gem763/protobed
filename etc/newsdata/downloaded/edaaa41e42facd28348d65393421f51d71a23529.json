I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in him and want to know about his future and what\u2019s going on with the NFL,\u201d Rosenhaus said. \u201cHopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue his Hall of Fame career. That\u2019s really where our focus is.\u201d\n\nBrown was released by the New England Patriots after one game and just 11 days with the team. He was accused of sexual assault and rape in a civil lawsuit filed in Florida, and a separate sexual assault and allegation surfaced in a report in Sports Illustrated last week. Brown was released after that report.\n\nANTONIO BROWN BACK TO SCHOOL AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN AFTER PATRIOTS RELEASE\n\nMeanwhile, Brown announced he was taking classes at Central Michigan University and appeared at a deposition hearing over a furniture-throwing case. Rosenhaus said he encourages all his clients to finish their degrees or receive a post-graduate degree and that Brown taking the classes doesn\u2019t mean the wide receiver is finished with football completely.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s been a lot of speculation as to whether or not that means he\u2019s not going to proceed with the NFL but taking online college courses to get your degree or your post-graduate degree is something that I would recommend to every client. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a very difficult time for him not playing. We expected him to be playing against the Jets on Sunday. So it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough for someone who loves the game not to be playing right now and the hope is that we will cooperate with the NFL and their investigation and get him back with a team to continue this tremendous career that he\u2019s had.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRosenhaus didn\u2019t specify how many teams have shown interest in Brown since his release.
