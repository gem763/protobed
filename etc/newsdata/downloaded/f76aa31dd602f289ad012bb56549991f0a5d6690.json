Martha McSally | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congress Senate Republicans caught in impeachment glare\n\nMartha McSally and Cory Gardner both face tough reelection races in 2020 in battleground states. But the two Republican senators are taking completely different approaches to the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nMcSally (R-Ariz.) is predicting political doom for Democrats, deeming it a \u201ckamikaze mission\u201d that will help Republicans across the board. Gardner is keeping his opinion as close to the vest as possible.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cLiterally they are on a path to re-elect the president, keep the Senate majority [Republican] and possibly flip the House. It\u2019s a total distraction,\u201d McSally said in an interview of the House Democrats' path. \u201cFor the people I represent, this is not what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nGardner said Trump's conversations with the president of Ukraine about Joe Biden and his family as well as a whistleblower complaint about the president's conversations with a world leader are a \u201cserious issue.\u201d Asked if he still supported Trump\u2019s reelection, Gardner declined to address the question: \u201cLet\u2019s find out what\u2019s happening. Let\u2019s get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get in front of the facts that I simply don\u2019t have right now,\u201d he added.\n\nIf House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry turns into an attempt to remove the president from office, Gardner and McSally will be two of the most closely watched votes. And for now no one on the Senate Republican side is even endorsing an inquiry, much less suggesting they might vote to convict the president.\n\nSenate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina spoke to the 53-member caucus on Tuesday afternoon at lunch, senators said. He \u201csuggested we get the facts before people start jumping to conclusions,\u201d recalled Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n\nShortly after Republicans were in harmony, saying they need more information about the Trump call with the Ukrainian president and the whistleblower to say whether it\u2019s troubling that Trump reportedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Biden and his son, Hunter, in order to receive U.S. aid. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\u201cIt would be much more helpful if we can just get the full and honest story out there. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about what was really said. So, hard to say until we see what\u2019s real,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), an occasional Trump critic.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) of impeachment.\n\nThat will change soon. On Wednesday, Trump will release his transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president. On Thursday, the House and Senate Intelligence committees will both hear from intelligence officials about the whistleblower case.\n\nRepublican senators said there was no real concern exhibited in their party lunch on Tuesday about a possible impeachment trial in the chamber. But Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who is among the most popular members among Republicans, said he\u2019d sensed a shift among his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI have not heard a peep [from Republicans]. They\u2019re being unusually circumspect, changing the subject, just not willing to talk about it,\u201d Coons said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rapid shift toward impeachment in the House is just the opening gun in what\u2019s going to turn into a marathon march for Senate Republicans, who are the president\u2019s firewall in any attempt at removal. At least 20 Senate Republicans would have to join with all 47 Senate Democratic Caucus members to remove the president, which now seems an impossibly high number.\n\n\u201cThere will be a huge backlash. And this will be just seen as the next step after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat and the Russian investigation,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), another incumbent Republican. \u201cI\u2019m kind of scratching my head why all of a sudden the House\u2019s hair is on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see nothing so far. Impeachment is a political decision. And their base ... they hate the president and they\u2019re searching for a reason to impeach him,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), another incumbent. \u201cIt\u2019s a different question if there\u2019s anything to convict him.\u201d\n\nSenate leaders said Democrats face all the risk, minimizing the pivotal role that Senate Republicans may play in the coming months as potential jurors in Trump\u2019s Senate trial.\n\n\u201cThis path, which we discovered 20 years ago when I was in the House, it\u2019s not always smooth sailing. And sometimes the things you do to satisfy your base don\u2019t help you with the majority of the American people,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nFor Cornyn and Cassidy, the impeachment question is relatively easy: Their states are conservative and there\u2019s no path to victory by breaking with the president. McSally\u2019s state is trending Democratic but still leans red.\n\nYet impeachment is still being celebrated in all corners of the party, reflecting the complex decisions ahead for the GOP.\n\nAnd no one has a more difficult political calculus than Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has not endorsed Trump\u2019s reelection but supported Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year. And she\u2019s been trying to pass firearms legislation and prescription drug reforms in an already volatile environment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what evidence they\u2019re using at this point,\u201d Collins said of the House\u2019s impeachment push. \u201cI still hold hope out that we can legislate \u2026 but this could affect everything.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the one shared lament on Tuesday among Senate Republicans is that their attempts at legislating were increasingly likely to flail on guns, prescription drugs and potentially the new North American trade agreement. It was also slowly sinking in that their time in Congress during the first term of Donald Trump was going to be consumed by impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt probably will eat up a lot of energy in the room to talk about other things that I think the public is interested in our addressing,\u201d said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). \u201cIt all eats up time and energy.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI see nothing so far. Impeachment is a political decision,\u201d said Sen.
