This is a no-judgment zone, in which you will be urged to forget the current American president\u2019s name\u2014and instead enjoy escapist fan fiction about Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nYes, there is such a thing. Past presidential fanfic masterworks\u2014like \u201cKim Jong Elmo vs Dick Cheney and George Bush featuring Lapis Lazuli\u201d\u2014might have been relegated to online speakeasies, but so great is the nostalgie d\u2019Obama that new books about Barry and Joe are bringing fanfic\u2019s nerdy tropes into the light of day in print.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nParodist Andrew Shaffer has just added a new entry to his enjoyably ludicrous Obama-Biden series, which launched last year with Hope Never Dies and features the duo solving mysteries together. The second entry, published in July, is called, you guessed it, Hope Rides Again. Indie director Adam Reid\u2019s gonzo graphic confection, The Adventures of Barry & Joe, which styles Obama and Biden as time-traveling superheroes, was released this past spring. It is here to, if not to save the day, then at least demonstrate the life-changing magic of putting our heads under the covers and pretending it\u2019s 2015.\n\nI respect you if you refuse to look back and entertain fantasies that Obama and Biden might return to deliver the Republic from evil. Biden on the 2020 stump might wield Obama\u2019s name like a talisman to protect himself from criticism, but all sane voters know the Joe-Barack heyday is never coming back.\n\nStill, tucking into the fantasies of Reid, a filmmaker whose 2010 film Hello Lonesome was a festival darling, and Shaffer, a novelist who teaches writing in Kentucky, I decided to tolerate and maybe even open my heart to the authors\u2019 poignant nostalgia for libmerica. It\u2019s a powerful thing to mark the difference between today\u2019s gruesome nonfan-nonfic\u2014in which the Chosen One aims to delete China while annexing Israel and Greenland\u2014and escape back to the relative paradise known as 2008 to 2016.\n\nThe covers of \u2018Hope Never Dies\u2019 and \u2018Hope Rides Again,\u2019 by Andrew Shaffer. | Courtesy of Quirk Books\n\nNow, to Uncle Joe. Hope Never Dies (Quirk Books), the first of the Shaffer mysteries\u2014Hardy Boys-style with a YA version of the Dashiell Hammett narrative voice, but goofy\u2014was released before Biden had announced his presidential bid; the second, Hope Rides Again, came out not long afterward. Like many an Obaman, Shaffer\u2019s Biden opens the first novel frozen in time, just after the 2016 election, gorging on Ben & Jerry\u2019s. This bothers Jill, Joe\u2019s wife. In both Shaffer novels, Joe and Jill (and Barack and Michelle) are comparable to lovable, forgettable CBS sitcom duos of a decade ago: Everybody Loves Raymond, King of Queens. The dude is a charming galoot; the wife has his number.\n\nBut the real One True Pairing here\u2014let\u2019s not kid ourselves\u2014is gonna involve Barack, whose communiqu\u00e9s Joe initially awaits like a schoolgirl scorned. \u201cAfter Jill was sound asleep, I scrolled through old text messages Barack and I had exchanged a lifetime ago,\u201d Shaffer writes. \u201cIt was an exercise in futility. If I kept picking at the wound, it was never going to heal.\u201d\n\nBiden mirrors the sulky American people. Is Barack Obama ghosting us?\n\nProbably. But in Hope Never Dies, he\u2018s not ghosting Biden, and after Encyclopedia Joe stumbles on the mystery of the murdered Amtrak conductor in Hope Never Dies, the Dem Duo reunite to criss-cross Delaware in a farrago that leads them to find the mastermind of the opioid epidemic because why not. (It is not the Sacklers, FYI; fanfic is fic.)\n\nOn the cover of Hope Rides Again, the sequel, Obama wears tan as, in an Ethan Hunt moment, he dashingly mounts a rope ladder to a helicopter, giving a hand to trusty Joe. This choice, of course, expresses Shaffer\u2019s fondness for no-drama Obama by reminding us that right-wing pundits had nothing to make hay about in summer 2014 but the president\u2019s beige suit. In this novel, Joe is about to announce his presidential bid, when Barack loses track of his BlackBerry\u2014warning, the nostalgia goes deep; Obama even smokes again\u2014and the device\u2019s thief has been murdered. Off they go!\n\nJoe encounters thugs, a grenade, near-disaster on an airplane. And he and Barack do, it\u2019s true, end up, \u201chuddled together, arms twisted like a couple of pretzels\u201d\u2014but they\u2019re in a hole the size of a washing machine in the hull of a ship. By the time the police helicopter arrives for them, unfurling its rope ladder, they\u2019ve finished off the bad guys and are ready to fly away, like Obama leaving the White House on January 20, 2017. Sniff.\n\nThe cover (left) and other scenes from \u2018The Adventures of Barry & Joe: Obama and Biden\u2019s Bromantic Battle for the Soul of America,\u2019 by Adam Reid. | Adam Reid/William Morrow & Dey Street Books; cover art by Titmouse Inc.\n\nIf this is all high corn, there\u2019s some actual sweetness, too: Shaffer clearly admires and somehow truly gets Joe\u2019s geriatric efforts to be cool and, especially cringily, down with the 44th president, with fist bumps and (yikes) even pseudo-Ebonics. It\u2019s good someone finds that side of Joe charming.\n\nReid\u2019s Adventures of Barry & Joe (Dey Street Books), the product of a Kickstarter campaign, is considerably skeevier than the wholesome Shaffer books. To clarify: None of this is slash. That\u2019s a blessing. Shaffer and Reid do not, I repeat do not, reprise (entirely) the Kirk/Spock erotics from the earliest days of pre-internet fan fiction. In case you somehow dodged the \u201970s zines, in which fanfic was first codified, \u201cslash\u201d were the sexy fairy tales, mostly by women, in which the fellowship expressed on the USS Enterprise tilted into loving tendresse and then\u2014sweetly, slowly\u2014into \u2026 make-out jams.\n\nPresumably Reid wants a bigger audience for his graphic novel than he\u2019d get with straight slash. Adventures is ultimately something called \u201campersand\u201d fanfic, meaning friendship, not romance, defines the Barry & Joe relationship. (That\u2019s \u201cship\u201d in fanfic-speak\u2014you D.C. squares got a lot to learn.)\n\nBut, unaccountably, Reid still wants to see the former president and VP nekkid, so by panel No. 7 of the chapter called \u201cTrue Bromance,\u201d they\u2019re drawn in a locker room, preparing to participate in a time-travel experiment by stripping down to their briefs. By No. 9, we\u2019re to full-posterior nudity. Joe, so you know, has the dusty-rose busting-at-the-seams body of geezer strongman Jack LaLanne. Barry, while also shredded, is only somewhat slimmer. Glutes have been diligently attended to by the artists in that section, Joe St. Pierre (of Marvel), Anwar Hananu (Image Comics) and freelance illustrator Dezi Sienty. (The Adventures, which includes a grab bag of stories, aphorisms and short plays alongside the graphic components, is very much a group effort.)\n\nBefore Joe and Barack disappear into a time-travel vessel that looks like KitchenAid made it, Biden says, \u201cBarack, I want you to know \u2026 I wanna hug even though we\u2019re naked. Is that wrong?\u201d Barry: \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d Joe: \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d\n\nScenes from \u2018The Adventures of Barry & Joe,\u2019 written by Adam Reid and featuring multiple artists. | Illustrations by LaSpina and Court Jones\n\nMuch of Reid\u2019s scrapbook concerns madcap travel in the \u201cmultiverse,\u201d in what could be a tribute to the late Mad magazine. The taste level is Mad, also. In one of Reid\u2019s short stories, Joe returns to the 1970s, looks uncannily hot, and gets a chance to talk to his son, Beau, then 9. More than the nudity, this fictional resurrection of Biden\u2019s son\u2014the real Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015\u2014seems far too intrusive to be even campily enjoyable.\n\nI winced. Until that point, I\u2019d been reading with the simmering notion that liberal democracy, now globally stifled, might come back to life with a new leader in 2020. But Beau Biden will not come back to life. Suddenly the whole project of these wish-fulfillment Obama fantasias seemed like nothing more than fodder for Trump ralliers to, as the T-shirt says, oil their guns with liberal tears. And how in the world could I write about it? One false move\u2014one mention in fiction that Obama and Biden (in fiction) are (fictional) witnesses to an (imaginary) gangland shooting (in a work of fiction)\u2014and you might end up quoted with a straight face in some daft anti-Biden propaganda that ricochets all over the internet. While I could suspend solemnity for a few hours, in this current breath-holdingly paranoid climate, there\u2019s not enough oxygen for this much playfulness.\n\nIf the Library of Congress shelving system were remade for our time, these fanfic works might be classified as \u201cWAFF,\u201d because they\u2019re meant to generate\u2014you got it\u2014warm and fuzzy feelings. Those are the feelings most Americans still vaguely remember from four years ago. But we\u2019re forgetting. And before we introduce delusions about what might have been, we have an urgent challenge in the present\u2014Trumpism, which can be stopped only with something other than naked cartoons. Thus, the Biden-Obama counterfactuals, especially because they\u2019re meant to be fun, leave me with CAPs\u2014cold and pricklies. Now that\u2019s a phrase from the 1970s that should be brought back.", "description": "Yes, it\u2019s a thing.
