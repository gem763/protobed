The newspaper published the audio.", "language": "en", "text": "On Thursday, the Examiner released the full audio of the call, calling it \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cdisparaging.\u201d\n\nThe paper\u2019s unusual decision left other journalists debating the exchange, and Conway offering a staunch defense of her conduct. Conway emphasized the division between her personal life and professional life, suggesting that a man in her position would not have to answer for his wife\u2019s differing political views.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve previously noted that it is unusual \u2014 especially in Washington and especially in Republican politics \u2014 for a man to gain newfound fame and power through his wife,\u201d she said in a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday evening.\n\nThe story that drew Conway\u2019s displeasure published on the Examiner\u2019s site on Tuesday, reporting on rumors that Trump was considering her as White House chief of staff, which Trump has denied. The piece suggested she \u201chas been in the middle of Trump\u2019s barbs with her husband,\u201d referring to a long-simmering feud between Conway\u2019s boss, President Trump, and her husband, attorney George T. Conway III.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, according to the Examiner\u2019s account, Conway\u2019s assistant called reporter Caitlin Yilek and asked to speak off the record. After Yilek agreed to those terms, Conway grabbed the phone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the audio later posted by the paper, Conway questioned why the reporter had included the line about her husband. \u201cI just am wondering why on God\u2019s earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway\u2019s tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff,\u201d she asked.\n\nWhen the reporter argued that her husband\u2019s feud with the president was \u201crelevant context,\u201d the president\u2019s senior adviser took issue with the language used in the story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not caught in the middle of anything except trying to understand somebody whose title is breaking news reporter, what that means,\u201d Conway said during the phone call. Later, Conway asked: \u201cWhat exactly are you an expert on that would qualify you to say, to characterize the way I feel?\u201d\n\nNear the end of the call, Conway made a comment that the Examiner later characterized as a threat that \u201cthe White House would delve into the personal lives of reporters if they wrote about her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIf it has nothing to do with my job \u2014 which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious \u2014 then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it published the audio on Thursday, the Examiner wrote that it made the decision because Conway had attempted to \u201cmock\u201d and \u201cthreaten\u201d a reporter doing her job. The paper\u2019s editor argued that while Conway\u2019s assistant had requested an off-the-record conversation, Conway had made no such arrangement herself after picking up the line.\n\n\u201cOff the record conversations are agreed in good faith and in advance between people known to be participating,\u201d Examiner editor in chief Hugo Gurdon said in a statement. \u201cThey are not, and never have been, blanket coverage to shield people who pull a bait and switch, peremptorily enter the conversation, and then spend ten minutes abusing, bullying and threatening a reporter. Other organizations may agree to be played for saps, but the Washington Examiner won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nConway, though, disputed the Examiner\u2019s version of events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat I said on that call I\u2019ve said publicly on-the-record before, including on TV, in speeches, in driveway gaggles with reporters,\u201d Conway wrote in a lengthy statement. \u201cI did NOT indicate the call was off-the-record, but the reporter certainly thought it was.\u201d\n\nThe false tweet below makes my point about how dangerous it is to characterize someone else\u2019s intentions, feelings, or state of mind, even if it\u2019s for clicks and kicks. https://t.co/v6df2aoU3T pic.twitter.com/B3Qzzra0uW \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 24, 2019\n\nThe White House adviser also denied she intended her final words as a threat to dig into the reporter\u2019s private life. Conway said the newspaper \u201clied\u201d by framing the quote that way and pointed out that she had not used the word \u201cinvestigate.\u201d\n\nSome journalists saluted the Examiner for releasing the call, suggesting they heard a familiar tone of intimidation in Conway\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI applaud the @dcexaminer for releasing this horrific display by a public official,\u201d ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman said on Twitter. \u201c'Off the record\u2019 is a mutual agreement and it absolutely does not give you the right to act like @KellyannePolls did here.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof called the transcript a \u201cremarkable\u201d example of \u201cbullying.\u201d\n\nA remarkable transcript of a bullying phone call from @KellyannePolls at the White House to Caitlin Yilek, a Washington Examiner reporter. Conway harangued Yilek and threatened to go after her private life, but Yilek remained professional: https://t.co/m1krtsABFf \u2014 Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) October 24, 2019\n\nBut others noted that fielding phone calls from angry sources can be a commonplace part of journalism, with varying degrees of sympathy for Yilek.\n\n\u201cLook: Being yelled at sometimes is part of journalism,\u201d Vox\u2019s deputy policy editor Libby Nelson tweeted. \u201cBut the Conway transcript is such a masterclass in all the ways reporters who are (or are perceived to be) young women are insulted and undermined that it puts a knot in my stomach.\u201d\n\nJulia Ioffe, a correspondent for GQ Magazine who has criticized Trump in the past, questioned why the tense phone call became a news story.\n\n\u201cRaise your hand if you\u2019re a journalist and a source was mean to you on the phone and you knew that that didn\u2019t merit a separate story,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. She followed up with a second tweet: \u201cNow I know: next time a Trump administration official threatens me, send the transcript to @dcexaminer and they will definitely publish it.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "In a heated phone call between Kellyanne Conway and a Washington Examiner reporter, the senior White House adviser called the journalist \"a non-reporting reporter\" and chided: \"You don\u2019t have to rely upon the men in your life.\"", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZpZs_oB8OH21gdGRWhe3HvoKvUY=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-25-2019/t_42fa2dd1e5a449f8bae48dcc23afb3a6_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_25_at_11_14_10_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
