Photo: Michael Becker/FOX\n\nWhen Fox revealed the cast of bizarre characters serving as contestants on the new season of The Masked Singer last month, it was clear the show had a breakout star. Staring at us through big, cartoonish, yet lifeless eyes was Egg, and we instantly loved Egg because nothing about Egg made any sense. Egg\u2019s head was an egg, but Egg\u2019s head was also adorned with a hat made out of a fried egg, not to mention Egg\u2019s long white jacket designed to look like a cracked eggshell. Everything about Egg just SCREAMED \u201cI am Egg.\u201d Egg was beautiful.\n\nIn last night\u2019s Masked Singer season premiere, Egg didn\u2019t have the gorgeous colors and detail of Butterfly or the badass attitude of Rottweiler, but what Egg had that the other masked singers don\u2019t was simplicity, timelessness, and that iconic egg-shaped face that gets stuck in your brain forever. Thankfully, Egg revealed during a press event earlier this month that the undying love was, in fact, very mutual.\n\nUnfortunately \u2014 spoiler alert, I guess \u2014 Egg got knocked out of the competition after last night\u2019s episode, and we learned that the man behind the mask was legendary figure skater and Olympic commentator Johnny Weir. Fox pushed Egg relentlessly in the promotional lead-up to the season, and this is what we got in return? Our beautiful Egg, so quickly beaten (pun not intended) in the very first episode???\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about The Masked Singer: Pretty much everything about the show \u2014 most notably, the judges \u2014 actively works to destroy what\u2019s so fantastic about its core concept. Whether it\u2019s the awkward editing as contestants slowly tease their way out of their masks, or the painfully obvious stuff the judges yell out about clues, these distractions get in the way of what is a beautifully weird idea: minor celebrities briefly giving up their fame to get honest feedback on what is sometimes very mediocre singing, with the added bonus of doing it as some truly bonkers costumed characters.\n\nBut the distractions are worth dealing with, because the entertaining elements of The Masked Singer are completely unique, shouldn\u2019t exist, and are worth fighting for \u2014 as Egg himself reminded us right up until his elimination. \u201cI\u2019m proof that no matter who you are,\u201d Egg said during his clue video, \u201cif you put in the work and are unapologetically yourself, anything is possible.\u201d That\u2019s the perfect template for enjoying The Masked Singer despite its flaws, and it\u2019s even better coming from a giant egg wearing another egg as a hat. The world was too dark and terrible of a place for Egg to stick around on The Masked Singer forever, but for Egg\u2019s extremely brief time on this Earth, we loved him so, so much.\n\nWe\u2019ll miss you, Egg.", "description": "The best character on the new season of Fox\u2019s \u2018The Masked Singer,\u2019 the Egg, was eliminated during the season premiere.
