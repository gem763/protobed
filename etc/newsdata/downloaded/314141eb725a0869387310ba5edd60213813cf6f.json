With tongue-in-cheek, let\u2019s take a peek at some of the specimens worthy of a place in Zad\u2019s Toy Vault.\n\nWolverine vs. the Incredible Hulk\n\nHasbro celebrates eight decades of Marvel Comics\u2019 publishing sequential art with its Marvel Legends 80th Anniversary collection of hyper-articulated action figures.\n\nThe latest lineup of beloved characters includes Thor, Iron Man and Captain America as well as two packs featuring Colossus vs. Juggernaut and a pair of adversaries that first met in the Canadian forest way back in 1974.\n\nFigures profile: The Incredible Hulk writer Len Wein chronicled a super-powered agent of the Canadian government with razor-sharp claws and fierce temper (codenamed Weapon X aka Wolverine) tracking and ultimately battling the Wendigo as well as Bruce Banner\u2019s alter ego \u2014 the gamma-fueled, green goliath known as The Incredible Hulk.\n\nAccessories: Hasbro does a commendable job of bringing to three-dimensional life the 1970s illustrative designs of a pre-X-Men Wolverine by John Romita and Herb Trimpe as well as an old-school Hulk paying homage to artist Sal Buscema\u2019s vision.\n\nFirst, the famed feral mutant arrives slightly under 6 inches tall and wearing his original yellow costume that\u2019s even a precursor to Dave Cockrum\u2019s updated design in the Uncanny X-Men in 1975.\n\nHis garb details include V-shaped blue boots with black flared highlights, fisted blue gloves with silver claws fully extended, blue raised shoulder pads, blue trunks, a red belt with gold buckle and black tiger stripes around a yellow torso.\n\nThe yellow mask really pays homage to the 1974 design with slightly raised black ear fins and black whisker highlights that cover most of its face but leaves open a clenched jaw with teeth flashing.\n\nHe\u2019s a solid addition to a collection and almost as impressive as the classic Wolverine figure from the Toy Biz\u2019s 2006 Face Off series.\n\nWolverine also comes with an additional pair of fists without the claws extended.\n\nEven more impressive is the Hulk standing at 8.5 inches tall. The muscle-bound figure with veins popping from its arms wears ripped purple pants tattered around the knees and a removable ragged, soft plastic, light-grey shirt that drapes around his shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe skin tone is bright comic emerald green with slight green highlights in its black hair and a right hand ready to grab Wolverine and a left fist ready to punch.\n\nThe head sculpt features a facial expression of the Hulk in full rage mode with teeth clenched and brow furled.\n\nHe also comes with additional hands \u2014 a right fist and a left in a grabbing pose.\n\nBoth figures also offer more than two dozen points of articulation that should provide nearly limitless posing potential when highlighting the adversaries in battle.\n\nPrice: $59.99\n\nRead all about it: A glimpse of Wolverine was seen in the final panel of \u201cThe Incredible Hulk, No. 180,\u201d but his first full story appearance in comics was in \u201cThe Incredible Hulk, No. 181.\u201d\n\nAlas, Hasbro did not include a reproduction of the No. 181 comic in the packaging. By the way, the company had zero reason not to as there is plenty of precedent for including the pulp extra.\n\nSpecifically, in 2012, Hasbro packaged the fully reproduced book in \u201cMarvel Universe Greatest Battles Comic Pack: Wolverine vs. Hulk.\u201d In fact, almost 50 \u201cComic Packs\u201d were released between 2009 and 2016 with a comic book duplicate enclosed.\n\nConsidering that we are celebrating Marvel \u201ccomics\u201d with the figures release, come on guys, collectors deserve more.\n\nInstead, inquisitive figure owners will need to buy \u201cMarvel Masterworks: The Incredible Hulk Vol. 10\u201d ($75 to $145 depending on outlet, ouch) that collects issues Nos. 171 to 183 of the Hulk main series and features the writing of Mr. Wein, Roy Thomas and plenty of art from Mr. Trimpe.\n\nWhat\u2019s it worth: Despite the anniversary moniker, this is a pricey trip down memory lane, folks, and may be affordable to only the purist of Marvel Legends collectors.\n\nThat reported, the quality and articulation goes unmatched for these gems, but a display base and comic book would have made the set a bit more economically palatable.\n\nExpect more 80th Anniversary figures this fall including Punisher, Logan, Agent Anti-Venom and a two-pack with Deadpool and Hit-Monkey.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
