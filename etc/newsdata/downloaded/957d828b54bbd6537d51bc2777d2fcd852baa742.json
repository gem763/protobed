REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed in a June 30 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to reopen working-level talks stalled since their failed February summit in Hanoi, but this has yet to happen in spite of repeated appeals from Washington.\n\nIn a statement carried by North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency, Vice North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Pyongyang was willing to have \u201ccomprehensive discussions\u201d with the United States in late September at a time and place agreed between both sides.\n\nTrump was asked about the offer while speaking to reporters at the White House and as he often does, mentioned his \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Kim.\n\n\u201cI just saw it as I\u2019m coming out here, that they would like to meet. We\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI always say having meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any meetings to announce at this time.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped for a return to denuclearisation talks in the coming days or weeks, while reiterating the U.S. objective of North Korea\u2019s complete denuclearisation and saying Washington was disappointed by North Korean short-range missile tests.\n\nChoe stressed that Washington needed to present a new approach or the talks could fall apart again.\n\n\u201cI want to believe that the U.S. side would come out with an alternative based on a calculation method that serves both sides\u2019 interests and is acceptable to us,\u201d Choe said.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. side toys with an old scenario that has nothing to do with the new method at working-level talks which would be held after difficulties, a deal between the two sides may come to an end.\u201d\n\nIn April, Kim set a year-end deadline for the United States to show more flexibility in talks, which broke down in February over U.S. demands for North Korea to give up all of its nuclear weapons and Pyongyang\u2019s demands for relief from punishing U.S.-led international sanctions.\n\nThe end-of-September time frame would coincide with the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York, which Pompeo is due to attend. North Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations said last week that Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho would not attend \u201cdue to his schedule.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea has demanded that Pompeo be replaced with a \u201cmore mature\u201d person in the U.S. negotiating team, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump in three meetings since June 2018.\n\nThe U.S. special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, led working level talks with North Korea in the run-up to the failed Hanoi meeting.\n\nIn a speech at the University of Michigan on Friday, Biegun said Washington\u2019s aim was to transform relations with Pyongyang and establish a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, but stressed that this would require the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nEmbarking on an \u201cintensive set of negotiations\u201d is necessary, Biegun said, adding that \u201cthe diplomatic opening is fragile\u201d and expressing concern about North Korea\u2019s continuing weapons development.\n\nThere were \u201cimmediate actions\u201d the United States could take if negotiations made progress, Biegun said, but he did not elaborate.\n\nThe steps Washington has so far offered North Korea publicly have fallen far short of Pyongyang\u2019s expectations.\n\nBefore the Hanoi summit, U.S. officials raised the possibility that while sanctions would remain, Washington might be willing to take interim steps such as boosting humanitarian aid or opening liaison offices.", "description": "North Korea said on Monday it was willing to restart nuclear talks with the United States in late September, but warned that chances of a deal could end unless Washington takes a fresh approach.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428056967&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881BL", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
