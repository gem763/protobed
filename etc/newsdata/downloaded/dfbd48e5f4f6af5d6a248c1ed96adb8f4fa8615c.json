Highly unlikely, say experts.\n\n\u201cIt would require the 5.7 billion barrels of [Saudi Arabian] crude oil to be offline for months,\u201d Ashley Petersen, senior oil market analyst at Stratas Advisors, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d also need to see retaliatory attacks, you\u2019d really need an escalation. But we are going to see higher oil prices for the next couple of weeks,\u201d she said.\n\nThe last time oil crossed the $100-a-barrel mark was in 2008, after political unrest in Nigeria and bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico disrupted supply. The assassination of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto also led to high political tensions in the Middle East. Oil wound up peaking at $145 a barrel in July of 2008.\n\n$100 tips US into recession\n\nHugh Johnson, founder and chief investment officer at Hugh Johnson Advisors, said the economy simply couldn\u2019t handle $100-a-barrel oil.\n\n\u201cIt would cause a recession,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt would be a hard landing, not a soft landing.\u201d\n\nJohnson said when it comes to oil prices, we\u2019d do best to use history as our guide. \u201cLook back to 1990 when we saw the price of oil increase $18 to $35 as Iraq invaded Kuwait. That led to that recession in August of 1990 to March of 1991,\u201d he said.\n\n(AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File) More\n\nToday, the oil landscape is very different, according to Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors.\n\n\"The U.S. has been able to double production over the last several years so when we have a very significant event like this,\u201d Thummel said, \u201cwe don't have a global economic crisis because we have plenty of oil, we have plenty of supply.\"\n\nGas prices are safe\n\nWhile the long-term effect on oil prices will depend on how fast Saudi Arabia restores production, Thummel believes crude oil will be range-bound between $60 and $70 a barrel.\n\nThummel said that range means gas prices in the U.S. will stay below $3 a gallon nationally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important number to stay below that $3 threshold domestically, because that keeps driver demand pretty steady,\u201d he said.\n\nThe national average for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline is $2.56, according to AAA.\n\n\u201cBoth politically and economically for consumers gas at under $3 a gallon is an important benchmark,\u201d said Peterson.\n\n\u201cThis should be a pretty transitory impact for U.S. gasoline prices,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly domestically supplied at this point. We\u2019re making the shift to winter grade, which is a cheaper and easier to make version of gasoline, so I think the spike we\u2019ve seen over the last 24 hours is more a reaction to the overall market move, not actually reflecting any shortage in the U.S. \u201c\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.\n\nRead more:\n\nGM strike risk is high as UAW deadline approaches\n\nTrump's latest Fed tweet is 'irresponsible': economist\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losing the trade war': Strategist\n\nHow to trade AT&T\n\nRecession warning: RV sales hit the skids\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Oil prices spiked the most on record Monday after a weekend attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities wiped out more than 5% of the global oil supply.", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZElRB6i26a.yTpX_.wERdQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b5b10690-d8a2-11e9-bffb-8dc31a6d2340", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
