That\u2019s the weird claim in an extraordinary letter to the New York Times\u2019 managing editor from a Biden campaign official. Following the Times\u2019 publication of an op-ed column from conservative author Peter Schweitzer about Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield accused Dean Baquet of \u201cactive participation\u201d in a \u201csmear campaign\u201d that dates back to May of this year \u2026 in their fevered imaginations, anyway:\n\nThe Biden 2020 campaign has sent a withering letter to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, blasting the newspaper\u2019s coverage of their candidate and claiming that the paper has \u201chad an outsized hand in the spread\u201d of a \u201cbaseless conspiracy theory\u201d about the former vice president. According to Oliver Darcy in CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield fired off the angry message on Wednesday evening, in part prompted by a Times op-ed published earlier in the day that attacked Joe Biden. That column was written by Breitbart contributor Peter Schweizer a Republican opposition researcher who authored the right-wing attack tome Clinton Cash and who has been identified as a source of the baseless claim that Biden engaged in corruption in Ukraine. \u201cWhat was especially troubling about the Times\u2018 active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel, this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon,\u201d Bedingfield complained to the Times.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for a candidate and/or a campaign to complain about coverage and commentary. It\u2019s quite another to specifically accuse its managing editor of \u201cactive participation\u201d in a \u201csmear campaign,\u201d while at the same time griping about a \u201cbaseless conspiracy theory.\u201d Irony is apparently invisible at Team Biden, especially when given the parameters of this conspiracy theory, which pairs the New York Times with Breitbart News.\n\nEven the coverage of this has everyone seeing conspiracy theories where there just might be, y\u2019know, reporting:\n\n\"Active participation\" in a \"smear campaign.\" That's what the Biden campaign is accusing The New York Times of in a letter sent to exec editor Dean Baquet over the newspaper's coverage of the Bidens and Ukraine. https://t.co/oEXvMmsmuM pic.twitter.com/nUtIBugAWw \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) October 10, 2019\n\nAhem. The Uranium One issue was hardly a conspiracy theory, although it might have played into other conspiracy theories. The Clintons got cash both directly and into their foundation from players in that deal, which got approved by the Obama administration while Hillary served as Secretary of State. The $500,000 payday Bill got for a speech with a Russian bank linked to the deal was real enough, and certainly indicated the potential for corruption. There was more evidence of that potential in the Uranium One deal than there ever was in the Russia-collusion theory, for instance, and yet the media seemed highly disinterested in the former \u2014 and still apparently are.\n\nCalling the Bidens\u2019 influence-peddling track record a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is equally absurd. Hunter Biden\u2019s sudden employment by Burisma while Joe Biden was VP despite having no qualifications in either the energy industry or Ukraine is not a conspiracy theory \u2014 it\u2019s a fact. So too are Hunter\u2019s business ventures in China while his father conducted US diplomatic and security efforts there, along with John Kerry\u2019s son when Kerry was Secretary of State. Joe\u2019s brother James has a long track record of hinting that his businesses gave investors access to Joe. Those issues have been covered by more than just the NYT and Breitbart; Politico has done extensive work on the topic too, and the Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim just ran a helpful roundup of the allegations yesterday. \u201cDemocrats need to acknowledge that,\u201d Grim noted. Maybe some media outlets do, too.\n\nWas Joe aware of the attempts at influence peddling? That has never been established, but there have been enough attempts at it surrounding him that it\u2019s tough to imagine that he\u2019s unaware of the risk. Asking that question isn\u2019t a conspiracy theory, nor is it a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d We could start by finding out what purpose Hunter Biden served at Burisma other than political window dressing while taking in hundreds of thousands of dollars. What was the expertise Hunter had that earned that kind of money? If there\u2019s an answer to that other than \u201chis last name,\u201d then maybe we can dispense with this story.\n\nBack to the Times/Breitbart plot, however. Which publication would be more offended at the suggestion that they\u2019re working with the other? That\u2019s a tough call, but I\u2019d guess that the NYT would win that contest while Breitbart would be a lot more vocal about it.\n\nUpdate: Changed \u201cBiden\u201d to \u201cTeam Biden\u201d in the headline for better accuracy.", "description": "\"Baseless conspiracy theory,\" indeed.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-720-million-women.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
