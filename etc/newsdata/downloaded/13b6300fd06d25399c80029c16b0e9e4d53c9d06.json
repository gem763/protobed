For the latter, there\u2019s no better example than the use of weak passwords\u2014one of the most prevalent and intractable problems in cybersecurity. It is the weakest link in the defense against hackers.\n\nFor a long time, information-security practitioners thought that all they had to do was tell people the difference between strong and weak passwords. The assumption was that people didn\u2019t choose strong passwords simply because they didn\u2019t know what a strong password looked like. Knowledge, it turned out, wasn\u2019t the only problem. Even when people understood what a strong password was, they didn\u2019t necessarily use one. It just wasn\u2019t worth coming up with one, and remembering it was too hard.\n\nAnother approach has been to issue strong passwords to people, to take human choice out of the equation. Here\u2019s your password, thank you very much. But that didn\u2019t work, either: People couldn\u2019t remember these complex passwords, so they wrote them down, effectively sapping their strength.\n\nIn recent years, the emphasis has been more on finding the right \u201cnudge\u201d\u2014the small manipulation in the environment within which passwords are chosen. An effective nudge would prompt people to change their behavior and choose stronger passwords.\n\nThe problem, though, was coming up with the right nudge. Researchers have experimented, for instance, with displaying password-strength meters to show people, as they type, how strong their passwords are. This effort, once again, builds on the assumption that if people know what a strong password is, they will use one. But the results of these efforts have been mixed.\n\nFor three years, my colleagues and I searched for a visual nudge that would work for students who were in the process of choosing a password.\n\nFalling short\n\nAt first, we simply displayed a range of different pictures above the password entry field, including a password strength indicator. One of these nudges exploited the idea that people rise to expectations: It showed them that the passwords we issued to them initially were weak, and that we expected them to choose passwords that were stronger. They typically did rise to the occasion, at least at the beginning of the year. However, they generally didn\u2019t choose passwords that were as strong as we\u2019d like.\n\nApple\u2019s new sign-in feature in iOS 13 allows you to access supported apps using your Apple ID. The system promises added privacy benefits over Facebook and Google\u2019s sign-in options. WSJ\u2019s Joanna Stern explains how it all works using some quirky bouncers.

Yet another displayed a pair of eyes above the password entry field, hoping to make people aware of the risk of someone else getting hold of their password.\n\nAll good ideas, all ineffective. The problem, we realized, was that strong passwords are simply too costly. They take longer to type and are harder to memorize. This means that people have no incentive to choose a strong password because we are all, by nature, cognitive misers: People will always choose the path of least resistance. That\u2019s just how we are made. A simple visual-cue nudge doesn\u2019t have the power to overcome this tendency.\n\nA powerful incentive\n\nWhat was needed was an incentive. And in the third year of our research we found one: We told participants that the stronger the password they came up with, the longer they could keep using it. We did this by displaying a dachshund with a bubble coming from his mouth saying \u201cthe stronger your password, the longer you can keep it\u201d to make sure people got the message. As they typed, text displayed just below the password entry field told them how long it would be before the password expired. For example, the password \u201c123456\u201d would only be valid for two weeks, whereas a good password like \u201cI ate 8 marshmallows at the BBQ\u201d would expire after six months. As the password got stronger, the time to expiration became greater.\n\nIn effect, instead of merely trying to change people\u2019s behavior with a visual nudge, we actually offered them an incentive. After six months of offering this incentive, the overall password profile of the entire group was significantly stronger.\n\nNow, a caveat. We don\u2019t believe that this kind of nudge ought to be widely adopted for every possible account. It should only be used when something of real value is being protected, like a bank or email account. Strong passwords are costly in time and effort, so we should do our best to help people match the strength of their passwords to the value of the assets they protect.\n\nThat\u2019s because no nudge can address the root cause of weak passwords: human memory limitations. Until we can solve the problem of human memory (or until more people are willing to use external tools such as password managers), nudges can only help so much. If we try to use these nudges for all accounts, it\u2019s likely to backfire: People won\u2019t be willing to remember lots of complex passwords and they\u2019ll go back to using weak passwords for everything. If a nudge becomes a drudge, it loses its power to sway.\n\nDr. Renaud is a professor of cybersecurity at Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland.
