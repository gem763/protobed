One unit in Iraq was sent home early after a member was accused of sexual assault and the unit was accused of drinking alcohol there in violation of Navy rules.\n\nRear Adm.

Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher was acquitted of murder in the death of a wounded Islamic State captive and the shootings of Iraqi civilians.\n\nGallagher was convicted of posing with the captive's body and a military jury recommended he be demoted, which could affect his pay. That sentence must still be approved by a higher authority before it takes effect.\n\nNaval Special Warfare Command spokeswoman Commander Tamara Lawrence said the Navy doesn't discuss complaints that could be reviewed by the agency. She added that the inspector general will investigate \"appropriate and credible allegations.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, Green told the SEALs they were being relieved for three reasons: a platoon was sent home from deployment for drinking alcohol while in Iraq against Navy rules; an executive officer was being replaced and they had failed to integrate an intelligence team into their unit in Iraq.\n\nGreen has long turned a blind eye to drinking among the fighters, according to the complaint. It also said neither Mason nor Spangler was aware of alcohol being consumed at a Fourth of July barbecue that allegedly led to them being booted. Mason and Spangler say they also cracked down on members of the intelligence team who were refusing to wear their uniforms and shave.\n\nSullivan said the firings have shocked the SEAL community. Both men are highly decorated with Bronze Stars with Valor, among other medals.\n\nHe called Spangler \"legendary\" with more than 25 combat tours.\n\n\"The admiral stole their dignity,\" Sullivan said.", "description": "The two, from SEAL Team Seven, say Navy's top SEAL targeted them due to several high-profile SEAL misconduct cases; their lawyer says their dignity's being stolen", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/14/5b3bada8-81c7-4320-9836-f5bab834d365/thumbnail/1200x630g3/6d786176d9ade2313567d09e177037bd/collin-green-180907-n-kk081-131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
