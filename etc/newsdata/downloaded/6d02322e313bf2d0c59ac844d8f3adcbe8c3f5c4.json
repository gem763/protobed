Another storm, Gabrielle, formed in the Atlantic, and the National Hurricane Center is also tracking another disturbance in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a 50% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone.\n\nFernand arrived in northeastern Mexico just south of the U.S. border. As of 11 p.m., it was dumping heavy rain in the area with the threat of flash flooding and possible mudslides. The top sustained winds remained at 35 mph with higher gusts.\n\nThe storm is expected to dump rain Thursday in Tamaulipas and central and southern Nuevo Leon in Mexico and South Texas and the Texas coast.\n\nThe government of Mexico discontinued the tropical storm warning for areas that was previously in effect for areas from Puerta Altamira to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. There are no longer any coastal watches or warnings in effect.\n\nThere no warnings for southern Texas, but NOAA suggested residents should \"monitor\" the storm's progress. CBS affiliate KHOU-TV reports tornadoes are possible for some areas of South Texas through Wednesday evening. Texas rainfall totals are only expected to be up to three inches with some isolated areas seeing as much as six inches.\n\nTropical Storm Gabrielle is strengthening over the eastern Atlantic Ocean with sustained winds of 50 mph. Moving northwest at 9 mph, the forecasted path shows Gabrielle tracking well east of Bermuda and poses no threat to land. As of NOAA's latest advisory Wednesday night, there are no coastal watches or warnings for Gabrielle.", "description": "Two more tropical storms have been named by the National Hurricane Center, though none pose a major threat to the U.S.", "authors": ["Thom Craver", "Thom Is A Technical Analyst For Cbs Interactive."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/09f3d003-5253-4529-a738-febcee8694a3/thumbnail/1200x630/66ab0da2f2f79ea0a717b0011246192a/noaa-tropica-storms.png"}
