Yet he must simultaneously satisfy the hardline Brexit self-styled \u2018spartans\u2019. He will then need the approval of the European Union before seeking the endorsement of the British parliament. Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party has no majority in parliament; he also unlawfully suspended it last month.\n\nEuronews Correspondent Jack Parrock told Good Morning Europe that the UK Prime Minister was moving into what is, for him, new territory:\n\n\u201cThe understanding is what\u2019s being worked on is the idea of Northern Ireland remaining in a Customs Union with the United Kingdom, but it would enforce EU customs rules, preventing the need for customs checks on the border.\n\n\"Nobody is very clear yet on how that would work, but that\u2019s the understanding of what the talks are considering at the moment.\n\n\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with a change of tone about the UK in her press conference (on Sunday), talking about the UK as a competitor, suggesting the UK\u2019s position may be very different to what the EU had when it negotiated Theresa May\u2019s initial agreement.\"\n\nFrom London, Euronews Correspondent Vincent McAviney said there appeared to be some shift in Boris Johnson\u2019s position:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking at proposals which he quit the government over last year; the problem is he doesn\u2019t have a working majority and his backbenchers including the European Research Group are very difficult to bring along on this; three times they voted down Theresa May\u2019s plan. They will only go along with a plan if the Democratic Unionist Party do, because they want to protect the union.\n\n\"Jacob Rees Mogg has suggested he can bring these people along if it\u2019s a choice between this and no Brexit at all if there\u2019s a General Election and they don\u2019t do well.\"\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Speech \u2013 setting out the new legislative agenda of the government will also be delivered by today, but Maddy Thimon Jack, Senior Brexit Researcher at the Institute of Government think tank told Euronews that it\u2019s being delivered in an unprecedented situation:\n\n\u201cIt could end up in a very strange scenario where the government can\u2019t pass its Queen\u2019s Speech, can\u2019t get a majority in favour of what it wants to do with the parliamentary session, but they still can\u2019t get the numbers for a general election.\n\n\u201cAnd at that stage, that would be something that\u2019s never really happened before; it\u2019s unclear what will happen next.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty over Brexit has coincided with a spike in applications for UK Settled Status from EU citizens, with more than half a million received in September alone.\n\nEU citizens and their families actually have until 31 December 2020 to apply even if the UK crashes out of the EU without deal.\n\nThe highest number of applications are from Polish, Romanian and Italian citizens, with more than 345,000 Polish citizens applying.\n\nWith an estimated 1 million Polish people in the UK, this raises questions about the large number of Poles who have not yet applied.", "description": "The European Union has cautioned that 'a lot of work' remains if there is to be any Brexit deal by the October 31 deadline.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/02/96/1000x563_cmsv2_c81853a5-99a7-50c2-9441-2eb83ce385d8-4230296.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
