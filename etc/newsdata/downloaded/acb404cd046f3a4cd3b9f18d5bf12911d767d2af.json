The study was conducted by the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI) with support from professional services company Accenture.\n\nThe report, which takes a closer look at Canada\u2019s blockchain ecosystem by region and company size, stated that the industry desperately needs government commitment to move this highly innovative technology sector forward by providing legal clarity. BRI\u2019s chairman Don Tapscott said:\n\n\u201cWhile the research showed that the blockchain industry is diverse and growing in Canada, it also surfaced challenges regarding access to funding and business services, and uncertain regulatory environments.\u201d\n\nAlthough the report claims that Canada is well-positioned to become a global leader in the blockchain industry, the ecosystem is facing major challenges that include funding, lack of regulatory environment, insufficient public education and little to no cooperation of banking and auditing services.\n\nBlockchain salaries among the highest in Canada\n\nA big positive, according to the report, is that the average annual blockchain salary in Canada is more than $98,000, making blockchain careers among the highest-paying in the country. Managing director of the Chamber of Digital Commerce Canada Tanya Woods said:\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s existing innovation ecosystem offers best-in-class talent and pro-growth policies that can be leveraged to establish a leading global blockchain hub here at home. It is clear that Canada\u2019s blockchain ecosystem offers tremendous opportunity to those interested in a career in this field.\u201d\n\nBitcoin tax payments in Canada\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that Evan Kuhn, the co-founder of Toronto-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinberry, claimed Bitcoin (BTC) is more efficient for paying taxes than bank cards. Kuhn explained that his company takes much lower fees than the ones that card institutions impose on their clients, adding:\n\n\u201cA credit card company charges a 3% fee. [...] Our fee is .5%, so that\u2019s a lot more beneficial for the municipalities.\u201d", "description": "Report: Blockchain Among Highest-Paying Industries in Canada | News by Cointelegraph", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5ldS1jZW50cmFsLTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTktMTAvNjgwYzY5YjAtMGUwMi00Yjk3LWFiMzItODU0MzM3YTgzNmRmLmpwZw==.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
