'I would like to pick up 12 points from the remaining four games. Obviously it's a tough one in Russia but there's no free hits.\n\n'We owe it to the thousand or so Tartan Army fans that are coming over as well to put on a good performance and hopefully go away with three points.\n\nCentre back Charlie Mulgrew (right) looks certain to start for Scotland against Russia\n\n'Every match you go into you want to achieve the maximum, which is three points. I want a good performance level, I want a good performance level in the next four matches. My belief is always that if your performance level is good enough, the points will follow.'\n\nWith McLean's absence coming on top of Scott McTominay's suspension, Sheffield United midfielder John Fleck has a decent chance of making his international debut.\n\n'It's always disappointing when you lose players from the squad and overnight we have lost Kenny McLean as well,' Clarke said.\n\n'It's another blow but a great chance for someone else. It's part and parcel of international football.\n\nScotland boss Steve Clarke stressed there was no leeway for blooding new caps in Russia\n\n'It's always disappointing to lose a player so late in the week. When Kenny reported, he had a little niggle. It's not correct for me to say what it is, that's for his club to work out.\n\n'We were all pretty confident that Kenny would make it but the last 24 hours it didn't get any better, it actually got a little bit worse. So we made the decision to allow Kenny to go back to Norwich.'\n\nUncapped Dundee United striker Lawrence Shankland is the only out-and-out centre-forward in the squad with the likes of Steven Naismith, Oli McBurnie and Leigh Griffiths missing.\n\nAnd Hanley's groin injury made it six players who have lined up at centre-back for Scotland in the past 18 months who are unavailable through fitness issues - along with Scott McKenna, John Souttar, Kieran Tierney, David Bates and Liam Cooper.\n\nCharlie Mulgrew looks certain to start with Stuart Findlay, Michael Devlin and late call-up Declan Gallagher vying to make their debuts.\n\n'I have been impressed with Declan in all my time in Scotland,' Clarke said.\n\n'When he was at Livingston he did very well and showed a bit of versatility there to play right-back and right central defence. He has gone to Motherwell and had a fantastic start to his Motherwell career and deserves his call-up.'", "description": "Scotland boss Steve Clarke stressed there was no leeway for blooding new caps in Russia after losing yet another player to injury.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19513384-0-image-a-18_1570657683204.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
