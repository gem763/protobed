Nobody on 'Watchmen' can do that.\"\n\nIn \"The Boys,\" a group of government operatives keep corrupt superheroes in check, from the Superman-like Homelander to the Flash-esque A-Train.\n\nREAD MORE: How 'The Boys' comic book survived cancellation and inspired Amazon's new hit superhero TV series\n\nThe \"Watchmen\" graphic novel follows a group of costumed vigilantes who uncover a vast conspiracy after one of their own is murdered. In Lindelof's \"Watchmen\" show, which takes place nearly 30 years after the events of the novel, vigilantes are outlawed and police officers wear masks.\n\n\"I felt like we wouldn't be deconstructing the superhero myth because all the characters in Watchmen are just humans who play dress up,\" Lindelof continued. \"It would be more interesting to ask psychological questions about why do people dress up, why is hiding their identity a good idea, and there are interesting themes to explore here when your mask both hides you and shows you at the same time \u2014 because your mask is actually a reflection in yourself.\"\n\n\"Watchmen\" premieres on HBO on October 20.", "description": "In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Damon Lindelof said that \"Watchmen\" isn't a superhero deconstruction like Amazon's \"The Boys\" is.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8248bc2e22af71ad5fc864-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
