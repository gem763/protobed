Failure to pay can lead to prosecution and even jail.\n\nAn Ofsted report has found that the threat of fines and court encourages some parents to pull out of formal schooling altogether.\n\nParents are being given an ultimatum of \u2018permanent exclusion or leave\u2019 if their children skip classes and are found guilty of truancy. Ofsted wants schools and parents to discuss whether home education is the best answer for the child rather than their own (file image)\n\nOne parent told the watchdog: \u2018I have been forced into doing it because there was no other option. If I didn\u2019t I\u2019d end up with a fine or prison.\u2019\n\nThe report said: \u2018School leaders and a few parents acknowledged that parents can move to home education to avoid penalties. It is clear that prosecution for non-attendance and permanent exclusions are sometimes a trigger for moves to home education.\n\n\u2018The reasons behind this are complex and at worst may include gaming from schools or neglectful parenting.\u2019\n\nAmanda Spielman, the Chief Inspector of OFSTED, said: 'Children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school'\n\nThe watchdog said schools were sometimes to blame, by giving parents of truanting pupils an ultimatum of \u2018permanent exclusion or leave\u2019.\n\nIn some cases the fines were imposed unfairly when pupils were absent for reasons of anxiety or disability. All parents have the right to home-school but they are supposed to do so only if they believe they can provide a better education than teachers could.\n\nOfsted\u2019s latest report suggests this loophole is being exploited by parents who hope to escape punishment for failing to make their children go to school.\n\nOfsted\u2019s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said: \u2018Home education is a legitimate parental choice and can be a positive decision when parents are well equipped to provide a good education.\n\nAn Ofsted report has found that the threat of fines and court encourages some parents to pull out of formal schooling altogether (file image)\n\n\u2018However, children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school.\n\n\u2018Schools, local authorities and parents need to work together before such a decision is made, to make sure that home education is genuinely in the interests of children and not just the best thing for schools or parents.\u2019\n\nOfsted\u2019s study was conducted across seven local authorities in the East Midlands to look at how and why children move from secondary school to home education.\n\nIt concluded that often the decision was made as a last resort rather than a choice.\n\nMany parents told Ofsted they had no idea of the impact on their finances \u2013 or how their children would sit exams.", "description": "Families can be charged \u00a360 if a pupil skips school without permission and some are even given an ultimatum of 'permanent exclusion or leave'.
