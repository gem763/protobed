Ervick of StudioEIS works on the installation of full-size, lifelike figures of World War I soldiers in late August at the National Museum of the U.S. Army. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe make-believe battlefield is small. And there\u2019s a bullet-pocked French tank beside the pathway. So before the figure of the American machine-gunner reaches the shell hole, B.J. Ervick detaches his hands, just to be safe.\n\nFixed to metal shanks, and with screws in the knuckles, they come off easily. Ervick, the production director, lays them on cushioned packing paper. Then he and a colleague lift the squinting doughboy and carry him feet first to the Western Front.\n\nIt is the fall of 1918 in the new National Museum of the U.S. Army. And experts are re-creating a scene from the Meuse-Argonne offensive in France, which helped end World War I in defeat for Germany and victory for the U.S. and allied forces.\n\nThe handless American \u2014 Soldier No. 14 \u2014 is gently placed in the shell hole, near blasted tree trunks and an abandoned German howitzer.\n\nHe\u2019ll get his helmet, his machine gun and his hands back later.\n\nInside this gleaming new museum, scheduled to open next spring at Fort Belvoir, Va., time is growing short.\n\n[Army's history awaits its museum]\n\nTechnicians in hard hats crawl over battlefields littered with boxes, ladders and wiring. And the cast figures of soldiers such as No. 14 wait to go into action.\n\nThe $400 million steel-and-glass facility, about 20 miles south of Washington, will be the Army\u2019s flagship museum when it opens on June 4, on Liberty Drive off the Fairfax County Parkway.\n\nIt has already selected 1,300 \u201cmicro\u201d artifacts and 19 \u201cmacro\u201d artifacts \u2014 including a famous World War II Sherman tank from the Battle of the Bulge and a Bradley Fighting Vehicle from the wars in Iraq \u2014 for inclusion. The latter two are already in place.\n\nAmong the most moving artifacts is the wreckage of an engine from \u201cSuper 6-1,\u201d the first helicopter shot down in the 1993 \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d disaster in Somalia in which 18 Americans were killed.\n\nAnd among the most striking exhibits will be several \u201cimmersion\u201d tableaux, which seek to place the visitor with the soldiers, amid the sights and sounds of combat.\n\nOver several days last month, curators moved many of the specially cast soldier figures from the base at Fort Belvoir to the museum to be installed.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Paul Morando, chief of exhibits, says as the work takes place. \u201cWe are actually starting to look like a museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see the walls going up \u2026 and the construction of it, but then when you start seeing the artifacts go in and the cast figures, reality is setting in that it is going to be \u2026 a world-class museum,\u201d he says.\n\nA few days later, wearing a white hard hat and yellow safety vest, he paces like a Hollywood director as artists from StudioEIS, which created the cast figures, position the World War I soldiers on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cThey have bolts that come out of the bottom of their shoes,\u201d Morando says. Holes have to be drilled into the concrete that makes up the simulated ground, and, \u201cbased on our art direction,\u201d the figures have to be fixed in place.\n\nThe figures, which are not fully finished, were molded mostly with the help of actual U.S. soldiers.\n\n\u201cEverybody here has been life cast,\u201d says Ervick, of StudioEIS. \u201cWe take a mold off their body and their faces and their hands. And then we have to assemble it and build it.\u201d\n\n\n\nA life-size figure depicting a U.S. soldier of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment during the war in Afghanistan. The figure was cast from an actual soldier. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nMost of the life casting was done in the firm\u2019s studio in Brooklyn. The casts are composites of plastic, urethane, foam and other materials, Ervick says.\n\nThe figures were authentically clothed and outfitted by Artistry in Motion, a company that specializes in historical consultation for the arts, the museum said.\n\n(In a scene of fighting in Iraq, the creators placed a tin of smokeless tobacco in one soldier\u2019s back pocket and a dog tag in another\u2019s boot. Morando says real soldiers were asked, \u201cHey, what are we missing?\u201d)\n\nThe World War I tableau depicts a group of American soldiers, or doughboys, as they were called, in pursuit of fleeing but unseen German soldiers.\n\nThe Yanks, men from the 140th Infantry Regiment, are clad in olive drab uniforms, with packs, canteens and entrenching shovels. They wear leg wrappings and hobnail boots.\n\nThey are placed in a circular room where battle images will be projected on the walls. As the projection system is tested, it casts a weird grid pattern of light on the scene.\n\n\n\nJustin Kendall of StudioEIS works on the World War I tableau at the museum. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe figures first had to be unscrewed from their wooden cases, then carried to the battlefield tableau by Ervick and sculptors from the company.\n\nMorando then had to decide where he wanted them.\n\nThe team realized that one soldier, where he was first placed, would block a small part of the wall projection.\n\nMuseum specialist Sara E. Bowen asks: \u201cCan we dig anything\u201d to get the figure lower?\n\n\u201cHang tight, guys,\u201d Ervick says. \u201cEverybody hang tight.\u201d\n\nHe disappears for moment and returns with a hammer and chisel. He gouges a small indentation in the concrete surface. The figure is maneuvered there and is out of the field of projection.\n\n\u201cLooks good,\u201d Morando says. \u201cLooks real good.\u201d\n\nBut another figure who is running looks as if he should be moved closer to the shell hole. \u201cBecause his next step is going to be inside the hole,\u201d Morando says.\n\nHe studies the scene, and the soldier is moved.\n\nOccasionally the figures are laid down on blankets, looking as if they had been killed in the fight.\n\n\n\nJay Baker works around the installation pieces on the World War I tableau. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThey are adjusted and moved around the scene until Morando is fairly satisfied.\n\n\u201cDo you feel that we can mark [the places for] these figures?\u201d Ervick asks.\n\nMorando says places for three of the five could be marked.\n\n\u201cWe have to worry about where their lighting is, where electric is, how all the scenic is and \u2026 the story they\u2019re trying to tell,\u201d Ervick says during a break in the work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to tell this [story of a] no-man\u2019s-land battle World War I scene,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an immersion scene, which means that the whole gallery is going to be like you feel like you just walked into it. They\u2019re going to have video and sounds and lights and all kinds of rumbles and things like that.\u201d\n\nOnce Morando is happy with the figures\u2019 placement in the scene, \u201cwe bolt them down to the ground,\u201d Ervick says.\n\nWhile all the work is aimed at authenticity, the men depicted and the scene itself are make-believe.\n\nBut another element of the tableau, just across the visitor walkway, is truly authentic.\n\nThe Renault FT 17 tank, shrouded in an opaque protective cover, is one that actually fought in the bloody battle, the museum says.\n\nSmall by modern standards, the \u201cFive of Hearts\u201d still bears the scars from the Meuse-Argonne, which claimed 26,000 American lives and was the deadliest battle in U.S. history.\n\nManned by Americans, the tank has 1,300 bullet holes in its armor, the museum says, and one bullet that is still lodged in the tread from the titanic fight more than a century ago.\n\n\n\nWorkers with StudioEIS install the figures of U.S. soldiers.
