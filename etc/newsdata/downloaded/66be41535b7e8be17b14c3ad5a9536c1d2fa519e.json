(Photo: Rick Diamond, Getty Images for New York & Comp)\n\nEva Mendes had no idea what she signed up for when she decided to put her career on hold and become a stay-at-home mom.\n\nThe actress, who shares two daughters with actor Ryan Gosling, stopped by \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" and said that even though people told her how hard motherhood was going to be, no one could have ever prepared her for the reality of it.\n\n\"People are so sweet, they really try to warn you, prep you, when you\u2019re pregnant, but nobody can prep you,\" Mendes told Clarkson. \"Nobody told me it was gonna really be a job and a job that I needed an incredible amount of skill for.\"\n\nShe then listed off all the skill sets she needed to be a stay at home: \"a chauffeur, a cook, a personal assistant to an abusive boss.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether the abusive boss is 5-year-old Esmeralda or 3-year-old Amada.\n\nWhat makes juggling all these careers at once all the more difficult is that the kids aren't grateful.\n\n\"They\u2019re not grateful! Oh my God, do they get grateful?\" Mendes asked. \"Does that happen at some point?\"\n\nMendes went on to add that with any other profession, people would need to take an exam of sorts to make sure they're qualified, but not with motherhood.\n\n\"In any other profession, you\u2019d need to take a test or pass tests. The only test I had to pass was a pregnancy test,\" Mendes joked.\n\nBut the hardest part about being a mom isn't dealing with the abuse from your kids or cleaning up after them, it's actually the snacks. Mendes revealed that the hardest part was carrying around snacks all day.\n\n\"Especially on long car rides, those are the worst,\" Mendes said. \"But even going to the market, we're like going to the market, but I need to take food in the car to go to the market.\"\n\nLater in the interview, Mendes admitted that she and her husband are probably \"bulldozing parents.\"\n\nShe joked that they have to be helicopter parents because their kids are so young.\n\n\"Well what else are we supposed to do?\" she joked. \"We have to be on top of them every second ... so ya, i'm a helicopter parent.\"\n\nEva Mendes and Ryan Gosling share two daughters. (Photo: Sonia Recchia, Getty Images)\n\nAlthough Mendes has two kids now, there was a time where she didn't see herself ever being a mother until she met Gosling.\n\n\"Ryan Gosling happened,\" the actress said in an interview with Women's Health. \"I mean, falling in love with him. Then it made sense for me to have \u2026 not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/18/eva-mendes-jokes-ryan-gosling-bulldozing-parents/4023917002/", "description": "Eva Mendes put her career on hold to be a stay-at-home mom to her two daughters with Ryan Gosling, but she wasn't prepared for how hard it is.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published P.M.
