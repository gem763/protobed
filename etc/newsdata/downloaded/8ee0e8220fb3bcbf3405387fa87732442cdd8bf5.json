Rashida Tlaib told Detroit Chief of Police James Craig that he should only hire black analysts to use facial recognition software because non-African-Americans think all African-Americans look alike? Chief Craig, who is himself African-American, is letting his opinion be known \u2013 if he made such a statement, people would be calling for his resignation.\n\nAn invitation was extended for Tlaib to tour Detroit\u2019s Real Time Crime center, escorted by the police chief, after setting off a controversy in August about the police department\u2019s use of facial recognition software. At the time, she fell in line with Bernie Sanders\u2019 criminal justice plan that calls for a ban on the use of the software by police. Sanders pointed to \u201cimplicit biases that lead to unjust or excessive sentences\u201d and in August, his spokesperson described the software technology as \u201cOrwellian\u201d.\n\n\u201cPolice use of facial recognition software is the latest example of Orwellian technology that violates our privacy and civil liberties under the guise of public safety and it must stop,\u201d Sarah Ford, a Bernie Sanders campaign spokesperson, told CNN Business on Monday.\n\n@RashidaTlaib Before you criticize the software, come to our Real Time Crime Center to see how we @detroitpolice responsibly use it in efforts to identify criminals involved in violent crimes. Let\u2019s set a date. https://t.co/aR7DOjQe2a \u2014 Detroit Police Dept. (@detroitpolice) August 20, 2019\n\nTlaib took the tour Monday. The police chief spent an hour of his day escorting her though the center and showing her what goes on there.\n\nThe tour, which lasted more than an hour, was often tense, with Tlaib and Craig wrangling over how the department uses the software, privacy issues, and concerns that the technology misidentifies a disproportionate number of darker-skinned people. A major point of contention: whether only black civilians should work in the crime center analyzing photos flagged by the software. \u201cAnalysts need to be African Americans, not people that are not,\u201d Tlaib told Craig. \u201cI think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same.\n\nTlaib went on to justify her demand to the chief by using an example \u2013 she claims she has witnessed people confuse Rep. John Lewis and Rep. Elijah Cummings, both bald African-Americans.\n\nNot only is Tlaib\u2019s objection, as justified, racist in tone but it\u2019s just silly. Confusing people with similiar physical attributes \u2013 like the two congressmen who are older, bald black men of similiar body type \u2013 as a reason to use racial discrimination in hiring practices is wrong-headed.\n\nPolice Chief Craig isn\u2019t taking her human resources recommendation in stride. He said if he said such a thing, people would be calling for his resignation. (Imagine if a white conservative man made the statement that Tlaib made.) He\u2019s right. Tlaib has a history of controversial remarks, though, and so far she has been sheltered. Speaker Pelosi is unwilling to stand up to Tlaib and The Squad. They are emboldened to act as if they are in charge. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American, not African-American, was telling the African-American police chief that white folks can\u2019t tell black folks apart. The arrogance in her ignorance is breath-taking.\n\nThe chief spoke up on behalf of his department: \u201cI trust people who are trained, regardless of race, regardless of gender.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned by a reporter, she expanded on her answer. It\u2019s not just white people who get is all so very wrong, it\u2019s Latinos, too.\n\nAfter the tour, when a reporter asked whether she meant white people weren\u2019t qualified to work in the crime center, Tlaib said: \u201cNo, I think there has actually been studies out that it\u2019s hard for \u2014 African Americans would identify African Americans, or Latinos, same thing.\u201d Tlaib then was asked whether that means non-whites should be barred from working as crime analysts in mostly white communities. She replied: \u201cLook it up.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman claims that \u201cthe error rate among African-Americans, especially women,\u201d was 60 percent.\n\n\u201cI understand the technology real well,\u201d Craig said. He showed Tlaib how his analysts examine the software\u2019s results before making determinations. \u201cSee if you can get some of our money back until they fix it,\u201d Tlaib said, to which Craig simply replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nNot only was there tension between Chief Craig and Tlaib during the tour, before the tour actually got underway, she questioned why she was being filmed by a reporter.\n\nThe tour, which was recorded and then posted by a reporter with The Detroit News, got off to a rocky start when Tlaib asked the reporter, \u201cAre you facial recognizing me right now? I\u2019m sorry who are you and why are you videotaping me?\u201d\n\nThe point that Chief Craig tried to make to the congresswoman is that analysts use more than the facial recognition software in their work. They are trained professionals and the software is a tool in their toolbox. It\u2019s an aid.\n\nBernie Sanders makes the argument that facial recognition software isn\u2019t perfect and shouldn\u2019t be used at all. The City of San Francisco is the first to ban the use of it in local government.\n\nIn May, San Francisco banned police and local government departments from using facial recognition technology \u2014 becoming the first city in the United States to do so. Somerville, Massachusetts, and Oakland, California, have also banned the use of such technology.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who introduced the city\u2019s bill, told CNN Business earlier this year that the technology is \u201cso fundamentally invasive\u201d that it shouldn\u2019t be used.\n\nTlaib posted a thread on Twitter explaining her racist comments weren\u2019t really racist \u2013 the software is racist and she has \u201cscholarly research\u201d to back up her claim.\n\nTlaib shared the science behind her statement, and explained how/why she came to the conclusion \u2014 telling @wxyzdetroit that the real bias comes from the facial recognition program, itself. Catch her thread/info, here: https://t.co/QUzMtv09As \u2014 Matthew Smith (@MattSmithWXYZ) October 3, 2019\n\nA response to that thread mentions that Tlaib\u2019s remarks could be a violation of the Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act passed by the Michigan legislature in 1976. It addresses discrimination in hiring practices.\n\nThe police chief isn\u2019t taking the criticism of his department lightly. He has been on cable television several times already that I have noticed. This is a can of worms that was opened in the name of identity politics. Politicians like Tlaib are so wrapped up in political ideologue that common sense goes out the window. She is quick to call out others for racism yet she sounds as though she is fine with a version of segregation in the workplace.
