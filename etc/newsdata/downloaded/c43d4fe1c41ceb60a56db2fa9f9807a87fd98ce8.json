So far, superficial messages have been sent to the world but real progress, one doesn\u2019t see it,\u201d said former President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, who won the award in 2016 for orchestrating a historic peace agreement with the country\u2019s violent revel group, known as FARC, following decades of conflict. \u201cWe need to see more complete progress.\u201d\n\nHowever, he acknowledged the importance of Trump taking \u201cbold moves\u201d and seeking to establish personal relationships even with adversaries such as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important. Leaders are human beings and if they have good chemistry, and some kind of empathy, that makes negotiations much easier,\u201d Santos quipped.\n\nBut, David Trimble, who served as the first First Minister of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2002, and who won the peace prize in 1998 for his work to draw a peaceful solution to end the conflict in Northern Ireland, didn\u2019t rule it out.\n\n\u201cTrump is going to do what he wants to do and what he thinks is best. And the Norwegian Nobel Committee acts on the basis of the nominations it receives. Some who deserve it never win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to remember that (in the case of North Korea) it is not just a member of saying nice things but applying pressure. And it is better if it\u2019s done in a way that does as little damage as possible.\u201d\n\nABE MUM ON REPORTS HE NOMINATED TRUMP FOR NOBEL PEACE PRIZE\n\nThis year, 301 candidates received nominations by the Jan. 31 deadline -- 223 are individuals and 78 are organizations.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Trump was nominated not only by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe but also by at least two other Norwegian lawmakers for his \u201cpositive developments on the Korean Peninsula\u201d and easing of tensions with Kim.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee \u2013 which has selected the recipients of the peace prize each year \u2013 did not respond to a request for further comment. But, as a rule, the committee has not unveiled the names of the nominees until 50 years have elapsed.\n\nThe process of selecting the winner has entailed creating a shortlist subject to assessment by the Nobel Committee\u2019s roster of \u201cpermanent advisors,\u201d in addition to international experts from Norway and beyond. The final decision has been made in the last meeting, usually held at the beginning of October. This year, the laureate is to be announced on Oct. 11 with the acceptance ceremony slated for December.\n\nOther recipients offered clear ideas on how not to win the prize.\n\nShirin Ebadi, a former Iranian judge, human rights activist and 2003 winner, who has since lived in exile in London, cautioned that inking \u201cpeace deals\u201d with the current Tehran regime would be no way to win the prestigious prize.\n\n\u201cMy recommendation to Trump is to talk about democracy and human rights and not only focus on nuclear issues. If there is democracy in Iran and the people can come to power, then those issues will be resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cCan democracy exist under the current regime? Not at all. Is it good to sign a peace agreement with dictators?\u201d\n\nIn her view, Iran has sought \u2013 since the revolution of 1979 \u2013 to \u201cbe the leaders in the Islamic world\u201d hence why the regime has meddled in the affairs of other countries beyond the Middle East. She stressed that any hypothetical deal would be equivalent to handing over money to the rogue nation to spend on its military and weapons arsenal, rather than on schools, hospitals, and the suffering population.\n\n\u201cThe government always chants 'death to America' even in parliament, and they even set the American flag on fire. But all those people have their families and children in America. But students who want to go to study there are not allowed,\u201d Ebadi continued. \u201cUnder Obama, hundreds of green cards were issued to people in the government of Iran. I still want to know why Obama sent all that cash to Iran in exchange for four hostages. Of course, I am happy the hostages were freed, they were innocent. But this is like being blackmailed by dictators.\u201d\n\nThen-President Barack Obama was the last American to receive the coveted prize. It happened in 2009 for his \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between people.\u201d\n\nDespite many critics saying Obama had yet to do anything worthy of such an accolade, officials said he still would be a welcome presence at the annual peace summit.\n\nBut, he has yet to attend the conference of talking heads and forums related to reconciliation and accord.\n\n\u201cHe is of course invited, our rule is that we invite each and every laureate,\u201d said Ekaterina Zagladina, the president of the Permanent Secretariat of the World Summit of Nobel Peace laureates. \u201cOur hope is that he will link to this channel to convey his message of peace to the world.\u201d\n\nNORTH KOREA'S FORCED ABORTIONS: THE HERMIT KINGDOM'S UNDERREPORTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter won the prestigious honor in 2002. Before him, then-Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt won the prize in 1919 and 1906, respectively.\n\nTrump\u2019s chances might be slim.\n\n\u201cTrump diagnoses the situation in the correct way. Everything he says is the reality including the wall and trade relations with China,\u201d said Lech Walesa, who won in 1983 as a pro-democracy activist and went on to become the first democratically-elected president of Poland in the post-Soviet era from 1990-95. \u201cHowever, the treatment he applies is not correct.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cMust stop thinking of states and continents. Globalization is at the door.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel Peace Summit was started some 20 years ago as a means to bring together the world\u2019s \u201cmost inspiring advocates of social, political, community, international and personal peace.\u201d This year the summit, held in the Mexican city of M\u00e9rida, brought together some 30 recipients with the intention of debating and discussing ongoing global problems and challenges and devising practical solutions.\n\nAnd, of course, it was topped off by a Ricky Martin \u201cYucat\u00e1n for Peace\u201d concert.\n\nAccording to former South African President F.W. de Klerk, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 alongside Nelson Mandela for their efforts to bring an end to apartheid, such summits would bring about \u201cgood ideas\u201d but \u201cfollow-throughs are very difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power of conferences is about changing hearts and minds,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is important to measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsidering the fact that people here in Washington, D.C., were calculating the odds just two years ago around the likelihood of a U.S.-North Korea nuclear war, I would say there has been tremendous progress made,\u201d noted Harry Kazianis, the director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest. \u201cWhat Trump has done is effectively halt Kim Jong Un at the very end of a multi-decade process of gaining a nuclear device that can hit the U.S. homeland through North Korea's self-imposed testing ban. While some would argue that is not an achievement, we must remember it was that threat. North Korea being able to hit America with nuclear warheads--that was driving tensions through the roof. For that, and that alone, Trump deserves tremendous praise.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWith the announcement less than three weeks away, it\u2019s now a waiting game.\n\n\u201cIf Barack Obama can get a Nobel Prize for doing nothing, then I say give President Trump two for actually getting results on the North Korea issue,\u201d Kazianis added. \u201cThere is no reason why Trump should not be nominated considering he was able to avert a nuclear war with North Korea \u2013 something that back in 2017 was a very real possibility.\u201d", "description": "The Nobel Prize Committee is just weeks away from announcing its 2019 recipient, months after it surfaced that President Trump was nominated by multiple people for the esteemed prize.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
