The sore point is fellow franchisor Retail Food Group's up to $190 million recapitalisation, which was struck at 5.6-times to 6.1-times forecast EBITDA.\n\nA $300 million deal at Retail Zoo would imply about 8-times EBITDA.", "description": "Fifteen-times pro forma profit is the magic number for Boost Juice owner and IPO contender Retail Zoo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/80ca3a730fdd379823e8e8c54b560d9fc5ef1288", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
