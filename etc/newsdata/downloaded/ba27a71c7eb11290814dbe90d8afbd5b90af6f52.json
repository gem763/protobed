The MMR vaccination remains the only safe and effective way to prevent the measles.\u201d\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious viruses on earth; 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed to the virus become infected. You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to two hours after that person is gone. You can catch measles from an infected person even before they have a measles rash.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://midhudsonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/measles_graphic_600x300-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
