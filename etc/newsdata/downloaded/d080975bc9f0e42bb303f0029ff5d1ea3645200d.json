On one side you had Michael Hooper and David Pocock, the originators of the double-openside back row and widely regarded as the finest in their trade for the last four years. On the other, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, just 43 years between them, and trailing the Wallaby duo by a gargantuan 153 international caps.\n\nFor Curry and Underhill, it had been billed as the ultimate test against the players who helped inspire them to play the game, and to see how the English pair not only went blow for blow with the Australian greats but played them off the park just goes to show how special this current back-row unit actually is.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The way those three are going, Curry-Underhill-Vunipola will become as recognisable as Hill-Back-Dallaglio. It is merely a case of how long it takes to cement that legacy.\n\nIn England\u2019s last outing two weeks ago, it was Underhill who claimed the man of the match award just ahead of Curry, and this time around in England\u2019s 40-16 defeat of Australia, it was Curry who took the honours. You sensed once again that Underhill was not far behind. But it could only go to Curry \u2013 it had to go to Curry. The young Sale Sharks flanker was phenomenal in defence, a particular highlight coming when he lined up Reece Hodge, smashed him halfway back to Sydney and set the platform for Underhill to swoop in and seal the turnover. It could easily have been mistaken for \u2018Pooper\u2019 at their very best, only this time they were wearing white instead of gold.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

With England under the cosh on their own line and Australia determined to take maximum points by turning down kicks at goal, they needed their defensive workhorses to come to the fore. First Isi Naisarani picked and went from the base, only to be scythed down short of the line by Curry. So Australia sent their powerhouse centre Samu Kerevi in to smash his way over the line, only to meet an immovable object: Curry again. His work-rate defied rugby logic.\n\nTogether, Curry and Underhill made a remarkable 38 tackles to completely nullify Australia\u2019s talented attack, and boy didn\u2019t they know the impact they were having. When Curry\u2019s thumping tackle on Hodge was replayed inside the stadium, Underhill watched, smiled and butted heads with his partner-in-crime, the pair fuelling each other on to greater and greater things.\n\n\u201cI probably can\u2019t speak on behalf of everyone else, but for the physicality and when you get moments like that, it is special,\u201d added Curry. \u201cEspecially watching Sam off the kick-offs, those big tackles he was putting in. It is special to watch and encourages everyone. They are big statements\n\n\u201cI would be a bit weird if I say making a tackle is more exciting than running with the ball. I don\u2019t think you start rugby to make tackles but they are both pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nBut as exciting as it was to watch, there was of course a sadness too. As the clock ticked down and the realism of England\u2019s imminent victory became clearer, time was running out on Pocock\u2019s career. The Wallaby great established himself as one of the leading sevens in the game when he burst onto the scene 11 years ago, redefined the art of back-row play when he moved to No 8 to join forces with Hooper in 2015, and wrapped it all up on the blindside opposite a man who may replace him in the worldwide ranks in the years to come.\n\nThe crafty 31-year-old did still teach Curry a lesson early on, beating the Englishman to the breakdown, going off his feet and coming in at the side to seal a turnover and manage to make it all look perfectly legal in doing so that you could only applaud him for it. Curry will learn all the dark arts of the game in the years to come \u2013 his mentor is Richard Hill after all \u2013 but that moment unquestionably belonged to Pocock.\n\nThere is a warm irony that Pocock was forced to move to six in order to allow Australia to get their two best forwards onto the pitch at the same time, given England might just be doing exactly the same, and if this is to be the changing of the guard, Curry has already shown he will have no problems living up to the high billing that Pocock has set before him.", "description": "A word that has been repeatedly used at this Rugby World Cup\u00a0by numerous coaches is cyclical: World Cups are cyclical, the laws of the game are cyclical, coaches are cyclical.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/19/18/Curry-Underhill-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
