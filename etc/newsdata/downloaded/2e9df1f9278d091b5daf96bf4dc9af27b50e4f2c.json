But you don\u2019t understand the Springbok mindset,\u201d said the former centre who won the World Cup the last, and only, time England triumphed, in 2003.\n\n\u201cThe Springbok mindset is you hit things, you get up, you hit things, you carry, you hit things again, you are relentless and you keep going.\n\n\u201cYou never truly beat the Springboks - you might have more points than them, but they\u2019ll be standing at the end ready to go again if you said we\u2019ll have another final in half an hour.\u201d\n\nGreenwood said the South African physical threat would be significant, and something England must counter in an entirely different challenge to the one presented by the free-flowing All Blacks in their semi-final.\n\n\u201cThey are powerful, powerful men. So they will look at the video and go, \u2018England destroyed New Zealand\u2019s lineout\u2019. When New Zealand won a penalty they went to the corner but they lost the lineout so they couldn\u2019t get a foothold in the game.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa have won World Cups on lineouts before, specifically \u201807,\u201d he told Reuters at an event staged by World Cup partner Land Rover.\n\n\u2018ENDS JUSTIFY MEANS\u2019\n\nThe Springboks are yet to lose a lineout this tournament \u2014 the only team with a flawless record.\n\n\u201cYou look at their lineout options whichever of the second-rows they pick ... they start with the guys... (Eben) Etzebeth and (Lodewyk) De Jager, but then after 55 minutes they bring on (Franco) Mostert and RG Snyman and in the back row they\u2019ve got Pieter-Steph du Toit who\u2019s a second row hybrid playing in the back row and can win anything at the lineout.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019ll believe that they won\u2019t let England take that facet of their game away from them, therefore the game will be much more balanced in terms of territory and then they\u2019ll say to England, \u2018loved what you did last week, do that from back there\u2019.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to have to do it from back there because if you boot it back to us, we\u2019re not going to play, we\u2019re going to boot it back to you and we\u2019re going to wait and wait and if you make an error we\u2019re going to come after you.\n\n\u201cEnds justify the means. People can say what they like about South Africa\u2019s game against Wales. South Africa is in the final. So you only write yourself into folklore by doing it at 6pm on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere will be not one iota of self doubt in the Springboks. Whatever anyone\u2019s talking about you just don\u2019t understand their mentality if you think they will be worried about England.\u201d", "description": "England's scintillating performance in blowing apart the seemingly invincible All Blacks last weekend has installed them, in many people's minds, as firm favourites for Saturday's Rugby World Cup final against South Africa.", "authors": ["Ossian Shine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446460625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0IM-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
