The event seemed aimed squarely at fans, with little new information and a lot of SpaceX history.\n\n\u201cThis is going to sound totally nuts, but I think we want to try to reach orbit in less than six months,\u201d Musk said. \u201cProvided the rate of design improvement and manufacturing improvement continues to be exponential, I think that is accurate to within a few months.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound totally nuts\n\nDuring the presentation at SpaceX\u2019s testing facility near Boca Chica, Texas, just north of the US-Mexico border, Musk also said that he expected the Starship prototype towering behind him to do controlled \u2018hops\u2019 in a few months up to an altitude of 65,000 feet. Once that milestone is reached, Musk indicated the next flight goal would be achieving orbit.\n\nA rendering of Starship displayed at the presentation indicated that the ship will have a length of 50 meters (about 164 feet) and a diameter of nine meters (about 30 feet), and should eventually be able to lift a payload of 150 tons. The Starship will be launched into space by a massive rocket called the Super Heavy. The Super Heavy will also be nine meters in diameter, with a length of 68 meters (223 feet.)\n\nStarship will be the most powerful rocket in history, capable of carrying humans to the Moon, Mars, and beyond pic.twitter.com/LloN8AQdei \u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) September 29, 2019\n\nThe Super Heavy will be able to contain up to 37 Raptor engines, according to Musk. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll go that high.\u201d Musk said the number of engines could vary depending on the mission, and indicated that the minimum number of engines for the booster could be about 24.\n\nFor the most part, Musk wasn\u2019t announcing anything new. He discussed Starship design decisions that had already been announced, including his decision from earlier this year to switch the material used to construct Starship from carbon fiber to steel. He also showed clips of past SpaceX achievements, including the first Falcon Heavy launch in 2018, and the successful \u2018hop\u2019 of it\u2019s prototype Starhopper test vehicle in August.\n\nOne potential reason for the nostalgic emphasis was standing next to the gleaming stainless steel prototype of the Starship \u2014 a much smaller SpaceX spacecraft, the Falcon 1. Eleven years ago, the Falcon 1 became the first private liquid-fueled rocket to make it to orbit on September 28, 2008.\n\n\u201cIf that launch had not succeeded that would have been the end of SpaceX\u201d Musk said. Instead, the company has now had 78 successful launches, and is still aiming to do many more.\n\nSeveral times during the night, and on Twitter earlier this week, Musk said that his ultimate focus was to allow humans to eventually inhabit other worlds. But while he pushes his company to pursue that ambition, one of SpaceX\u2019s biggest customers appears eager for his focus to be on human spaceflight projects closer to home.\n\nSpaceX is building a different spacecraft, the Crew Dragon, for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. That project has been delayed repeatedly, including a setback earlier this year after an explosion on a test vehicle caused by a leaky valve. The timeline of the project is now once again in flux, even as NASA pushes ahead on an ambitious plan to land humans on the Moon again by 2024.\n\nOn Friday, tension between the two projects surfaced when NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted a statement related to SpaceX\u2019s Saturday event. While Bridenstine mentioned that he looked forward to the presentation, he also mentioned that NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew program is years behind schedule. \u201cNASA expects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Musk responded, saying that less than five percent of the company was working on Starship. \u201cTo be clear, the vast majority of our resources are [focused] on Falcon and Dragon, especially Crew Dragon.\u201d Musk said.\n\nUpdate 9/28 11:55PM ET: Updated to include information about Bridenstine\u2019s tweet, and Musk\u2019s response.", "description": "\"This is going to sound totally nuts\"", "authors": ["Mary Beth Griggs", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MmfS5snYHnRIwrDunMvxDx7ZyA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19242767/pacalin_190927_3690_0004.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
