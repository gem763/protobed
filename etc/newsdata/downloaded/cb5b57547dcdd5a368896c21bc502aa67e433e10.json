Other e-commerce firms including Lazada mainly operate via a marketplace model in Singapore.\n\nSingapore, a small but high-value market with a population of just 5.7 million, is often seen as a launchpad for consumer-focused companies into much bigger Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, home to over 260 million people.\n\n(Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by Christopher Cushing)", "description": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has launched a bigger local store and marketplace in Singapore, expanding its product selection and  intensifying competition with rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Lazada and Sea Ltd's Shopee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
