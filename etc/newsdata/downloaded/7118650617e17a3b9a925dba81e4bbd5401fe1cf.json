On the basis of last season\u2019s encounters between the sides, Celtic should not be especially concerned. They won three of the four league meetings \u2013 the other was a goalless draw at Parkhead \u2013 and beat the Dons in the Betfred Scottish League Cup final as well as in the semi-final of the William Hill Scottish Cup.\n\nWith Aberdeen short of key players through a combination of injury and suspension, Hoops fans will likely anticipate more of the same, but the TV schedule could act as something of a leveller, since it dictates that Celtic are in the lunchtime kick-off in the Granite City less than 72 hours after their high-intensity Europa League victory over Lazio on Thursday night. Aberdeen supporters will point out, correctly, that the resources which allow Celtic to compete regularly in the group stages of European competitions are sufficiently substantial to give the Scottish champions a significant edge in any domestic encounter, even when their rest period between fixtures is truncated.\n\nLennon, though, flagged an element of hope for the Dons when he said of Celtic\u2019s away games in the aftermath of the Europa League card: \u201cThey are more hazardous after big nights with a quick turnaround.\n\n\u201cWe finished playing against Lazio at 10pm on Thursday night, we had a day to recover and then we travelled up to Aberdeen for a midday kick-off. It\u2019s a big ask.\n\n\u201cRotation? I don\u2019t believe in making too many changes because that can be detrimental, but maybe needs must, because a few of them had fatigue towards the end of the Lazio game, so recovery is really important.\u201d\n\nCeltic are without the suspended Ryan Christie, who scored one of their goals and whose precise corner-kick delivery supplied the other for Christopher Jullien in the 2-1 win over Lazio, but the midfielder was also banned when they hammered Ross County 6-0 last weekend. That result put Celtic back on top of the table and their Europa League win sees them lead Group E, a single victory away from probable qualification to the knockout stages.\n\nAll of which was not foreseen by the online trolls and harpies who declared Lennon a dud when Celtic lost a Champions League qualifier to CRF Cluj in August \u2013 a classic example of how football fortunes can be transformed.\n\n\u201cAnd can change back again,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to it because I don\u2019t believe it anyway and I don\u2019t believe all the nice stuff that\u2019s said about me either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost treated like politicians these days, football managers. Hero to zero, zero to hero, in a matter of days or hours.\u201d\n\nDerek McInnes can say as much, too. The Aberdeen manager, now in his sixth season, positioned the Dons as Celtic\u2019s only consistent challengers through the period of Rangers\u2019 absence from Scotland\u2019s top flight, but was also the target for internet bile during a slow start to the current campaign and especially after a 5-0 filleting at Ibrox last month.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best in the country and has been for a long time,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cHe\u2019s done great things at Aberdeen. When he came in, they were finishing eighth and ninth and he\u2019s turned them into one of the top clubs in the country. He\u2019s had a lot of injuries and that bites any squad \u2013 I had it myself at Hibs last season when we were struggling and weren\u2019t getting results.\n\n\u201cBut now he\u2019s starting to get players back and he\u2019s got Sam Cosgrove flying. They had a fantastic win at high-flying Motherwell last week and that was a real statement of intent from Aberdeen, so we\u2019re probably getting them at the wrong time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Premiership card, Hibernian\u2019s habit of letting leads slip away cost them another two points. Goals by Daryl Horgan and Scott Allan put them in a comfortable position but Ross County hit back to draw 2-2 at Easter Road thanks to Brian Graham and a last-minute strike by Joe Chalmers.\n\nHearts could only manage a 0-0 draw at Livingston, despite the fact the home side played most of the second half with 10 men.\n\nLivingston\u2019s Aymen Souda was sent off for a high tackle on Hearts captain Christophe Berra in the 49th minute. Craig Levein\u2019s side had sustained pressure but could not make it count.\n\nSt Johnstone recorded their first league win of the season, David Wotherspoon scoring twice as they beat Hamilton 3-2. Kilmarnock beat St Mirren 1-0 with a goal from Gary Dicker.", "description": "To travel hopefully is no guarantee of a satisfactory stay at journey\u2019s end, as the Old Firm sides have discovered to their cost in recent weeks.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214044631-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqyg3ji3oTBD8qJbsSikkQLCC8Ujwz17HvKrr3MtyJRuE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
