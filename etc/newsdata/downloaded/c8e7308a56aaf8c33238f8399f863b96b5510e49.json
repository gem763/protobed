I think that is probably the right analogy \u2014 we\u2019re getting better, they\u2019re getting better, I think right now we\u2019re doing quite well. But this is certainly an area that we all need to be focused on.\u201d\n\nFacebook came under fire from critics who charged it with negligence during the last presidential-election cycle, when it allowed Russian actors, among others, to spread misinformation and attempt to sow discord on the site. The company ramped up efforts to combat election meddling during the 2018 midterm elections, but some bad actors have continued to slip through the cracks.\n\nIn August, Facebook said it had removed several accounts apparently run by the Chinese government as part of an effort to confuse and disrupt pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s an ongoing challenge,\u201d Facebook said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to continually improving to stay ahead.\u201d\n\nThe company pledged to continue to advance its technology, hire more employees, and work with law-enforcement and security experts ahead of the upcoming elections.", "description": "Facebook announced Monday that it has removed four networks of accounts that originated in Russia and Iran and were attempting to interfere in the 2020 elections.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
