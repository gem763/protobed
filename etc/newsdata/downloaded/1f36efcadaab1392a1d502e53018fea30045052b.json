AAPL, +0.98% rallied 1.1% toward a record high Wednesday, to stretch the technology giant's lead as the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, after Morgan Stanley's Huberty boosted her price target by 17%, enough to make her the most bullish analyst on Wall Street. Huberty raised her price target to $289, which is 19% above current levels, from $247. Her target is now the highest among the 42 analysts surveyed by FactSet, putting her just above Raymond James' Chris Caso's previous Street high of $280. Apple's market cap has increased to $1.096 trillion, while second-place Microsoft Corp.'s stock slipped 0.1% to lower its market cap to $1.048 trillion. Huberty said she disagrees with the rest of the Street in thinking Apple is earnings a new, more capital intensive market with a low probability of generating a positive return for shareholders. She believes Apple's soon-to-launch Apple TV+ streaming video service will boost the company's services revenue growth by two percentage points and add 1 percentage point to earnings per share. The stock has soared 53.7% year to date, while Microsoft shares have climbed 34.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% has gained 15.2%.", "description": "Shares of Apple Inc. rallied 1.1% toward a record high Wednesday, to stretch the technology giant's lead as the largest U.S. company by market...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
