In Europe, Germany's main index, the Dax, closed 2.8% lower, while France's Cac 40 lost more than 3%.\n\nIn the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended trading down 1.9%, marking the second day in a row it has dropped more than 1%.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.8% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gave up 1.6%.\n\nThe losses came after one of the most closely-watched US manufacturing figures, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index of factory activity, dropped to its lowest level since June 2009.\n\nFresh figures on Wednesday showing a slowdown in jobs growth in the private sector in September accelerated concerns over the US economy.\n\n\"With sentiment so fragile, the one-two punch from the WTO and [US jobs data] was enough to cremate European stock markets,\" said Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst.", "description": "Stock markets in Asia joined a global sell-off on renewed worries about trade and the world economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/459A/production/_109081871_asiastocksredgreenman.jpg"}
