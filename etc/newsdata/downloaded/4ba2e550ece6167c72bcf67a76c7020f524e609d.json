They call themselves the \u201cforest guardians,\u201d and some recently took Ueslei Marcelino, a photographer with Reuters, along on patrol. Marcelino was with a group of six men who went into the forest at midnight, searching for illegal logging operations. One night, the forest guardians found and destroyed a logging camp, and on another night, they lay in wait for a caravan on a narrow road, capturing a scout and scaring off a group of loggers, then burning their trucks.", "description": "Groups of Guajajara tribesmen in Brazil\u2019s Maranh\u00e3o state patrol their tribal land, seeking to protect it from illegal logging in places with little police presence.", "authors": ["Alan Taylor"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/09/forest/a01_RTX73RZX-1/facebook.jpg?1569263284"}
