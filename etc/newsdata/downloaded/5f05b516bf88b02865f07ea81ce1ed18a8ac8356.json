We asked CNN Business readers what they want from their boss and they said it's all about trust, respect and support.\n\nHelp, my boss hates me\n\nSo here's the thing: You need to get along with your boss.\n\nYour manager has the power to promote or fire you, speak up for you or assign you high-profile projects.

There are steps you can take to mend the relationship.\n\nStep one: Stop complaining.

But don't worry: You don't have to be sitting at the top of the org chart to be a leader in the office.\n\nEven if you don't currently have a management role, you can still highlight your leadership capabilities without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nAttention bosses: Your mood plays a big role in the office\n\nGerms aren't the only thing that can spread quickly in the office. Emotions are contagious -- particularly those from the top.\n\nYour bad mood not only affects your work performance, but it can also influence your team.\n\nNegative emotions can be detrimental to the office: they can hurt productivity, morale and quality of work and can increase absenteeism.", "description": "Happy National Boss's Day!
