The spokesperson said that the Air Force's spending limit was $166, and said the crew used the Marriott on the return leg of the trip.\n\nPolitico also reported on Sunday that a unit of the Maine Air National Guard stayed at the resort in September 2018, according to a person familiar with the trip, an Instagram post, and a voucher that showed the crew's arrangements.\n\nThe Air Force did not answer Politico's questions about that trip.\n\nA Trump Organization representative told The New York Times that military personnel have stayed at Turnberry a few times a year, and that the government was given a cheaper rate of around $100 per night.\n\nDonald Trump speaking at Turnberry in 2016.
