Protesters use masks to shield their identities.\n\nHowever, hundreds of people, including school children and office workers, have since defied the ban and wore face masks. A group of protesters plan a \"face mask party\" on Saturday night.\n\nHong Kong's police, once praised as \"Asia's finest\", are also facing a crisis of confidence amid the worsening political tensions. Protesters accuse them of using excessive force, a charge police deny, and two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.
