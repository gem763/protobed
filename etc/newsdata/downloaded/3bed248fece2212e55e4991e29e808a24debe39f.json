A second update at the end of the month will fix other unspecified technical issues.\n\nA lot of the other fixes are similar vague though, with changes to the in-game economy (i.e. microtransactions) apparently designed to make \u2018players more comfortable\u2019, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear what they\u2019re going to do about complaints at the undercooked survival elements and tiered loot progression.\n\n\u2018In line with this vision and the feedback we received, we are working on a more radical and immersive version of Ghost Recon Breakpoint. We also want to let you tailor your experience to the way you want to enjoy the game, since freedom of choice has always been part of the Ghost Recon DNA\u2019, is the non-committal statement on the blog.\n\nIt\u2019s also uncertain when the AI team-mate feature will be ready, but it sounds like it\u2019s a long way off at the moment.\n\nThere is a clear plan for the first raid though, called Project Titan, which will be ready for this December, with a Terminator themed live event to follow afterwards.\n\n\u2018We know that we have a lot of work ahead of us to get the game where you want it to be, and that not everything will be addressed or released as fast as all of you might like\u2019, concludes the blog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Big changes can take time to make sure they are done right, but we still want to be as transparent as we can about the current state of development.\u2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: I\u2019m glad Ghost Recon Breakpoint was a flop, Ubisoft deserved it \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\nMORE: Ghost Recon Breakpoint review \u2013 surviving games a service\n\nMORE: Year one plans for Ghost Recon Breakpoint include a volcanic raid", "description": "Major changes are planned for Ghost Recon Breakpoint, as Ubisoft promises fans it\u2019ll crush the bugs and revamp the gameplay.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-ultimate-key-art-01-ps4-us-03may19-4bc7_1572346262.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
