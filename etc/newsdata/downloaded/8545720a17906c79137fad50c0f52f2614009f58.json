Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s proposed regulations will provide clarity and certainty to investors regarding CFIUS\u2019s enhanced authorities to address national security risks that arise from certain foreign investments,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed regulations explain some of the mechanics of a 2018 law passed by lawmakers concerned that the acquisition of U.S. companies by Chinese interests could pose risks to national security. Under the rule, failing to disclose investments, in some cases, could trigger fines.\n\nThe law, passed in August 2018, strengthens the investment scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a Treasury-led panel of government agencies that review foreign investments for national security.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration and Congress worked together in a bipartisan manner,\u201d a senior Treasury official said, \u201crecognizing that some vulnerabilities could be exploited through transactions that fell outside of CFIUS\u2019s traditional control and jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nTreasury officials said they still haven't determined whether investments from certain countries will get tougher scrutiny than others. They also didn\u2019t explain the fee cost for future requests for national-security reviews from foreign investors.\n\nTuesday\u2019s proposed rules explained what kind of sensitive data collected by U.S. businesses could trigger a national-security review if a foreign investor becomes involved, narrowing the panel\u2019s review authority to companies with data on more than one million people or on populations that include U.S. military members.\n\nRelated Video A secretive panel called CFIUS is paving the way for President Trump to block more foreign business deals due to national security concerns. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains why you'll hear more about CFIUS during the Trump era.

Restricting that flow could scare off foreign money that has been a lifeline to such companies as Silicon Valley startups and biotech enterprises.\n\nIndustry officials concerned about the implementation said potential regulatory overreach could overwhelm Treasury staff with new filings. Trump administration officials have said that the law will lead to more than 1,000 filings a year. The staff handled 143 reviews in 2015, the latest year for which data is available.\n\nSince the law, Treasury officials have hired more than two dozen people to prepare for a possible uptick in filings.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is clearly evolving to focus on current and next-generation national security concerns, including as they relate U.S. companies\u2019 technological leadership and access to U.S. citizens\u2019 data,\u201d said John Kabealo, a Washington lawyer who has handled more than 100 CFIUS filings since 2011.\n\nUnder federal law, Treasury officials were given a Feb. 13, 2020 deadline to implement the rules. Soon, they will begin gathering public comments, due by mid-October, on the proposed rules.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com", "description": "Foreign investors who want to put their money into U.S. businesses that rely on sensitive technology, infrastructure and data could face greater national-security scrutiny under proposed rules from the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Katy Stech Ferek", "Katy.Stech Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108015/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
