This is where you go when gas prices are rising.\"\n\nBefore we get hungry for lunch, let's check out the charts and indicators of this fast food icon.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MCD, below, we can see that prices have been in an uptrend the past 12 months with only a shallow pullback in December when the broad market was weak. Prices have stayed above the rising 50-day moving average line and only this month have prices closed below this indicator.\n\nThe slope of the 50-day average has turned slightly lower and the 200-day line is still bullish. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line made a lower in February and trended higher into August where it stalled. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been in weakening pattern since July and has just fallen below the zero-line for a sell signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MCD, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has leveled off in recent months and created a small bearish divergence vs. price. The MACD oscillator has crossed to the downside in early September signaling a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MCD, below, we can see a relatively nearby price target in the $193 area.\n\nBottom line strategy: Even the strongest stocks are entitled to a pullback or correction. MCD could correct to the $200-$195 area, where the 200-day moving average line intersects. This will probably be a buying opportunity.", "description": "MCD could correct to the $200-$195 area, where the 200-day moving average line intersects, and this will likely serve as a buying opportunity....MCD", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Order Up Some Mcdonald'S On A Pullback", "Mcd Could Correct To The", "Area", "Where The Moving Average Line Intersects", "This Will Likely Serve As A Buying Opportunity.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Dave Butler", "Jim Cramer", "Chris Versace"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/2b7236bb-fd4b-11e8-86d7-310ec3710a22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
