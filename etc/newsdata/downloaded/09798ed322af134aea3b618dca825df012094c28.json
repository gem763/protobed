Joseph is in full training. Joe Launchbury came off with a back injury at the weekend, but there's nothing concerning there.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Sinckler was nothing serious, but while Mako and Jack are unavailable (now) Slade is on track.\u201d\n\nBorthwick delivered the positive update from Miyazaki Kita High School, where he joined the squad\u2019s backs for a welcoming ceremony in front of 1,000 school children that was entirely composed by the pupils, which featured a brass band rendition of Queen\u2019s \u2018We Will Rock You\u2019, both rugby and archery displays and a presentation to the England captain Owen Farrell.\n\nWith Borthwick returning to Japan four years after leaving his role as assistant coach with the national team under Jones, the former England skipper delivered a thank you speech in Japanese in response.\n\n\u201cI said it's great to be here in Japan and we'll do our very best at the World Cup. I thanked them for their support,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players are enjoying it. It's a great training camp here in Miyazaki. I know that from my previous experience with Japan at the last World Cup.\n\n\"You couldn't have asked for better facilities and the players have enjoyed how we've started.\u201d\n\nThe squad have also put their disruptive start behind them after the early travel issues caused by Typhoon Faxai. \u201cThere was a bit of disruption, but people were very good around the airport. They gave us access to the lounge because they knew we'd been held up.\n\n\"We stayed on the plane for a period of time and then went into the lounge.\n\n\u201cThere was also a little delay outside at the airport so the boys started an impromptu game of cricket. It was good, but I didn't have an innings.\u201d\n\nListen to Episode Two of The Indy Rugby Podcast: Japan 2019.", "description": "Joe Launchbury and Henry Slade will be fit for England\u2019s opening Rugby World Cup match against Tonga after returning to full training upon the squad\u2019s arrival in Japan.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/10/steve-borthwick-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
