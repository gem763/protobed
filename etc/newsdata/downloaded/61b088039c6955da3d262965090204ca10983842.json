REUTERS/Shannon VanRaes\n\nTrudeau, 47, an avowed defender of Canada\u2019s multiculturalism policy, has apologised repeatedly for donning brown face makeup at a 2001 \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party when he was a 29-year-old teacher at a Vancouver private school.\n\nA picture that emerged on Wednesday night showed him wearing a turban and a white robe at the party, with his face covered in dark makeup. \u201cI dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he told reporters after Time magazine published the image.\n\nA new video of him in blackface in the early 1990s emerged on Thursday.\n\nThe scandal could sink his chances of re-election in the Oct. 21 national vote in which he already faced a tough challenge from the opposition Conservatives. Critics expressed disbelief that the son of former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau - the father of Canada\u2019s multiculturalism system - could have been so insensitive.\n\nTrudeau, who has said he will not resign, said he did not realise at the time how offensive blackface was and asked Canadians for forgiveness. \u201cIf he really claims ignorance, then he was living in some strange sheltered world,\u201d said Ladonna James, a brand and marketing executive in Toronto. \u201cBecause otherwise, you cannot claim ignorance on that. He\u2019s an educator. And his father was the prime minister, who was loved by immigrants.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s dress sense has landed him in trouble before while in office. He and his family wore a number of elaborate outfits during a 2018 official trip to India, sparking widespread scorn from critics who said he went over the top.\n\nLiberal insiders say part of the issue is that Trudeau - who used to throw himself down stairs as a party trick when younger - does not always think twice before he tries to be funny.\n\n\u201cBefore he does a public event, his team tells him: \u2018Don\u2019t make jokes,\u2019\u201d said one well-placed Liberal.\n\nThe prime minister himself acknowledged the issue last year after he interrupted a woman who used the word \u201cmankind,\u201d saying he preferred \u201cpeoplekind\u201d instead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have the best of track records on jokes. ... I shouldn\u2019t be making jokes even when I think they\u2019re funny,\u201d he told reporters after days of mockery.\n\nIn May 2016, as wildfires ripped through an Alberta oil-producing region, Trudeau opened a meeting with legislators by making a quip about the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie franchise.\n\n\u201cPM Trudeau makes me not want to call myself a Canadian. \u2018Star Wars\u2019 jokes when we just lost one of the key towns of Alberta?\u201d commented one irate Twitter user.\n\n\u2018A TERRIBLE IDEA\u2019\n\nLiberals who have worked with Trudeau say his gregariousness masks a sometimes shy personality and that his off-colour jokes are a defence mechanism.\n\n\u201cHe is not naturally funny and it doesn\u2019t come easily to him and I think he tries too hard,\u201d said a second Liberal.\n\nAfter the first damaging picture emerged on Wednesday night, Trudeau told reporters that \u201cthe fact of the matter is that I\u2019ve always - and you\u2019ll know this - been more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate.\u201d\n\nA Liberal strategist who has worked on election campaigns said theatricality had long been part of the Trudeau image.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s racist. I think he\u2019s \u2018Mr. Dressup,\u2019 to tell you the truth,\u201d the strategist said, referring to a well-known Canadian children\u2019s TV show. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing with personas and ways of appearing in public for most of his public life. And I think that he just saw this as another costume.\u201d\n\nTrudeau visibly struggled on Thursday to explain behaviour that appalled many Canadians, telling reporters that his life of privilege had blinded him to the fact his actions were wrong.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good idea. It was a terrible idea,\u201d he said in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \u201cI have to recognise that I let a lot of people down.\u201d\n\nSome opposition leaders said Trudeau, who has long cultivated a reputation as a progressive, was merely a hypocrite. Trudeau\u2019s main rival, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, has hammered away at the prime minister for \u201cnot being as advertised.\u201d\n\nRyerson University communications professor Cheryl Thompson said the fact that Trudeau, born when his father was in office, grew up in the public eye meant that people felt they knew him.\n\n\u201cI think he has an authenticity issue: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you feel like we know people, our expectations are a lot higher. Those expectations have been thrown out the window.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in major political trouble just weeks before facing voters, tripped up by a penchant for poor jokes and dressing up that have let him down before and are now raising accusations of racial insensitivity.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431819141&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J04P", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
