He's brilliant, he's always got a smile on his face, always there, always gets knocked about, gets goals, setting others up.\n\n\"He's the one who came in at the very start under Klopp, his first real big signing, and I think ever since then he's just been getting better and better. He's just a machine.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nMane was given the No.10 shirt this season, having previously worn the No.19 in his first two campaigns, following Philippe Coutinho vacating the famous number.\n\nMane follows in the footsteps of the likes of Michael Owen, Graeme Souness and Luis Garcia in wearing the squad number, but it is Barnes that reminds Carragher of the incumbent most.\n\n\"I always talk about the teams I played in never possibly had, say, a John Barnes, that world-class wide player,\" he added. \"But I think Liverpool have got that now.\n\n\"I think that's what's making the difference why they are so good and look in a great position to hopefully go on and win the first Premier League.\n\n\"If you start comparing people like Sadio Mane to John Barnes then that shows how well he's doing.\"", "description": "Sadio Mane has been an important player for Liverpool and has formed a formidable attacking trio with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570360.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-105830.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
