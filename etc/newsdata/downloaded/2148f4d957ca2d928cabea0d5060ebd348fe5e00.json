REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\n\u201cWe do not take this lightly,\u201d Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the union\u2019s relationship with GM, said at a press conference in downtown Detroit. \u201cThis is our last resort.\u201d\n\nGM said in a statement that its offer to the UAW during talks included more than $7 billion in new investments, 5,400 jobs - a majority of which would be new - pay increases, improved benefits and a contract ratification bonus of $8,000.\n\n\u201cWe have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,\u201d the automaker said.\n\nA strike will very quickly shut down GM\u2019s operations across North America and could hurt the broader U.S. economy. A prolonged industrial action would also cause hardship for GM hourly workers on greatly reduced strike pay.\n\nGM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.\n\nAs of Sunday, talks between GM and the UAW had been suspended, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe union has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan and arguing workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.\n\nGM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states. In its statement, the automaker said its offer to the union included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products.\n\nA person familiar with GM\u2019s offer said that could include producing a future electric vehicle in Detroit.\n\nIt could also include turning a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, into an electric vehicle battery plant or going through with the proposed sale of the plant to a group affiliated with electric vehicle start-up Workhorse Group Inc.\n\nA new battery plant could give some UAW workers at Lordstown the chance to remain with GM.\n\nThe closure of Lordstown drew widespread criticism, including from U.S. President Donald Trump. Ohio is crucial to Trump\u2019s re-election bid in 2020.\n\nThe union has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors needs to understand that we stood up for GM when they needed us,\u201d Ted Krumm, head of the union\u2019s bargaining committee in talks with GM, said at the press conference Sunday. These are profitable times... and we deserve a fair contract.\u201d\n\nThe UAW says significant differences remain between both sides over wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing.\n\nThe strike will test both the union and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs for launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.\n\nKristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR), said the strike at GM\u2019s U.S. facilities will also shut its plants in Canada and Mexico as the automaker\u2019s supply chain is so integrated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to have a big effect on the economy,\u201d she said.\n\nGM starts off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles.\n\nAs of Sept. 1, the automaker had 96 days supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, 59 days supply of its Chevrolet Equinox SUV and more than 100 days supply of the Cadillac Escalade.\n\nIf the strike is short, hourly workers should not suffer much. But strike pay provided by the UAW, which has been building up reserves in preparation for possible industrial action, is just $250 per week.\n\nThis is far below their normal wages. The longer the strike goes on, the harder it will be for GM\u2019s workers to pay their bills.\n\n\u201cThe pain is deep on both sides,\u201d CAR\u2019s Dziczek said. \u201c(GM) will start to see costs immediately, but the costs (will) become prohibitive and drive them back to the table after a couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the UAW said 850 maintenance workers employed by GM contractor Aramark went on strike at five GM plants in Michigan and Ohio.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe automaker has 12 vehicle assembly plants, 12 engine and power train facilities and a handful of other U.S. stamping plants and other facilities.\n\nOn Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) while it focused its attention on GM.\n\nThe union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.", "description": "The United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Sunday that its roughly 48,000 hourly workers at General Motors Co facilities would go on strike as of midnight Sunday after U.S. labor contract talks reached an impasse, the first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430153909&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0L5", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
