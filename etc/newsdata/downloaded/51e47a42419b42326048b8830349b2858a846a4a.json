New Zealand Rugby called and said \u201cCan you stay put and fly the day after the final?\u201d I was a bit p****d off with everything so I said to my agent \u201cNah! I\u2019m not doing that\u201d but he talked me around.\n\nDonald's remarkable story is frequently referenced by England coach Eddie Jones\n\n\u2018I had a very social six weeks \u2014 not watching what was going into my mouth \u2014 and put on five kilos. I gave away all my All Blacks tickets because I couldn\u2019t bear to watch. I\u2019d come to the conclusion that my All Black career was over.\n\n\u2018Then I was down the river fishing for whitebait with my mate. A dead patch for phone signal. We got back to the boat ramp and my phone started going mad. I never saved the coach Graham Henry\u2019s number on my phone because you never want to make a bad call when you\u2019re not thinking straight! Then Mils Muliaina called me and said, \u201cGraham\u2019s trying to ring you\u2026 you better call him\u201d. We were taking the boat out of the river to put it on the trailer, our little dinghy on the Waikato River, and Graham said, \u201cBeaver, if you bring me three kilos of whitebait, you can play for the All Blacks this weekend\u201d.\n\n\u2018I sat on the bench for the semi-finals and then I came on in the final. At the time, it was just another kick. I didn\u2019t think it was that important but there\u2019s no hiding from the fact it changed my life.\u2019\n\nDonald has been able to cash in on his moment of glory. He currently plays his rugby in Japan, where he is working as a pundit for New Zealand television throughout the World Cup. He signed for Bath after the 2011 competition but was uninspired by his experiences in the Premiership. Now, however, he feels that England, along with South Africa, are New Zealand\u2019s biggest rivals for the title.\n\n\u2018When I was at Bath, you wouldn\u2019t expect any ball play from the forwards,\u2019 he says. \u2018Even some backs couldn\u2019t throw a decent pass. It\u2019s worlds apart now. I watched England live the other day and some of their ball play was incredible.\n\n\u2018I think the winner will come from them, New Zealand and South Africa. Elliot Daly does some incredible work in the back-three and I remember Manu Tuilagi from when he ran over me playing for Leicester!\n\n\u2018Eddie\u2019s done an amazing job with them. Look at the Japanese skill level\u2026 that\u2019s come from repetition and I imagine there\u2019s a fair bit of repetition in the England camp.\n\n\u2018I love listening to the jams he comes out with in press conference. Secretly, I think a lot of Kiwis quite like him!\u2019", "description": "IF anyone in rugby has learned to expect the unexpected, it is former All Black No 10 Stephen Donald.
