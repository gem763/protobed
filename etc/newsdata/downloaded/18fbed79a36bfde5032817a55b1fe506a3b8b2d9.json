Somehow, the balance situation is around $60 a barrel,\" he said.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attacks sent Brent to nearly $71.95 on Sept. 16 before it settled at $69.02 on the same day.\n\nBrent is currently trading below $62.\n\nDespite the gloomy economic outlook, Toyoda added that the overall oil consumption in Asia would continue to grow in the next 10 years although demand in Japan and South Korea is falling.\n\nNonetheless, Japan still needs to secure its energy resources given that some 85% of its crude is supplied by the Middle East and some 8-10% from Russia although supplies from the latter may not necessarily be consistent, he said.\n\n\"With respect to security a couple of things are important. First, we have to keep stockpiling. At this moment, we have about 200 days of stockpiling. And as I have said, the consumption is declining, so we can reduce stockpiling but for the moment we don't reduce stockpiling.\"\n\nToyoda added that Japan tries to work closely with (South) Korea, China or the region to have joint stockpiling.\n\nHe added that diversification of energy source could be another option and highlighted the importance of hydrogen as one of the solutions of the future.", "description": "Brent price seen within $60 to $65 next year - IEEJ", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T0L2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
