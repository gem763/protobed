I won\u2019t say anything bad about your network,\u201d Trump said as he pointed to the cameras. \u201cBecause a lot of the times, I get ready to do a number on these phony networks and you know, you see those red lights go off off off off. They don\u2019t want their viewers to see it. But that\u2019s OK I\u2019m not going to say it tonight. I\u2019m going to say, \u2018You\u2019re legitimate media.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually mean that,\u201d Trump added, drawing chuckles from the crowd.\n\n\u201cBut look at all those cameras. That\u2019s like the Academy Awards used to be before it failed. You know why it failed? You know why it failed?\u201d Trump asked his supporters.\n\n\u201cBecause they came after us. That\u2019s why it failed. It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us. Stupid, stupid people,\u201d Trump continued, noting that their ratings have \u201cdropped like a rock\u201d \u2014 something he loves seeing.\n\n\u201cThey are stupid people, and their ratings have dropped like a rock and I love seeing it, I\u2019m telling you. Love it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut no matter how hard they try, they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there.\u201d\n\nThe Oscars has been plagued by left-wing activists and progressive talking points in recent years. Actors and actresses lectured viewers on immigration, racism, the Supreme Court, and feminism during the 2019 Academy Awards.\n\nRatings tanked in 2018, earning a 6.8 rating with 26.5 million viewers\u2013 a \u201chistoric\u201d low.\n\nAs Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte detailed:\n\nOn top of insulting Trump voters, this Oscar telecast also promised to be a lecture in favor of gun control (by elitists protected by hundreds of armed guards) and against sexual harassment (by elitists who are either harassers or enablers). As the early ratings show, even Democrats were not interested in watching that kind of self-serving hypocrisy. If Sunday night\u2019s telecast signaled anything, though, it is that Hollywood is going the same way as the mainstream media. With their ratings and credibility gone, and knowing they have lose Middle America forever, both institutions are blatantly and belligerently moving to the far left in the hopes of at least holding on to that base of support.\n\nThe Academy experienced a slight uptick the following year with a 7.7 rating among adults 18-49 and 29.6 million total viewers, according to Variety.\n\nThis is far from the first time the president has taken aim at Hollywood.\n\n\u201cYou know, the Academy Awards is on hard times now. You know that,\u201d Trump said during a speech at the Shell Petrochemicals Complex in Monaco, Pennsylvania, in August. \u201cNobody wants to watch it. You know, why? Because they started taking us on. Everyone got tired of it.\u201d", "description": "President Trump ripped Hollywood elites, mocking the \"stupid\" people running the Oscars and declaring that it failed because \"they came after us.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/trumposcarsTX1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
