Pompeo, through his passivity, sacrificed a seasoned \u2014 and falsely maligned \u2014 diplomat who has honorably represented six presidents in some of the most challenging foreign assignments that the world has to offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo pales in stature to his predecessor William P. Rogers, who went to the mat for his State Department employees.\n\nAlmost 50 years ago \u2014 in 1970 \u2014 some 250 State Department employees signed an internal petition to senior department officials criticizing President Richard Nixon\u2019s invasion of Cambodia and his administration\u2019s demonizing of antiwar protesters.\n\nStories about the petition hit the papers. Somebody at the White House must have hit the ceiling.\n\nNixon\u2019s special counsel, Clark Mollenhoff, sent the FBI to State to get the names of the petition signers so that files could be opened for investigation.\n\nI know because I was a special agent in the office now named the Bureau of Diplomatic Security when the FBI came looking for the names.\n\nAD\n\nThe FBI request was brought to the attention of senior security officials who notified William B. Macomber, deputy undersecretary for administration. Macomber refused to turn over the names and sent word to Rogers. The secretary stepped in and let the White House know in no uncertain terms that he, not some White House gumshoe, ran the State Department. No one else, Rogers said, would deal with his officers.\n\nAD\n\nLess than a month later, the White House announced that Mollenhoff had resigned, adding that he had been acting \u201con his own volition\u201d in trying to get his hands on the petition.\n\nIn Yovanovitch\u2019s case, Pompeo didn\u2019t lift a finger.\n\nThere are reasons to have expected more of him.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo graduated West Point, first in his class, where he was steeped in the principles of leadership.\n\nPompeo was taught, just as I learned as a commissioned officer, that you stand up for your subordinates, especially when you know they are right but are under attack because they might have rubbed some high-ranking horse\u2019s ass the wrong way.\n\nA strong leader, Pompeo must have learned, doesn\u2019t cave under pressure, look the other way or throw subordinates under the bus.\n\nTo do anything less shows a lack of moral fortitude. Anything less, and as a leader you are marginalized.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo let Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, run roughshod over his department. He stood by while Giuliani, slinging around unfounded and false claims, campaigned against Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nHe capitulated to the unreasonable demand that she be removed from her post.\n\nMike Pompeo might earn plenty of \u201cattaboys\u201d from Trump. But Pompeo, as secretary of state, let down his department and disgraced himself in the process.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Pompeo should know better than to betray his staff.", "authors": ["Colbert I.
