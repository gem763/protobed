It hadn\u2019t. But Mr Benedict said the central bank learned about the extent of automated trolling of disclosures, and warned other banks to be aware of the risk too.\n\n\u201cIt indicated to us that releasing updates to markets on operational matters provides information to malicious actors that is weaponised by machine learning systems almost immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Australian National Audit Office said this year that the RBA is the most cyber-secure federal agency it has reviewed in recent years.\n\nWhile most of the focus on the RBA is on monetary policy - as it will be this week when it determines whether to cut official interest rates again - it also plays a core role delivering banking services to the government and facilitating payments across the financial sector, putting it in the frontline of the fight against cyber-crime.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the footprint of the RBA was felt largely through the effects of monetary policy decisions and its market operations. Today, our digital platforms for payments and banking are now also on the critical path for daily operations within the broader economy,\u201d Mr Benedict said.\n\nThis means the RBA is facing many new risks, including \u201coperational disruptions, cyber threats, the ongoing challenge of attracting and retaining a digitally skilled workforce, and the need to collaborate with others to constantly improve the services we offer.\"\n\n\u201cThe RBA finds itself at the intersection of digital disruption across a number of sectors in which we operate. Escalating cyber-security threats, fintech innovation in banking services and crypto-currency-based alternatives to conventional payments all confront the sweet spot of central banking operations.\u201d\n\nLike many other organisations, he said the RBA had to balance \u201coften-competing tensions\u201d around demands to be agile and to innovate, with the need for stability and security.\n\n\u201cFailure to manage this tension can result in significant failure, such as a failure to deliver highly available and secure services, or a failure to keep up with market innovation and customer expectations and demands,\u201d he said.\n\nQuestioning whether there are sufficient IT skills in the workforce to protect institutions from growing cyber threats, he said: \"It has been our experience that we will suffer and lessen our quality outcomes if we do not plan and invest in the skills of our workforce\".", "description": "Malicious actors used \"weaponised machine learning systems\" to try to attack the central bank after a power outage last August, its CIO revealed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3918%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_898/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/46c852df12112342332f743dc7a42fd5f25821c3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
