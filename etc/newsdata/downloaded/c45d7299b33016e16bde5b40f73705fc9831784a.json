No legal action has yet been taken in respect of the allegations.\n\nThe union also alleges Bulmer Farms underpaid Mr Mohammad Nor between $1 and $1.40 an hour for eight months by paying him at the lowest classification level, despite requiring him to operate tractors and maintain harvesting records.\n\nMore broadly, the union says all workers have been underpaid because Bulmer Farms allegedly reduced piece rates without consultation and removed a $150 weekly retainer set out in their piecework agreement.\n\nBulmer Farms has denied the claims and hit back with allegations that the NUW is harassing its workers at their homes. There is also no suggestion that Bill Bulmer, Kaine Bulmer or managing director Andrew Bullmer had personal knowledge of the underpayments. The wrongdoing is alleged against the company.\n\n'Union failing to respect privacy'\n\nManaging director Andrew Bulmer said the company \"does not have an issue with any of their employees choosing to join the NUW or any other union that they may like to join\".\n\nHowever, he said employees had complained \"of NUW members attending their homes to pressure individuals into becoming members and failing to respect their privacy\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Bulmer Farms believes that any employee should not be pressured into giving away their personal details such as phone numbers and residential addresses for the NUW to place undue pressure on individuals to become members, should they choose not to join.\"\n\nHe also said Mr Mohammad Nor was fired because he did not inform his supervisor about taking leave.\n\nThe union argues the worker requested leave by texting the person he believed was his acting supervisor.\n\nIt is alleged that at a meeting with his acting supervisor to discuss his absence, Mr Mohammad Nor requested union representation but the supervisor allegedly replied \"I don't have to sign this shit, good luck to you with the NUW\" and walked out the room.\n\nMr Mohammad Nor said he was \"shocked\" at his sacking and criticised Bulmer Farms for \"not paying good enough\".\n\n\"They don\u2019t care about us. We are in pain and sick every day, we work up to 14 hours a day, and even when we work at night they don\u2019t pay us extra.\"\n\nAndrew Bulmer said the company was in discussions with the NUW and was \"committed to clearing our name\".\n\nEarlier last month, Bill Bulmer told The Australian Financial Review the government must crack down on exploitation in the industry, warning \"if people speed, they get a speeding ticket\".\n\nNUW farms director Jannette Armstrong said, as AusVeg chair, Bill Bulmer was advancing the Fair Farms program, which certifies growers' \"fair employment practices\", but she said the program did not engage with workers or their union.\n\n\u201cThe [alleged] treatment of workers on Bulmer Farms is particularly concerning because Bill Bulmer positions himself as a moral authority on labour standards in the Australian horticulture industry,\" she said.", "description": "A large horticultural company run by the industry's peak body chair, Bill Bulmer, has been accused of underpayments and targeting union members.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6677%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1339%2C$y_960/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6079e4b9716737a8b23d615fc07cfd3614ae12fc", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
