Suddenly Fox News feels like a nation up for grabs, and there is growing, palpable drama on its sets.\n\nThe network\u2019s daytime anchors \u2014 people like Shep Smith and Chris Wallace, who fall on the news reporting side of Fox\u2019s opinion-reporting divide \u2014 have always grumbled about the network\u2019s nighttime pundits, talkers like Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. Now the two sides are at open war, sniping at each other daily over the seriousness of impeachment and the very legitimacy of any inquiry of the president.\n\nOn impeachment, Fox News\u2019s news side has been excellent. There were many moments in the last week where I felt shocked and gratified by the seriousness with which Fox was taking impeachment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Impeachment-Fox-News.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
