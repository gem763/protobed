She landed on her head and the injury left her psychologically damaged. As a result she needed constant medication.\n\n\u201cI was kept in a cage like a dog. Locked up and pumped full of medication,\u201d Yaroslava said.\n\n\u201cI gave my grandmother some of my medication and ran away.\u201d\n\nHer mom, Tamara, said they have no idea why Yaroslava said she was kept in a cage, but she said it might be because of her psychological condition.\n\nYaroslava revealed she funded her life as a runaway by giving English lessons for cash.\n\nDespite being found, the now 18-year-old says she has no intentions of returning home to her family.\n\nPolice are investigating the circumstances under which Yaroslava disappeared to make sure no crime had been committed and the no third party was involved.\n\nSources: Magazine Features", "description": "A teenager who ran away from home three years ago refuses to go back to her family after being found by police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/b0e53620dc7344c0a3424110d4c55e67.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
