From within one\u2019s own car, the absurdity and injustice of the situation is abundantly plain. Other drivers can be seen cutting in, changing lanes excessively, and getting worked up. Roadworks appear needlessly restrictive. Why are there so many cars on the road anyway? Horns begin to honk. There is one question that few drivers ever consider: what is my own contribution to this quagmire?\n\nPsychoanalysts refer to the process of \u201csplitting\u201d, where the self is unable to cope with its good and bad qualities simultaneously, and so \u201csplits\u201d the bad ones off and attributes them to other people. The result is an exaggerated sense of one\u2019s own virtue and innocence, but an equally exaggerated sense of the selfishness and corruption of others. We are all guilty of this from time to time, rarely more so than on social media, where the world can appear perfectly split into goodies and baddies. Populism and culture warriors exploit this aspect of human psychology, reinforcing the comforting (but ultimately harmful) feeling that any conflict in the world is their fault not ours.\n\nThe left is not averse to playing this game. Why did the financial crisis occur? Because bankers and Blairites are bad, selfish people. Apart from anything else, this makes for woeful social science. But the right plays it more dangerously. Where the left spies moral depravity in centres of wealth and power (which, as we know, can produce antisemitic conspiracy theories), the right sees it among newcomers, intellectuals and the already marginalised. The potential political implications of this don\u2019t need spelling out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Douglas Murray. Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images\n\nIn The Madness of Crowds, Douglas Murray sets out to explain why societies are now so characterised by conflict. \u201cIn public and in private, both online and off, people are behaving in ways that are increasingly irrational, feverish, herd-like and simply unpleasant. The daily news cycle is filled with the consequences. Yet while we see the symptoms everywhere, we do not see the causes.\u201d\n\nFew would fail to recognise this as a starting point. MPs and journalists are being harassed and threatened simply for doing their jobs. A university was recently forced out of Hungary by the government. The Home Office is growing increasingly anxious about the threat of far-right extremists cooperating across Europe. But there is not so much as a sniff of these trends in The Madness of Crowds. Instead, Murray organises his material into four themes: \u201cGay\u201d, \u201cGender\u201d, \u201cRace\u201d and \u201cTrans\u201d. You can see where this is heading.\n\nMurray\u2019s stock in trade is a tone of genteel civility. He writes gracefully and wittily, in keeping with his demeanour as a clubbable conservative, who simply wishes we could all just muddle through a little better. While never over-egging it, he proffers a kindly Christian gospel of love and forgiveness, which he believes might rid us of the political and cultural toxins that have so polluted our lives. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and his account of recent history is clear: authorised by leftwing academics, minority groups have been concocting conflict and hatred out of thin air, polluting an otherwise harmonious society, for their own gratification.\n\nMurray is quick to celebrate struggles for racial, sexual and gay equality, but he's adamant they have now been settled\n\nHis narrative is roughly as follows. The decline of ideologies at the end of the 20th century created a vacuum of meaning, which was waiting to be filled. This coincided with the birth of a whole range of critical cultural theories, producing fields of gender studies, race studies and queer studies. Most damagingly of all, for Murray, was the rise of intersectional feminism, which assumes that different types of oppression (especially racial and patriarchal) tend to \u201cintersect\u201d and reinforce one another.\n\nThe bitter irony, as far as Murray is concerned, is that these new theories of oppression arose at the precise moment in human history when actual racism, sexism and homophobia had evaporated. \u201cSuddenly \u2013 after most of us had hoped it had become a non-issue \u2013 everything seemed to have become about race,\u201d he writes. This seems to bug him more than anything else: \u201cAmong the many depressing aspects of recent years, the most troubling is the ease with which race has returned as an issue.\u201d\n\nHistory, therefore, is much as his fellow neoconservative Francis Fukuyama brashly described it in 1989: ended. Or rather, it could have ended, if it weren\u2019t for troublemaking intellectuals and activists. Murray is quick to celebrate past struggles for racial, sexual and gay equality, but he is adamant that they have now been settled. Questions persist regarding the nature of sex, sexuality and innate ability (what belongs to our physical \u201chardware\u201d and what to our cultural \u201csoftware\u201d, as he puts it), but these are far better handled by biologists than political thinkers. The problem, as he sees it, is that malicious, fraudulent and resentful forces \u2013 emerging from universities \u2013 have refused to accept that justice has now been delivered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The gender theorist Judith Butler \u2026 Murray decries her as a fraud. Photograph: Target Presse Agentur Gmbh/Getty Images\n\nThe acclaimed gender theorist Judith Butler is held up as a malignant fraud who hides behind the complexity of her prose. The entire venture of social science is deemed corrupted by its insidious fixation on oppression. Murray turns to recent hoax articles that were published in the academic journal Cogent Social Sciences (a prank that he describes as \u201cone of the most beautiful things to happen in recent years\u201d) as evidence that social and cultural theory is all a sham. The reader is assured \u2013 falsely \u2013 that this is all a vast Marxist project, aimed at sowing dissatisfaction and discord.\n\nMurray presumably knows that Michel Foucault was not a Marxist, but it\u2019s important to his branch of conservatism that this is brushed over. The M word serves as a coded way of tying together the humanities, Marx himself and (with a small leap of imagination) the Gulag. The fact that it is now illegal to teach gender studies in Hungary, as decreed by Viktor Orb\u00e1n (favourite intellectual: Douglas Murray), poses questions as to where the real threat to liberty is coming from. But you won\u2019t find any discussion of that in The Madness of Crowds.\n\nWe learn that the doctrine of intersectionality has now swept the world, even becoming embedded in the search algorithms written in Silicon Valley. Why? Because tech workers \u201chave decided to \u2018stick\u2019 it to people\u201d towards whom they \u201cfeel angry\u201d. It\u2019s for this reason, apparently, that Google image search throws up a disproportionate number of black faces. Intersectionality is being \u201cforce-fed\u201d to people, encouraging them to seek \u201crevenge\u201d on white men, and that is why there is so much conflict.\n\nMurray has no shortage of examples and anecdotes to back this up, many gleaned from the US. But it\u2019s notable that they nearly all operate at the level of discourse, and mostly in the media and social media. It\u2019s not difficult to come up with absurd cases of \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d saying stupid and hypocritical things online, especially when the Daily Mail appears to have an entire desk dedicated to unearthing them.\n\nThe Strange Death of Europe by Douglas Murray review \u2013 gentrified xenophobia Read more\n\nAnd there are plenty of well-known cases of people being shamed and sacked for things they\u2019ve said, many of which are unfair and sadistic. One critique of this would be that the logic of public relations and credit rating has now infiltrated every corner of our lives, such that we are constantly having to consider the effects of our words on our reputations. Another is that a global \u201cMarxist\u201d conspiracy has duped people into a fantasy of their own oppression. I know which I find more plausible.\n\nWhenever Murray strays too close to any actual oppression (as opposed to the controversies surrounding it), he quickly veers away. His chapter on gender refers to the \u201c\u2018MeToo\u2019 claims against Harvey Weinstein\u201d, but never to Weinstein or the power structures he built. His chapter on race (the longest in the book) makes no reference to one of the most controversial campaigns in recent US history, Black Lives Matter, presumably because it\u2019s impossible to discuss without acknowledging what prompted it: black men being gunned down by police officers.\n\nAnger is ultimately a mystery to Murray, seeming to emanate spontaneously from his political and ideological foes. He can come up with no better explanation for it than that bad people enjoy it, that \u201ctheir desire is not to heal but to divide, not to placate but to inflame\u201d. And yet when an author goes to such great lengths to assure you that others are degraded, and that \u201cwe\u201d white, male conservatives simply want to live in harmony, you have to wonder whom much of this anger truly belongs to.\n\n\u2022 Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World by William Davies is out in paperback from Vintage.
