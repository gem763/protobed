The scandal has taken its toll on her health, leaving her deeply depressed and with blood pressure problems.\n\n\"I find myself going to bed as early as 18:00,\" she tells DRUM. \"But I don\u2019t sleep \u2013 I\u2019m constantly thinking about my lost money and worrying about the future. I feel like I could just die because of the pain I\u2019m feeling right now. I\u2019m heartbroken.\"\n\nEverything has changed as a result of the VBS nightmare, she adds. Now she has to think twice about every cent she spends as she needs to make sure she has enough for her youngest daughter\u2019s tuition fees.\n\nTshinyalani, who works for the Thulamela municipality in Limpopo as a TLB (tractor-loader-backhoe) machine operator, opened a savings account at the bank in 1993, with the goal of saving enough money for her children to study at tertiary institutions so they wouldn\u2019t have to rely on bursaries.\n\nEvery month she\u2019d put away part of her salary, always at VBS Mutual Bank. By the time the bank was placed under administration, she\u2019d saved a healthy R600 000, which was to be her investment in her children and grandchildren\u2019s futures.\n\nNow that future is uncertain.\n\nTshinyalani felt helpless when she was told her money was gone. She\u2019d been waiting to see her doctor in May when she overheard people in the waiting room talking about a rumour that VBS Mutual Bank had collapsed.\n\nShe immediately went to the bank \"and told them I wanted my money\". She was told only a maximum of R100 000 was being given to clients so she took her money and left.\n\n\"I never imagined there would be a scandal like this.\"\n\nTshinyalani reinvested her R100 000 with Nedbank. The bank was appointed by the government to facilitate payment to investors after the national treasury provided a guarantee to the South African Reserve Bank to pay out R100 000 per depositor.\n\n\"I thought of buying a safe to put my money in because my faith in banks was at an all-time low and burying the safe inside the garage.\n\n\"But then I thought, \u2018What if I die before I tell my children where the money is?\u2019 They would never find it.\"\n\nThe money Tshinyalani had painstakingly saved over decades had, in addition to paying her children\u2019s tertiary fees, been for her to enjoy when she became a pensioner.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a way of thanking myself for all these years I\u2019ve been working hard.\"\n\nShe had also planned to finish the house she was building for her daughters, as well as build a second house on a nearby stand she owns.\n\n\"I wanted to put on a roof and finish it off so my daughters could live there with my grandkids,\" she says. \"I didn\u2019t want us all living in a full house.\"\n\nNow she isn\u2019t sure it will ever be finished \u2013 and it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll be able to build a house on the second stand.\n\nTshinyalani\u2019s youngest daughter, Murendeni (22), is studying financial accounting at Damelin College and started her final year in January.\n\nHer R40 000 fees will have to come out of the R100 000 that\u2019s left of her mother\u2019s payout.\n\n\u201cAs a mother, I cannot fail her. It has been hard for her over the past couple of months and she is worried she won\u2019t perform well in some of the modules since her attention has been divided due to uncertainty of where the money for her studies will come from.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019ll make a plan, Tshinyalani says, and use some of her salary to make up the shortfall if necessary.\n\nTshinyalani\u2019s other daughter, Rofhiwa (26), also lives with her. She put her studies on hold after she gave birth to her daughter, Uzwothe, who is now 18 months old. Her sons, Dennis (41), Fhulufhelo (36) and Mpho (30) live in Joburg.\n\nLife has changed for the family, Rofhiwa says.\n\n\u201cWe used to get everything we wanted, but not anymore. For instance, we would go out as a family to our favourite restaurants in town at least three times a month, but now we can only afford it once a month.\n\n\"Money is very tight.\"\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain if Tshinyalani and the bank\u2019s other customers will ever get their money back.\n\nIn November 2018, the high court in Gauteng issued a final order for the liquidation of the bank.\n\nAnoosh Rooplal, director of accounting firm Grant Thornton, was appointed as liquidator and his task will be to ensure civil and criminal proceedings can be pursued to hold those responsible for the theft of almost R2bn to account.\n\nThe liquidation order will allow for the recovery of funds from those who looted or owed the bank money.\n\nAdvocate Motau\u2019s report has been referred to the National Prosecuting Authority for civil or criminal action to be taken against those implicated.\n\nMeanwhile, people like Tshinyalani can only wait, hope and count every cent they have.", "description": "A Limpopo mom opens up about how losing her life savings in the VBS collapse has shattered all her dreams for her family\u2019s future.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8714/5ef9df6cae6747f69a91f5338a26010e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-05"}
