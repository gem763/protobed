Posted by Gallia County Sheriff on Monday, September 30, 2019\n\nAt any given time, Champlin said, there are two officers overseeing 35 to 50 people in general population at the jail, which has 22 beds and employs nine full-time officers \u2014 four women and five men.\n\nThe night of the escape, two male corrections officers were scheduled to work, Champlin said, but both called in sick. Two female corrections officers took their place.\n\nAt 12:14 a.m. Sunday, the male inmates \u2014 one of whom had escaped the jail before \u2014 overpowered the two female guards on duty with a \u201chomemade weapon\u201d described as a \u201cshank,\u201d Champlin said at the news conference. They gained access to the administrative wing of the facility, stole the keys to a corrections officer\u2019s vehicle and forced open a secure door.\n\nOnce outside, the inmates climbed inside the officer\u2019s car and drove it one block south, to a city park that runs parallel to the Ohio River, which divides the states of Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nThere, the men abandoned the stolen vehicle and drove away in a different vehicle that was waiting for them, authorities said. Law enforcement from the city of Gallipolis, Gallia County and the Ohio State Highway Patrol \u201cconverged,\u201d Champlin said, working with authorities in two other states throughout the night to find the men.\n\nDuring the news conference Sunday, Champlin said authorities in Pennsylvania had located the second vehicle in which the men had fled. An award of up to $2,500 per escapee was offered for relevant information. At 2 a.m. Monday, the sheriff\u2019s office said investigators \u201cwere able to develop information\u201d that led to the apprehension of McDaniel, 30, Clemente, 23, and Martin, 40.\n\nMartin escaped custody earlier this month with another man while the two were being driven in a transport vehicle to the Gallia County Jail. Both were wearing orange jumpsuits and shackles on their legs and ankles. After a short standoff, the men were discovered hiding in a crawl space of a home in Gallia County and taken back to jail, reported News Channel 3 WSAZ.\n\nChamplin headed off criticism of jail procedures at his news conference Sunday, acknowledging the ways insufficient space, decades-old facilities and limited staffing have negatively affected the upkeep of the jail. Part of Champlin\u2019s plan to improve crowding, he told reporters, was to ship some Gallia County inmates to neighboring county jails.\n\nThis is what they did with Martin after his first attempt to escape in early September, Champlin said. But Martin had returned to Gallia County for a court hearing, Champlin said, providing the circumstances for his second breakout.\n\nThe jail, Champlin said, is not equipped to handle the influx of inmates, or the mental health and substance abuse challenges they\u2019re facing. Decades ago, the facility was transformed from individual cells to a dormlike space that could hold more people \u2014 making it difficult to separate nonviolent offenders from violent ones.\n\n\u201cBad men continue to try to fight to free themselves to terrorize our community,\u201d Champlin said at the news conference. \u201cI won\u2019t stop fighting the criminal element that\u2019s been plaguing our Gallia County and other counties like ours.\u201d\n\nThe scope of questions from reporters and community members extended beyond the three escape attempts since August, touching on multiple shortcomings that prompted an emergency county commissioner meeting and an investigation into jail protocol by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\n\nIn the past three weeks, two people serving time at the jail have died. One man, David \u201cTommy\u201d Gibson, died by suicide, Champlin said, and the other, 35-year-old Lacey Wolford, died of a drug overdose, reported the Gallipolis Daily Tribune.\n\nSherry Russell, the mother of Gibson, 27, challenged the sheriff during his news conference, asking what the county was doing to make the jail more safe. David Gibson, she said, was suffering from withdrawal when he ended his life. She and others present criticized the jail for not providing him proper supervision and failing to grant him a medical evaluation in a timely manner.\n\nRussell, who told the Daily Tribune she was a nurse practitioner, engaged in an impassioned and emotional dialogue with the sheriff, during which he acknowledged her concerns but deferred many of them to the pending investigation.\n\n\u201cYour job is to protect the men that are in your facility,\u201d Russell said. \u201cHe [Gibson] made some bad choices. He did not deserve to die.\u201d\n\nChamplin said he takes responsibility for the successes and failures of the jail, and spoke of short-term and long-term plans he said his staff have begun to implement since he took office 2\u00bd years ago.\n\nBut Russell told reporters after the news conference that she felt she wasn\u2019t given \u201cany real answers\u201d about the condition of the jail.\n\n\u201cI feel like we were being pacified and given the politically correct answers,\u201d Russell told the Daily Tribune. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously been a problem for a while. We\u2019ve had deaths in the past year and numerous escapes.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nGeorgia teen shot and killed after his hunting party mistook him for a deer\n\nKangaroo \u2018carnage\u2019: 20 animals killed in apparent hit-and-run rampage\n\nAn officer was killed with his own gun.
