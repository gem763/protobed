One of its projects is a gene therapy treatment for hemophilia.\n\nThe FTC staff had focused on hemophilia treatments since Roche markets Hemlibra, the report said.\n\nFollowing the staff's recommendation, officials at the top of the FTC's Bureau of Competition must weigh in. The next step would be a vote by the FTC chairman and four commissioners.\n\nThe deal must also win approval from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which said this week that it had a deadline of mid-December for a Phase 1 decision. A Phase 2 probe would be more in-depth and detailed.\n\nRoche, Spark and the FTC all declined comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by John Miller; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "description": "The Federal Trade Commission staff reviewing Roche's  plan to buy U.S.-based gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics  for $4.3 billion recommended that the deal be approved without requiring any asset sales, the Capitol Forum reported on Thursday.
