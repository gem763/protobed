Photo: Aram Roston/REUTERS\n\nOn Wednesday night, Rudy Giuliani\u2019s clients Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman went down as the first arrests of the Ukraine scandal, when they were detained on campaign-finance charges: The pair allegedly laundered foreign money through shell companies in order to spend it on Republican campaigns. Also on their suspect docket was a project with Giuliani, helping the president\u2019s lawyer pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in-country.\n\nThe charges \u2014 and subsequent subpoenas from the impeachment inquiry \u2014 handed to Parnas and Fruman were reportedly moved up, because the two were prepared to board a one-way flight at Dulles airport heading to Vienna, Austria.\n\nApparently, so was Rudy Giuliani. According to The Atlantic staff writer Elaina Plott, on Wednesday the lawyer told her they couldn\u2019t meet for an interview due to a Hannity appearance.\n\nWhen I suggested this evening instead, his response was a bit more curious. We would have to aim for lunch, Giuliani told me, because he was planning to fly to Vienna, Austria, at night. He didn\u2019t offer any details beyond that \u2026 When confirming today that Parnas and Fruman were heading to Vienna on matters \u201crelated to their business,\u201d told the [Wall Street] Journal that he himself only had plans to meet with them when they returned to Washington. By this logic, Giuliani was also planning to fly to Vienna within roughly 24 hours of his business associates, but do no business with them while all three were there.\n\nWhen Plott tried to get in contact with Giuliani on Thursday, a woman who said she was his communications director answered his phone \u2014 a first for Plott in her many calls to Giuliani \u2014 and said he wasn\u2019t available. In the background, Plott heard the president\u2019s lawyer yelling \u201casshole\u201d at the TV.\n\nWhy were Parnas and Fruman were headed to Vienna for \u201cbusiness\u201d in the same window as Giuliani, but with no stated plan to meet up? Certainly some answer will arise following the subpoena issued to Giuliani last month, and the subpoenas issued to Parnas and Fruman on Thursday. (The two aren\u2019t going anywhere, as they\u2019re currently in detention in Virginia on $1 million bond each.) In the ensuing days, we\u2019ll hopefully learn more about Giuliani\u2019s connections to the men, as he hasn\u2019t been too forward about their relationship:\n\nHere's the full answer from RUDY GIULIANI on his work for LEV PARNAS's company, Fraud Guarantee: \"All I can tell you is that most of the Fraud Guarantee work, in fact the Fraud Guarantee work, which \u2014 or I should say \u2014 I can\u2019t acknowledge it\u2019s Fraud Guarantee, I don\u2019t think.\" \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) October 11, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the president has claimed ignorance: \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen,\u201d Trump said Thursday, adding that he hadn\u2019t spoken about them with Giuliani \u2014 despite Giuliani being the point man on the president\u2019s push for an investigation in Ukraine, and the existence a picture of Parnas with Trump at the White House from 2018.", "description": "On Wednesday, Rudy Giuliani\u2019s clients Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas were arrested prior to boarding a one-way flight to Vienna.
