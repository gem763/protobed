Little notice has been given, however, to another document lying in plain sight: a Justice Department press release issued the day the conversation transcript became public. That Justice Department statement makes explicit that the president never spoke with Attorney General William Barr \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son\u201d or asked him to contact Ukraine \u201con this or any other matter,\u201d and that the attorney general has not communicated at all with Ukraine. It also contains the following morsel: \u201cA Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. While the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.\u201d [Bold mine]\n\nThe number of countries includes the U.K. and Italy, the latter of which was just visited by one William Barr. So what's going on? More from Mukasey:\n\nThe definitive answer to the obvious question\u2014what\u2019s that about?\u2014is known only to Mr. Durham and his colleagues. But publicly available reports, including by Andrew McCarthy in his new book, \u201cBall of Collusion,\u201d suggest that during the 2016 campaign the Federal Bureau of Investigation tried to get evidence from Ukrainian government officials against Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, to pressure him into cooperating against Mr. Trump. When you grope through the miasma of Slavic names and follow the daisy chain of related people and entities, it appears that Ukrainian officials who backed the Clinton campaign provided information that generated the investigation of Mr. Manafort\u2014acts that one Ukrainian court has said violated Ukrainian law and \u201cled to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 and harmed the interests of Ukraine as a state.\u201d\n\nSorry to quote so extensively, but the WSJ is behind a paywall and I thought everyone should see as much of Mukasey's writing as possible. Reading not so far between the lines here, it's clear that the biggest story of 2019 or maybe 2020 is yet to come \u2014 and it won't be impeachment. The Russia Probe is being turned on its head.\n\nPJ Media's co-founder Roger L.
