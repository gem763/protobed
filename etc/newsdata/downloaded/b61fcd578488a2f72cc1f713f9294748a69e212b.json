Christie submitted herself for a nomination after the network failed to do so, as did Allen and van Houten.\n\nKevin Winter via Getty Images Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Gwendoline Christie, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau speak onstage during the 71st Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater on September 22, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.
