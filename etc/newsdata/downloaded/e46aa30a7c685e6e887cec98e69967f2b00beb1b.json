Here are a few tips.\n\nParties\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nTo say that PAX days are long is an understatement. I get it, we're all exhausted and would like a nice lie down come 10pm. But acting like a nanna isn't going to get you anywhere. You don't want to miss out on the good vibes that our little tribe emanates throughout the city.\n\nIn addition to hitting the bars, parties are where it's at. Don't stress if you don't get into Twitch or any of the big name events - there will be plenty of parties happening. A good first step is joining this Facebook group.\n\nPanels\n\nImage: Kotaku\n\nWhat better place to meet someone with similar interests than in the panels you're hitting. You might as well put that line-time to good use by StreetPassing those around you or even being brave enough to strike up a conversation.\n\nThere are an overwhelming amount of amazing panels this year, so I recommend planning ahead. Use the PAX Aus app to build your personal schedule and get there early. Plus, more lines means more opportunities for chats!\n\nYou may meet someone interested in sex, or at least discussing it, at the Love in the Time of Pixels: Gaming in Romantic Relationships panel. It should be fun!\n\nTabletop Area\n\nImage: Kotaku\n\nSimply taking a chance and talking to a stranger is always a good piece of advice, but that can be intimidating. You may not know what to say, or the conversation may get awkward.\n\nA unique solution to this is board games. PAX dedicate a huge area to it, and people are really welcoming. You can easily find people to sit down and play with, and there are plenty of 'learn-to-play' sessions and tournaments.\n\nNot only will this give you a chance to chat with new people, but you'll always have something to talk about - the game at hand.\n\nYou could also do this in the Handheld Area.\n\nApps\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nYes, I'm absolutely advocating Tinder.\n\nJust think about how awesome and fun that's going to be when so many fellow gamers are gathered in close proximity! Whether you're looking for a casual hookup or perhaps something that could blossom - I really think Tinder can be a good source, especially in such as positive environment.\n\nA friend also recommended that you advertise being at PAX on your profile. If people do it on Twitter, why not here too?\n\nI've also stumbled across a geek-only equivalent called Cuddli on the Android store. In addition to matching people up and providing a messenger service, it also suggests unique dates ideas, which is pretty awesome.\n\nApparently it will also match you up with a partner on the dance floor if you both have your phones out.\n\nI haven't tried this myself so I would love to hear from anyone who has or gives it a crack at PAX.", "description": "This week, Australia's biggest gaming convention PAX returns!
