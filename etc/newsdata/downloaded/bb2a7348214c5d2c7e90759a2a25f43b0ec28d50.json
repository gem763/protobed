At the time, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez won the vote, but without a majority and he has, since then, struggled to find support from other political groups to form a government. The Spanish King has started fresh consultations with the various parties, but without a breakthrough by Monday, Spain will automatically hold elections on November 10.\n\n\"Given the existing discord between parties, a new election is the most likely outcome at this stage,\" Antonio Barroso, deputy director of research at Teneo, said in a note Monday.\n\nOpinion polls show that the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Sanchez would win an election with 31% of the vote \u2013 this is up from 28.7% in the April election. The conservative party Partido Popular would come second with 19% of support, followed by the populist Podemos with 14% and the liberal party Ciudadanos with 13%.", "description": "The Southern European economy has been at a political impasse since a general election in April.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105878738-1556517480231gettyimages-1140043174.jpeg?v=1556517519", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
