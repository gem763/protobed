Andrew Knapp dropped a sacrifice bunt that moved Hoskins and Gosselin up a base before the Marlins intentionally walked Maikel Franco, loading the bases with one out for Haseley.\n\nWith the Marlins using five players in the infield, Haseley hit a hard grounder to shortstop. It looked as if it could have been be a double-play ball. At the least, shortstop Miguel Rojas could have had a force at home for the second out. But, Rojas bobbled the grounder, allowing Hoskins to score the winning run in a game that lasted 5 hours, 13 minutes.\n\n\u201cA very professional game by us,\u201d Knapp said. \u201cWe could\u2019ve let that one get away and gone home, but we\u2019re playing for each other and the city. It\u2019s great to pull that one off.\u201d\n\nRanger Suarez (6-1) pitched three scoreless innings and capped an impressive performance by Philadelphia\u2019s bullpen. Seven relievers combined for 11 scoreless innings. None of the Phillies\u2019 eight pitchers walked a batter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really impressive,\u201d Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said of the bullpen. \u201cThat was a lot of work for (Suarez).\u201d\n\nBryce Harper doubled, tripled and drove in a pair of runs for the Phillies, who snapped a six-game losing streak while improving to 8-9 against the Marlins this season.\n\nAsked if the win showed the Phillies, who failed to qualify for the postseason, aren\u2019t packing it in, Kapler said: \u201cI think the players demonstrated that tonight. The fight from the players did the talking.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia, which had postseason aspirations after signing Harper in the offseason, needs wins in its final two games against Miami to end the season with a winning record.\n\nHarold Ramirez homered and Rojas had four hits for Miami.\n\nThe Marlins had a hit in every extra inning, except the 15th, but couldn\u2019t score.\n\n\u201cWe gave ourselves some chances and just weren\u2019t able to get them in,\u201d Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. \u201cThat\u2019s a game you have to get a big hit and we just weren\u2019t able to do it tonight.\u201d\n\nThe teams combined to use 19 pitchers and 26 position players.\n\nMiami took a 4-2 lead in the third on Isan Diaz\u2019s RBI single to right that scored Rojas. Starlin Castro also reached on the play when Diaz got caught in a rundown between first and second. The Phillies\u2019 throw home to get Castro was late and Diaz then safely made it to second.\n\nPhiladelphia got a run back in the fourth on Haseley\u2019s RBI single to left-center and tied it in the fifth on a sacrifice fly by Harper.\n\nVince Velasquez allowed four runs on seven hits in four innings.\n\nPablo Lopez gave up four runs on eight hits in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nWALLACH STEPPING DOWN\n\nMarlins bench coach Tim Wallach won\u2019t return for the 2020 season. Wallach, who has worked alongside manager Don Mattingly for the last nine seasons, told reporters he would like to be closer to his family in California.\n\nDOUBLE DOWN\n\nCastro\u2019s first-inning double gave him a career-high 56 extra-base hits this season.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMiami: RF Lewis Brinson was lifted in the fourth inning with a right foot contusion.\n\nPhillies: C J.T. Realmuto had surgery on his right knee on Friday. He is expected to be ready for the start of the 2020 season. \u2026 SS Jean Segura (sprained right ankle) likely won\u2019t return this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMiami LHP Caleb Smith (10-10, 4.31) opposes Phillies RHP Zach Eflin (9-13, 4.16) on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Adam Haseley and Philadelphia's bullpen showed the Phillies aren't quitting on the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Bracy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/marlins_phillies_baseball_58650_c0-90-2154-1345_s1770x1032.jpg?1e704d98e9058760c9b3ffa579cfdc8ab3076732", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
