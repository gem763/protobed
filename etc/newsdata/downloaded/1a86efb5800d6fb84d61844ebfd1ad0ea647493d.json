The supermodel broke her arm during rehearsals and needed to undergo surgery. The 65-year-old\u2019s daughter Sailor Brinkley-Cook, 21, took her mom\u2019s spot on the reality show.\n\n\u201cThe second I landed, I felt the shards in my arm,\u201d Brinkley told People magazine. \u201cLike, I literally felt it in my wrist, and I just instantly looked up and said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I broke my arm.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bone at the thumb that usually posts one way. Mine was in the opposite direction,\" she explained. \"Then there was bone, just it, it was just shattered into a thousand little pieces, just a million of little pieces.\u201d\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY WANTS TO \u2018IMMEDIATELY\u2019 COMPETE ON \u2018DANCING WITH THE STARS,\u2019 SAYS DAUGHTER SAILOR\n\nBrinkley previously made the devastating announcement on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\n\"Showbiz is all about getting a break, and Sailor and I both got one on 'Dancing with the Stars' this season,\" Brinkley said in a statement.\n\nBrinkley-Cook, who is also a Sports Illustrated model like her famous mom, said she's busy learning her mother's dance routine just hours before she will perform live.\n\n\"I'm doing this mostly for my mom. I just want to make her happy and make her proud,\" she said. \"She loved doing this. She loves dancing and she loves performing, and getting hurt was her worst nightmare.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nFox News\u2019 Mariah Haas contributed to this report.", "description": "What should have been a relaxing soak quickly turned into a painful mishap.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Michelle-Pfeiffer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
