More companies are offering their workers more than one option on how to use these accounts, and if you are one of the lucky workers who has a choice beyond the usual pretax contribution, you should take a hard look at how you could benefit most.\n\nWhen given a choice, the majority of American workers opt for pretax contributions, which lower their federal income tax bill in the year they're made. And although the tax incentive for pretax contributions is a clear benefit no one can discount, it could make more financial sense to take advantage of after-tax contributions if you are among these three types of people:\n\nThose who are in need of an emergency savings buffer. Those who are high-income earners. Those whose incomes are volatile.\n\nWe will go into detail about each of those three situations, but first it's important to understand some 401(k) basics.\n\nA little background on how 401(k)s work\n\nA 401(k) is a workplace retirement plan that allows individuals to save for retirement in a tax-favored manner. Employee contributions are withheld from paychecks while employers can match their employees' contributions up to certain limits. Most workers contribute to their 401(k)s on a pretax basis. (See How Much Can You Contribute to a 401(k) for 2019?) With pretax contributions, employees can reduce their tax bill for that year since deposits into their 401(k) plan are not counted in their taxable income. These contributions grow tax-deferred during an employee's working years and then withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nWith 7 out of 10 large and midsize employers now offering a Roth 401(k) option, many workers also have the option of paying tax up front on their contributions and then taking tax-free withdrawals in retirement. (See How Much Can You Contribute to a Roth 401(k) for 2019?)\n\nA third much less common 401(k) option some employers offer is the after-tax contribution option. Like a Roth 401(k), an after-tax 401(k) contribution is just that, made after taxes are paid. Like a Roth 401(k), earnings grow tax-deferred. However, unlike a Roth 401(k), the earnings on the account are taxed upon withdrawal. The after-tax option predates the Roth 401(k). Of course, if you are saving for retirement and wish to do it on an after-tax basis, the Roth 401(k) is preferable to the after-tax option. Why would you pay taxes if you don't need to?\n\nAt first glance, this thinking may cause workers to dismiss the after-tax option altogether, but there are three reasons why workers could benefit from going the route of after-tax contributions:\n\nReason #1: You need an emergency savings buffer\n\nWe've all seen the statistics that show Americans cannot handle even a minor disruption to their incomes. Two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, according to Prudential, and 40% of households lack the savings to weather a financial shock. These sobering statistics indicate a strong need for Americans to build emergency savings.\n\nAn after-tax 401(k) account can offer a convenient, yet disciplined way to create a designated emergency fund at your workplace. This fund can be used to cover unexpected expenses -- without dipping into your pretax savings, which can jeopardize your retirement security and trigger a tax bill and possibly early withdrawal penalties as well. If it turns out you never need that money for an emergency, it becomes an additional source of long-term retirement savings. With the after-tax option you can easily access your after-tax emergency funds should you need them, subject to plan rules or provisions. Generally, your contributions (but not your gains) can be withdrawn at any time tax-free.\n\nWhy an after-tax 401(k) and not a Roth 401(k)? While both types of accounts are funded with after-tax money, withdrawals from Roth 401(k)s come with more restrictions -- including penalties if you're not yet 59\u00bd -- and you must have had the account for at least five tax years and have reached 59\u00bd to enjoy income tax free treatment of earnings.\n\nHow to invest your emergency 401(k) funds: An important thing to remember if you do decide to use the after-tax option in your 401(k) to build emergency savings is to invest the funds conservatively. You would do this because you want to ensure the money earmarked for emergency savings is there if/when you need it, and riskier investments such as stock funds will go down in value from time to time. The rest of your contributions within the 401(k) plan earmarked for retirement could be invested conservatively, moderately or aggressively based on your age and risk tolerance level. Note that if you make a withdrawal from the after-tax portion of your savings earmarked for emergencies while younger than 59\u00bd, you will owe a 10% penalty and ordinary income taxes on the earnings (but not contributions) that you withdraw. Therefore, investing conservatively may be optimal. This approach may also cause you to feel more comfortable investing your other funds intended for retirement more aggressively since you will have confidence you can access your emergency fund -- and it will be there -- if you need it.\n\nStory continues", "description": "This type of saving method isn't nearly as well-known (or as popular) as regular contributions to a 401(k), but three types of people could benefit from giving it a try.", "authors": ["Vishal Jain", "Head Of Financial Wellness Strategy", "Prudential Financial"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TgC7Kf.uI8yy0oH64Dz4oA--~B/aD04NDI7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/kiplinger.com/e56268f0224e267614fde09a064e2b1e", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
