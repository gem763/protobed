They were looking after 300 dogs and about 100 cats when the storm hit.\n\nElizabeth Burrows, executive director of the humane society, said they thought the building was safe. It was built in 2008 with an elevated foundation, specifically to avoid the danger of flooding. Since recent storms didn't flood the shelter, Burrows thought they could survive Dorian.\n\nBut the slow-moving Category-5 hurricane hovered over the islands and delivered an unexpected amount of rainfall. A massive storm surge washed over the island and water invaded the interior of the animal shelter.\n\nThe staff desperately tried to save the dogs by elevating their crates, even as water rose up to their chests, Telfort said. Cell phone video shows a vehicle outside almost entirely submerged in the flood, and water inside the building.\n\nAppolina is a survivor of the flooding that killed more than 200 dogs at an animal shelter in Freeport, Bahamas. She a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and available for adoption.\n\nRead More", "description": "A massive storm surge in the Bahamas killed about 220 dogs and 50 cats in an animal shelter during Hurricane Dorian, according to staffers at the shelter.", "authors": ["Gustavo Valdes", "Pamela Boykoff"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190908190619-01-hurricane-floods-animal-shelter-in-grand-bahamas-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
