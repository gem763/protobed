As Chair of the department, he and his team achieved the unprecedented feat of becoming number one in the Designintelligence rankings for both undergraduate (2012-16 and 2018) and graduate (2012-2014, 2016 and 2018) interior design programmes.\n\nKhoi Vo, Vice President of SCAD Hong Kong Photo: SCAD Hong Kong\n\nTherefore, it should be no surprise that, in today\u2019s job market, SCAD degrees are in high demand. This is especially so in areas which call for imaginative and critical thinking, problem-solving skills, an innovative approach to design, and an understanding of the power of storytelling.\n\nVo emphasises that SCAD students receive a comprehensive education in different aspects of art and design. The courses are intellectually rigorous, student-centred, and focus on meeting professional standards. The curriculum is regularly updated and adapted to include new concepts and to ensure students can achieve their dreams of a career in the creative field.\n\nBesides that, SCAD Hong Kong recently introduced a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in User Experience (UX) design while SCAD Savannah has launched three new degree programmes in Immersive Reality; the Business of Beauty and Fragrance; and Social Strategy and Management.\n\nNew UX Design programme at SCAD Hong Kong connects businesses with their target consumers\n\nAccording to Vo, his aim in Hong Kong is to focus on three particular pillars. One is to give students diverse career options by building strong, positive relationships with the art and design world. This will strengthen the bridge between SCAD, potential employers in Hong Kong and global industry leaders.\n\nSCAD students have diverse career options after graduation.

Recent examples include a streetwear collection in collaboration with Disney to celebrate Mickey Mouse\u2019s 90th birthday. SCAD students also teamed up with the MTR Corporation as part of the \u201cArt in MTR\u201d scheme to visually transform the Sham Shui Po station.\n\nMickey Mouse turns 90: Disney teams up with SCAD faculty and students to create special streetwear collection\n\nCrucially, he plans to continue to raise the bar in terms of academic excellence, with new programmes developed by SCAD faculty members and co-operating with global leading partners such as Google.\n\nAs SCAD celebrates its 40th birthday and by reflecting on its humble beginning, it continues to look to the future. With more than 40 majors and 70 minors, the curriculum is constantly evolving in response to the changes in the professions that graduates expect to enter.\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\nCourses of study are registered with the Hong Kong Education Bureau, registration numbers: 261958-261971, 262196-262202 and 262909.
