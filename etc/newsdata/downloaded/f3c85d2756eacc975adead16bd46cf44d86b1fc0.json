We wanted to play the game at our pace, not theirs, and we did that in the second half.\u201d\n\nScrum-half Ben Youngs added: \u201cWe\u2019re happy with today, but the exciting thing for me is that I know there\u2019s more in this team.\u201d\n\nFears England could come into the match undercooked, after their final pool game against France was washed out by last week\u2019s devastating typhoon, proved unfounded.\n\nMay\u2019s early salvo and Farrell\u2019s eight-from-eight kicking meant England exorcised the demons of their traumatic early World Cup exit four years ago \u2014 one of the lowest points in English rugby history.\n\nIt also extended England\u2019s winning run over Australia to seven matches dating back to that tournament, when the Wallabies condemned the hosts to a first-round exit with a 33-13 drubbing at Twickenham.\n\nEngland have now beaten Australia at the quarter-final stage on all three occasions the Wallabies have failed to reach the last four, after 1995 and 2007.\n\nAfter an early Christian Lealiifano penalty, a slow-burner burst into life with May scoring twice in three minutes to put England in the driving seat.\n\nHenry Slade, making his return from a knee injury, had threatened before England broke through on 18 minutes.\n\nAfter securing good lineout ball, Farrell deftly switched play to the left and after a couple more phases, Tom Curry\u2019s quick hands fed May to dive over in the corner.\n\n\u2013 Explosive burst \u2013\n\nMoments later, England\u2019s prolific winger was again the beneficiary following more fine work from Slade, who picked off a David Pocock pass and sent a clever grubber kick into the same corner for May to finish clinically.\n\nAfter a close-range Farrell penalty had extended England\u2019s advantage, Lealiifano nailed his third three-pointer of the half to reduce the lead at the break to 17-9.\n\nThe masters of knockout rugby, Australia came out firing at the start of the second half, an explosive burst from winger Marika Koroibete putting the Wallabies right back in it.\n\nBack came England, though, with a brilliant pass from Farrell teeing up prop Kyle Sinckler to bulldoze over for his first Test try, triggering a run of 23 unanswered points.\n\nFarrell stretched England\u2019s lead back to 11 with another penalty before Sinckler came up with a huge steal to arrest fierce Australia pressure.\n\nTwo more Farrell three-pointers effectively extinguished any hopes of a late Australia fightback before Anthony Watson\u2019s late intercept try added insult to injury for the two-time champions.\n\n\u201cThe better team won \u2014 you\u2019ve got to suck it up sometimes,\u201d said Australia coach Michael Cheika, who barked at a reporter to \u201cjust chill\u201d for asking him if he was going to step down.\n\n\u201cThe lads put everything into it today. I want all the Aussies at home and here to know that \u2014 they put their bodies on the line.\u201d\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones, in charge of Australia when Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s extra-time drop goal floored the Wallabies in the 2003 final, had little sympathy for his old sparring partner.\n\n\u201cAt this time not a lot of sympathy,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the win \u2014 I think I\u2019m allowed to.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Wing Jonny May produced a quickfire double and captain Owen Farrell was perfect with the boot as England stormed into the World", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/d2a0ad_england-jonny-may-scored-two-in-minutes-may-day-england-smash-aussies-40-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
