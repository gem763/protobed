Supporters chanted the name of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the party\u2019s founder and leader, who has in effect run Poland from his party office since taking power four years ago with 37.6% of the vote.\n\n\u201cWe have reasons to be joyful. Despite the powerful front that was arraigned against us, we were able to win,\u201d said Kaczy\u0144ski. \u201cI hope that tomorrow will bring confirmation of our success. We have four years of hard work in front of us, because Poland needs to change further. And it must change for the better.\u201d\n\nSince winning elections in 2015, the rightwing populists have embarked on a programme of massive social spending, winning widespread support, especially in smaller towns and the countryside.\n\nSimultaneously, the party has been accused of attacking the judiciary, engaging in a culture war and, in recent months, using its stable of loyal media to launch a war on \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d, claiming the party is defending traditional Polishness.\n\nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland\u2019s prime minister and a Kaczy\u0144ski nominee, said: \u201cToday the sun shone as it rarely does in October. And I hope tomorrow it will shine even brighter. These results give us a huge public mandate.\u201d\n\nAlso buoyant were supporters of the Left. The result marks a return of leftwing parties to Polish parliamentary politics after a four-year absence, when a fragmented left failed to cross the parliamentary threshold.\n\n\u201cWe are returning to the parliament!\u201d Robert Biedro\u0144, one of the Left\u2019s three co-leaders, told a post-election rally. \u201cWe are going back to where the Polish left has always belonged.\u201d\n\nThe agrarian PSL bloc and anti-system Kukiz\u201915 was at 8.6% while the far-right Confederation got 6.8%, based on the partial official results.\n\nOn Thursday, the European commission announced it was referring Poland to the European court of justice over its disciplinary regime for Polish judges, opening up a new front with Law and Justice, which is already embroiled in a dispute with the rest of the EU over the rule of law.", "description": "Early results of parliamentary election show party has done even better than four years ago", "authors": ["Christian Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9286324e7e829784392cd96cb7efb7a321a17c1/0_278_5613_3368/master/5613.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b88c241380c81334c907b5571e166dd", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
