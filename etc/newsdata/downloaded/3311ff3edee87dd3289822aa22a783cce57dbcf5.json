Her mother hoped it would keep her out of trouble \u2014 but Hadera soon realized she enjoyed acting and wanted to pursue it. Now, the Harlem-raised Hadera stars in the new series Godfather Of Harlem.\n\nAt a taping of NPR's Ask Me Another at the Bell House in Brooklyn, New York, Hadera told host Ophira Eisenberg she struggled to find work as an actor. Hadera spent years working in the restaurant business to pay the bills. Eventually, she decided to move her career in a different direction, and enrolled in DJ school. Her time studying samples was short-lived, however, when she was put off by, as she put it, a \"hardass\" instructor.\n\nIt was then that she got a career-changing call about an audition for Spike Lee's 2011 film, Da Brick. Hadera got the part, and Lee apparently liked working with her \u2014 she's now appeared in four of his projects.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mike Katzif/NPR Mike Katzif/NPR\n\nHadera's latest role is in the Epix series, Godfather Of Harlem, based on the true story of crime boss Bumpy Johnson. In it, Hadera portrays Johnson's wife, Mayme.\n\nFor her Ask Me Another trivia challenge, the DJ school dropout displayed her knowledge of hip-hop and rap samples in a game called, \"Sample Sampler.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn her time at the Harlem School of the Arts:\n\n\"It's an amazing place, that's where I started during the summer. My mom wanted to keep me out of trouble, and it was either summer camp or The Harlem School of the Arts, so I reluctantly choose the theater program there. I did not like attention, and I still don't like attention or being in the spotlight. I choose that and it was the best thing that ever happened.\"\n\nOn auditioning for and working with Spike Lee:\n\n\"Spike has made me audition for every single part I have gotten from him. I think a lot of actors get to a certain point where they get offers. And I am sure Spike is not making Denzel [Washington] audition. But I think he is someone who has worked really hard for everything he has gotten and he is not a fan of handouts; and I respect that and I think that it is part of your job as an actor to audition. There's no ego there, it's just part of what you do.\"\n\nOn playing Crime Boss Bumpy Johnson's Wife In Godfather Of Harlem:\n\nHadera plays Mayme Johnson, who was the wife of one of New York City's infamous crime bosses, Bumpy Johnson \u2014 who was also a subject of the movie American Gangster. Hadera said the real Mayme was unhappy with the 2007 film's depiction of one of Harlem's biggest drug dealers, Nicky Barnes (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.):\n\n\"Before she passed, [Mayme Johnson] wrote a book called Harlem Godfather. And I turned to that. She really had an issue with the portrayal of the relationship between Nicky Barnes and Bumpy Johnson in Ameican Gangster. It made it seem like Nicky Barnes came up under Bumpy Johnson and that he was his right hand man. She's very vocal about being like, 'This is not so, Nicky Barnes drove my man around like once before he was fired \u2014 he was not good enough to hang with Bumpy.'\"\n\nOn attending DJ school:\n\n\"It was a four month program, very intensive. It was only two days a week, but it was four hours a class. And I was really loving it. And then we had a very hardass DJ teacher... she's like 'you're going to come back next week and you're gonna get up and present your mix to the class whether or not you're ready.' And that to me is the way to ensure I never come back to DJ school. It was supposed to be this fun thing that could earn me lots of money, that I could love doing, and then she ruined it because she made it scary.\"\n\nHeard on Ilfenesh Hadera: Spike Lee Alum And DJ School Dropout.", "description": "She's Gotta Have It actor and DJ school dropout Ilfenesh Hadera chats with Ophira Eisenberg about growing up in Harlem, working with Spike Lee, and her new show on Epix, Godfather Of Harlem.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/13/ilfeneshhadera_20190829_2n8a3129_npr_mkatzif_wide-2908762e65f730ca38d62c4f8a9a5349d722ff2d.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
