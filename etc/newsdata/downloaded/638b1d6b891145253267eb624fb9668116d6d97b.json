The actor with the stage name Bernie Sanders waved his arms wildly and spoke with a passable Brooklyn timbre, but had a nicer suit and flashier tie. Joe Biden\u2019s performer broke character with his crisp diction.\n\nAnd Yang, the real one, didn\u2019t wear a tie.\n\nThe campaign pushed him outside his comfort zone. Instead of softball questions on his signature issue \u2014 a universal basic income to help society weather the brunt of job automation \u2014 Yang was pressed on Medicare for All, Chinese tariffs, mandatory gun buybacks, and Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nDespite the rules, the crowd slipped in some applause for Yang when he concluded his gun control answer. \u201cThe fact is that we all know 96 percent-plus of these shooters are boys and men. So we need to try and invest in schools that actually have a place for boys to become men, and not become dangerous to our society over time.\u201d\n\nThe debate prep session, to which POLITICO was granted exclusive media access, was just the latest example of the Yang\u2019s unconventional campaign. His novel approach has made him an internet celebrity candidate and, remarkably, propelled him to sixth place in the crowded 2020 presidential race, surpassing a host of more traditionally-credentialed politicians who do this for a living.\n\nAfter a middling performance in the first debate, Yang and his team brought in new advisers to rethink their approach for the second one in late July. Part of that was a comprehensive dry-run that included local professional performers from places like Roundabout Theatre. It was a more rigorous form of practice for the first-time candidate. The team also had Yang spend a half-hour ahead of time in a make-shift green room, turned the stage lights bright and the audience lights low, and made Yang remain standing throughout.\n\nThe campaign also instructed the audience beforehand to be hostile.\n\nYang's aides say they made a mistake before the second debate in trying to make Yang follow a more typical politician's script by delivering \u201cforced sound bites.\u201d The immersive mock session left the candidate more frustrated than aides had ever seen him.\n\n\u201cYang came in, and he\u2019s not a big yeller, but he came in ripping me and totally fired up: \u2018Y\u2019all are trying to make me a politician,'\u201d recalled one official. \u201cAnd realistically, we were, we were trying to make the dog quack like a duck.\u201d\n\nThe failed practice session led Yang and his campaign to change course and embrace a break-the-fourth-wall approach.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/7f/40/f2b649eb45bc9c3ae674d3479cd2/fall-debates.png\" true\n\n\u201cWhat that first mock made clear is we were going to be unsuccessful turning Yang into a politician,\u201d said a top aide brought in after the first debate. \u201cWe needed to let Yang be Yang. As a Washington hack that was terrifying. As a Democratic primary voter it is exhilarating.\u201d\n\nYang agrees that the intricate dress rehearsal helped him find his mojo. \u201cThe first time I saw it as a debate and the second time I saw it more as a distributed media occurrence across 10 candidates\u201d \u2014 essentially, a chance to speak directly to supporters and potential supporters watching on TV or clips online, Yang said in a brief interview after the latest debate prep.\n\nHe added that the prep sessions have helped. \u201cWhen you actually go through something that's a simulation,\" Yang said, \"it ends up honing your approach, and putting you in a position where when it's actual debate night, and you get up there, then it seems more familiar and comfortable.\u201d\n\nIn the 48 hours around the second debate, aides said Yang raised more than he had the previous month (they say they're currently on pace to double their second quarter total). He received one of the biggest polling bounces in the field, helping him to qualify for the September and October debates. His \u201cMATH\u201d hats (\u201cMake America Think Harder\u201d) are selling strong, aides say, with over 8,000 ordered since the debate.\n\nThe Yang campaign is closely holding most of their debate strategy. It\u2019s even unclear whether Yang will go sans tie again. A campaign official said they had previously discussed wearing a bow-tie to troll the people who mocked his past sartorial choices.\n\nThursday night offers Yang an opportunity to catapult himself into the upper-tier of candidates or remain relegated to low single digits. He seems confident it will be the former. And his campaign is signaling that viewers will see something they've never seen before in a presidential debate.\n\n\u201cYou know in my last answer at the last debate, I talked about how it\u2019s a reality TV show and now I understand my role in the show,\u201d Yang said after the prep session.\n\nHe then added, with some mischief: \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to become the star.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The entrepreneur brings his outside-the-box method to a well-worn political exercise.", "authors": ["Alex Thompson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2b/9a/cb06395441688329c46f451a82e1/190912-andrew-yang-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
