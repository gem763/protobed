The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the withdrawal would benefit Russia and Iran, while Senator Lindsey Graham \u2013 usually an outspoken defender of the president \u2013 warned abandoning the Kurds in the region to allow a Turkish military offensive would be \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honour\u201d.\n\nWar zone. Turkish forces are already massing near the border with north-eastern Syria as US troops withdraw. A spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the area would soon \u201cturn into a war zone\u201d.\n\nCivilian suffering.

The records remain unseen pending an appeal, but the ruling only adds to Trump\u2019s woes as the impeachment inquiry escalates. Trump is the first US president in nearly 40 years not to release his tax returns, despite promising to do so during the 2016 campaign.\n\nHate group. The rightwing \u201cnational security organization\u201d Act for America, described by civil rights advocates as an Islamophobic hate group, has scrapped plans for a $1,500-a-head gala dinner at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nFlorida ex-prisoners sue over GOP attempt to block voting rights\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A campaigner explains amendment 4 to voters in Miami before last year\u2019s public ballot. Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nA group of former prisoners in Florida are suing over Republican legislation that they say restricts their recently restored voting rights. Amendment 4, approved by Floridians at the ballot box in 2018, gave 1.4 million previously incarcerated felons in Florida the right to vote, potentially shifting the state\u2019s delicate balance of power to the Democrats. The GOP-led legislature then introduced a bill requiring ex-prisoners to pay every court fee and fine they might have faced during and after conviction, before being permitted to vote.\n\nUnconstitutional obstacle. Melba Pearson, the legal director of the ACLU Florida chapter, said the legislation meant \u201cthe ability to vote becomes based on your pocketbook, how much money you have\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s, quite frankly, wrong.\u201d\n\nCalifornia wildfire survivors set to lose housing funds\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Tubbs fire tore through Santa Rosa, California, in October 2017.

California has become the first US state to allow pharmacists to dispense HIV prevention pills to patients without a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists staged mass protests over the climate crisis in London, New York and Sydney on Monday, but have been dismissed by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, as \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d.\n\nJohnson has appealed to the US to waive diplomatic immunity for Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, who fled the UK after being accused of killing a 19-year-old motorcyclist in a traffic collision.\n\nThe FBI has said 79-year-old Samuel Little is now considered the most prolific serial killer in US history, after he confessed last year to more than 90 murders between 1970 and 2005.

In this essay from her new book, Enough, she explains why working for $15 an hour at a local grocery store turned out to be the best job she ever had.\n\nOpinion\n\nTraditionally, it is the right that has focused on filling the courts with judges, who rule on conservative lines and perpetuate Republican power. But the previously passive left is waking up to the importance of the judiciary, says Moira Donegan.\n\nThe protesters see [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh as only the most egregious symptom of a court system that is gravely diseased. Their action speaks to a growing liberal agitation around the judiciary, led by feminists, that is poised to change the politics of the courts.\n\nSport\n\nZion Williamson, the most anticipated NBA rookie in years, scored 17 points \u2013 including a series of dunks \u2013 in his first pre-season appearance for the Pelicans, helping the New Orleans team to a 133-109 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nManchester United are in the bottom half of the Premier League table after their worst start to a season for more than 30 years.
