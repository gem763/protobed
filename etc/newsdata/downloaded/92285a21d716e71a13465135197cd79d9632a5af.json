Back in 2009, the former British colony\u2019s GDP fell around 2.7 percent compared to the previous year in the wake of the global financial crisis.\n\n\u201cIt seems it will be extremely difficult for us to reach full-year economic growth of zero to one percent. I would not rule out the possibility that the full-year economic growth will be negative.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nMassive rallies, sparked by a withdrawn extradition bill, have been raging in China\u2019s self-governing territory for five months and show no sign of relenting. The city saw multiple chaotic scenes on Sunday, with violent mobs blocking roads, setting shops on fire, and hurling petrol bombs. Police deployed tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd.\n\nThe unrest took a toll on local businesses and banks, as demonstrators mainly tried to attack entities linked to mainland China. The tourism sector has been one of the worst affected, as visitor arrivals tumbled almost 50 percent in the first two weeks of October following a combined 39 percent drop in August and September.\n\nThe dual effect of the US-China trade war and civil unrest sank Hong Kong\u2019s exports, which were down seven percent in September compared to the same period last year. Imports, meanwhile, fell by more than 10 percent.\n\nNotably, Hong Kong is an internationally recognized financial hub, which attracts massive foreign investment. The ongoing unrest is likely to turn investors away, however.\n\nHong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po called on various sectors to unite, stop damaging the city\u2019s infrastructure and hurting \u201cpeople with different political views.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must reject the concept of \u2018burning together,\u2019 so that order can be restored in society as soon as possible,\u201d he wrote, referring to a popular protest slogan. \u201cIf you really love Hong Kong, our home, please set aside differences.\u201d\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "Hong Kong plunges into recession as months of violent protests take toll on economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db6d60a85f540334c28199f.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
