How Unai Emery desperately did too.\n\nA first truly significant and decisive night in his Arsenal career for the \u00a372million winger after two sublime late free-kicks dug his side out of trouble against Vitoria Guimaraes and spared his Spanish manager another serious inquisition.\n\nEmery has been forced to continually defend the club's record signing following his slow start to life in England that until Thursday night had only yielded one goal from the penalty spot against Aston Villa.\n\nNicolas Pepe scored two stunning late free-kicks as Arsenal came from behind to beat Vitoria 3-2 at the Emirates\n\nPepe scored his first free-kick from 25 yards on 80 minutes to make it 2-2 and seemingly rescue a point for the Gunners\n\nThe winger then capped an incredible cameo performance with another brilliant free-kick to give Arsenal all three points\n\nMATCH FACTS ARSENAL (4-2-3-1): Martinez 6; Bellerin 6, Mustafi 6, Holding 6, Tierney 7.5; Torreira 6.5, Willock 5 (Ceballos 46, 7); Maitland-Niles 4 (Guendouzi 46, 7.5), Smith-Rowe 6.5, Martinelli 6; Lacazette 6 (Pepe 75) Subs not used: Leno, Chambers, Kolasinac, Saka Goals: Martinelli 32, Pepe 80, 90+2 Booked: Mustafi, Lacazette Manager: Unai Emery 7.5 VITORIA GUIMARAES (4-3-3): Silva 6; Garcia 7.5, Venancio 6, Tapsoba 7.5, Hanin 6; Almeida 7.5 (Pepe 64, 6), Agu 6, Poha 6; Edwards 7.5 (Pereira 71), Duarte 6, Davidson 8 (Rochinha 87). Subs not used: Douglas, Henrique, Bonatini, Al Musrati Goals: Edwards 8, Duarte 36 Booked: Victor Garcia, Poha, Tapsoba Manager: Ivo Vieira 7 Referee: Serdar Gozubuyuk 7\n\nPatience was all that was required Emery had maintained. Arsenal's supporters certainly had to wait for his dramatic intervention.\n\nPepe, who came on with 15 minutes to go, repaid his manager in stunning style with a late equaliser and even later winner after coming off the bench to turn embarrassing defeat into dramatic victory for the Gunners.\n\nHe might have missed a sitter from six yards against Sheffield United but give him a free-kick outside the box and Pepe is deadly.\n\nAnd this could well be the long-awaited lift-off moment for his Arsenal career.\n\nEmery said: 'To score two set-pieces is perfect. He was trying a lot of set-pieces in training last week and I expected him to shoot.\n\n'Every player needs time for their adaptation. He is a very good player and we believe in him totally. He is improving and those two goals are really important for us first and also for him. We are very happy for him.'\n\nIvory Coast winger Pepe's goals got Arsenal out of jail at the Emirates and earned them a third successive Group F win.\n\nThey also papered over the cracks of a second successive underwhelming display, following Monday's 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United.\n\nIn the immediate euphoria of victory, especially in the circumstances it was secured and given the identity of the match-winner, that may have briefly have been forgotten.\n\nBut the problems Arsenal had against Portugal's fourth best side and one who arrived at the Emirates pointless were concerning.\n\nFormer Tottenham wonderkid Marcus Edwards put Vitoria in front with a wonderful turn and finish on eight minutes\n\nEdwards celebrated by sprinting over to the touchline and sliding on his knees in front of the home supporters\n\nArsenal responded through Brazilian teenager Gabriel Martinelli's 32nd minute strike but were behind again shortly after\n\nThat they took so long to match the fight and defiance their manager showed as he defended his methods in his pre-match press conference was also a worry when the occasion required an emphatic response.\n\nEmery said: 'That result is very important for us because the priority is to finish first in the group. We deserved to win but we didn't play well.'\n\nFor a long time, as Arsenal toiled so badly against Vitoria, Emery might have been regretting omitting Ozil from his squad for a fifth game running.\n\nHis absence might explain his cryptic 'you make me laugh' tweet on the eve of the game though he at least wished his team-mates good luck as he revealed he trained with Gunners legend Robert Pires in another timely social media post just before kick-off that reminded everyone he is still around.\n\nAsked if \u00a3350,000-a-week Ozil has a future at the Emirates, Emery said: 'Tonight is not the night to speak about him. He is not in the squad and that is the decision and now we are going to work for Sunday.'\n\nArsenal's defending and lack of control was a further problem along with their creativity and Vitoria exploited the hosts' nervousness, sloppiness and how open they were in midfield.\n\nFormer Spurs winger Marcus Edward's return to north London could hardly have started any better after he fired Vitoria into an eighth-minute lead.\n\nBruno duarte da Silva put Vitoria in front for a second time on the night with his strike on 36 minutes to silence the Emirates\n\nEmery cut a nervous figure before Pepe's late heroics rescued his side and gave him a much needed three points\n\nEdwards traded passes with Victor Garcia, collected the return in the box, sent Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin the wrong way when he chopped onto his right foot and fired the opener through Martinez's legs.\n\nFrom their first spell of genuine pressure Arsenal equalised when they pinned Vitoria back for a period and Tierney eventually crossed for Gabriel Martinelli to head in his fifth goal in three cup appearances.\n\nBut they were level for just five minutes as Ainsley Maitland-Niles was dispossessed after a poor touch, the impressive Davidson pounced, strode forward and hit the post before Bruno Duarte smashed in the rebound.\n\nEmery's half-time double change that saw Matteo Guendouzi and Dani Ceballos come on for Joe Willock and Maitland-Niles was a clear statement of what he thought of Arsenal's first-half display and also one of intent that gave Arsenal greater control in midfield.\n\nTheir arrival lifted the crowd too but it was the Pepe inspired-finale that lifted the roof off the Emirates.\n\nWith just 10 minutes left Pepe bent his first free-kick past Miguel Silva after Lucas Torreira was brought down.\n\nHe then repeated the trick with an even better effort bent into the top corner from the last kick of the game after Guendouzi was fouled 25 yards out.", "description": "ADRIAN KAJUMBA AT THE EMIRATES: Two stunning late free-kicks from Nicolas Pepe saw Arsenal come from behind to beat Vitoria 3-2 in the Europa League on Thursday night.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/23/20156628-0-image-a-8_1571954674072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
