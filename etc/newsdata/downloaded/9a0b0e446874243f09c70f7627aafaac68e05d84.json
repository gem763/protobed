Jason was 38 years old and had always been fit and healthy.\n\nHe had two young children and a successful job as the manager of a large manufacturing company.\n\nHe was in the prime of life, splitting his time between his job in Germany and his home in the UK.\n\nBut his health deteriorated rapidly and, within months, he was insulin-dependant.\n\nJason had private healthcare via his job and had been sent for several tests in Germany.\n\nOne of these was a blood test that came back with a diagnosis of a genetic condition called haemochromatosis.\n\nThe UK and Ireland are a hotspot for the condition haemochromatosis \u2013 so much so that it\u2019s also known as the \u2018Celtic curse\u2019.\n\n\u2018My first thought was, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit of a mouthful,\u201d\u2019 says Jenny.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d never heard of it before, and no one in the family had ever been diagnosed with it.'\n\n'But I was surprised to discover how common it is, and that people are dying of it, yet many doctors in the UK don\u2019t seem to know about it at all.\u2019\n\nHaemochromatosis is a hereditary genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food.\n\nThat iron then builds up to toxic levels, damaging organs, joints and soft tissues.\n\nIf it\u2019s left untreated, it can cause diabetes, arthritis , liver cirrhosis and failure, heart failure and several cancers.\n\nAlthough it was once thought of as a rare condition, the latest research estimates that one in 200 Brits suffers from the condition, but only one in 5,000 is diagnosed.\n\n\u2018Awful things began to fall into place as I read about the effect it has on the body,\u2019 says Jenny.\n\n\u2018My mother, sister and uncle had all died from liver failure \u2013 none of them had been a heavy drinker and the cause had never been determined.'\n\n'I\u2019m now sure they died of the condition.\u2019\n\nJason\u2019s consultant advised Jenny and other family members to go straight to their GP for a blood test to check their level of ferritin \u2013 the blood-cell protein that carries iron around the body.\n\nHaemochromatosis is still widely underdiagnosed, partly because of a lack of awareness in some areas of the medical profession.\n\nSymptoms such as joint pain, fatigue, weakness and irregular periods can easily be put down to other conditions, and as a result many sufferers can go for years without being diagnosed and treated.\n\nA lucky diagnosis\n\nJenny was fortunate.\n\n\u2018The doctor I saw had an intern with him, and they were intrigued when I told them about Jason\u2019s diagnosis.'\n\n'He said, \u201cGosh, that\u2019s different \u2013 I\u2019m going to follow it up and talk to my colleagues.\u201d\n\n'I just thank God it was him I was booked in to see that day, because my cousin went for a test and his doctor told him not to worry, saying haemochromatosis was something that affected only people who drank too much \u2013 it was ridiculous.\u2019\n\nA test confirmed that both Jenny and her daughter Helen, then 33, had the condition.\n\nAs Helen was pregnant, her treatment was put on hold, but Jenny and Jason were referred to their local haematology units right away.\n\nHealthy ferritin levels are below 300 ng/mL (nanograms per millilitre of blood) for men, and below 150 ng/mL for women.\n\nJenny\u2019s levels were sky-high, at 2,000 ng/mL, and Jason\u2019s were over 3,000 ng/mL.\n\nThe treatment for haemochromatosis is very similar to donating blood: a procedure called a venesection removes a pint of blood at a time through a thick needle.\n\nThis contains 200mg of iron and forces the body to use stored iron to build new red blood cells.\n\nJenny began to have a venesection every fortnight, while Jason needed one every week.\n\nAlthough they were being treated in different hospitals miles apart \u2013 Jason in Warwick and Jenny in Bristol \u2013 it was a comfort to her to know they were going through the same thing.\n\n\u2018It was quite invasive and difficult to fit round my job working with people with disabilities, but I was amazed by how much less tired I felt after a few sessions,\u2019 says Jenny.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d been on awful arthritis tablets for years, but was able to give them up as my symptoms improved.\u2019\n\nAlthough Jenny began to feel better, things got worse for Jason.\n\nOn a work trip to China, he picked up a food-borne strain of hepatitis and became gravely ill.\n\nFour and half years after his diagnosis, his liver began to fail.\n\nAlthough he was put on the list to receive a transplant, doctors advised he would be unlikely to receive a match because of his size \u2013 he was unusually tall, at 6ft 5in \u2013 and also had a rare blood type.\n\nAt 43 years old, Jason was hospitalised.\n\n\u2018It was extremely difficult at the end,\u2019 recalls Jenny.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018He just didn\u2019t want to be in hospital and kept trying to leave to go back to work, but he was very ill by that point.'\n\n'In fact, the nurses had a problem keeping him there, so in the end they sedated him.'\n\n'They said it\u2019d help his organs repair and they\u2019d be able to work on him without him knowing.'\n\n'It seemed like the best thing, but it was very, very hard.\u2019\n\nFor eight weeks, Jenny sat by her son\u2019s bedside as he lay unconscious.\n\nShe tried to stay strong for his children, who were 12 and 16 at the time.\n\nUnfortunately, Jason\u2019s condition didn\u2019t improve and no donor was found.\n\nDoctors decided to bring him round so his family could say goodbye.\n\n\u2018He couldn\u2019t talk because of the breathing tubes in his mouth, but he maintained his sense of humour right to the end, smiling when the nurses made jokes,\u2019 she says.\n\nFour days later, Jason died peacefully, with his family around him.\n\nHis death certificate gives haemochromatosis as the primary cause.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t expect to lose a child,\u2019 says Jenny.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the bit that was so devastating \u2013 it\u2019s the wrong order of things.\n\n'He was my boy and it was shattering.\n\n'People ask me how I cope, but you just wake up every day and get out of bed because you have to.\n\n'As the mum and the oldest member of the family, you just have to stay strong for everybody.\u2019\n\nAn avoidable death\n\nThis year, the family should have been celebrating Jason\u2019s 50th birthday.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ll be visiting his grave.\n\nJenny and Helen now have venesections every 12 weeks and will need to continue with this treatment forever.\n\nIf they continue to lead a healthy lifestyle, there\u2019s nothing to stop them living a long life despite having haemochromatosis \u2013 a fact that makes it even tougher for Jenny to accept Jason\u2019s death.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s devastating to think that a simple blood test could have saved Jason\u2019s life,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018In France, where rates of the condition are much lower than in the UK, babies are tested at birth, meaning many sufferers are spared the horrible complications by having early treatment.\u2019\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nJenny continues, \u2018People have blood tests every day, and it would be easy to check for haemochromatosis at the same time.'\n\n'A specialist told me that checking ferritin levels would only cost an extra 50p.'\n\n'When you think of the price of years of arthritis or diabetes medication, or cancer and heart-failure treatment, that is nothing \u2013 it\u2019s criminal not to test people.\u2019\n\nThese days, Jenny campaigns to raise awareness of the condition she believes has killed many members of her family.\n\nSlowly but surely, awareness is growing.\n\nIn July, MPs debated ways to tackle the issue of significant under-diagnosis of haemochromatosis and new research has recently been funded.\n\nShe\u2019s pleased about that.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m on a mission to get doctors to wake up,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018Helen and I are so aware that, in death, Jason gave us life, because we may not have known about our own condition until it was too late.'\n\n'Nothing will bring back my son, but I hope his death won\u2019t be for nothing.\u2019\n\n- For more about haemochromatosis, or to donate, go to
