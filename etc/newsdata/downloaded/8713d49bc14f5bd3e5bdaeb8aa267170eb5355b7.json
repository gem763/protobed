In Turkey, for example, petrol and diesel prices jumped significantly, on news of delayed deliveries.\n\nThe attacks also showed what security experts have described as alarming new precision military capabilities by Iran and its allies in the region, potentially changing the strategic calculations in the volatile Middle East.\n\nThe US has long been committed to protecting world energy supplies and markets. The Trump administration is also closely allied with the Saudi royal circle.\n\nWashington\u2019s decision last year to pull out of the nuclear deal and impose crippling sanctions on Iran sparked the months-long crisis in the Gulf, with Iran vowing to exact a cost from the US and its allies for what it has described as economic warfare against the country.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It remains unclear what effects the latest sanctions would have since Iran is already largely cut off from conventional commercial channels.\n\n\u201cI have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!\u201d he wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nAlthough top US officials have accused Iran of being behind the attack, Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the pinpoint targeting of the facility as a part of their four-and-a-half-year war against Saudi Arabia.\n\nKey Washington hawks in and out of government have demanded airstrikes on Iranian targets. But Iran has warned it would respond militarily to any attack.\n\n\u201cWe are fully prepared to act against any moves attacking our country or the interests of the Islamic Republic, and will respond to possible mischief in such a decisive and comprehensive manner that will be a big surprise for the aggressors,\u201d Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, was quoted as saying by the Mehr news agency.\n\nVeto-wielding UN Security Council members Russia and China, along with the European Union, have called for restraint on all sides, with Moscow urging the US not to make any \u201chasty conclusions\u201d about the attack.\n\nEvidence presented so far by the US has shown unexpected sophistication but failed to prove the contention that the attacks originated in Iran or from bases of Iranian-backed armed groups in Iraq. Saudi television said a defence official would present evidence later specifying Iran\u2019s role in the attack and detailing weapons used in the attacks.\n\nRiyadh on Wednesday displayed remnants of drones and missiles, which it said were produced in Iran in 2019, that it said were used in the weekend attacks on its oil facilities.\n\nDefence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles were used in addition to cruise missiles. \u201cThe attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich desert kingdom, has been scrambling to build international support. On Wednesday he telephoned Russian president Vladimir Putin, who \u201ccalled for a thorough and objective investigation of the events\u201d, according to a Kremlin announcement.\n\n\u201cWhat happened represents a real test of the international will to confront acts of sabotage that threaten international security and stability,\u201d Prince Mohammed was quoted as saying during a conversation with South Korean president Moon Jae-in.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, Mr Rouhani, Iran\u2019s president, urged Saudi Arabia to end its war in Yemen, which has been described as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.\n\n\u201cThey struck a certain point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not strike a hospital. They did not strike a school. They did not strike a market. They attacked an industrial centre in order to warn you. Learn from this warning and think about ending the war in the region.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials who have traditionally sided with the US on crucial security matters appeared in no mood to sign on to any action against Iran, and have voiced alarm about the prospects of armed conflict.\n\n\u201cIt is very close to war,\u201d Norbert Roettgen, chair of the German parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, said in a televised interview. \u201cHowever, neither Iran nor the United States or Saudi Arabia are interested in a war.\u201d\n\nNato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned earlier this week about \u201cthe danger of an escalation\u201d, and urged all parties to avoid attacks even as he accused Iran of being \u201cresponsible for the destabilisation of the entire region\u201d.", "description": "US president Donald Trump\u00a0on Wednesday said he would impose fresh sanctions on Iran over the devastating 14 September attack on one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s key oil facilities.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/16/Trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
