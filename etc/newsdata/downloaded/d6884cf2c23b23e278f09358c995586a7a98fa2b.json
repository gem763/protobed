While the bullish price action has decisively ended, with BTC falling back to $8,100 as of the time of writing this, indicators abound have shown that cryptocurrencies may continue to recover in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe most notable of these is Santiment\u2019s social volume indicator, which tracks social media mentions of Bitcoin over time.\n\nIn a tweet published Tuesday, the cryptocurrency data provider pointed out that social volume for the leading cryptocurrency \u201c[has] continu[ed] its quiet decline after hitting a recent two-year low.\u201d Indeed, BitInfo recently noted that the use of the \u201cBitcoin\u201d hashtag fell to a three-year low after peaking earlier this year during the pseudo-bull run in May/June.\n\nWhile many see this as a sign that Bitcoin will only fall further, even further than 40% from the year-to-date top of $14,000, Santiment argues that this can be interpreted as bullish. They wrote that historically, \u201clow social volume has preceded large price upswings and bull runs, and high social volume has been [a] fairly reliable top indicator.\u201d\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC's social volume continues its quiet decline after hitting its recent 2-year low. Historically, low social volume has preceded large price upswings and bull runs, and high social volume has been fairly reliable as a top indicator. https://t.co/4kl8hsb9Pk pic.twitter.com/z84qpJpk79 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 8, 2019\n\nWhile Santiment\u2019s social indicators have clear historical precedence in their implications, is their other evidence, in terms of technicals and fundamentals, to back the idea that the Bitcoin price may soon surge higher?\n\nInterestingly, there are.\n\nBitcoin Price Ready to Mount Higher\n\nAnalyst Chonis recently pointed out to his followers that Bitcoin\u2019s one-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) \u2014 a lagging trend indicator that some analysts say is a good way to decipher market directionality \u2014 has \u201cpoked its head above zero for the first time in almost three weeks.\u201d\n\n$BTC \u2013 MACD poking its head above the ZERO line for the first time in almost 3 weeks, with a bull cross on very low indicators compared to where they were the last time red to green flipped. pic.twitter.com/5Py7wOD4NT \u2014 Big Chonis\u2694\ufe0fFlux Trading Group\ud83d\ude80 (@BigChonis) October 9, 2019\n\nThe one-day MACD is of historical significance. Per previous reports from NewsBTC, Bitcoin rallied by 52% to 61% in the weeks after the MACD trended green in two cases earlier this year.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only positive sign. Financial Survivalism noted that Bitcoin\u2019s chart from the last week of September until now is eerily reminiscent of the textbook Wyckoff Accumulation pattern that technical analysis legend Richard Wyckoff identified in his studies. Survivalism argued that if \u201cthis current pullback (referencing the fall from $8,350 to $8,100) creates a higher low above $8,000, then I would consider [the Wyckoff Accumulation] confirmed\u201d.\n\nShould this bullish pattern play out in full, Survivalism suggests that Bitcoin will return above $10,000 in around a week\u2019s time.\n\n1. Starting to look a lot like Wyckoff Accumulation. If this current pullback creates a higher low above $8,000 then I would consider it confirmed. 2.

While it has been made clear that this isn\u2019t quantitative easing, many in the cryptocurrency industry say that this tacit money printing is decisively bullish for Bitcoin \u2014 a money that is deflationary (disinflationary for now), non-sovereign, public, decentralized, and so on and so forth.\n\nAs Anthony Pompliano would say, it\u2019s Bitcoin rocket fuel.
