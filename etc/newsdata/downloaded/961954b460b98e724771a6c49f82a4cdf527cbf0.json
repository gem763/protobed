I'd say 20 minutes before they scored the goal you can see we stopped playing passes in behind, and I always say when we stop doing that it puts more pressure on us as a team.'\n\nRashford added: 'This club, we play attacking football and as soon as we take our foot off the gas a little bit it's difficult to defend against top players for large spells like we had to towards the end of the game.\n\n'So, I think we've just got to be more positive - at 1-0 or 2-0 up, we need to be more positive.'\n\nThe England international leaps up to smash home to give the Red Devils a shock 1-0 lead\n\nBut Adam Lallana ensured Liverpool remained unbeaten after netting an 85th minute leveller\n\nThe return of Anthony Martial, Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard will surely help that positive mindset, although Daniel James worked well with Rashford on Sunday and linked up together for the opener.\n\n'We had a bit of eye contact before,' Rashford told MUTV.\n\n'These are the fine margins we're working with, so probably without looking at each other and getting that little connection we wouldn't have got the goal.\n\n'Instead, you'd miss which has happened a lot in the past. So yeah, it was a good goal, but we definitely want more.'", "description": "United rallied impressively and came out fighting against reigning European champions Liverpool, with Rashford putting the hosts ahead on an afternoon when they would fall just short.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19988668-0-image-a-97_1571658985310.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
