Now Turkey is looking elsewhere for new fighters, all while rebuffing calls from former allies in the West to end its invasion of northern Syria.\n\n\u201cOffers are coming in,\u201d embattled Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, according to broadcaster NTV.\n\nBut those offers might not include a radar-evading plane in the class of the F-35. There are just two stealth fighters besides the F-35 that are in production and in theory even are available for export. The Russian Su-57 and the Chinese J-20.\n\nBut Chinese officials apparently are not keen to ship the J-20 beyond China\u2019s borders, much in the same way U.S. lawmakers passed a law barring the export of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F-22.\n\nIn 2014, Song Zhongping, a former officer in Beijing\u2019s strategic missile force, told a Chinese T.V. program that Beijing had banned any export of the J-20 \u201cin order to keep J-20\u2019s fifth-generation technology out of hostile hands.\u201d\n\nChinese firm Shenyang is developing, as a purely commercial venture with little or no government support, the lightweight FC-31 stealth fighter as a potential export commodity. But progress has been slow. It\u2019s unlikely that Shenyang is taking orders for the plane.\n\nThat leaves the Su-57, Russia\u2019s own answer to the F-22. Russian president Vladimir Putin in August 2019 showed Erdogan around Russia\u2019s MAKS air show. The two leaders inspected a Su-57. \"So now, we are going to buy this one?\" Erdogan asked Putin.\n\n\"You could,\" Putin replied.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "No F-35s or Su-57s?
