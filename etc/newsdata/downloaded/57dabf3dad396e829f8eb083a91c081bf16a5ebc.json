Instead, it is fueling tensions among white and black people.\n\nThe monument, which is set to be unveiled in late September near a courthouse in downtown Helena, marks the centennial of what has become known as the Elaine Massacre. In late September and early October 1919, white posses who believed black sharecroppers were organizing a revolt killed more than 100 African-Americans\u2014and some historians have said it could have been many hundreds.\n\nSome Arkansas residents are angry about the monument\u2019s location in the Phillips County community where white leaders planned the attacks, rather than about 25 miles southwest in Elaine, near where the violence erupted. Helena, they say, is co-opting a bloody history it long suppressed to promote tourism, harming smaller Elaine a second time.\n\n\u201cThis is white folks using white privilege to demonstrate a 21st-century version of polite white supremacy, \u201d said Arkansas Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, an African-American leader and pastor.\n\nTensions over the memorial are part of a broader debate taking place nationwide, as communities consider erecting new markers to long-ignored events such as race riots and lynchings.\n\nThe Elaine Massacre was the bloodiest incident of the \u201cRed Summer\u201d of 1919, when antiblack riots, lynchings and other violence swept the nation. Events are planned throughout the U.S. this year to mark the centennial.\n\nFederal troops escorting African-Americans to the schoolhouse in Elaine, Ark., in 1919.

Generations of his family lived in Phillips County, and they still own land in the area.\n\nPhillips County, once a cotton-producing powerhouse on the Mississippi River, had a population of about 18,000 people in 2018, a 17% drop from 2010, according to the census. About 62% of the county is black, and about 36% is white.\n\nThe Rev. Mary Olson, who is white and president of the Elaine Legacy Center, said her group and Elaine residents weren\u2019t consulted and want a memorial there. The group, made up of blacks and whites, is considering possible legal action, she said. Her group plans to hold an event in Elaine at the same time the other group holds its event in Helena, she said.\n\nThe legacy center planted a weeping willow tree in Elaine in April honoring those who died during the 1919 massacre, but someone recently cut the tree down, Rev. Olson said. State officials are investigating, she said.\n\nThe Helena memorial idea arose in 2013, when Mr. Solomon heard of the massacre from a friend, J. Chester Johnson, 74, a white writer who grew up near Phillips County, Mr. Solomon said. Both men believe they had relatives who were involved in the violence or supported it, and they said they hope a monument would help the community start to heal.\n\nThen-Arkansas Gov.

One early idea was displaying representations of dead bodies, Brian Miller, an African-American U.S. district judge who served on the group, told a gathering last year.\n\nAfter many discussions, the group decided on something simple \u201cthat will appropriately memorialize our fallen,\u201d Judge Miller said. The memorial bears the words: \u201cDedicated to those known and unknown who lost their lives in the 1919 massacre,\u201d along with a biblical quote urging unity.\n\n\u201cWe are uncovering a wound that never healed,\u201d said Sheila Walker, 71, of Wilmington, Del., an African-American who backs the monument in Helena and who says two of her relatives were shot by white people in the attacks.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think is the best way to commemorate this and other moments of racial violence in the country\u2019s past? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn the fall of 1919, black sharecroppers and a group of white people opened fire on each other in a remote area near Elaine. Afterward, white people organized posses and brought in groups of soldiers, which committed \u201chelter-skelter killing\u201d throughout the county, according to Robert Whitaker, author of \u201cOn the Laps of Gods,\u201d a book about the event. No official investigation ever took place, he said.\n\nWhite mobs rounded up hundreds of black people, and all-white juries convicted many after brief trials. Lawyers for 12 men sentenced to death argued up to the U.S. Supreme Court that the men weren\u2019t given fair trials. In 1923, the Supreme Court agreed, and the ruling set a precedent for defendants\u2019 rights in state trials.\n\nMr. Johnson, the writer who helped develop the Helena monument, said he is thrilled that the important event is finally getting a public marker and isn\u2019t bothered by the complaints.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad for people to disagree about this memorial,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it starts the discussion.\u201d\n\nWrite to Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com", "description": "A memorial was meant to help a rural Arkansas community heal longstanding wounds from one of the bloodiest episodes of racial violence in U.S. history.
