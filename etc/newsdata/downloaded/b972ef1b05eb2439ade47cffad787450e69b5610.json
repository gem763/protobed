Under Israeli law, he could serve as long as legal proceedings and appeals are ongoing.\n\nNetanyahu's supporters in the legislature have said they would support granting him parliamentary immunity from prosecution, but it is unclear whether enough legislatures would back such a move.\n\nHowever, if convicted in a trial, Netanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine for bribery charges alone, while fraud and breach of trust carry a prison sentence of up to three years.", "description": "Lawyers begin arguments in series of hearings as the Israeli leader faces possible indictments in corruption cases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/0092621de9414cbe8e35c8491b97e5f6_18.jpg"}
