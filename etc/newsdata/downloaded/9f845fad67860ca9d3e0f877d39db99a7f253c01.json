Demand for image sensors is expected to grow further as high-spec smartphones equipped with multiple lenses are getting more popular,\u201d Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo, told AFP before the results were announced.\n\nThe Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday that Sony plans to build a new image sensor plant in southern Nagasaki prefecture.\n\nSony currently operates four image sensor plants in Japan and is looking to increase production capacity by March 2021.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re considering the plan\u201d to build a new plant in Japan, Sony spokesman Takashi Iida told AFP, but said nothing had been decided yet.\n\nLast week, the CEO of US hedge fund Third Point, which holds a key stake in the Japanese conglomerate, reportedly expressed frustration at its rejection of a proposal to spin off its semiconductor operations including image sensors.\n\nSales for Sony\u2019s music business also rose, the firm said Wednesday, helped by its integration of EMI Music Publishing and an increase in streaming revenues.\n\nSony\u2019s half-year sales dipped 2.1 percent to 4.04 trillion yen while operating profit jumped 17.3 percent to 510 billion yen.\n\nSony has spent years struggling to recover from deep financial trouble, a process that entailed aggressive restructuring, the loss of thousands of jobs and the sale of business units and assets.\n\nIt has seen a slowdown in its games and network businesses, and has said it expects revenue from the core sector to sag owing to a continued fall in game hardware sales, and the cost of developing a next-generation console.\n\nIn the six-month period, the company posted a drop in sales for the sector, citing a decline in both software and PlayStation 4 hardware sales.\n\n\u201cSales of PS4 consoles, which had spearheaded the company\u2019s recovery, are slowing down further as users\u2019 interest is now shifting to PS5,\u201d Yasuda said.\n\n\u201cSales of its electronics products remain weak due to tough competition in the global market,\u201d he added.\n\nThe firm said earlier this month its next-generation PlayStation 5 console, which will be equipped with new immersive features, would launch for the 2020 holiday season.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Japan\u2019s Sony said Wednesday half-year net profit fell nearly 15 percent but it upgraded its annual forecast on solid growth in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/c9c6a9_sony-has-slowdown-in-its-games-network-businesses-expects-revenue-in-core-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
