He does not lack confidence either, having cited Sweden great Zlatan Ibrahimovic as his inspiration. \u200b\n\nKlopp, fully aware of the threat of a Salzburg team who have scored 40 goals in nine league matches this season, was unequivocal when asked if he had a plan to stop the forward.\u200b\n\nJurgen Klopp, left, in his Mainz days with Zeljko Buvac - RB Salzburg remind him tactically of the system he used in his first head coach's job Credit: Andreas Rentz/Bongarts/Getty Images\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cAnd you will have to watch the game to see. He is a wonderful player: very young, very confident, very quick. He looks clear minded and focused on the pitch.\u200b\n\n\u201cHe looks a decent player and is in the perfect place at the moment. I hope he can play as long as possible. He is not the only threat for us, unfortunately, but he is a proper one.\u201d \u200b\n\nStory continues\n\nKlopp is an admirer of Salzburg\u2019s style, developed in part under the watch of experienced German coach Ralf Rangnick, employed by Red Bull as head of sport and development at the four football clubs it owns across the world.\u200b\n\nJesse Marsch, Salzburg\u2019s head coach, employs an attack-minded style that reminds Klopp of his own approach when he started out in management at Mainz in 2001.\u200b\n\n\u201cIt is really difficult for me to explain it in your language, but they remind me of what I did years ago at Mainz,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt is a clear 4-4-2 and you made life pretty uncomfortable for each opponent. With the system they play, the football they play, it is possible to cause each team in the world problems.\u200b\n\n\u201cI could talk for two hours on what they do well, but what is really important is that they have never played us. I hope that what they think about when they go to bed tonight is that it is Anfield and it is us.\u201d", "description": "Erling Haaland\u2019s threat to Liverpool\u2019s Champions League ambitions is significant enough that J\u00fcrgen Klopp is being cautious about revealing exactly how he plans to counter it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDnB0hm5OU9OtQVRL25HNQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xsKGW8dAQRvX01B9W6dHPQ--~B/aD0xMTMyO3c9MTgxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/cef9b13da7644b1ff9cd2dbb96681c6b"}
