Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the poll finds.\n\nAD\n\nWere they running against each other in a U.S. Senate race held today, Hogan would hold a lead over Van Hollen, who was elected to the Senate in 2016.\n\nThe poll, conducted by The Post and the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, found that Maryland adults back Hogan over Van Hollen, 51 percent to 41 percent. Among registered voters, Hogan tops Van Hollen by an eight-point margin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a measure of popularity,\u201d said Michael Hanmer, a government and politics professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cHogan\u2019s approval is still high, even among Democrats. \u2026 He\u2019s been in the news more \u2026 than Van Hollen. He\u2019s on people\u2019s minds more, they\u2019re seeing him more.\u201d\n\nMaryland has not elected a Republican senator since Charles McCurdy \u201cMac\u201d Mathias Jr., who retired in 1987. The state has reliably backed Democrats in national presidential elections since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992.\n\nYet Catherine Smith, a Democrat who lives in Capitol Heights, said she would opt for Hogan over Van Hollen in a potential matchup because she admires Hogan\u2019s job performance, especially how he battled cancer while in office during his first term.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes you can\u2019t go with your party just because it is your party,\u201d said Smith, 68, who runs a small day-care business. \u201cRight now, Chris Van Hollen hasn\u2019t impressed me all that much. To get my vote, you have to do a little bit more.\u201d\n\nSmith said she liked that Hogan has vocally criticized President Trump and wishes the governor would have challenged him in the 2020 primary \u2014 although she said she wasn\u2019t yet sure that Hogan would have had her vote in the presidential general election.\n\nLast year, Hogan told The Washington Post he is not interested in being one of hundreds of lawmakers in Congress. At the same time, he has continued to raise his national profile through his work as chairman of the National Governors Association and has increasingly weighed in through national media on matters in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast week, he joined a minority of Republicans in backing the impeachment inquiry into Trump, saying \u201cI don\u2019t see any other way to get to the facts.\u201d\n\nHogan\u2019s support among registered Republicans now stands at 80 percent, down from over 90 percent in mid-2018, the poll finds. The dip follows his flirtation with a primary challenge to President Trump and more outspoken criticism about polarization in Washington.\n\nThat\u2019s why Les Solomon, a Trump-supporting conservative who grew up in Baltimore County, said she has soured on Hogan. Solomon, a retired small business owner, said she was a strong backer of Hogan when he created the advocacy group \u201cChange Maryland,\u201d which fueled his underdog gubernatorial campaign in 2014. She has supported some of his decisions, like lowering tolls on the Bay Bridge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Solomon said Hogan\u2019s repeated criticisms of Trump, including most recently his support for launching an impeachment inquiry, have disappointed her.\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d said Solomon, 67, of Owings Mills. \u201cI am really mad at him. But I would always choose a Republican over a Democrat.\u201d\n\nHanmer, the political scientist, said party loyalty might affect any real-life matchup once Democratic voters consider sending a Republican to the U.S. Senate could alter the balance of power in national politics.\n\nGary Wilson, a lifelong Democrat from Gaithersburg, scoffed at the idea of voting for the governor over Van Hollen in a potential race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat. I don\u2019t vote for Republicans,\u201d he said, though he conceded that he did vote for Ronald Reagan decades ago. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Hogan does \u2014 I vote for the Democrat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilson, 64, said that party loyalty aside, he also respects Van Hollen, who represented the congressional district where Wilson lives before running for Senate. Wilson described Van Hollen as a rare breed of elected official who is both \u201cvery political and very ethical.\u201d\n\nHogan still has three years remaining in his term and has not publicly said what he intends to do after leaving office. In addition to two political groups he formed to raise millions to advance his agenda in the state, Hogan also has a political action committee called An America United. That group is billed as a way to \u201cbreak partisan gridlock\u201d nationally and bring \u201call Americans\u201d together.\n\nFor now, the poll finds 61 percent of registered voters in Maryland say Hogan has accomplished \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d during his tenure. That percentage is significantly higher than the governor\u2019s two most recent predecessors; fewer than half said the same about Martin O\u2019Malley (D) and Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) as favorably during their respective second terms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis Washington Post-University of Maryland poll was conducted Oct. 9-14 among a random sample of 860 Maryland adults, 60 percent reached on cellphones and 40 percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for both the overall sample and the sample of 819 registered voters.", "description": "Poll finds a narrow majority of Marylanders say they would back the governor over the incumbent, Democrat Sen.
