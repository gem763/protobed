Article I, Section 2 grants \u201cthe sole Power of Impeachment\u201d to the House of Representatives and Article I, Section 5 sets out that \u201cEach House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\u201d These aren\u2019t suggestions, these are the supreme law of the land. And that law comports with the intent of the framers. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist No. 69, \u201cThe President of the United States would be liable to be impeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law,\u201d in direct contrast to \u201cthe king of Great Britain,\u201d for whom \u201cthere is no constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national revolution.\u201d Once freed from the executive tyranny they had rebelled against, the founders were determined not to install another king but to create a chief executive who would bring energy to the administration of laws but remain accountable, as the Constitution commands, to Congress for any serious misconduct in office.\n\nThe founders regarded impeachment as indispensable for addressing presidential misconduct: \u201cShall any man be above Justice?\u201d asked George Mason during one debate at the Constitutional Convention, and \u201cAbove all shall that man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?\u201d Further, he queried, \u201cShall the man who has practised corruption & by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment?\u201d James Madison expressed concerned that a president might \u201cpervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression\u201d or \u201cbetray his trust to foreign leaders.\u201d Edmund Randolph, then Virginia\u2019s governor, worried that \u201cThe executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power; particularly in time of war when military force, and in some respects the public money will be in his hands.\u201d William Davie, a North Carolina delegate, warned that \u201cIf he be not impeachable whilst in office, he will spare no effort or means whatever to get himself re-elected.\u201d These aren\u2019t the words of people intending to create an unaccountable chief executive, and their observations all mirror the questions currently facing Congress.\n\nWith its sole impeachment power and authority to determine its own rules, the House, not the president, decides which procedures to follow in opening and conducting impeachment inquiries. While attacking the process as unfair makes political sense for the president, there is no legal basis for this argument. The Constitution doesn\u2019t give Trump, or any president, say over whether and how the House should impeach. Nowhere does the Constitution require a process that would further vest the House\u2019s Republican minority with the subpoena power that Cipollone\u2019s letter demands, nor bind the Democratic majority by precedent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd it is astounding that the letter does not acknowledge two unanimous Supreme Court decisions that are on point: In the first, U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court in 1974 ordered President Richard M. Nixon to comply with a judicial subpoena to turn over taped conversations to the Court, affirming the principle that no one, even the president, is above the law. When Justice Department lawyers argued in federal district court this week that the case may have been wrongly decided, the judge gasped, \u201cWow, okay,\u201d and described their argument as \u201cextreme.\u201d She understood the implications of the government\u2019s position \u2014 that the president should be entitled to keep confidential any communications produced for the White House, even if such evidence pertains to possibly criminal activity or abuse of power.\n\nThe letter also looks past Nixon v. United States, a 1993 decision ruling that judicial challenges to Senate procedures in impeachment trials, as were brought in the case by impeached federal judge Walter Nixon, are for the Senate alone to decide. It follows from this decision that the House and Senate each are solely responsible for structuring their impeachment proceedings as they see fit. The president has no say, and the White House counsel\u2019s responsibility is to the settled law, not to act as if these decisions do not exist.\n\nIn its defense against potential obstruction of justice allegations laid out in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, the administration relied on the official opinion of the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, which binds the executive branch and says a sitting president may not be criminally indicted or prosecuted while in office because doing so \u201cwould unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions\u201d \u2014 even if the Constitution provides no such express grant of immunity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president contends that he can\u2019t be indicted or even investigated by prosecutors or Congress. If he also has the power to keep records of confidential White House conversations from courts or Congress, and if he can unilaterally decide not to submit to an impeachment inquiry, or persists in trying to dictate the terms of an inquiry, his legal defense is, effectively, that the law can\u2019t touch him, and he should be treated in the manner of an English king.\n\nAltogether, the White House counsel\u2019s arguments leave only one option for holding Trump accountable \u2014 the next presidential election. To game that sole remaining possibility, Trump appears to be enlisting foreign leaders to intervene in his next election and influence the only avenue by which the body politic can hold him accountable. A neat trick. What\u2019s astonishing is that administration lawyers, bound by ethical rules requiring them to be candid with Congress and the courts, have the gall to assert their various claims as law.\n\nTrump once declared that the Constitution gives him \u201cthe right to do whatever I want as president.\u201d Obviously, he\u2019s wrong. As Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), now chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said when he was a member of the House, on the verge of impeaching President Bill Clinton, \u201cThe day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is the day he was subject to impeachment because he took the power from Congress over the impeachment process away from Congress, and he became the judge and jury.\u201d\n\nTrump has done that and more, directing underlings not to comply with subpoenas and not to appear at lawful hearings. Such misconduct, coupled with the outlandish claims in the White House counsel\u2019s letter, is aimed at curtailing every avenue for holding him accountable. He seeks the power of a king. Our Constitution and the clear objectives of our founders say otherwise.\n\nAD", "description": "If he can\u2019t be indicted, and if he can dictate his own terms to Congress \u2014 as the White House counsel suggests \u2014 then the president is saying that he\u2019s something other than a president.", "authors": ["Michael J.
