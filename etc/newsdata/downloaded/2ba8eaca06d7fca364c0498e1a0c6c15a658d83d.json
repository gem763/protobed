The new FTA has several safeguards and carve-outs applying to the ISDS clauses but these would be meaningless if the 1993 investment agreement still exists.\n\nTrade Minister Simon Birmingham said he was not opposed to abolishing the 1993 agreement but needed to check with Indonesia first.\n\n\"We should be able to work through that issue,'' he said\n\nHe said he would give Labor an answer before the FTA legislation was put to a vote in the House of Representatives next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShadow trade minister Madeleine King also sought assurances that working holiday makers were not exploited and would have to be adequately qualified for any skilled work they undertook.\n\nSenator Birmingham said there were already laws that ensured holiday workers undertaking skilled work had to meet appropriate qualifications.\n\nMs King said Labor would do what it could from Opposition but, at the end of the day, there was a net benefit to such deals.\n\n\"Trade generates jobs for Australian workers,'' she said.\n\n\"Reducing barriers to trade also creates more competitive industries and benefits Australian consumers through lower prices and greater choice.\n\n\"We will back these agreements although we are concerned about how this government will implement them.''\n\nGreens MP Adam Bandt said his party would try to amend the legislation to remove ISDS clauses, mandate local market testing before foreign workers could be imported, and defer the Hong Kong deal while the civil unrest was ongoing.\n\nSenator Birmingham said an FTA with Hong Kong separate to that with China was a sign of support for Hong Kong retaining a level of autonomy over China.", "description": "The government will consider a minor change to the FTA with Indonesia after Labor requested changes to quell its own internal dissent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4914%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_294%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2d7e64d16878823821364a76372bf7cc3155554e", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
