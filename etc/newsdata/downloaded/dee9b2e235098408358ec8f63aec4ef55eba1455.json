The line will include beauty products and perfume and will most likely follow a direct-to-consumer model.\n\n\u201cI think, for us, we can deliver a much better product if we're direct to consumer. We're taking out the middleman. And hopefully we'll be able to have a much better product in return. So I'm very much looking forward to it,\u201d Vonn said.\n\nThe move comes at a time when several celebrities are diving into the cosmetic space, including Kylie Jenner and Lady Gaga, who recently announced the launch of her Amazon-exclusive (AMZN) cosmetics line.\n\nAlpine Skiing - FIS Alpine World Ski Championships - Women's Downhill - Are, Sweden - February 10, 2019 Bronze medalist Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. poses during the medal ceremony REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger More\n\nVonn hopes to differentiate her beauty venture by catering those on the move.\n\n\u201cMakeup right now, is really geared towards being extravagant and bold, and there's not really anything for the active woman,\u201d Vonn said.\n\n\u201cThere's not something where you can wear it in the morning to the gym, and then wear it to work, or vice versa. So I'm looking to do something that's different and hopefully fill that void that's in the market right now.\u201d\n\nBridgette Webb is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
