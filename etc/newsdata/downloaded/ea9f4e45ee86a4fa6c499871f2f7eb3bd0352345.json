It is expected that the profit of the company's new energy vehicle business will also decline to a certain extent compared with the same period of last year,\" BYD said in a stock exchange filing.\n\nBYD's profit drop comes as auto sales in China fell for a 15th consecutive month in September, according to industry data, dampening hopes for a second-half turnaround.\n\nSales of new energy vehicles, which have long benefited from state support, have also been impacted by subsidy cuts, falling 34.2% in September following a 15.8% decline in August.\n\nRevenue dropped 9.17% to 31.64 billion yuan in the third quarter. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, BYD sold 107,723 cars, down 15% from a year earlier.\n\nBYD also faces intensifying competition as Tesla Inc started taking orders for China-made Model 3 sedans last week ahead of mass production from its $2 billion Shanghai factory expected later this year.\n\nBYD, which has a joint venture with Daimler, said in July it would develop battery electric vehicles with Toyota Motor Corp.\n\nBesides car manufacturing, BYD also assembles mobile phones, makes batteries for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and builds Skyrail, a monorail-like product designed for commutes in smaller cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh, Editing by Lincoln Feast and Deepa Babington)", "description": "Chinese electric car maker BYD Co Ltd said on Tuesday it expected full-year net profit to fall by as much as 43%, as sales of new energy vehicles in the world's biggest auto market plunged following a cut in government subsidies.
