REUTERS/Jason Reed\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) chopped interest rates in June and July to a record low of 1%. While noting the back-to-back rate cuts, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said \u201cfurther monetary easing may well be required\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt our Board meeting next week, we will again take stock of the evidence.\u201d\n\nLowe said the RBA Board was prepared to ease policy further if needed and that it was likely an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia.\n\nThe Australian dollar AUD=D3 jumped to the day's high of $0.68065 after Lowe's speech as markets scaled back the probability for a rate cut at its Oct. 1 policy meeting.\n\nFinancial futures <0#YIB:> are now pricing in a 60% chance of a third cut this year to 0.75% next week from 74% prior to the speech. Economists at Australia\u2019s \u2018Big Four\u2019 banks are predicting an October easing.\n\n\u201cMarkets were looking for a clearer confirmation that the RBA would be considering a cut in October. But we didn\u2019t get that,\u201d said Prashant Newnaha, senior Asia-Pacific rates strategist at TD Securities.\n\n\u201cIf you look at other comments from the Governor too, he does sound upbeat. So that doesn\u2019t provide a guarantee either that a cut is coming through next month.\u201d\n\nLowe held out hope for a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d in the economy, brought about by low interest rates, government tax rebates to millions of households, a weaker Aussie dollar, a brighter outlook for the resources sector and spending on infrastructure.\n\nHe expects a modest increase in economic growth in the quarters ahead, although \u201cthe strength and durability of this pick-up remains to be seen\u201d.\n\nLowe listed global uncertainties, including the Sino-U.S. trade war, together with an extreme drought in Australia and sluggish household consumption as among the factors hurting the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nECONOMIC PUZZLE\n\nAustralia\u2019s A$1.95 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy has dodged recession for 28 years but has hit a soft patch with growth slowing to 1.4% last quarter from a year earlier, the weakest in a decade.\n\nAdditionally, rising unemployment and snail-paced wages growth were keeping downward pressure on inflation.\n\nDecisions by major global central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to lower rates in their countries were also playing a part in the RBA\u2019s decision-making, Lowe said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore structural shifts in global interest rates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we did seek to ignore these shifts, our exchange rate would appreciate, which, in the current environment, would be unhelpful in terms of achieving both the inflation target and full employment.\u201d\n\nThe Australian dollar has so far fallen about 4% this year on top of a nearly 10% drop in 2018, helping to boost the country\u2019s export sector.\n\nEven considering the impact of the global growth slowdown, Australia\u2019s drought and weak household consumption, part of the slowing of the country\u2019s economy remains unexplained, Lowe said.\n\nRelated Coverage Australia central bank chief says would consider QE but unlikely\n\nThis is especially so taking into account the recent strength in jobs growth, which at 2.5% is faster than the 1.4% growth in the country\u2019s annual gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cNormally, output growth exceeds employment growth, rather than falls short,\u201d he told business leaders in the regional New South Wales city of Armidale, about 475 km (295 miles) north of Sydney.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking to understand what is going on here. It is possible that it is just measurement noise, but we can\u2019t yet rule out something more structural.\u201d", "description": "Further cuts to the cash rate may be needed in Australia, the governor of the country's central bank said in a speech on Tuesday, ahead of a board meeting next week where policymakers are expected to lower interest rates again.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433285350&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0NW", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
