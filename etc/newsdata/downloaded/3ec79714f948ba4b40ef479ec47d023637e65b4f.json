One member of the organization said such a deal is \u201calways possible\u201d but also expressed surprise that speculation about a Williams trade resurfaced Monday. NFL Network first reported that the Redskins were open to the possibility of trading Williams.\n\nAD\n\nA person who has dealings with the Redskins\u2019 front office said the team is open to making \u201ca blockbuster deal\u201d involving Williams if an enticing trde offer comes along. But the person, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of trade talks, expressed skepticism that any team will make an offer that is substantial enough for the Redskins to act.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo one will do it,\u201d the person predicted.\n\nIt was not clear what the Redskins would deem a suitable offer for Williams. The Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots have been among the teams linked to Williams in trade speculation. The Patriots are 8-0 as they seek a seventh Super Bowl title with Bill Belichick as their coach and Tom Brady as their quarterback. The Browns, at 2-5, have been one of the NFL\u2019s biggest disappointments but apparently remain a potential buyer as the trade deadline approaches at 4 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nBefore Monday, the prevalent view around the league was that the Redskins would consider trading Williams during the upcoming offseason but would not do so during the season, even with their record at 1-7 and Williams steadfastly refusing to play for Washington. He did not participate in any offseason workouts or report to the team during training camp or once the regular season was underway, racking up fines and missing salary in the process.\n\nAD\n\nThe situation stemmed in part from the team\u2019s medical staff misdiagnosing a growth on Williams\u2019s scalp during the offseason. The medical issue gave Williams \u201ca scare,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the situation, and Williams made the decision that he no longer wanted to play for the team. The Redskins\u2019 strategy throughout the standoff had been to wait Williams out in the hopes that financial factors would drive him to return, but with the trade deadline approaching and Williams staying away for the season\u2019s first eight games, the organization has changed its approach.\n\nWilliams isn\u2019t the only Redskins player to be the subject of trade speculation, which isn\u2019t surprising given that the team is in last place in the NFC East.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting when all these reports come up and come out,\u201d interim coach Bill Callahan said. \u201cSome have credence, some don\u2019t, and I look at the trade deadline in terms of our organization, whatever happens, happens. I\u2019m not privy to anything of that nature at this juncture. \u2026 If I had something to report, I would. But to speculate, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to anybody, fans, players.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther Redskins veterans who fit the profile of potential trade candidates include Pro Bowl right guard Brandon Scherff, who is scheduled to be a free agent in the offseason after he and the team haven\u2019t reached an agreement on a contract extension. Cornerback Josh Norman, who has struggled and has been limited by injuries, has also been mentioned in the trade deadline rumor mill. The 31-year-old\u2019s five-year, $75 million contract \u2014 one of the NFL\u2019s richest at his position \u2014 expires after the 2020 season. There is also outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, a pass rusher who has been one of the team\u2019s cornerstones for several seasons and could be appealing for a contending team. His contract is up after next season.\n\nWhile players may not know until after 4 p.m. Tuesday, they said dealing with rumors and uncertainty is part of the job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around six years. I\u2019ve been around guys who knew they were going to get traded,\u201d wide receiver Paul Richardson Jr. said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around guys that asked for a trade, so they prepared themselves. Ultimately, we\u2019ve got to come in ready to work. It\u2019s more or less harder for guys who don\u2019t expect it. \u2026 Those guys kind of have to prepare themselves for a new beginning.\u201d\n\nAdd to list\n\nAD", "description": "Washington, which previously was unwilling to trade its star left tackle, probably would need to receive a \"blockbuster\" offer before Tuesday afternoon's trade deadline.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-fUvWiJKUFB_1rc2vLbcM7rKmwc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PCOLGZGLJ4I6RLIKBYA67OR4YE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
