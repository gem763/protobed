Earlier this week, Premier Li Keqiang made the unusual move to warn local officials that they must do \"everything\" to make sure they hit growth targets for this year.\n\nChina's economy is being hit on three fronts: The US-led trade war, slowing demand at home and rising domestic challenges including the outbreak of swine fever that has dealt a huge blow to its pork farmers. It's also pushed up prices for consumers.\n\nChina's slowdown is nothing new. But these challenges pose new headaches for policymakers who are trying to manage the slowdown. The country's political stability depends on economic security - and over the last forty years, that's what the Communist Party has delivered. They're under pressure to keep that contract.", "description": "The world's second largest economy is battling a trade war with the US and slowing domestic demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/337C/production/_107908131_gettyimages-1143952826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
