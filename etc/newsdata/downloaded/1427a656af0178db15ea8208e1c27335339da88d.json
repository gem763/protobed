Photographer Karna Roa had the idea to capture the bride and groom with the fire burning at the back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explained to Metro.co.uk that this was the \u2018new normal\u2019 for California\u2019s wine country.\n\nThe fire began on 23 October but the exact cause is unknown (AP Photo/Noah Berger)\n\nThe picture \u2013 which saw Katie and Curtis wearing face masks while donning stoic expressions, was inspired by a famous painting.\n\n\u2018The image was created in the style of the 1930s painting American Gothic,\u2019 explained Karna of KMR Photography.\n\n\u2018The original painting by Grant Wood depicted normal life in 1930 in the United States.\n\n\u2018As the couple stood in the vineyard with masks I wondered if this was the \u201cnew normal\u201d for the California Wine Country in 2019.\u2019\n\nShe then posted the images on social media where they went viral. Users said the picture was \u2018powerful\u2019.\n\nKarna hopes to show people just how prevalent wildfires are in the state which has been plagued by at least nine wildfires since last week.\n\n\u2018I do hope this is raising awareness of the California fires across the nation and world.\n\n\u2018This is the fourth wedding I\u2019ve shot that was threatened by wildfires. This is the first time I\u2019ve created an image like this.\u2019\n\nDespite all the obstacles on such a special occasion, Katie and Curtis felt they sent a strong message with their image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next morning, the wedding party had to be evacuated and moved to San Francisco where they could continue the celebrations.\n\nMORE: Inseparable kids who say they\u2019ll be together forever stage fake wedding photoshoot\n\nMORE: Couple slammed for Handmaid\u2019s Tale themed wedding photos\n\nMORE: Curious raccoons interrupt couple\u2019s wedding photoshoot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Katie and Curtis Ferland from Chicago, Illinois, had planned for the perfect day at Chateau St. Jean vineyard in Sonoma County, California.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93694530_1572422979.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
