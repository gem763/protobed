We can now continue in our quest to try and qualify for the World Rugby Sevens Series.\u201d\n\nMpupha, who earlier in the year also helped the Springbok Women to qualify for the Rugby World Cup New Zealand in 2021, said the foundation needed to be laid as the team prepare for their next challenge, which will be tournaments in Dubai and Cape Town in November and December.\n\n\u201cWe needed to ground ourselves first, almost touch base with our abilities and this was a good exercise for us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe now know where we need to be when we play at that level of competition. This was good for us to continue with our momentum and to see what worked for us. We also came back unbeaten from two tournaments in France earlier in the year, so this all adds to our confidence as a squad. It was not the easiest of trips, but we made the best of it.\u201d\n\nThe Imbokodo beat Uganda, Zimbabwe and Zambia in pool play and then knocked out Morocco and Madagascar before beating Kenya in the final on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe winning mind-set is a strong one and we enhanced that. It grows confidence and belief in each other and the squad as a whole. It has been a good year so far,\u201d said Mpupha.\n\nThe next assignment for the Imbokodo will be the Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens International Invitational tournament before they will play in the first-ever HSBC Cape Town Sevens tournament for Women.", "description": "The Springbok Women's Sevens team travelled to Tunisia with one mission - to claim the Rugby Africa Women's Sevens crown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7550/35832eaf160440c9bb7a9d8716aec69d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
