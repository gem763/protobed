I\u2019m here until at least 2021.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI said that Arsene Wenger was a big factor in me joining Arsenal \u2014 and he was \u2014 but ultimately I signed for the club.\n\n\"Even when Arsene announced he was leaving, I wanted to stay because I love playing for Arsenal and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been here for six years.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cWhen I moved from Real Madrid , it was a really tough time for Arsenal. But I always believed in what we could do and together we delivered.\n\n\"More recently things have been difficult and a lot has changed. But I\u2019m proud to be an Arsenal player, a fan and I\u2019m happy here.\n\n\"Whenever people see me in the street I always say, \u2018This is my home\u2019.
