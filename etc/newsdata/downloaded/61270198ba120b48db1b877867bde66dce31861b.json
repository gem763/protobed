This Weekend", "language": "en", "text": "Gun owners from across the country will converge on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol on Saturday, November 2nd to rally in support of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. I\u2019ll be speaking there, along with today\u2019s guest on Bearing Arms\u2019 Cam & Co., Rob Pincus, who joins me to talk about the idea behind the rally, a few of the many speakers, and what the grassroots gathering can accomplish.\n\nSome of my favorite folks in the world of Second Amendment advocacy will be there, and I\u2019m looking forward to getting to see old friends and meet some activists for the very first time. There\u2019ll be gun owners traveling from as far away as California and Washington State to attend the rally, and many of the speakers will be around beforehand and afterwards to talk with those in attendance. I\u2019ll be sticking around until the early evening for sure, and hope to get a chance to say hello to readers of the website and fans of the show.\n\nAlso on today\u2019s program, we have the incredible story of a Washington State man with 50 felony convictions to his name, an armed citizen in southern California, and a Jacksonville police recruit in the right place at the right time to save a woman\u2019s life.\n\nIn addition to the link above, you can also find Bearing Arms\u2019 Cam & Co. on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Townhall.com\u2019s podcast page. Thanks for watching, listening, and spreading the word!", "description": "Gun owners from across the country will gather on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol Saturday afternoon in support of the Second Amendment.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cam-and-Co-Thumbnail-102919.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
