Wochit\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump did not give House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or other key members of Congress advance notice of the Saturday night raid that ended in the death of terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nTrump said he knew about plans for the top-secret mission for three days but kept most members of Congress in the dark because he feared the information would be leaked to the public and endanger the lives of American forces.\n\n\u201cWashington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s no country in the world that leaks like we do. And Washington is a leaking machine.\u201d\n\nTrump, who announced al-Baghdadi's death during a nationally televised address to the nation, said he was notifying Pelosi and other members of Congress on Sunday.\n\nMore: President Trump says ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead after U.S.-led raid in Syria\n\nPresident Donald Trump answers questions as he speaks in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nThe raid, carried out Saturday night by special operations forces in northwestern Syria, comes amid increasingly hostile relations between Trump and House Democrats who are conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Pelosi saluted the \u201cheroism, dedication and skill\u201d of the military and intelligence officials who played a role in the mission and said she was relieved that no U.S. personnel died in the raid.\n\nBut, she said, \u201cthe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., applauded the death of al-Baghdadi, who led the terrorist group the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nMcConnell called al-Baghdadi\u2019s death \u201ca significant step for the campaign against ISIS, for the future of the Middle East and for the safety of the American people and free people around the world.\u201d\n\nHis office did not say whether he had been given advance notice of the raid.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, Trump said he withheld information about the raid from most Congress members until American forces were out of harm's way because he didn\u2019t want them to be \u201cgreeted with firepower like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cA leak could have caused the death of all of them,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly a handful of people knew details of the mission, Trump said. They included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Gen. Mark Milley and other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\u201cThe only people who knew were the few that I dealt with,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said he informed Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, of the raid before making the announcement Sunday. He said he also spoke to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., shortly before his televised address.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is one of the leaders of the impeachment investigation against Trump, was not notified.\n\nNeither was Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., his office said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, possibly the most wanted man in the world, died in Saturday\u2019s raid after being chased into a dead-end tunnel by U.S. special operations forces. Trump said al-Baghdadi was killed after detonating an explosive suicide vest. Three of al-Baghdadi\u2019s children also were killed in the blast.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Graham complimented Trump for carrying out the mission.\n\n\u201cISIS is a depraved organization,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThey\u2019re religious Nazis. It cannot be accommodated. It cannot be negotiated with. They have to be destroyed and marginalized.\u201d\n\nAsked if Trump was wrong to withhold information about the mission from Democrats, Graham said he didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThat is not my concern today,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment where President Trump\u2019s worst critics should say, \u2018Well done,\u2019 \u201d Graham said.\n\nMore: 'A stain on America's honor': Lindsey Graham says Trump's Syria pullout abandons Kurds, helps ISIS\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed-trump-withheld-details-democrats/2478353001/", "description": "Donald Trump did not give House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or other congressional Democrats advance notice of a raid that ended in the death of ISIS leader.", "authors": ["Michael Collins", "David Jackson", "Courtney Subramanian", "Published P.M.
