Beto O'Rourke. During Thursday's Democratic presidential primary debate, moderator David Muir asked O'Rourke about his views on a buyback plan.\n\n\"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" O'Rourke said, referring to the firearms.\n\nThe debate stage Thursday reflected an increased urgency on the left regarding guns following the latest rash of killings.

Americans who fear their town or city could be the site of the next attack wonder what strategies the US could take to reduce gun violence.\n\nNo country has the same political structure as the US, but several have taken steps that worked for them.
