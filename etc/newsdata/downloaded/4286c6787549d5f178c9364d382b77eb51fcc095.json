Huawei's lawyers referred to Cole as the \"lead counsel\" for the Chinese company on the case.\n\nLawyers for Huawei called the government's motion to disqualify Cole \"part of a barrage against Huawei.\"\n\nIn the suit that Cole is defending, the government has alleged Huawei violated American economic sanctions on Iran and obstructed justice in the investigation that followed . Huawei pleaded not guilty in April. Also charged in the case is Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou , who was arrested in Vancouver in December at the request of the United States and now faces a court battle in Canada that could result in her extradition.\n\nThe US government made the charges against the Chinese tech company public in January. At the same time, it unsealed charges in a separate federal case in Washington state alleging that Huawei tried to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile. Huawei has also pleaded not guilty to those charges. Not long after those suits were filed, the US government added Huawei to a trade blacklist that restricts American companies from selling products to Huawei.\n\nRead More", "description": "The US government is seeking to disqualify a lawyer representing Huawei in one of several active lawsuits against the Chinese telecommunications company.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190904123031-01-huawei-attorney-general-lawsuit-super-tease.jpg"}
