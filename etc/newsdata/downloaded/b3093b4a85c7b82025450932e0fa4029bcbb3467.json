They could not reach a verdict on two other counts: hate crime assault and deprivation of civil rights.\n\nProsecutors allege the former Bordentown Township police chief slammed the head of a handcuffed 18-year-old black man against a doorjamb in September 2016 as he was being escorted from a hotel.\n\nPHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT PUTS 72 OFFICERS ON DESK DUTY AMID INVESTIGATION INTO ANTI-MUSLIM SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS\n\nOfficers responded to the Ramada hotel amid complaints alleging that two teenagers who were not guests were swimming in the pool. During the arrest, Nucera, who is white, allegedly yelled racial slurs and derogatory remarks, The Courier-Post reported.\n\nThe indictment said the teenager, Timothy Stroye, was \"loudly complaining\" when Nucera approached him from behind and slammed his head into the metal doorjamb. The incident was reported by a police officer.\n\nNucera was recorded later that evening describing Stroye with profanity and the N-word, the indictment said. Prosecutors discovered that other officers had been secretly recording Nucera making racist comments for about a year.\n\nIn one recording, the former chief allegedly said that he was tired of African-Americans, and that \u201cit\u2019s getting to the point where I could shoot one.\u201d\n\nIn a 2015 recording, Nucera allegedly said black people were \"like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe former chief has a history of using racially charged language and using police dogs to intimidate African-Americans, prosecutors said, adding that he harbored an \"intense, senseless, irrational and bigoted view\" of blacks.\n\nJurors will meet Thursday to decide whether to resume deliberations on the other two charges.\n\nNucera retired from the Bordentown Township force in 2017 after 34 years in law enforcement. He faces up to 20 years in prison and the loss of his police pension.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A retired New Jersey police chief was found guilty Wednesday of lying to the FBI during a hate crime investigation in which he is accused of using excessive force against a black man.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/PD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
