O\u2019Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, as the next national security adviser.\n\nO\u2019Brien is set to replace John Bolton, who last week announced he is leaving the White House. Trump said he fired Bolton. Bolton said he was resigning following disagreements about foreign affairs.\n\nThe post does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nI am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O\u2019Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was considered the \u201csafest option\u201d to avoid drama ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a senior U.S. official who requested anonymity told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cHe gets along with everybody,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe\u2019s the nicest guy on the planet.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien would take on the role during a time of increasing hostilities between the U.S. and Iran. Tensions have gone up in recent days following an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, which cut access to around 5% of the global oil supply and brought renewed threat of a military conflict between Washington and Tehran. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the strikes and Trump claimed Wednesday that he would add new sanctions as a result, while Iranian officials deny involvement in the attack.\n\nTT News Agency / Reuters Robert C. O'Brien arrives at the district court during the second day of ASAP Rocky's trial in Stockholm on Aug. 1.\n\nO\u2019Brien, who currently leads the U.S. government\u2019s diplomatic efforts on overseas hostage-related matters, recently traveled to Sweden for the ASAP Rocky trial.\n\nIn the book \u201cWhile America Slept,\u201d O\u2019Brien heavily criticized the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy and advocated for expanding U.S. military presence abroad. He has supported expanding the Navy, and he is a big proponent of countering China in the South China Sea. Trump reportedly considered O\u2019Brien for the role of secretary of the Navy in 2017.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s prior work includes having served as a senior foreign policy adviser to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), as well as being a foreign policy adviser for former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nIn addition to advising Republican politicians, O\u2019Brien is an attorney who co-founded the Los Angeles-based law firm Larson O\u2019Brien in 2016. He previously represented astronaut Buzz Aldrin.\n\nBolton\u2019s replacement will be Trump\u2019s fourth official national security adviser in less than three years in office. No other president has had that many in their first term. Michael Flynn was fired from the position after just 24 days. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster left in early 2018.\n\nLongtime Bolton ally Charles Kupperman temporarily served in the role after Bolton left, but he faced calls from civil rights groups to resign over his ties to an anti-Muslim think tank.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional background on O\u2019Brien.", "description": "O'Brien, who serves as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, is set to replace John Bolton.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter", "Senior World News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8230d02300001c05571683.jpeg?cache=kcatxhpxlv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
