This would be the fourth time the Trump administration lowered the refugee cap, and it had reportedly discussed lowering it to zero. There are more displaced people in the world today than at any point since World War II, according to the United Nations.", "description": "This is the fourth time the Trump administration has lowered the refugee cap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/k3iiufvdi8Ak4ESGbofvBF5ilOY=/0x437:4202x2801/1920x1080/2019/09/10/1568122734760.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
