Then came the accusations against Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and contentious hearings before a Senate committee. Now it\u2019s questions about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine\u2019s president and whether that should lead to Trump\u2019s removal from office.\n\n\u201cI think they wanted to do it all along, and they\u2019re just looking for another way, another avenue,\u201d Stenske, a 55-year-old Trump supporter, said of the impeachment proceedings as he walked his dog through a suburban Indianapolis park last week. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of a ploy to help keep the pressure on him and muddy his campaign, his chances to win in 2020.\u201d\n\nPolling finds that support for the inquiry has grown since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the start of the investigation last month following a whistleblower complaint. But what those numbers don\u2019t show is the sense of fatigue among some Americans \u2013 a factor that could be significant as Democrats leading the inquiry debate how to proceed with an election year approaching.\n\nIt\u2019s a feeling shared by people on both sides.\n\nFor Trump supporters such as Stenske, the impeachment inquiry is more of the same from obstructionist Democrats still bitter about the 2016 election. Those who want Trump gone say it\u2019s tough to feel hopeful after watching him flout the rules and spew divisive rhetoric for almost a full term \u2013 and get away with all of it.\n\n\u201cImpeachment in general has been depressing because it\u2019s sad that it\u2019s taken this long,\u201d said Megan Gettelfinger, 33, a preschool teacher and mother of two who moved to Fishers from Indianapolis almost three years ago.\n\nThe question about how to move forward with impeachment is of particular concern to both parties in places such as Fishers, one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing suburbs. The community has more than doubled in population since 2000, to just over 90,000 people. Companies have located to the area, and young families have been drawn to its good schools, entertainment and acres and acres of green space.\n\nThe boom in Fishers and the surrounding region has changed the face of Indiana\u2019s 5th Congressional District, a once reliably Republican area that backed Trump by nearly 12 percentage points in 2016. The increased number of college-educated, more liberal residents has given Democrats hope that they may pick up a seat here in 2020, when GOP Rep. Susan Brooks is retiring.\n\nDemocrat Joe Donnelly narrowly won the district in 2018, even as he lost his Senate reelection bid statewide, and Democrats think the area looks a lot like the suburban districts that helped them win control of the House during last year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTrump should find plenty of ardent defenders here \u2013 people like Stenske, who voted for Trump in 2016 and thinks he\u2019s doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d as president despite what he sees as Democrats\u2019 relentless efforts to sabotage him. But at a park in the heart of Fishers\u2018 Sunblest neighborhood, an upper middle-class area of young families and two-story homes, there were signs of problems for Trump and the GOP. For every supporter of the president, it was easy to find someone \u2013 most of them women \u2013 eager for his time in office to end.\n\nGettelfinger, who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 after supporting Republican candidates over Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, has a long list of things she dislikes about Trump, from his treatment of women and minorities to his inability to admit when he\u2019s wrong. But even she sees the impeachment proceedings as both a legitimate inquiry and a political move by Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think that what happened is impeachable,\u201d she said. \u201cI also think that at this point anyone who doesn\u2019t support him is now jumping on \u2018This is how we can impeach him. This is our path to get this done to get him out of office.\u201d\u2019\n\nKathrynne Shaw, 28, also opposes Trump but described impeachment as \u201ctoo late in the game.\u201d She said Democrats should hold off for now and proceed only if Trump wins a second term in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something they\u2019ve been talking about forever,\u201d said Shaw, who lives in nearby Noblesville and works in a distribution center. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to show that they\u2019re able to do something, but it\u2019s almost like when a toddler throws a temper tantrum. They\u2019re trying to do something, but everything they\u2019ve tried to do thus far isn\u2019t really working.\u201d\n\nRandall Scott, 55, voted for Trump in 2016 and said he also avoids watching TV news or spending time on social media. He reads some but generally distrusts both the media and the information politicians are putting out. Like Shaw, he doesn\u2019t feel that following the impeachment proceedings is a worthwhile use of his time.\n\n\u201cI feel powerless. There\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it,\u201d said Scott, who lives in Fishers and owns a business. \u201cI\u2019m not depressed about it. I don\u2019t feel woeful or anything. I think that\u2019s the nature of politics.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Polling finds that support for the impeachment inquiry has grown since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of one last month following a whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sara Burnett"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/Impeachment_Voter_Fatigue_88507.jpg-a6031_c0-205-4868-3044_s1200x700.jpg?9ef7c93d891abf4868cf89b818b49ca7792dc860", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
