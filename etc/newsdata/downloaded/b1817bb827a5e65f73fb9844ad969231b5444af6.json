REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\n\nExports rose 0.7% in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, while imports fell 1.5%, the Federal Statistics Office said. The trade surplus rose to 20.2 billion euros ($22.3 billion) after a downwardly revised 18.0 billion euros the month before.\n\nA Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5% drop in exports and a 0.3% fall in imports, while the trade surplus was expected to come in at 17.5 billion euros.\n\n\u201cThe small rise in exports in July is no reason for euphoria about foreign trade,\u201d said Volker Treier, economist at the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce.\n\n\u201cUncertainties persist for business, mainly due to the smoldering global trade conflicts and the still unclear Brexit (path).\u201d\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that the U.S.-China trade conflict could take years to resolve, although Washington wants \u201cnear term\u201d results from talks in September and October.\n\nMonday\u2019s stronger-than-expected German export figures cut against the grain of a recent run of weak data from Europe\u2019s largest economy, which has fueled concerns that it could tip into recession in the July-September period.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the European Central Bank is expected to deploy fresh stimulus at its policy meeting on Thursday.\n\nGermany\u2019s gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the decrease in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain and below-average demand from China.\n\nEconomists generally define a technical recession as at least two consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\nRAY OF SUNSHINE\n\nMonday\u2019s data showed that in the January-July period, German exports rose by 1.0%, with the strongest contribution coming from markets beyond the European Union, which registered growth of 2.9%.\n\nThe BGA foreign trade association said that in contrast to business in Europe, which was being hampered by Brexit uncertainty, business with the United States was going well.\n\n\u201cBut this is no reason to give the all-clear, because the many risks and confrontations in foreign trade and the general economic slowdown persist,\u201d BGA President Holger Bingmann said.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel said on a visit to Beijing on Friday that the China-U.S. trade war was affecting the whole world and that she hoped it would be resolved soon.\n\nWith its sales abroad hit, a global economic slowdown and an increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany\u2019s growth momentum is now being generated domestically \u2014 a dependency that leaves it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market.\n\nSeasonally adjusted unemployment rose in August, eroding a pillar of growth that has helped support Germany\u2019s traditionally export-driven economy.\n\nThe government expects economic growth to slow to 0.5% this year from 1.5% in the previous year. This would be the weakest expansion since 2013 when the euro zone struggled amid a sovereign debt crisis.\n\nCommenting on the July trade figures, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s trade data brings a very weak ray of sunshine. Nothing more but luckily also nothing less.\u201d", "description": "German exports unexpectedly rose in July, data showed on Monday, but business groups said tariff disputes and Brexit uncertainty still posed risks to Europe's largest economy as it teeters on the brink of recession.", "authors": ["Paul Carrel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427843508&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880FA", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
