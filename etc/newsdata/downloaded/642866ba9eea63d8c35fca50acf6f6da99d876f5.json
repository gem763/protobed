He's obviously had a big effect.\"\n\nFrance, who have lost four players to injury since the start of the World Cup, will go into the quarterfinal on the back of an unexpectedly long break after their final pool game against England was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nWales, by contrast, have won all four of their pool games at a World Cup for the first time since the inaugural 1987 edition, when they achieved their best placing of third, with Stridgeon adamant that was a \"massive achievement\" for Warren Gatland's men.\n\n\"You can look at it both ways,\" added Stridgeon, who made his international coaching reputation with his native England and on three tours with the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"They (France) have had a rest and is that a good thing for them? But they have missed a game as well. Are you game fit, are you ready to go?\"\n\nWales won this season's Six Nations Championship with a Grand Slam but only after coming from 16-0 down at half-time to beat France 24-19 in their opening match in Paris.\n\nStridgeon reckoned it was too simplistic to put Wales' Stade de France revival down to superior fitness alone.\n\n\"People always think that if you have won in the last 20 minutes it means you are fitter than them. We work on repeatability and being able to do things at maximum intensity and hopefully in the last 20 minutes of games that pays off,\" he added.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Wales will be up against an increasingly fit France in Sunday's World Cup quarterfinal in Oita according to their conditioning expert Paul Stridgeon.
