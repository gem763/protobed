He stood up at the commemoration of the nearly 3,000 dead from radical Islamist terrorism and explained very carefully to Rep. Ilhan Omar what \u201csome people did\u201d on 9/11. It\u2019s tough to top Haros\u2019 succinct and direct response to Omar and the Squad:\n\nNicholas Haros Jr., donning a black T-shirt with the words \u201csome people did something?\u201d singled out the congresswoman and the other members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d after reading the names of the dead, including his mother\u2019s, Frances Haros, at the ceremony. \u201c\u2019Some people did something,\u2019 said a freshman congresswoman from Minnesota,\u201d said Haros in reference to Omar. To the sound of some applause, Haros continued, \u201cToday I am here to respond to you exactly who did what to whom.\u201d \u201cMadam, objectively speaking, we know who and what was done. There is no uncertainty about that. Why your confusion?\u201d Haros asked. \u201cOn that day, 19 Islamic terrorist members of al Qaeda killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. Is that clear?\u201d \u201cBut as to whom,\u201d Haros continued, \u201cI was attacked, your relatives and friends were attacked, our constitutional freedoms were attacked and our nation\u2019s founding on Judeo-Christian principles were attacked.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what some people did,\u201d Haros railed. \u201cGot that now?\u201d\n\nWell put. There\u2019s not much to add to that, except that Omar will be continuing to pay for her flippancy and denial for years to come, at least in New York. That is, if the media there cover it.\n\nSpeaking of people doing something, Trump announced at the commemoration that he\u2019s doing a few things to the Taliban at the moment. And if they don\u2019t stop attacking US personnel, Trump warned, they\u2019ll start getting somethings \u201cthey have never seen before.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump used his remarks at a memorial service marking the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to bring up his dashed peace talks with the Taliban https://t.co/P1ktlYnaw7 pic.twitter.com/WvKiWcPpTU \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) September 11, 2019\n\nUpdate: Changed headline from \u201c9/11 survivor\u201d to \u201cSon of 9/11 victim\u201d for better accuracy. In my mind, Haros\u2019 loss of his mother makes him a 9/11 survivor too, but this is more accurate.", "description": "\u201cOn that day, 19 Islamic terrorist members of al Qaeda killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage.
