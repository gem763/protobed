A doctoral candidate in comparative literature at NYU, she\u2019s a writer and critic whose work has appeared in n+1, Bookforum, and The New York Times. In early 2018, she published an essay called \u201cOn Liking Women\u201d that lit up trans Twitter: The piece championed the 1960s playwright and provocateur Valerie Solanas, the author of the SCUM Manifesto (SCUM = Society for Cutting Up Men) and the would-be assassin of Andy Warhol (she shot him in 1968). Chu hit back hard against the unitary, easy-to-understand trans story I sketched at the start of this article. She also took aim at a subset of radical feminist activists who regard trans women as interloping men.\n\n\u201cI have never been able to differentiate liking women from wanting to be like them,\u201d Chu confessed. She described her young self not as a child who was already a girl, but as \u201cthe scared, straight boy whose life I will never not have lived.\u201d As for the SCUM Manifesto, it implies\u2014according to Chu\u2014that trans women transition \u201cnot to \u2018confirm\u2019 some kind of innate gender identity, but because being a man is stupid and boring.\u201d\n\nComing out, announcing her womanhood, was\u2014for her and for trans women like her (and, to be honest, like me)\u2014an exhilarating, empowering choice, not an act of simple survival. That perspective wasn\u2019t a breath of fresh air so much as a mountaintop\u2019s worth. \u201cSome of us \u2026 might opt to transition,\u201d she concluded, to climb out of the cage that radical feminists take \u201cheterosexuality to be.\u201d\n\nHow did Chu come to such views? What is it like for her to live with them? You won\u2019t find clear answers in her first book, Females, a short, exasperating volume that is nothing like a memoir and not much like a manifesto. It\u2019s more like a provocation, thick with what Chu herself labels \u201cindefensible claims.\u201d \u201cEveryone is female,\u201d Chu writes, \u201cand everyone hates it\u201d: We are all female in this special, philosophical sense because we all \u201cmake room for the desires of another.\u201d You, too, let \u201csomeone else do your desiring for you.\u201d\n\nMales, in Chu\u2019s terms\u2014that is, men who behave \u201clike men\u201d; men who fit archetypes of masculinity\u2014know what they want and how to get it for themselves. But expanding on what she takes to be Solanas\u2019s view, Chu argues that no one is totally independent, totally dominant, totally satisfied\u2014which means that anyone trying to be \u201cmale\u201d has signed up for continual failure. If femaleness means vulnerability and dependence, then we are all female, and \u201cthe patriarchal system of sexual oppression\u201d works \u201cto conceal\u201d that universal truth. Men feel they have to be male, but they cannot be. They find relief from this double bind in porn, where passive, humiliated, masturbating viewers may find permission \u201cnot to have power, but to give it up.\u201d\n\nThe logical question, if you see maleness this way, is not \u201cWhat makes some people trans?\u201d but \u201cWhy would anyone want, or try, to be male?\u201d One answer is that guys have no choice. Another answer is that masculinity feels that painful and that limiting only if you don\u2019t want it\u2014if, like me, you\u2019d rather be a girl. (\u201cI hated being a man,\u201d Chu remembers, \u201cbut I thought that was just how feminism felt.\u201d) A third is to say that we might try to redefine maleness, to tell other stories about it.
