Trump\u2019s latest comments \u2014 prioritizing oil over loyalty to an ally \u2014 is only likely to inflame Kurdish anger at their abandonment by the U.S., which boiled over Monday with Kurdish citizens pelting U.S. military vehicles with vegetables as they withdrew to Iraq.\n\nU.K.-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 120 civilians have been killed since Turkey launched its offensive on Oct. 9, and about 300,000 displaced by the fighting.\n\nREAD: These Kurds threw potatoes at the U.S. troops abandoning them in Syria\n\nBut Trump made no apologies Monday for his decision to cut off his allies, who lost 11,000 fighters in the battle against ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe fought with them for three and a half to four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere's an agreement that said we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds?\u201d\n\nHe offered to cut the Kurds in on any profits made by potential oil exports from Syria. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, so that they have some cash flow. Maybe we\u2019ll get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly.\u201d\n\nHowever, former administration officials say any plans for the U.S. to profit from Syrian oil would face considerable hurdles, not least legal ones. \u201cOil, like it or not, is owned by the Syrian state,\u201d Brett McGurk, the administration\u2019s former special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, told a Washington think tank Monday.\n\n\u201cIt [is] just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is as incoherent as it is dangerous\n\nThe Turkish offensive against has been temporarily halted by a U.S.-brokered 120-hour ceasefire, due to expire at 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) Tuesday. Ahead of the deadline, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Tuesday that there were still 1,300 Syrian Kurdish fighters who were yet to evacuate a so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeastern Syria. He said Turkey would resume its attack \u201cwith more determination\u201d if the fighters had not left by then.\n\n\n\nREAD: Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s \u2018great\u2019 ceasefire deal is going\n\nErdogan is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 a key backer of the Syrian regime \u2014 in the Russian resort of Sochi Tuesday for emergency talks on the conflict. Ahead of the talks, Erdogan said the meeting would \u201ccreate the opportunity to discuss peace in a strong manner.\u201d\n\nAid groups say they are seeing a rise in civilians fleeing across the border into Iraq in anticipation of renewed fighting as the deadline approaches. More than 7,000 have crossed into Kurdish-governed territory in neighboring Iraq so far, said the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing hundreds arriving into Iraq every day and we expect more to arrive, not only because of the fighting but also because of the fear of what is going to happen next,\u201d said the group\u2019s Iraq country director Rishana Haniffa.\n\nCover: American military convoy stops near the town of Tel Tamr, north Syria, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.
