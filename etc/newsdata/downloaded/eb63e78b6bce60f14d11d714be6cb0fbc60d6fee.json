The app matches blue-collar workers such as clerks and chefs with companies that are looking for professionals to join their workforce on temporary and ad-hoc bases.\n\nUber said it has been testing this app in Chicago for a year. Now, it plans to roll out the app officially in the city, and the idea is to expand it to other places later.\n\nThrough this app, workers won\u2019t have to sign up again when they get a new job.

The staffing agencies signing up on the app will need to pay payroll taxes.\n\nThe company is taking this step probably to avoid confrontation with workers.\n\nUber said with this app, it aims to \u201celiminate bottlenecks to finding work.\u201d\n\nRead next: Hands-on: Microsoft's Surface Buds are far more comfortable than they look", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fuber-works.jpg&signature=8b493a80dd94c3dc235c1decf4726cb3", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
