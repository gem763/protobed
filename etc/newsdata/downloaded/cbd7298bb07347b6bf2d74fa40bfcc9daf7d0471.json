The newly proposed 33,000 acre farm is a positive step in reducing China\u2019s bitcoin mining dominance.\n\n\n\nBitmain: Texas Farm Can Hit 300 Megawatts\n\nIn a press release on October 21, executives confirmed its latest Bitcoin mining farm in Rochdale, Texas had launched.\n\nThe 33,000 acre site will initially host a 50 megawatt farm, but its overall capacity can increase six times over to 300 megawatts in future, Bitmain says.\n\nShould it reach those levels, the Texas site would then become the biggest mining farm in the world.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to launch this facility, which is significant to Bitmain\u2019s global expansion plans,\u201d lead project manager Clinton Brown commented in the release.\n\n\u201cThe stable and efficient energy resources in Texas are fundamental to the inevitable scale of growth for the cryptocurrency mining industry.\u201d\n\nWork began in 2018 on a 25 megawatt project. Operations will be a joint scheme between Bitmain and DMG, which will provide hosting and management services on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\u201cThis mining facility marks a major milestone in the development of the mining farm industry,\u201d the latter\u2019s COO Sheldon Bennett added.\n\nBTC Mining \u2018Even Split\u2019\n\nThe announcement comes at a pivotal time for Bitmain, which is still pursuing its initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Major competitor Canaan Creative beat it to the IPO crown last month, reportedly announcing a $200 million public listing for November.\n\nThroughout 2019, Bitmain\u2019s overall share of the Bitcoin hashrate pie has also diminished. As noted by Christopher Walken, co-founder of mining startup HASHR8, Bitmain\u2019s pools currently contribute around 27% of the total.\n\nBy contrast, in January, that figure was closer to 42%. This, commentators have warned previously, placed a single entity close to controlling more than half of the market.\n\nFor Walken, however, the trend does not constitute cause for concern.\n\n\u201cPeople complain that the (Bitcoin) hashrate is too centralized[.] But this is one of the most even splits I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he summarized uploading comparative charts on Saturday.\n\nAs Bitcoinist reported, Bitcoin miners are in fiercer competition than ever with one another over mining rewards.\n\n\n\nMultiple metrics including hashrate and mining difficulty have repeatedly set new highs this year, despite the recent mixed performance of the Bitcoin price itself.\n\nThe newly proposed Bitmain Texas bitcoin mining farm comes only 1 week after Layer1 announced the launch of their $50 Million facility in Texas. Together, the two US-based farms should help boost mining activity in the west and reduce China\u2019s rampant mining dominance.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about Bitmain\u2019s mining farm?
