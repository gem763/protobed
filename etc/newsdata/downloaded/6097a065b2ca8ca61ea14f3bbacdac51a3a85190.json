We went in-depth on a subject that hits close to home for so many of us: school violence.\n\n\n\nDo you know how many violent incidents have happened at your kid's school? Finding out may be a challenge. Many school boards and districts keep track, but we discovered they carefully guard those records. Some asked for large fees, others worried about damage to their reputation when we asked them to release figures on how many times students reported physical and sexual violence at school.\n\n\n\nSo we took a different approach. We asked students themselves. We surveyed 4,000 young people across the country aged 14 to 21, asking what they've seen and what they have personally experienced.\n\n\n\nIf you have kids in school, we want to show you what could be happening behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nAs our survey found, some disturbing violence starts very early, and schools sometimes let students down when it comes to how they respond.\n\n\n\nCatch up on this episode and others on CBC Gem.\n\n\u2014 The Marketplace Team", "description": "CBC's Marketplace rounds up the consumer and health news you need from the week.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335993.1572031854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/school-generic-mp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
