Galvin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOver the two previous seasons, Gurley has rushed for 2,556 yards and caught 123 passes for 1,368 yards, scoring a whopping 40 touchdowns. That Los Angeles has won consecutive NFC West titles and earned a controversial NFC title last season is no coincidence.\n\nBut Gurley, whether because the team is trying to manage a sore knee or because of other factors, hasn\u2019t been a big difference-maker during this year\u2019s 3-0 start. He\u2019s rushed for 203 yards on 44 carries while managing only four catches for eight yards. And he has scored only once.\n\nAsked about a lesser workload for Gurley prior to Sunday\u2019s afternoon visit from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, McVay told reporters it\u2019s a matter of getting more snaps from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cBeing efficient on those early drives and being able to sustain drives,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThe more plays we get, the better it is for everybody because the more opportunities and the more of a rhythm that we can get in where we\u2019re able to do a handful of different things.\u201d\n\nYet the Rams actually rank tied for ninth in plays run with 197, and may get a chance to match or eclipse their average of 65.7 snaps per game against a Tampa Bay defense that\u2019s allowing nearly 26 points per game. Last week, the Buccaneers were carved up for 336 yards and two touchdown passes (and another two touchdowns rushing) by rookie quarterback Daniel Jones in a 32-31 loss to the New York Giants.\n\nYet Tampa Bay (1-2) probably should be packing a 2-1 record for its trip across three time zones. The Buccaneers used the last 1:16 after Jones\u2019 go-ahead scoring run to position rookie kicker Matt Gay for a game-winning 34-yard field goal attempt from the field\u2019s middle, but Gay pushed it wide right.\n\nA few hours after Tampa Bay lost a game in which it led 28-10 at halftime, Los Angeles was grinding out a 20-13 win in Cleveland, thanks largely to its defense. The Rams came up with a goal-line stand in the last minute, stopping the Browns on four plays from the 4-yard line as their defensive line forced inaccurate back-foot throws from Baker Mayfield.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 front four faces an interesting challenge this week. Under first-year coach Bruce Arians and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, the Buccaneers have established an identity of power runs on first down to set up play-action throws from Jameis Winston.\n\nTampa Bay ranks eighth in the league in rushing at 121.7 yards per game, just two yards behind the Rams, and has controlled the ball for more than 32 minutes per game.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s such a positive when you\u2019re able to run the football, no matter if it\u2019s first down or what,\u201d said Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston. \u201cThe more effective we are and if we continue to be efficient, eventually it will open up some big play-action shots for us. As long as we keep running the ball effectively, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Since Sean McVay took the Los Angeles Rams' coaching job before the 2017 season, the offense has been based around the rushing and receiving of running back Todd Gurley.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434044985&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0E0-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
