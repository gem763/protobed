The freedom to choose is critical to preserve access to care and quality, for seniors as well as for veterans. Additionally, all Medicare beneficiaries who use their own hard-earned, after-tax dollars to purchase medical care, without burdening the already overstressed system, free up resources for other beneficiaries. It is hardly fair for middle-class or low-income workers to be shouldering all the medical costs of wealthy retirees.\n\nTrump announced an executive order two weeks ago that seeks to protect Medicare for older Americans and strengthen it by providing them with more freedom and choices.\n\nAmong the provisions of the order is one that finally demands a change to the 1993 rule that required Medicare and Social Security to be linked together. The Clinton administration wrote the rule that states Americans cannot opt out of Medicare without giving up their Social Security benefits, even though they had been forced to pay into Social Security for years.\n\nThe order states:\n\nWithin 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in coordination with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall revise current rules or policies to preserve the Social Security retirement insurance benefits of seniors who choose not to receive benefits under Medicare Part A, and propose other administrative improvements to Medicare enrollment processes for beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cIt is unethical, not to mention contrary to basic common sense, to insist that American seniors only receive care through Medicare,\u201d said AAPS Executive Director Jane M. Orient, MD, in a press release.\n\nAAPS added:\n\nMedicare\u2019s Hospital Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026 and over the next 10-15 years, counting the Trust Funds as assets rather than taxpayer liabilities, the Medicare program is only 71% funded under trustees\u2019 unfavorable assumptions, and 91% under favorable assumptions. Giving seniors the ability to escape this faltering program will help ease the looming crisis as well as give American\u2019s access to options that work best for them, not government bureaucrats.\n\nWhile the physicians also support the provision in Trump\u2019s executive order that urges \u201ctransparency,\u201d AAPS expressed concern the \u201cmanaged-care methodology that increasingly controls medical practice\u201d will interpret \u201ctransparency\u201d as a means to compromise patient private data collection.\n\nThe group stressed patients must have \u201caccess to honest prices, information about the qualifications of the clinicians they see, the identity of persons making coverage decisions, and treatment choices not necessarily included in drop-down menus in their electronic heath record.\u201d\n\nAAPS also urged a hard look at the push to replace physicians with lesser trained \u201cproviders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a reason for the rigorous training that physicians undergo,\u201d said Dr. Jane M. Orient. \u201cThe work done by a minimally trained person is not the same as the work of a highly trained, experienced person even if the same procedure code is assigned.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order also requires further improvement to Medicare by \u201celiminating burdensome regulatory billing requirements, conditions of participation, and other requirements\u201d for physicians. Such bureaucratic red tape lessens the time physicians can spend with patients.\n\n\u201cAll of the pointless administrative overhead is completely eliminated in private, self-pay, fee-for-service or direct-patient-care models,\u201d Orient noted.\n\nOrient said the executive order\u2019s \u201ccritically important effect is to permit patients to exercise their freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn private transactions between patients and physicians, problems can be solved immediately without wasteful bureaucratic involvement,\u201d she added.", "description": "A group of physicians is praising President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that expands freedom and options for Americans on Medicare.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/doctor-paperwork-health-care-patient-stock-gettyimages-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
