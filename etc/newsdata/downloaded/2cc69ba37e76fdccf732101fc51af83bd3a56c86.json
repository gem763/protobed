There was an average increase in the healthy loan portfolio of 5.4% parallel to a 0.5 per cent increase in average deposit volumes from the first three quarters of 2018, it added. It posted net impairments of NOK1.25 billion.\n\nThe fourth rate hike from Norges Bank from 1.25% to 1.5% in September, and DNB's subsequent announcement of increased loan rates, will have a positive effect on net interest income from the fourth quarter, with full effect from the first quarter of 2020, the bank said.\n\nThe bank still expects an annual increase in lending volumes of 3% to 4% in 2020. In this period, DNB expects higher growth in lending volume for small- and medium-sized enterprises and slower-paced growth in lending to large corporates and international customers.\n\nWrite to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 03:01 ET (07:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
