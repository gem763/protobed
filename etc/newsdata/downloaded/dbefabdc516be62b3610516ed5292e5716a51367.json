The couple feared a chromosomal issue, but the results came back negative.\n\nLately, the couple have been documenting Johnson's growing belly, including on Sunday in which the mama-to-be was \"squatting.\"\n\n\"I've been told it might help kick this little one out!\" Johnson captioned an Instagram photo. \"I WANT TO MEET YOU!\"\n\nJohnson said after the miscarriage both her and East, 28, got serious about having children.\n\n\"It was a surprise for both of us and we ended up losing that pregnancy, that was my miscarriage,\" she said on the Oct. 20 episode of \"Miraculous Mamas\" hosted by Elizabeth Joy. \"And we both kind of had this switch flip and it was a rude awakening of like, 'Holy crap! We're going to have a kid and then all of the sudden we are ready to have a kid and we want nothing else.'\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/21/shawn-johnson-andrew-east-anxiously-await-meeting-rainbow-baby-miscarriage/4056443002/", "description": "Shawn Johnson shares that two years ago she and Andrew East experienced a pregnancy loss.
