Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski, one of the prosecutors in the case, said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that an investigation was continuing.\n\nGiuliani has said Parnas and Fruman helped his efforts in Ukraine to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. The younger Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nUkrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas and Russian-born businessman Igor Fruman sit with lawyer Todd Blanche during their arraignment at the United States Courthouse in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg\n\nGiuliani has denied wrongdoing.\n\nEdward McMahon, another one of Parnas\u2019 lawyers, said at Wednesday\u2019s court hearing he believed some documents obtained by prosecutors in the case could be protected by attorney-client privilege or executive privilege, because Giuliani had been Parnas\u2019 attorney and is Trump\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nDonaleski, one of the prosecutors, said there was already a legal team in place to deal with privilege issues.\n\nProsecutors said Parnas and Fruman funneled money from an unnamed Russian businessman to political candidates in several states to help the businessman obtain permits needed for a proposed marijuana business, which never materialized. U.S. law prohibits foreign donations to political campaigns.\n\nProsecutors say Parnas and Fruman committed to raise $20,000 for Sessions as part of an effort to get Trump to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThat effort was carried out at the request of at least one Ukrainian official, prosecutors said.\n\nTrump ordered Yovanovitch removed in May. Yovanovitch testified in the House impeachment inquiry on Oct. 11.\n\nIMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nA former Sessions staffer, Caroline Boothe, is cooperating with the Manhattan prosecutors\u2019 investigation, her lawyer confirmed on Wednesday. Boothe\u2019s cooperation was first reported by The Hill.\n\nSessions previously confirmed he too was cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on Trump\u2019s request in a July phone call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a former vice president and a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The request came after Trump had withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine, which he later released.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on a domestic political opponent for his own political benefit.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and described the impeachment probe as a partisan smear.\n\nTwo other men charged in the marijuana business scheme, Andrey Kukushkin and David Correia, pleaded not guilty last Thursday.", "description": "Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who helped U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, investigate political rival Joe Biden pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to illegally funneling money to a pro-Trump election committee and other politicians.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444345993&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1O7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
