We have completed our review, and instructed our officers to treat these as an oversized liquid.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause these bottles contain liquids larger than 3.4 ounces, they should be put in checked baggage or emptied to be brought on as carry-on items,\u201d it continued. \u201cTSA officers will maintain the discretion to prohibit any item through the screening checkpoint if they believe it poses a security threat.\u201d\n\nA few days after Galaxy\u2019s Edge finally opened in Disney World to \u201cthousands\u201d of visitors on Aug. 29 \u2013 despite the threat of Hurricane Dorian \u2013 fans caused a fuss when the TSA ruled that the popular souvenir, inspired by the weapons used by the beloved film franchise\u2019s Stormtroopers and bounty hunters, were effectively banned from all airline bags, TravelPulse reports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nNow, the security agency has slightly softened its stance on the souvenir.\n\nMeanwhile, light sabers are, surprisingly, allowed in the high skies, in both carry-on and checked bags.\n\n\u201cSadly, the technology doesn't currently exist to create a real lightsaber.
