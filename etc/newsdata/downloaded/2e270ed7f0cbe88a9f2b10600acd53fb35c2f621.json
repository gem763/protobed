Many Italian Americans honor their heritage on Columbus Day with parades and festivals.\n\nHowever, in recent years, indigenous people and others have rallied against the holiday, claiming Columbus enslaved and murdered many indigenous people. There is now a growing movement to reclaim the day in honor of indigenous people and their unique cultures and contributions.\n\nAt least eight states and 130 cities have legally changed the holiday to Indigenous Peoples Day, including Wisconsin, where Gov. Tony Evers signed an executive order on Oct. 7.\n\nOther states are attempting to find a middle ground. Earlier this year, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Sitt signed legislation recognizing the day as both Native Americans Day and Columbus Day.\n\nSome have replaced Columbus Day with other titles related to the Native American community. Summit City, Ohio, selected \"First Peoples Day\" and Hawaii switched to \"Discoverers Day.\"\n\nThe city council in Washington, D.C., passed emergency legislation last week to rename the federal holiday. For the change to become permanent, it requires congressional approval within 225 days, according to the city council.", "description": "Statues of Christopher Columbus were vandalized amid continued calls to change the name of the federal holiday honoring the explorer.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/columbus-statue-rhode-island-ap-jt-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
