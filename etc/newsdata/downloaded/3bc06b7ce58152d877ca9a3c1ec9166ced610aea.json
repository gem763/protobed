However, even with the association\u2019s first meeting just weeks away, a recent Journal report revealed there\u2019s been little concrete support from the 28 groups involved. As of this week, not a single one had committed to the project beyond a non-binding referendum nor paid the $US10 ($15) million investment Facebook requested, according to the Journal.\n\nIt\u2019s currently unsure how PayPal\u2019s announcement shakes up the association\u2019s plans or Libra\u2019s planned 2020 debut moving forward; the group\u2019s head of policy and communications, Dante Disparte, doesn\u2019t mention it in their statement provided to Gizmodo, preferring instead to focus on the \u201cboldness\u201d and \u201cfortitude\u201d required of its supporters in this \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d, which makes Libra sound more like a Star Trek expedition than a cryptocurrency scheme.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later,\u201d writes Disparte of PayPal\u2019s decision.\n\nYou can read the statement in full below:\n\nIt requires a certain boldness and fortitude to take on an endeavour as ambitious as Libra - a generational opportunity to get things right and improve financial inclusion. The journey will be long and challenging. The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard. Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.\n\nFacebook\u2019s endured plenty of heat since announcing Libra back in June, making PayPal\u2019s withdrawal feel like the first inevitable crack in an already shaky foundation. Plans for Facebook\u2019s s cryptocurrency have prompted scrutiny from sceptical banking and antitrust officials in India, China, the EU, and multiple branches of the U.S. government. And the \u201ccrypto mafia\u201d of corporate and non-profit Libra supporters have been purportedly showing signs of cold feet for months, worrying that moving forward with the project could put their organisations under a similar regulatory microscope from governments worldwide. According to the Journal\u2019s sources, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, and PayPal itself have already fielded requests from the Department of Justice to hand over a \u201ccomplete overview of their money-laundering compliance programs and how Libra will fit into them.\u201d\n\nOutside of its cryptocurrency development, Facebook is also reportedly facing a DOJ antitrust probe in addition to similar investigations from the Federal Trade Commission and multiple states. And he\u2019s already promised to go toe-to-toe with Senator Elizabeth Warren or any other 2020 presidential candidate that tries to break up big tech companies while in office. Which all seems to suggest PayPal might have the right idea in giving Facebook a wide berth.", "description": "A few days after the Wall Street Journal reported that a few corporate supporters of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency were considering bowing out of its so-called \u201ccrypto mafia\u201d, PayPal became the first to do so Friday, announcing that it will no longer participate in the Libra Association....", "authors": ["Tom Mckay", "George Dvorsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/hgsn1wmedmnaf0zaumhi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
