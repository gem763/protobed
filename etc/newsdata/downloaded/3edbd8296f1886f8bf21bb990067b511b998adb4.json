Followers of the group were often called \"Moonies\" by critics, who raised questions over how it indoctrinated members, according to Reuters. In the early 1990s, the group was believed to have as many as 7 million followers in 180 nations.\n\nThe organization was banned in Germany and other European continues in the 1990s because it was viewed as a dangerous religious sect, DutchNews.nl reported.\n\nAmong the rituals the \"Moonies\" at the farm in the Netherlands had to do were walking in a circle every 30 minutes, according to RTV Drenthe. After the family was initially taken off the farm on Monday, the family members continued to walk outside in laps every 30 minutes.\n\nBystanders saw the odd behavior and began taking photos, prompting Dutch authorities to relocate the family, according to the broadcaster.\n\nFAMILY OF 7 DISCOVERED LIVING IN DUTCH FARM CELLAR FOR YEARS WAITING FOR WORLD TO END\n\nThe six members of the family, reportedly a father and children aged 18-25, were discovered this week living in what local mayor Roger de Groot called \"improvised rooms\" on a farm in the Netherlands' rural east.\n\nThe father of the family reportedly had a cerebral infection three years ago that left him paralyzed, which allowed the family to keep receiving money from the organization. A large amount of cash has been found on the farm, RTV Drenthe reported.\n\nThey were discovered after a 25-year-old man left the farm, visited a local bar and raised the alarm. Dutch media reported Wednesday that the young man, Jan Zon van Dorsten, had been active in recent weeks on social media, including saying that he worked for a company run by the suspect who is to be charged.\n\nDrone images of the farm showed a cluster of buildings with a large vegetable garden on one side. The small property appeared to be ringed by a fence and largely obscured by trees.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile Dutch media reported the family was living on the farm allegedly \"waiting for the end of time,\" officials have not released any additional details. The Drenthe Police Department said a Large Scale Investigation Team is now operating at the farm, and investigators are probing possible criminal charges, according to police.\n\n\"We understand that everyone still has many questions. We have that, too. That is why we want to do our research thoroughly and carefully,\" police said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The family discovered living mostly isolated from the outside world on a farm in the Netherlands for nearly a decade may have been associated with the\u00a0South Korean-based Unification Church, Dutch media reported Thursday.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
