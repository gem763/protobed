He stepped down as CEO Tuesday and will take a new role as non-executive chairman, the company said.\n\nNothing has been finalized and the office-sharing company\u2019s IPO plans could change, the people said.\n\nA representative for WeWork declined to comment.\n\nWeWork, or We Co. as it was renamed, had initially sought to price its offering by Sept. 27, a person familiar with the matter said this month. Last week, it delayed its IPO roadshow, saying it planned to complete the offering by the end of the year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that WeWork was unlikely to go public this year.\n\nThe delay would sideline what was expected to have been the second-biggest IPO in the U.S. this year. It also threatens a $6 billion credit financing that was contingent on a successful offering. WeWork had touted it as one of the biggest pre-IPO credit facilities ever assembled.\n\nThe credit facility will be unwound if the IPO doesn\u2019t happen this year, a person with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nFor more on WeWork, check out the Decrypted podcast:\n\nThe company is in talks with investment banks about a new $3 billion loan, which would also be contingent on raising a substantial amount of new equity, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg Tuesday. A likely source of that equity infusion is SoftBank Group Corp., the company\u2019s largest shareholder, they said.\n\n(Updates in eighth paragraph with details of credit facility unwinding if IPO doesn\u2019t happen this year.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.net;Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net, Michael Hytha, Matthew Monks\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- WeWork will likely postpone its initial public offering until next year, after co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down as chief executive officer, according to people familiar with the matter.The latest delay follows the tumult over Neumann\u2019s handling of the company\u2019s IPO plans made public", "authors": ["Gillian Tan", "Ellen Huet"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/InLAsc4lT2x7aIVNg3zZ0A--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b6ffaefbfe5868bbc77623f316ccaf24", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
