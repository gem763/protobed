Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should be worried about her own reelection chances instead of helping Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on the presidential campaign trail, Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think AOC should be far less concerned with really campaigning for Bernie Sanders. She should be worried about her own back because I think she\u2019s going to have a more difficult time with re-election than she thinks,\u201d Lahren said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nFox News has learned that Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally following the senator's recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS\n\nCNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.\n\nThat makes three members of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of far-left freshman members of Congress who are lining up behind Sanders for president.\n\n\"The fact that we're in a place in this country that we take any of those three seriously, let alone elect them to office, is also appalling to me,\" Lahren added.\n\nThe endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nHUNTER MAY HAVE MADE 'MILLIONS' IN UKRAINE, NEWLY REVEALED DOCS SUGGEST\n\nWord of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.\n\nWinning the OK of the \u201cSquad\u201d members was also viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens \u2014 Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., was ready to make an endorsement \u2014 either of Sanders or any other candidate.\n\nLahren said the endorsements are not shocking or important to the race.\n\n\"We know that they were going to endorse Bernie Sanders. They're all socialists. The bigger problem here is that that is actually happening in an election for president of the United States.\"\n\nFox News' Dom Calicchio and Julia Musto contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Wednesday that \u00a0Rep.
