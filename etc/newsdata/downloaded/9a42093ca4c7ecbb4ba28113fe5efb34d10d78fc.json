He clinched by firing an ace down the middle.\n\nFederer broke again to begin the second set, taking his chance with a powerful forehand winner down the line.\n\nVictory lifted Federer to a 50-8 record in 2019. It's his third straight year of 50 wins since an injury-ravaged season ended early in 2016.\n\nThiem 'able to pull through'\n\nIn Vienna, top seed Dominic Thiem came back from a set down to earn a 3-6 7-5 6-3 victory over Italy's Matteo Berrettini on Saturday to advance to his first Vienna Open final.\n\nWith the home crowd behind Thiem at the Wiener Stadthalle, the 26-year-old broke Berrettini five times in the contest and became the first Austrian to reach the tournament's final since Juergen Melzer beat compatriot Andreas Haider-Maurer in 2010.\n\n\"I've never experienced such a great atmosphere here,\" Thiem said. \"It was full from the first point on, such a loud atmosphere as well.\n\n\"It was perfect to play in and the match was on a very high level from the first to the last point. With all the support and home advantage, I was able to pull through.\"\n\nNo player has won more matches than Thiem when play goes to a deciding set this season (11 wins) and the victory also ended Berrettini's streak of 28 wins when he had taken the opening set.\n\nThiem will now play Argentina's fifth seed Diego Schwartzman who beat French fourth seed Gael Monfils 6-3 6-2 in the other semi-final.\n\n\"I am very confident now,\" Thiem added. It was a tough match mentally and physically... There is going to be an amazing energy again tomorrow.\"", "description": "Roger Federer delighted his hometown fans by cruising past Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-4 in the Swiss Indoors semifinals on Saturday.
