Big ones.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s unloading stocks and looking to \u201ctake stabs on the short side,\u201d he\u2019s not completely apocalyptic with his view.\n\n\u201cI am not turning into one of those the end-of-the-world-is-upon-us bears. Yet I think the time to be heavily long is past,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next 5%-10% in the stock market is more likely to be down than higher.\u201d\n\nNo sign of a pullback on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.61% shaking off premarket weakness to turn positive.", "description": "Looking for reasons to bail on this market?
