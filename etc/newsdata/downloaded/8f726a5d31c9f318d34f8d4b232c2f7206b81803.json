They see us and they think we are the characters. It comes with the territory of being with a show that is this enormous.\"\n\nAnd that people believe in, or want to believe in.\n\nThe cast of \"Downton Abbey,\" a new film based on the internationally-popular TV series. Focus Features\n\n\"Ground Zero\" of the fantasy is the building which stars as Downton Abbey: Highclere Castle outside London. Recently its owner, the 8th Earl of Carnarvon, and his wife, Lady Carnarvon, were judging a Downton-themed costume contest, where commoners channel their inner aristocrat.\n\nHere, public passion is fueling private enterprise. For a fee, visitors can tour the magnificent rooms and the castle grounds where the Crawley family drama unfolds.\n\n\"I dare say that the silhouette of Highclere is perhaps now more famous than that of Buckingham Palace,\" said Palmer.\n\n\"It has become very famous throughout the whole world,\" said Lady Carnarvon. \"But I wouldn't want to myself in front of Her Majesty the Queen!\"\n\nActually, word is the Queen is a fan \u2013 as are millions of Americans, like these who spotted Hugh Bonneville (the actor who plays Lord Grantham) at Highclere.\n\nActor Hugh Bonneville poses with \"Downton Abbey\" fans at Highclere Castle. CBS News\n\nThe appeal of \"Downton Abbey,\" Bonneville told us, is universal: \"I go back to when I first read the first script, and these characters popped off the page at me. They were engaging, and they were vivid.\n\n\"And more to the point, I wanted to know what happened next. It was a page-turner.\"\n\nJim Carter as Mr. Carson in \"Downtown Abbey,\" a new film inspired by the award-winning television series. Focus Features\n\nBut not everyone was initially sold on the show. \"The notion of costume drama, certainly in Britain, was being written off,\" said Bonneville. \"We couldn't even get anyone to interview us.\"\n\nThat didn't last long. Soon, the series was a triumph, and its characters household names.\n\nLesley Nicol, who plays the cook, Mrs. Patmore, said the series had changed her life. \"Oh blimey, in so many ways. I don't know how long you've got. But personally, professionally, ways I couldn't possibly have thought could happen. The fact that I support a charity in China, which would never have happened if 160 million people in China didn't watch 'Downton Abbey'!\"\n\nMichelle Dockery, Elizabeth McGovern and Laura Carmichael in \"Downton Abbey.\" Focus Features\n\nAllen Leech made his name as Tom Branson, the ex-chauffeur who marries into the Crawley family.\n\nPalmer said, \"You must ask yourself why it has been such a blockbuster success?\"\n\n\"Yeah, and I still just struggle to find an answer for that,\" Leech replied. \"Even Julian himself struggles to find an answer. He says, 'You know, it's like lightning in a bottle.' If he could bottle it, he'd sell it, you know?\"\n\nPart of the answer is that Julian Fellowes' script created a refuge from our turbulent times, a reassuring world where everyone has a place, from the lord of the manor, to Carson the butler, played by Jim Carter.\n\n\"It's uncynical,\" Carter said. \"There are no men with guns. There's no violence. It's about romance. It's also harks back nostalgically to a time when things felt more settled.\"\n\nThat's not to say the movie doesn't innovate. There are a few new faces, including Jim Carter's real-life wife, Imelda Staunton.\n\nWhen asked how intimidating it was for her to join the cast's \"family,\" Staunton said, \"To be fair, when I arrived it felt very familiar because I have been living with Carson for quite some time!\"\n\nHer character, Maud Bagshaw, gets to cross swords with Maggie Smith's Violet Crawley. \"You know, with Maggie, if any of us had the lines that she has, none of us could deliver them like she does,\" Staunton said.\n\n\"Downton Abbey,\" the movie, has a bigger budget than the TV series, and it shows. But it seems money was never the magic ingredient. \"A lot of it is luck,\" said Fellowes. \"You luck out, and you get the right combinations all down the line, and people keep coming back for more. And I really think it's as simple as that.\"\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"Downton Abbey,\" click on the video player below:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mikaela Bufano.", "description": "The cast, and the castle, of the internationally-popular TV series about the upper-class Crawleys and their working-class servants are back in a theatrical feature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/261b3bf8-b8f1-476d-b5d5-1aedacbc646f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/bb78c64be1a9ea5840907bd11b5a4a89/downton-abbey-movie-cast-members-focus-features.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
