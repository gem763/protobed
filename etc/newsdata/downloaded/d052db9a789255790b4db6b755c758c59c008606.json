USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The Houston Astros rotation hogged the spotlight all season.\n\nIt was Justin Verlander this, Gerrit Cole that, Zack Greinke this, Wade Miley that.\n\nWell, now that they have taken their act to Broadway, the garage band has taken over the show.\n\nThe performers\u2019 names may be anonymous to everyone outside the 713 area code, but the Astros\u2019 bullpen suddenly have become the stars of this American League Championship Series.\n\nThe Astros, 4-1 winners over the New York Yankees on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium, now have a commanding 2-1 lead in this best-of-seven series, thanks to their unknown cast of characters.\n\nThe series isn\u2019t over, but the Astros are in control, and even could have Mother Nature helping them out.\n\nGerrit Cole struck out seven batters over seven scoreless innings. (Photo: Mike Stobe, Getty Images)\n\nGame 4 is expected to be postponed Wednesday with heavy rain in the New York forecast, meaning that if the ALCS went seven games, there would be four consecutive games with no rest.\n\nThat would create huge problems for the Yankees, who heavily rely on their bullpen, with Yankees manager Aaron Boone having yet to deploy any of his relievers in three consecutive games this season.\n\nNow, he may have no choice, particularly with a starting rotation that again force him to go to the bullpen early, with Luis Severino lasting just 4 \u2153 innings.\n\nThe Astros, after Cole\u2019s latest masterpiece, pitching seven scoreless innings, now will have former Cy Young winners Greinke and Verlander available to start Games 4 and 5, and if needed Cole for Game 7.\n\nALCS: Correa loses his mind after saving Astros' season\n\nMLB PLAYOFFS: Our idea for a new postseason award\n\nThey\u2019ll eat up innings, and permit Astros manager A.J. Hinch to mix and match with his own bullpen, keeping them fresh.\n\n\u201cWhen the bullpen comes in game after game after game, you get a little bit more of a fatigue version of that reliever,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said, \u201cor you get a little bit more of the same sequence. The hitters can get a little bit better idea how they're going to be attacked.\u2019\u2019\n\nYep, three games in, and the Astros now have seen the Yankees\u2019 bullpen plenty, and appear more comfortable by the day.\n\nSeverino gave up two runs, and when the Yankees bullpen came in, they were helpless to stop the damage. The Astros blew it open in the seventh inning when Adam Ottavino self-destructed, with the Astros scoring two runs on nothing more than a single, thanks to two walks, a wild pitch and a sacrifice fly.\n\nCole, 19-0 since May 22, pitched seven shutout innings, but walked a season-high five batters, turning the game over to the bullpen in the eighth inning.\n\nWell, after pitching 4 \u2153 shutout innings in their 3-2, 11-inning victory in Game 2, giving up just one hit while striking out five with two walks, came back for an encore, and once again closed the door.\n\nWill Harris, who has yet to give up a run this postseason, after yielding a franchise-best 1.50 ERA in 68 regular-season appearances, got the final two outs of the eighth.\n\nAnd closer Roberto Osuna, who pitched 1 \u2154 scoreless innings in Game 2, saved his eight consecutive game.\n\nBallgame.\n\nAnd just like that, the script for this series has been turned upside down.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 bullpen, filled with marquee stars like Aroldis Chapman, Zack Britton, Ottavino and company, now are taking a back seat to the Astros.\n\nYes, a bullpen that could walk the streets of New York wearing their uniforms and no one would recognize them.\n\n\u201cSo far, everybody we\u2019ve played has had a better bullpen than us,\u201d said Smith, who looks like every other Joe Smith you met in life. \u201cWe look at the guys we\u2019ve got, and we know how good we can be.\n\n\u201cWe just smile and nod, and go about our business, and hopefully we come out on top.\u201d\n\nWell, by the time the World Series starts, maybe everyone will finally learn their names.\n\nThey\u2019re making a convincing case it will open in Houston.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Gerrit Cole tossed seven scoreless innings against the Yankees to lead the Astros to Game 3 victory of the ALCS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
