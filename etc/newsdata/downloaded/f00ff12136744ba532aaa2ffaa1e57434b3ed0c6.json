The turnout of 61 per cent was the highest in three decades.\n\nThe result puts the party within touching distance of an absolute majority in the 360-seat lower house of parliament. If nothing changes Law and Justice will get about 236 seats, giving it a slender majority.\n\nIt amounted to a resounding endorsement of Law and Justice's policies, including controversial reforms that have encountered fierce domestic and international criticism.\n\nAccording to the European Union, the ruling party's overhaul of Poland's courts and public prosecution over the past four years has eroded the country's judicial independence.\n\nThe party also used public media to promote its successes and to cast a poor light on the opposition.
