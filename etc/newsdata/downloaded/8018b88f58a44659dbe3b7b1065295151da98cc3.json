The clothes are made locally at its founder, Jaen Roussou\u2019s home.\n\nThe Blue Crane Hoodie Elite gives outdoors types a smorgasbord of hidden pockets and handy outdoor gizmos to play with - all packed into one jacket.\n\nI tested the hoodie under a variety of weather conditions from cold nights out in a quiver tree forest in the empty expanse of the Karoo, to rain and fog on the top of Lion\u2019s Head.\n\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n\nThe hoodie proved to be extremely warm and comfortable and makes for a perfect travel jacket whether you are planning a trip to the Karoo or to visit the northern hemisphere in the middle of Winter.\n\nThe assortment of 27 features range from bottle opener zip-heads to hidden lens cleaners \u2013 which are really cool tools to have on you.\n\nMy favourite was the jacket\u2019s built-in facemask.\n\n&amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;gt;\n\nIt not only saves me from buying 'buffs' that I constantly misplace, but is great for cool mornings up on a mountain or a night out photographing star trails. It also makes you look like a ninja, which I am totally down with.\n\nThis inside lining of the hoodie is super comfortable.\n\nThe hood is lined with Mongolian fleece which is so soft you don\u2019t need a pillow. I found myself more than once easily drifting off to sleep on rocks and other hard surfaces.\n\n\n\nIf you get too hot the hoodie can be folded into a bag, which is built into the back.\n\nSelling for R969 it comes off as extremely affordable for what you get.\n\nCompared with puff jackets its price comes off much cheaper and offers the bonus of it being waterproof material. The inside on the body is lined with 160 gram cotton which if I were to compare it in terms of warmth, I would put it at the same warmth level as a 600-fill power down jacket - the type of jackets that sell for R1,999.\n\nIt is, however, not as compactable as the puff jackets.\n\nWhich makes it quite a challenge to squeeze into your camera bag, when you have limited space being fully loaded with gear.\n\nThere were some features which I found strange like the 250ml foldable water bottle - I took it off within the first couple of wears and didn\u2019t put it back on.\n\nIt holds the equivalent of a glass of water, or very small bottle of water, which for me isn't nearly enough. I usually carry at a minimum 500ml, even on short hikes. You never know how long you are going to be up on a mountain, and getting lost with a mere cup of water is not ideal. (Warning: the video contains a cat photobomb.)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nSecondly, the water bottle clips in an awkward location for walking. It makes a racket when empty and when filled it knocks your knees when hiking uphill. Logically the bottle should be kept on your back where it won\u2019t bump around.\n\n\n\n</div>\n\nThe hoodie is not light by any stretch of the imagination and can get quite heavy if you are climbing Lions Head.\n\nWhile it will never be able to compete with the lightness of puff jackets, I didn't expect it to be so heavy. It more than makes up for that in durability, comfort and pocket space. You also don\u2019t feel like you need to walk gingerly past every thorny bush you come across in case you blow a goose-down panel.\n\nA final bugbear was the \u2018crane beak\u2019 hood that blocks your vision.\n\nThe peak of the hood is stylised after the beak of the Blue Crane. While the design is cool and I feel awesome looking like I\u2019ve come straight out a video game like Assassins Creed, functionally the hood tends to slip over your head and block your vision.\n\nVerdict: a bargain at the price.\n\nThe hoodie gives you all the variety you would expect from a Swiss Army knife of hoodies. Like most utility knives you\u2019ll get some strange utensils you\u2019ll never use, but the tools you do like more than make up for it.\n\nAt R969 it is a bargain and you are getting way more than what you should for that price. Plus you\u2019ll wear it and feel like a ninja.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "South African indie-clothing company Youneek has come out with the most versatile hoodies we have seen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9310/407409e481054e6787772b967f0da833.jpg"}
