Therefore, it is only fitting that we meet the new term on the block: \u201cthe broken rung\u201d.\n\nRecent research reveals that a \u201cbroken rung\u201d exists between entry-level and management positions for women, forestalling female talent from reaching the boardroom. The research also shows that the representation of women at the C-suite level has inched ever so slowly upwards in the last five years, from 17 to 21 per cent. There can be no doubt that it is a step in the right direction but the momentum could gather a bit quicker.\n\nThe Women in the Workplace report, carried out by management consultants McKinsey for Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Lean In initiative, took place over five years, drawing in data from 590 companies, totalling 22 million employees \u2013 so it\u2019s safe to say the research is a fair reflection of what is happening to a lot of women in work all over the world.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAssumptions and bias (eg \u201cnot hiring a woman of a certain age as she\u2019ll probably vanish off to have a child soon\u201d) have huge effects on women\u2019s careers. The cry from companies that they are only paying men more because they are in senior positions is really starting to get old. Gender pay gap reporting data, required from UK companies with over 250 employees since 2017, has even, at times, been shown to be implausible \u2013 and if they thought no one would bother to calculate the sums and call them out, they were wrong.\n\n\u201cFemale-related sectors\u201d are often low-paid (such as childcare, cleaning, catering, clerical work) but even when women rise to the top of male-related sectors, they earn less \u2013 because women\u2019s work is valued less. At the other end of the spectrum, it was discovered by Cornell University that while a janitor\u2019s job (traditionally a male occupation) is low-paid, it\u2019s still 22 per cent more than a cleaner\u2019s job (traditionally a female occupation). One could argue a janitor and a cleaner is not exactly like for like, but we\u2019re talking less apples and oranges than we are Braeburn and Pink Lady.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world 1/14 Marley Dias @iammarleydias At just 11 years old, Marley Dias gained international attention in 2016 after becoming frustrated with the lack of diversity in her school curriculum. What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma. Getty 8/14 Adwoa Aboah @adwoaaboah British model Adwoa Aboah is no stranger to the crippling effect of depression having suffered from it herself. This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard. Blanchard was very vocal in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shootings earlier this year, talking with activists and highlighting their plight on social media. Getty 13/14 Liv Little @livlittle As the founder of Gal-dem, a magazine produced by women of colour, Liv Little has gained international recognition for her work in diversifying print media. After becoming frustrated with the lack of representation at Bristol University where Little attended, the 25-year-old created the publication in an attempt to give women of colour a voice in the media. Her business is growing rapidly, alongside Gal-dem\u2019s social media following which stands at more than 111,000. Little can be found on Twitter talking about everything from activism to literature.

There are, in fact, more men named David or Dave at the helm of FTSE 100 companies than there are women. (In the US, the name\u2019s John.) And another fun fact: those female FTSE 100 bosses? They\u2019re paid on average \u00a3300,000 less than the 94 male counterparts.\n\nIt\u2019s highly demotivating to think your efforts, your input, skills and expertise don\u2019t merit that of a human who happens to have a different chromosomal coupling.\n\nThe report showed that while men are hired and promoted on the basis of their expected potential, women are often hired and promoted on the strength of their past achievements. Hence why many women don\u2019t apply for jobs unless they meet every single criteria listed in a job description. We assume that it is necessary for us to fit perfectly into a particular slot described by a list of bullet points, as opposed to opening a potential employer\u2019s eyes to the skills and experience we do have that could be invaluable to them. Women look at the world of work and wonder where they can fit into it; where can I cause the least disruption and help the most? Men, research suggests, mainly consider how they can change the world of work around them to suit their end goal.\n\nBut to be clear, this is not at all an exercise in men-bashing. In my own experience, my male bosses have been by far superior in terms of my personal and professional development when compared to the women for whom I have worked. Possibly this has been bad luck. But those in senior positions who do possess the double-X chromosome pattern could probably do better at helping a sister out as well.\n\nThe male-dominated corporate world \u2013 in fact, the world in general (also, mainly dominated by men) \u2013 has cultivated the \u201cqueen bee syndrome\u201d whereby women in a senior position treat their female subordinates in a harsher manner than they would a man. Not only can senior women be tough on their junior colleagues but also, according to Harvard\u2019s Professor Robin Ely, junior women can judge their senior females equally harshly due to their bosses\u2019 failure to live up to high expectations as trailblazers.\n\nWomen\u2019s experiences in the workplace will only ever improve if everyone \u2013 male and female \u2013 recognises that biases and challenges still remain, and that we all need to work together for change.
