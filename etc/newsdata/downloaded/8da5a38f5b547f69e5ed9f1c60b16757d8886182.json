The Browns both work demanding jobs and have two young sons. They bought the house in June using Knock, a company that\u2019s trying to revolutionize the real-estate industry with a \u201chome trade-in platform\u201d making it easier to buy and sell at once. That solution was ideal for the Browns, who are just as busy as most couples but more introverted, making the idea of prospective buyers tramping through their private space seem excruciating.\n\nAcross town, Martha Seay was overseeing movers in a rambling brown ranch-style house nestled among tall hickory trees. The day before, she had closed on the sale of the house, where she and her husband had raised their family, to the real-estate company Zillow. The next day she would leave for Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, where the couple had just bought a retirement home.\n\nSeay had wanted to move for years, but the idea of selling was daunting: \u201cI said, maybe next year, maybe next year, maybe next year, because I didn\u2019t want to go through all the crap you have to go through.\u201d Selling to a company took just a few clicks and one visit from an appraiser. Seay was delighted. \u201cI cannot tell you how much the stress was relieved,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Browns and Seay are the consumer faces of the disruption that\u2019s currently roiling residential real estate. As different models \u2014 home trade-in companies, \u201ciBuyers,\u201d partnerships between new upstarts and old stalwarts \u2014 clamor for attention, lots of attention is focused on trying to determine what\u2019s here to stay and what\u2019s just an awkward rough draft \u2014 the Pets.com of the housing market.\n\nBut these families are also part of a massive industrial revolution. Information technology has remade processes as disparate as ordering dinner delivery, hailing a cab and trading stocks. Now it\u2019s coming for an industry so 20th century that much of the paperwork is still done on paper, where customers are often steered among professionals scratching each other\u2019s backs, and where there\u2019s enormous incentive for the incumbents to keep it hard for customers to manage on their own.\n\nThe stakes are big: $74 billion of real-estate-agent commissions were paid out in 2018, and investors have poured billions into all kinds of disrupters. Early adopters like the Browns and Seay provide a glimpse of what the future real-estate market could look like. But just as online retail has hurt the bricks-and-mortar retail industry, and tech-enabled social networks have changed not just high-school reunions but the political process, data-fied real estate could upend our lives in many ways, some we can\u2019t even comprehend yet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s over 100 million active users on Zillow Z, +0.46% and Trulia every month, but only 6 million people buy and sell houses every year,\u201d said Charles Folsom, Knock\u2019s director of customer service. \u201cEven if they\u2019re just window shopping, there\u2019s clearly a desire there. If you can empower the American Dream and enable mobility at the same time, that\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d\n\nZillow, a company that maintains an uneasy truce with real-estate agents even as it increasingly tries to automate the work they\u2019ve done for decades, may have even bigger ambitions.\n\nKrishna Rao, a Zillow analytics executive, likened the current evolution in real estate to the democratization of stock trading decades ago. Not only is it possible to look up the value of any stock instantly today, he noted, but \u201cthere\u2019s a kind of perpetual bid-ask spread on every stock, right? I think we\u2019re a long way away from that in the real-estate space, but how do we take incremental steps toward it?\u201d\n\nZillow sees the listing price as a \u2018machine learning\u2019 exercise\n\nIn 2018, Zillow took what had been a small pilot program and announced it was going whole hog into iBuying, the practice of buying homes directly from consumers. (The term iBuying is also sometimes called \u201cinstant offers\u201d; Zillow\u2019s program is called Zillow Offers.)\n\nRao, a macroeconomist by training, had joined Zillow in 2013 after a stint at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the thick of the financial crisis. At Zillow, he helped analyze and make useful the enormous quantities of data the company captures for the Zestimate and other reports and forecasts.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, Zillow bought more than 1,500 homes and sold nearly 800; it has said it aims to transact 10 times that amount. Rao\u2019s group is in charge of thinking about how it should all work: What should the company pay for a home? What should it be listed for \u2014 and how much would the company sell it for? How quickly will it sell? What upgrades are necessary, and which contractors should be dispatched to do the work?\n\nMore to the point, when your \u201cinventory\u201d is dozens of houses scattered around a sprawling metro area, with the constant threat of mold, floods, power outages, unmowed lawns, downed tree limbs, etc., who\u2019s keeping an eye on the goods? (Rao told MarketWatch that Zillow is currently recruiting high-level logistics people from the likes of Amazon AMZN, +0.13% and \u201cclassic industrial companies\u201d like General Electric GE, +2.41% to make this transition.)\n\nThe promises \u2014 and the peril \u2014 of this new endeavor are weighty. Zillow\u2019s stock ZG, +0.77% tanked after its last earnings report, in which management revealed that a small sliver of the homes it had purchased were being held longer than they had accounted for.\n\nAnalyst Brad Safalow, who has a short position on Zillow shares, betting on a decline, wrote: \u201cEven a 10% hit to the company\u2019s inventory could cut Zillow\u2019s overall gross profits from its Homes division by 25%! The margin for error in this business is razor thin, and we think investors continue to underestimate the difficulty of this ambitious endeavor.\u201d\n\nBut Zillow bulls, and management, point to what Rao calls its \u201ccompetitive advantage.\u201d\n\nLots of companies have housing-market data about supply \u2014 that is, listings of homes for sale. Zillow\u2019s secret sauce is information about demand, gleaned from 180 million unique website visitors each month. \u201cThat is, seeing who\u2019s searching in this neighborhood and are they also searching in that other neighborhood or are they really just pinned down in this area. What is the demand for three bedrooms like relative to four bedrooms?\u201d and so on, Rao said.\n\nWhat does that mean in real life? Zillow sees the listing price as a \u201cmachine learning\u201d exercise, he said.\n\n\u201cThat machine can look at what the relative demand is for homes like this, relative supply, how that\u2019s trended, and take these gobs of data and crunch it down into a particular listing price. Over time, as that home is listed, we then get more and more granular information \u2014 how well is the home showing? Are we seeing lots of tours, lots of offers? And use that to refine our strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we solve the problem of consumers\u2019 pain\u201d\n\nIn a shared office in Buckhead, an upscale section of Atlanta, the Knock team is working on the same questions. Two of Knock\u2019s co-founders started Trulia, a rival that Zillow eventually bought. Both companies launched as the housing bubble was peaking. Zillow quickly became known for the \u201cZestimate,\u201d a modern marvel of housing clickbait that made the value of a home, previously something an owner considered only infrequently, a near-real-time interactive experience. (The Zestimate preceded Zillow\u2019s listings, while Trulia started by offering online listings and later developed its own home-value-estimation tool.)\n\n\u201cAt Trulia they unlocked the database of listings, and now they\u2019re unlocking the other side \u2014 how do we actually solve the problem of the transaction?\u201d said Stephen Freudenberg, Knock\u2019s first employee and a former real-estate agent. \u201cMost of these other companies are solving for the agent\u2019s pain, not the consumer\u2019s pain.\u201d\n\nKnock does that by helping customers buy a new home \u2014 usually a larger one to accommodate a growing family \u2014 then sells the old one once they\u2019re settled in, and out of the property that needs to be staged and shown. It charges a fee equivalent to 3% of the value of the property the clients have bought and 3% of the cost of the house that gets sold, as well as a small surcharge to cover costs that have been fronted to buying clients, such as initial insurance and escrow payments.\n\nIt\u2019s a personalized model, almost like a concierge service. Yet Knock seems to spend nearly as much time and energy on data analytics, specifically regarding price, as Zillow does. The company recruited its lead data scientist, Rafaan Anvari, from the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nAnvari spent months shadowing Freudenberg, asking a constant stream of questions about how and why Realtors do what they do to create an automated valuation model for homes that understands even better than a seasoned real-estate agent how to gauge pluses, like access to a golf course, against minuses, like proximity to a busy road.\n\nThe back-and-forth went on for months, and some of the futility of getting a machine to learn how to think like a veteran salesperson are captured in their internal chats, as seen below.\n\nTheir automated valuation model is now named \u201cBorg,\u201d after the drone-like cybernetic beings that tried to \u201cassimilate\u201d humanity on \u201cStar Trek.\u201d\n\nThe Knock team doesn\u2019t just think Borg will make Knock more competitive; they think it will solve a lot of what\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s housing market. \u201cAsk five different agents what your house is worth, and you\u2019ll get five completely different answers,\u201d Freudenberg said.\n\nInternally, Knock team members call the existing real-estate ecosystem a \u201cgypsy market\u201d because it\u2019s so antiquated and opaque. \u201cEveryone\u2019s haggling, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re haggling over,\u201d Freudenberg said. \u201cThey\u2019re just making up obscure numbers.\u201d\n\nHe offers an example: A family might spend $100,000 remodeling a kitchen but add only $50,000 to their house\u2019s listing price because properties in the surrounding area, which are comparable listings, might not have such upmarket kitchens. \u201cSo they\u2019re stuck with what the neighborhood sold for, but, if we\u2019re actually looking at the data, then everyone could theoretically get a better deal.\u201d\n\nBorg plugs information including room sizes, home style, outdoor space and more into an algorithm to derive a home\u2019s value. Meanwhile, Zillow is trying to get even more granular, by teaching its machines about internal fixtures and features. The company described that evolution in a July press release about the Zestimate: \u201cThe image-recognition model can classify patterns in the pixels of photographs and correlate them to home value. For example, while the human eye sees tile or granite countertops, the Zestimate identifies two different pixel patterns.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the vast majority of data-science resources in real estate seem to be focusing on home valuation as the end game, as least for now.\n\nRao suggested that may be \u201cbecause it\u2019s a very narrow, well-defined problem, so it\u2019s kind of easy to show progress to investors. We think of the strategy of Zillow Offers not just as a crisper valuation, but kind of an end-to-end experience that can seamlessly integrate the mortgage piece of it, the title, the escrow, and the buying and selling. It\u2019s a big challenge doing all those things at the same time.\u201d\n\nStill, a revolution has to start somewhere. The industry\u2019s focus on automating valuations means that, very soon, the Federal Reserve is likely to finalize a regulation stating that appraisals will no longer be required on most property sales valued at up to $400,000.\n\nTo Dahlia Brown, the Knock customer in Marietta, having an algorithm at the heart of the real-estate market may help counter human bias by limiting \u201csome of the historical practices that maybe have kept certain people from home ownership,\u201d she said. \u201cThis process actually seems as fair and equitable as it could be.\u201d\n\nDahlia Brown and family in front of their Marietta home.\n\nStill, it goes without saying that the real-estate industry and the capital markets and venture capitalists that fund them aren\u2019t developing better data tools to create a more equitable playing field for families moving into their forever homes.\n\nHouseCanary, a platform that aggregates what CEO Jeremy Sicklick called \u201cmillions of data elements\u201d to come up with home-price valuations, forecasts of where prices are going and rental valuations for properties, has raised over $60 million from investors.\n\nWith HouseCanary, investors, like those who buy single-family homes to rent out, can see a property\u2019s status change, like a price drop or a default, in nearly real-time, Sicklick said. \u201cWe\u2019re helping them identify real-estate opportunities within five minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into a world of programmatic trading in real estate with large institutional investors that we help enable.\u201d\n\nWith so many concerns about institutional investors like Blackstone BX, +1.57% snatching up homes to rent out, keeping low- and moderate-income Americans locked out of property ownership, is that a good thing?\n\n\u201cI actually think it\u2019s a great thing,\u201d Sicklick said. \u201cWhat I think it does is it adds liquidity into the market. The iBuyers and the large institutional investors create a very liquid floor price for someone looking to sell and drive a faster transaction.\u201d\n\nThere has to be a better way\n\nFor now, that model is as imminent as, say, driverless cars. Knock, Zillow and other upstarts are still plying their trade in a mostly 20th-century housing market. The Brown family, for example, contacted Knock, got pre-approved for a mortgage, had their house assessed, and started touring new homes within a week. But they hadn\u2019t even moved out when their agent urged them to hurry to get the property prepped for sale, to take advantage of the waning spring selling season.\n\nThe Browns are happy with the outcome and say that having the process whiz by so quickly \u2014 two months, start to finish \u2014 lessened the stress of having to do precisely what they dreaded in the first place: let strangers poke around their home. But it\u2019s still worth noting that traditional cycles of demand and habits are trumping the potential that new models offer, at least for now.\n\nThe question remains: How much of what comes next comes down to algorithms, and how much to process? For now, the onslaught of machine learning in the housing market continues unabated. As Knock\u2019s data team might say, resistance is futile.", "description": "Artificial intelligence in housing won\u2019t just eliminate Realtors.
