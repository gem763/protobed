It is marked with mourning rituals and passion plays re-enacting Hussein's martyrdom.\n\nOne of the rituals is known as the \"Tuwairij run\", which sees pilgrims run down streets leading to the Imam Hussein Mosque in commemoration of the run from the ancient village of Tuwairij to Karbala that was undertaken during the 7th Century battle by the cousins of Hussein's half-brother Abbas.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shia Muslims mark the holy day of Ashura in the Iraqi city of Karbala\n\nA spokesman for Karbala province's media office told the BBC that as hundreds of thousands of people undertook the Tuwairij run one person stumbled and fell over, causing others to fall and triggering the deadly stampede.\n\nHowever, security officials told the Associated Press that the stampede began when a walkway collapsed.\n\nIn 2004, more than 140 people were killed in a series of near-simultaneous bombings at shrines in Karbala and Baghdad during Ashura.\n\nThe following year, at least 965 pilgrims were killed in a stampede on a bridge over the River Tigris in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, during a different Shia holy day.
