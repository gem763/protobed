[Photo: Getty]\n\nLady Gaga has shared a video of herself \u201crelaxing\u201d in an ice bath.\n\nIn an Instagram clip that has been viewed more than 4.5 million times, the \u2018Star is Born\u2019 actress can be seen singing along to rock music while seemingly grimacing in discomfort.\n\nJust days earlier, Gaga shared a picture of herself \u201cenjoying\u201d another ice bath, or cryotherapy, as part of her \u201cpost show ritual\u201d.\n\nThe Shallow singer told her 37.4 million followers she soaks in sub-zero temperatures for up to 10 minutes, before enjoying a hot bath for 20 minutes, followed by a \u201ccompression suit packed with ice packs\u201d.\n\nThe Academy Award nominee may be trying to relieve her fibromyalgia, which causes chronic pain all over a sufferer\u2019s body.\n\nThe icy bath may also be an attempt to ease her bumps and bruises after dancing with a fan on stage in Vegas ended with the songstress tumbling into the pit last week.\n\nAs well as Lady Gaga, Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill also swear by cryotherapy after a tough day of competition. With its score of celebrity fans, Yahoo UK looks at the pros and cons of ice baths.\n\nLady Gaga opened up about her fibromyalgia in the 2017 Netflix documentary \u201cGaga: Five Foot Two\u201d.\n\nThe Shallow singer described the condition as a \u201ccyclone of anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, and panic disorder\u201d, which \u201csends the nervous system into overdrive\u201d.\n\nThe NHS does not recommend ice baths for fibromyalgia and even advises patients swim in heated pools or indulge in warm baths to ease their discomfort.\n\nDespite this, fibromyalgia support forums are awash with sufferers asking each other for advice on the alternative treatment.\n\nREAD MORE: Ice Baths!

Lady Gaga Reveals Her Regenerative Postshow Rituals\n\nAfter reviewing 17 studies with a total of 366 people, scientists from the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland found ice baths reduced post-exercise soreness by 20% compared to do nothing.\n\nHowever, cryotherapy was found to be no better at easing discomfort than stretching or compression socks, which may be easier to withstand.\n\nCryotherapy is best associated with athletes, with Murray\u2019s post-match routine reportedly involving a shower and snack followed by an icy dip.\n\nREAD MORE: Lady Gaga takes a nasty tumble off the stage while embracing a fan\n\nEnnis-Hill has also been pictured standing in a wheelie bin of ice to ease her sore muscles after a competitive day on the track.\n\nWhile it may sound unpleasant, advocates allege ice baths help to boost blood flow and reduce inflammation to injured tissue.\n\nTo put this to the test, a study by Edith Cowan University in Western Australia had nine men run for half-an-hour before putting one of their legs in a cold water bath.\n\nAfter just 15 minutes, tissue in the \u201cicy leg\u201d contained significantly more oxygen than the other limb, suggesting improved muscle recovery.\n\nAn animal study also suggests ice baths may reduce inflammation, a key cause of pain and injury among athletes. Scientists from the University of Brasilia exposed injured rats to three 30-minute sessions of cryotherapy.\n\nWithin 48 hours, markers of inflammation had reduced, however, there was no sign of muscle recovery.\n\nWhile it all sounds relatively positive, studies have also shown ice baths may delay muscle repair.\n\nREAD MORE: Lady Gaga Confirms She Has Fibromyalgia\n\nScientists from Kobe University in Japan applied ice packs to the injured limbs of rats for 20 minutes.\n\nCompared to the animals who did not have cryotherapy, this delayed the release of \u201crepair cells\u201d by a day, \u201cimpairing muscle regeneration\u201d.\n\nWhile inflammation may trigger nasty symptoms, it is brought about by the immune system in response to a cut, infection or other damage. This swelling appears alongside the release of immune cells, which are together thought to repair any injuries.\n\nThe Japanese scientists worry suppressing inflammation may ultimately delay muscle regeneration.\n\nREAD MORE: What is fibromyalgia, the chronic illness Lady Gaga suffers from?\n\nAnd when it comes to building muscle, athletes may be better off avoiding chilly water.\n\nA team from the Queensland Academy of Sport in Brisbane had 21 men train for 12 weeks, with some having a 10-minute ice bath after each work out.\n\nCompared to those who bypassed the chilly therapy, the \u201cicy men\u201d gained significantly less strength and muscle mass.\n\nCritics also warn spending any longer than just a few minutes in chilly water could be fatal, with pregnant women, children and those with high blood pressure being advised to avoid ice baths altogether.\n\nOverall, it seems the jury is out when it comes to cryotherapy\u2019s benefits.\n\n\n\n", "description": "In an Instagram clip, the Star is Born actress can be seen singing along to rock music while seemingly grimacing in discomfort.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RfloMzOXLr2oNKrjBwMqeQ--~B/aD01MzA0O3c9Nzk1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7ca5df20-f3e0-11e9-b7fb-497509e7cf17", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
