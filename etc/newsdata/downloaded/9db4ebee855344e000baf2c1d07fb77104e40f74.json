The flanker was everywhere, barking orders, cajoling and encouraging.\n\nHe was surprisingly dropped to the bench for the Ireland game, in what turned out to be a masterstroke by Japan coach Jamie Joseph.\n\nAngry at being left out, a rampaging Leitch turned the game after coming on after just 30 minutes.\n\nHe returned to the back row against Samoa and was comfortably the best player on the pitch, biffing Pacific islanders out of his path with gusto in a rampaging display as he once again led by example.\n\n\u2013 Ireland: Jonathan Sexton \u2013\n\nFly-halves by their nature are key figures but few sides lean more heavily on their number 10 than Ireland do on Jonathan Sexton, reigning World Player of the Year.\n\nSexton missed Ireland\u2019s game against Japan with a thigh injury and although the Irish went 12-3 up in his absence, they missed the Leinster star\u2019s tactical control in what became a damaging defeat.\n\nHe returned to captain Ireland for the first time against Russia but played just the opening 40 minutes.\n\nIreland\u2019s first-choice goalkicker when fit, Sexton directs play with an authority that understudies Jack Carty and Joey Carbery, for all their undoubted talent, cannot match.\n\n\u201cJohnny sees things unfolding before they happen,\u201d said Ireland centre Chris Farrell.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so exciting to play with because he gives you space and time on the ball.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Wales: Hadleigh Parkes \u2013\n\nThe Kiwi-born centre was labelled an ageing journeyman by many critics after Warren Gatland handed him a debut at the age of 30, having qualified for Wales through three years of residency. He has proven his detractors wrong, a panic-free approach to the game setting an example to all.\n\nParkes rarely makes mistakes: he is often used on the crash-ball, but is equally adept at linking up with centre partner Jonathan Davies and setting the back three away in attack.\n\nHe is also a solid defender, whose incredible try-saving tackle on Jacob Stockdale was a decisive moment in Wales beating Ireland to seal last season\u2019s Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nParkes scored the opening try in the 29-25 win over Australia, playing despite a minor fracture in his hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll slowly improve as time goes by,\u201d said assistant Wales coach Robin McBryde. \u201cHe managed to catch that ball and score a try, so that is good enough for me.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Australia: Matt To\u2019omua \u2013\n\nMatt To\u2019omua has become the Wallabies\u2019 Mr Dependable. If he\u2019s not starting, he\u2019s coming off the bench as an influencer.\n\nA man who can straighten a backline and take the ball to the gain line, To\u2019omua has developed from being back-up to inside centre Samu Kerevi to being tipped to replace Christian Lealiifano as first choice Wallaby fly-half.\n\nHaving come off the bench against Fiji and Wales to fill the fly-half role, and starting at inside centre against Uruguay, To\u2019omua believes he is \u201cauditioning with the 12 on the back for a 10 jersey\u201d.\n\nNic White and Lealiifano started as halves against Fiji, and Australia were down 21-20 when To\u2019omua replaced Lealiifano. They won 39-21.\n\nAgainst Wales, with Will Genia and Bernard Foley in the halves, the Wallabies were down 26-8 until the strong-running To\u2019omua replaced Foley, and by the final whistle the score had narrowed to 29-25.\n\n\u2013 England: Sam Underhill \u2013\n\nAs part of the youngest back row to represent England in the professional era, Sam Underhill is set to be part of England\u2019s plans for many years to come and has shone at his first World Cup.\n\nMan-of-the-man against Argentina, Underhill\u2019s phenomenal work at the breakdown has seen coach Eddie Jones dub him and Tom Curry the \u2018kamikaze kids\u2019, because they \u201chit everything that moves\u201d.\n\nBorn in the USA, the Bath Rugby man is shorter than the average flanker at 186cm (6ft 1in) but makes up for it with his tackling work-rate. Against Argentina, he made 16 tackles and not a single handling error in what turned out to be a comfortable 39-10 win.\n\n\u2013 France: Damian Penaud \u2013\n\nDamian Penaud, the 23-year-old Clermont outside back, has become France\u2019s go-to player when a touch of inspiration is needed.\n\nWhen Tonga threatened to pull off a stunning upset after a late try closed the score to 23-21 on Sunday, it was Penaud who chased the restart, leaping high in the face of the Tongans to regain possession for France, denying the Pacific islanders one last chance to attack.\n\nHis stunning footwork also helped unravel the Argentina defence for France\u2019s two tries in their opening match by Gael Fickou and Antoine Dupont.\n\nSon of former French fly-half Alain Penaud, he can play centre or wing \u2014 where he made the most metres (59) and beat the most defenders (seven) against Argentina.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 As the Rugby World Cup pool stages head into the final round, AFP looks at some of the stand-out players so far: \u2013 South Africa:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/3438a8_south-africa-wing-cheslin-kolbe-has-in-electric-form-top-players-so-far-rugby-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
