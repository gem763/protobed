I\u2019m pretty hot, but it was a great day,\u201d Meadow said. \u201cI hit the ball really well, putted really nicely, so it\u2019s a good start. \u201c\n\nSeeking her first tour victory, the 27-year-old former University of Alabama player from Northern Ireland began the birdie run on the par-5 second and capped it on the par-5 sixth in mid-90-degree heat at Old American Golf Club.\n\n\u201cI made kind of three medium-length ones in a row and then like I hit two really good shots in there on the next two holes and made those,\u201d Meadow said. \u201cSo, a little bit of putting and a little bit of really good ball-striking. But it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve put five in a row, which is fun. You don\u2019t want to stop after three, you want to keep going.\u201d\n\nMeadow also birdied the par-5 13th, the par-4 15th and par-3 16th in the bogey-free afternoon round. At 112th on the money list, she needs a top finish to avoid a trip to the qualifying series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty tough year, but I\u2019ve been playing well the last few months, so I just feel like if I can just have a good week,\u201d Meadow said. \u201cI have nothing to lose. I\u2019m just going to go out there, make smart choices. I\u2019m not going to be stupid aggressive, but give myself some opportunities. I believe in myself and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nDori Carter and Amy Olson were tied for second at 65.\n\nCarter birdied the first four holes on the back nine, then rebounded from a double bogey on the 15th with birdies on 16h and the par-4 17th late in the afternoon. The 32-year-old former University of Mississippi player also is winless on the tour.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a roller-coaster, especially the back nine, but it was fun,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI had a couple big putts that hit the pin, and thank goodness it hit the pin. Kind of on a day like that the way things are falling, they\u2019re always kind of falling in your favor kind of. You just have to enjoy it. I think I learned late on in my career that those days don\u2019t happen very often. I kind of laughed some off and then I kind of really fought back after a bad hole. So, it was kind of a really emotional round, up and down, but still, it was a blast.\u201d\n\nOlson had seven birdies and a bogey in the morning session. She\u2019s also winless on the tour.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get myself really in much trouble and the putter was working,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThese greens can be a little tough because sometimes the grain doesn\u2019t match the slope perfectly, so trying to read them can be a bit of a challenge.\u201d\n\nCheyenne Knight, Ruixin Liu and Moriya Jutanugarn shot 66. Inbee Park, the 2013 and 2015 winner at Las Colinas Country Club, was another stroke back with U.S. Women\u2019s Open champion Jeongeun Lee6, Brittany Altomare, Jaye Marie Green, Katherine Perry, Kristen Gillman and Gaby Lopez. Park overcame two early bogeys.\n\n\u201cIt was hot today,\u201d Park said. \u201cI started off a little bit bad today, but I was able to come back really strong, so I\u2019m really happy with that. I was able to putt really well.\u201d\n\nMi Jung Hur, the area resident who won the Indy Women in Tech Championship last week, opened with a 68. Angela Stanford, the 41-year-old player from Fort Worth with six LPGA Tour victories, also shot 68. Defending champion Sung Hyun Park had a 69.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stephanie Meadow had five straight birdies on the front nine and shot a career-best 8-under 63 in hot and humid conditions Thursday to take the first-round lead in the LPGA Tour\u2019s Volunteers of America Classic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
