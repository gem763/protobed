Facing an 14-0 deficit, the Redskins turned to their first-round rookie quarterback, who helped the team march down the field before settling for a 21-yard field goal.\n\nAt the half, Haskins is 2 of 4 for 15 yards. Keenum went 6 of 11 for 54 yards and interception when he was pulled.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense, again, looks like a mess. The Giants have moved the chains with ease \u2014 converting 80% (4 of 5) of their opportunities on third down. Washington entered the game with the league\u2019s worst third-down defense.\n\nPenalties have also been a problem as the Redskins have been called for nine penalties for 41 yards.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
