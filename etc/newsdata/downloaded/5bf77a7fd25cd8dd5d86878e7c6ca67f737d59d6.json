Or rather, Airpool Karaoke. Yes, Kanye isn't going to take a car like some normie. It's planes for him and Corden.\n\nShading Kim's Ex\n\nView photos\n\nWhile they were recording The Late Late Show segment, Kanye West explained that initially he thought that it would be \"uncool\" to get married, to which Corden replied, \"No one ever thought it\u2019d be uncool to marry Kim Kardashian. Everyone thought it\u2019d be cool to marry Kim Kardashian.\"\n\nKanye, of course, couldn't resist throwing a little shade, so he laughed and replied \"Well, not Kris Humphries.\"\n\nHumphries and Kardashian had a lavish $10 million televised wedding and were only married for 72 days.\n\nPraising Their Marriage\n\nView photos\n\nKanye continued, praising his marriage to Kim. He claimed that \"it\u2019s more than cool. It\u2019s more than cool as hell or something. It\u2019s heavenly, it\u2019s great, it\u2019s magnificent.\"\n\nSinging A Different Tune\n\nKanye was singing a different tune a few weeks ago when footage from Keeping Up With The Kardashians revealed that the rapper who recently has undergone a religious conversion was not a fan of Kim's 2019 Met Gala look. He claimed that her dressing sexy \"hurt his soul.\"\n\n\"I went through this transition where being a rapper, looking at all these girls and looking at my wife, like, \u2018Oh my girl needs to be just like the other girls showing their body off.' I didn\u2019t realize that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone who is married and the father of now \u2026 about to be four kids. A corset is a form of underwear. It\u2019s hot, for who though?\"\n\nKim countered those comments saying \"You built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this, and just because you\u2019re on a journey and transformation doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in the same spot with you.\"\n\nKanye was visibly annoyed by the whole interaction.", "description": "The rapper also praised his \"heavenly\" married on 'Airpool Karaoke.\"", "authors": ["Lynne Versluys"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KL1FvH0dQAg_nyGG9pgTEQ--~B/aD0zNDYzO3c9NTE5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/70378217176d5d97f4b44f9fd6646303", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
