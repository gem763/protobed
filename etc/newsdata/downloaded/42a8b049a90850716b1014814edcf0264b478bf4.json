Its core was shipped years ago to the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory. What is left inside the containment building remains highly radioactive and encased in concrete.\n\nWork to dismantle Unit 2 is scheduled to begin in 2041 and be completed in 2053, its owner, FirstEnergy, has said.\n\nNo nuclear plant proposed after the 1979 accident has been successfully completed and put into operation in the U.S.", "description": "Three Mile Island, the 1979 site of the United States's worst commercial nuclear power accident, was shut down Friday by its energy giant owner.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292381.1569019430!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/three-mile-island-closure.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
