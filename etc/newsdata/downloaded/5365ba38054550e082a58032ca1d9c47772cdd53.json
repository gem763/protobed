But now isn\u2019t the time for investors to rest on their laurels. The upcoming federal election is the next big event to test the market\u2019s resilience.\n\nWith less than a week left to the Oct. 21 vote, Liberal Party Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in a neck-and-neck race with Conservatives leader Andrew Scheer. While the most likely scenario is a government that doesn\u2019t command an absolute majority in its own right, some strategists say that a minority administration led by Scheer could be better for the loonie in the near term than one under Trudeau.\n\n\u201cBetween a Liberal-led minority and a Conservative-led minority, we expect the first one to be more CAD-negative,\u201d Francesco Pesole, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING Bank, said in an Oct. 17 report. \u201cThe balance of risks for the loonie appears tilted to the downside.\u201d\n\nThe loonie has been in the No. 1 spot among Group-of-10 currencies this year, rising almost 4% against the U.S. dollar amid a sound economy and a low unemployment rate. Canada\u2019s benchmark equity index has rallied 15% in 2019, making it one of the top gainers among developed markets.\n\nA Conservative minority government would be better for market sentiment than a Liberal minority administration, according to Pesole. He said this is in part because it would likely exclude smaller parties that oppose more oil pipelines, a subject that has been a focus of political debate.\n\nA rebound in housing, solid economic growth and one of the strongest job markets in recent times has helped give Trudeau something positive to talk about during his campaign. While major central banks in other parts of the world have been cutting interest rates, the Bank of Canada has been reluctant to do so thus far -- strengthening the Canadian dollar\u2019s position as one of the highest yielders among G-10 currencies.\n\nMichael Hsueh, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, says a Trudeau-led minority government could be negative for the Canadian dollar given the reduced capacity to pass legislation. It could also potentially hinder growth in oil, a key industry for Canada, one of the world\u2019s largest energy exporters.\n\nThe Oil Factor\n\nStewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of the elections. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and has promised to remove regulations Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.\n\nFrom Binge to Bust: Canadian Oil Town Lines Up at the Food Bank\n\nThe loonie, often seen as a petrocurrency, has benefited from the nation\u2019s massive oil exports. Still, bringing more oil reserves to market has divided Canadians -- with two pipelines being scrapped on Trudeau\u2019s watch.\n\nForeign-exchange strategists are concerned that a Trudeau-led government, propped up by other left-leaning parties, could be an obstacle in passing legislation favorable to business leaders and the country\u2019s energy sector.\n\nA Liberal minority government is \u201clikely to push for more regulation and rules on capital inflows into Canada,\u201d which could be negative for the Canadian dollar, Mark McCormick, global head of currency strategy at Toronto-based TD Securities, said in an email.\n\nStock Market\n\nWhile Canadian politics rarely play a significant role in the nation\u2019s equity market, a minority government could be positive for stocks, according to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cAlthough on average the market has posted relatively strong performance post federal elections, there appears to be little to no performance preference around the outcome,\u201d he said in a September report. \u201cThe only potentially meaningful outcome appears to be a minority government versus a majority government.\u201d\n\nSince 1935, Canadian stocks have returned on average 12% in the 12 months after the election of a minority government, compared with 8% in the year following a majority victory, according to Belski\u2019s research.\n\nFor others, volatility is the name of the game. Stripping out the global rout in 2008, National Bank Financial\u2019s Warren Lovely said that Canadian stocks had a \u201cmixed/choppy\u201d performance after a minority government was formed from 2004 to 2011.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Canada\u2019s dollar is the best-performing major currency this year and the nation\u2019s stocks are going strong.
