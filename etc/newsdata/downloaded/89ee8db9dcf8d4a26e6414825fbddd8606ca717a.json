The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nEver since last year, nothing has grabbed economists' attention as much as the whipsawing evolution of the US-China trade war. Just last week, the IMF downgraded its global growth forecast for 2020, citing trade and geopolitical tensions.\n\nBut economic forecasters are misunderstanding the primary cause of the current global slowdown, which means that they'll also miss what's coming next.\n\nIn hindsight, it's clear that actual global industrial production growth started slowing at the end of 2017. In other words, the year-over-year pace of increase in the world's total industrial output began a sustained decline in late 2017. That's the definition of a global industrial slowdown.\n\nMost analysts focus on the global purchasing managers' index (PMI) data for their read on global growth because it's published each month about a month and a half before the actual production data. While the global PMI generally has a positive correlation with global industrial production growth, it doesn't measure actual industrial production, as it's based on a survey of purchasing executives about conditions facing their companies. It's really a proxy for industrial production growth, which measures real output for all companies within the manufacturing, mining and utilities industries.\n\nIn this case, while the global manufacturing PMI also started easing at the end of 2017, its decline didn't become evident until a few months into 2018, when the sustained nature of the downturn became increasingly difficult to dismiss as meaningless \"noise.\" Coincidentally, that's just about when President Trump began his trade war, slapping tariffs on washing machines and steel and aluminum imports. Because the trade war was front and center, economists thought it was to blame for the drop in PMI and global industrial growth.\n\nRead More", "description": "The global industrial slowdown really started before the trade war: ECRI research shows that global growth peaked in end-2017, write Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of ECRI.", "authors": ["Lakshman Achuthan", "Anirvan Banerji For Cnn Business Perspectives", "Anirvan Banerji For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191024092732-us-oil-pumpjack-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
