Biden might say, \u201cHe\u2019s clean-looking.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg can boast what Pocahontas, Feel the Burn, Slow Joe and, yes, even The Donald cannot: Military service. And yes, in our military.\n\nAs a U.S. Navy Reserve intelligence officer, Mr. Buttigieg began his prep for a presidential run by taking a seven-month leave from his day job as mayor.\n\nHe got himself a deployment to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan where he drove his commander on more than 100 dangerous trips to Kabul in 2014.\n\nDuring his tour, he learned an Afghan dialect of Farsi. See, he\u2019s whip-smart.\n\nHis Afghanistan war service later won him the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the Joint Service Commendation Award.\n\nIn Iowa, the polls have him tied with Democratic oldster Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont for second behind two other oldsters, Mr. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are in a statistical tie for first.\n\nThat\u2019s Real Clear Politics\u2019 average of polls in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nIn New Hampshire \u2014 but wait. Let\u2019s get this out of the way first:\n\nIf looking at his surname\u2019s letters promotes consternation, don\u2019t look. Instead, ask what you do when you fire a magistrate?\n\nYou boot a judge.\n\nWhich is exactly how you pronounce Buttigieg.\n\nBack to New Hampshire, where RealClealPolitics.Com has him as the fourth car in the Warren-Biden-Sanders train, with Sen. Kamala D. Harris in the fifth car, polling half his numbers.\n\nSo here\u2019s the mayor of the nation\u2019s 306th most populous city in the17th most populous state. Yet he\u2019s competing successfully with a former vice president and two well-known U.S. senators.\n\nAnd beating the pants off several other U.S. senators with longer resumes and, except for Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, from bigger states: Ms. Harris of California and Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey.\n\nMeanwhile, things over which Mr. Buttigieg has no control are going his way.\n\nTo stiffen their wobbly knees, some reelection-sweating Republican lawmakers, braying indistinguishably from Democrats, have taken to shaking their fists at President Trump over Syria.\n\nThis lets Democrats think their presidential prospects are improving for next year.\n\nThat sugar-plumb fantasy turns more Democratic eyes toward Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s way.\n\nHe\u2019s unquestionably hot.\n\nAnd he has a fawning press calling him a moderate.\n\nPerfect. In an American age that celebrates the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, queer (LGBTQ) ways of life, Democrats will offer the ideal candidate:\n\nHere\u2019s Mr. Buttigieg, a homosexual man who is in a stable marriage to another man and who wants to boost military spending but opposes \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a mandatory \u201cassault\u201d weapons buyback (he wants it voluntary).\n\nHe\u2019s also leftist enough to want to decriminalize border jumping, end offshore drilling, put the kibosh on new oil and gas leases on federal property and abolish the death penalty.\n\nSo Boot-a-judge vs. The Donald is a good bet for Nov. 3, 2020?\n\nQuinnipiac University\u2019s poll says 70 percent of voters are \u201copen\u201d to electing a homosexual as president. That includes 46 percent of Republicans.\n\nVoters are always the final judge and, doing their usual politically correct hemming and hawing, 52 percent of them said America \u201cis not ready\u201d to elect a homosexual as president. Only 36 percent said America is ready to greet a Mr. President and his husband.\n\nSo, based on those responses, do you elect to boot a judge \u2014 or think it possible to elect a Buttigieg?\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
