Authorities say the narcotics are linked to at least one death.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman, \"As alleged, these defendants operated a covert on-demand delivery service for the distribution of highly addictive and dangerous drugs. Allegedly, even after they realized the potency of the drugs they were distributing and selling, the defendants continued to sell their poison.\"\n\n\"Today\u2019s arrests are part of our continued commitment, along with our law enforcement partners, to stop the flow of heroin and cocaine onto the streets of New York City,\" Berman continued. \"Thanks to the tireless efforts of law enforcement, Mike\u2019s Candyshop is no longer open for business.\"\n\n\"This illicit enterprise allegedly allowed people to order heroin and cocaine to their doorstep simply by calling the business phone number with the same convenience as if they were ordering a pizza,\" HSI Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh explained.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, \"deaths involving heroin rose from 1,960 in 1999 to 15,482 in 2017\" in America.\n\nAccording to the press release, \"Mike\u2019s Candyshop generally operated seven days per week, from approximately 6:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., with the exception of major holidays such as Thanksgiving, New Year\u2019s Eve, and Labor Day.\"\n\nThe arrest highlights the growing problem that authorities have in modern day drug deal busts. Prior to cell phones, drug dealers would have to mark their territory making it more likely police could easily identify criminals. Nowadays, all drug dealers need is a cellphone number and smart business tactics in order to evade authorities. While deaths related to \"turf wars\" have dissipated, studies show that deaths related to the drugs themselves have increased.\n\nIf convicted, the six defendants will serve a minimum of ten years each with the possibility of a maximum life sentences.", "description": "It allowed people to order heroin and cocaine to their doorstep simply by calling the business phone number with the same convenience as if they were ordering a pizza.10/03/2019 19:23:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/61/cd6168e0-39b6-47f3-8592-1001a5433a4d.jpg"}
