Their free-flowing ambition married nicely with more traditional forward grunt four years ago, and it is a similarly-built squad assembled for Japan.\n\nIt was not a squad naming without surprises, not least the absences of Facundo Isa and Santiago Cordero. The France-based pair both possess game-breaking qualities (Isa as a physical and dynamic carrier; Cordero with salsa footwork in open spaces) but have lost out to less familiar names playing in South America, despite the board reversing their decision to exclude those not playing in Argentina.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Emiliano Boffelli\u2019s long-range prowess from the tee may also come in handy regardless of whether the versatile Jaguares man starts on the wing or at full-back.\n\nFormer captain Agustin Creevy remains a stout hooker, and if the second and back rows find chemistry and keep their discipline (new leader Pablo Matera will be crucial in keeping heads cool), Argentina can match their result from the last World Cup. Having run each of New Zealand, Australia and South Africa very close in the truncated Rugby Championship this year, Argentina are favourites for second place in Pool C and may even challenge England for top spot.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A legend of Argentinean rugby, Ledesma appeared in four World Cups as a player, including a pivotal role in his side\u2019s third-placed finish in 2007. Ledesma drew praise for his first international coaching foray, helping to guide Australia to the final four years ago as forwards coach, and Argentina will hope to draw on his previous tournament successes in Japan.\n\nThe 46-year-old has only been head coach since last summer, but Argentina have shown signs of improvement in his tenure. While eyebrows were raised at a couple of high-profile omissions from the squad, Ledesma has largely kept faith in an Argentina-based squad which he knows rather well after coaching the Jaguares for a season, and that cohesion should aid their efforts at the World Cup.\n\nKey Player\n\nPablo Matera. Matera always had the potential to be one of the world\u2019s best back-rowers, with athleticism, strength and ability to thrive in spaces both open and tight. He arrived at Leicester too young in 2013 and never truly settled in England, but since returning to Argentina he has begun to fulfil his promise, and a big money move to Stade Francais beckons.\n\nStill only 26, Matera has become Argentina captain in the last year or so, and while former leader Agustin Creevy remains to guide, he will need to be a totem for his side in Japan. With Facundo Isa omitted, Matera will have a key role as a ball-carrier and defensive linchpin.\n\nPast Record\n\nAustralia/New Zealand 1987 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (one win)\n\nEurope 1991 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (no wins)\n\nSouth Africa 1995 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (no wins)\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 quarter-finalists (three wins)\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (two wins)\n\nFrance 2007 \u2013 third place\n\nNew Zealand 2011 \u2013 quarter-finalists (three wins)\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 fourth place\n\nPrediction\n\nQuarter-finalists, finishing behind England in the group but beating France, Tonga and the USA.
