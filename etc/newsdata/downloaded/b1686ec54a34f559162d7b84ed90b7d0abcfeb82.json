Elliot Engel (D-NY) wrote in a letter to Khalilzad, adding that the special representative\u2019s agreement with the Taliban has \u201cbeen disseminated among officials in the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nKhalilzad said Monday the U.S. and the Taliban had agreed upon the deal \u201cin principle,\u201d but foreign officials and diplomats told The Daily Beast that the two parties are still working on ironing out final details.

In the last few days of the negotiations, Khalilzad is under pressure to please all sides.\n\nThis would be the third time the committee has requested Khalilzad appear for questioning, but he has so far not shown. Engel and ranking member Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) extended an invitation in February; Democrats on the committee asked Khalilzad to appear in April.\n\n\u201cGiven the challenges this Committee has faced in getting information from the Trump Administration on this issue, I want to be clear: I do not consider your testimony at this hearing optional,\u201d Engel wrote. \u201cIf this letter is insufficient to secure your attendance, I will consider other options that would ensure this hearing takes place in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
