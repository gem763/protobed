REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader\n\nThe German cabinet last week approved steps to slash greenhouse gas emissions, paving the way for landmark climate legislation this year. Climate activists and industry groups criticized the plans as too weak to achieve Germany\u2019s goal of becoming emissions-neutral by 2050.\n\n\u201cIf you take the issue of climate change and its consequences seriously, we will not be able to get around CO2 pricing,\u201d Verbund CEO Wolfgang Anzengruber said in an interview, hailing Germany\u2019s plan as an important step.\n\nHe dismissed calls for a carbon tax, however.\n\n\u201cTaxes are never tied to a goal, and once a tax is there, you never get rid of it,\u201d said Anzengruber, who favored the approach of setting a minimum CO2 price that would apply until market mechanisms worked properly.\n\n\u201cGermany has made an important step here, and other countries will not be able to avoid it,\u201d Anzengruber said.\n\nGermany\u2019s Climate Protection Act sets annual targets for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030.\n\nIt plans to introduce a CO2 price of 10 euros ($11) per tonne for fuel, heating oil and gas from 2021, rising to 35 euros by 2025 and then partly left to markets from 2026 but initially capped at 60 euros.\n\nBy comparison, one tonne now trades in Europe at around 27 euros.\n\nAnzengruber said he could also imagine a staggered model for Austria. \u201cSooner or later we will do it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called the introductory price of 10 euros in Germany \u201ctoo timid\u201d and largely ineffective. An initial price of around 30 euros would have more impact, he said.\n\nSebastian Kurz\u2019s conservative People\u2019s Party, big winners in last month\u2019s Austrian parliamentary election, has ruled out a CO2 tax. Its potential coalition partners, the Greens, favor such a tax as exploratory talks on forming a coalition begin.\n\nThe previous Austrian government aimed for all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, a goal Anzengruber called very ambitious. That would require an additional 25 to 30 terawatt hours of electricity versus the 70 terawatt hours Austrians now use each year.\n\nHydropower could generate around seven terawatt hours with new plants and increased efficiency. The rest would have to come from wind and photovoltaic systems.\n\nVerbund, Austria\u2019s largest electricity group, has 128 hydropower plants, making it one of the largest providers in Europe. Together with oil and gas group OMV (OMVV.VI), it plans to build Austria\u2019s largest solar power plant and start electrolytic hydrogen production.", "description": "Austria will have to adopt a carbon pricing system along the lines of what Germany has proposed, the chief executive of state-controlled utility Verbund told Reuters.", "authors": ["Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441092405&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0XN", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
