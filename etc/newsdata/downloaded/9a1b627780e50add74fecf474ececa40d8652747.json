The social networking platform has approximately 2.1 billion daily active users, so inevitably, it can sometimes feel like a pit of negative and offensive comments \u2014 but thankfully, there\u2019s a way to prevent these from appearing on your feed.\n\nInstead of deleting or deactivating your Facebook account, the tech giant allows you to control what comments you see by giving you the ability to delete, hide, or report them. But first, let\u2019s explain what each of these mean.\n\nSo, to delete a comment, this means it\u2019ll be removed from the platform forever. But you can\u2019t go around on Facebook simply deleting everyone\u2019s comments, after all, you\u2019re not God, or Zuckerberg. However, you can delete your own comments and comments from others on your uploads, be that a status, a photo album, or a life update.\n\nHiding a comment means it will disappear from your point of view. However, the person who posted it, along with any of your mutual friends, will still be able to view it. But what kind of comments are worth hiding? Well, maybe ones that could spoil a TV show you\u2019re watching, for example.\n\nAnd finally, reporting a comment is kind of like a citizen\u2019s arrest. Well, not really\u2026 but it does mean that if you see an offensive comment, you can flag it to the Facebook police who will then decide if it has violated its community standards. If it does, it\u2019ll be deleted.\n\nA reported comment will be looked into further to see if it violated Facebook\u2019s community standards.\n\nTake control over what comments you see on Facebook\n\nHiding comments from any post on Facebook is easy \u2014 be that your own or someone else\u2019s \u2014 and you can do this on desktop or from the social networking app.\n\nIf you see a comment worth hiding on your newsfeed whilst on desktop, simply click on the three dots to the right of the comment, and click Hide comment. And if for some reason you regret hiding the comment, or you did this by accident, just click Unhide under the now-hidden comment.\n\nHiding a comment removes it from your point of view.\n\nTo hide a comment from the Facebook app, simply press and hold down the comment you don\u2019t want to see anymore, and then tap Hide. Once hidden, the comment will be replaced with text saying: \u201cThis comment has been hidden\u201d and will remain in the comment section, but instead it\u2019ll greyed out.\n\nBut, if again, you regret doing this. It can easily by unhidden by long-pressing the now-hidden message and tap Unhide comment.\n\nHow to report offensive comments on Facebook\n\nSome comments require more action than simply hiding them. Unfortunately, you might come across an offensive message, even though Facebook has tools in place to automatically detect and remove offensive comments, sometimes some slip through the net.\n\nTo report a comment on desktop, click the three dots to the right of the comment box and click Find support or report comment. Once clicked, a box will appear asking you to explain what category this comment typically falls into such as: Violence, harassment, suicide or self-injury, or hate speech, etc. However, if you can\u2019t find the category, there\u2019s a search option to manually find what you\u2019re looking for including options such as \u201cPromoting drug use\u201d and \u201cMocking victims.\u201d\n\nHere, you can categorize what the offending comment falls into.\n\nOn the Facebook app, a comment can be reported by long-pressing the comment and tapping Find support or report comment. The next steps are the same as mentioned through desktop.\n\nSo, even though Facebook is using AI to combat hate speech online, sometimes you may stumble across something offensive. At least now you know how to control what you see.\n\nRead next: An ant colony has memories its individual members don\u2019t have", "description": "Instead of deleting or deactivating your Facebook account, you can control what comments you see by deleting, hiding, or reporting them.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-1-1.png&signature=6f5b430e5f8c11d2a7713735efc6e119", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
