Only Jason Leonard (114) and Dylan Hartley (97) have represented the England men\u2019s side on more occasions.\n\nDizzying Rugby World Cup opening leaves referees and players in a spin Read more\n\nEngland flew south to Kobe on Monday 24 hours after opening their World Cup campaign with a scratchy bonus-point win over Tonga. They will have one proper training session on Wednesday before facing the USA.\n\nThe two injury absentees are Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell, who are not due to be ready until the third pool match against Argentina on Saturday week, though England were awaiting further medical reports on Slade\u2019s knee before Jones finalises his team on Tuesday. It was the same knee Slade injured in the buildup to England\u2019s first World Cup warm-up match against Wales last month, though he was able to finish the match against Tonga. Joe Cokanasiga has also been hampered with a knee injury and his leg has been heavily strapped.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s victory Jones was unsure how many of the 23 who featured would also be involved against the USA. Youngs may start on the bench with Willi Heinz in the No 9 jersey while Cole is more likely to start in place of Kyle Sinckler. At least nine of the starting XV against Tonga are set to be involved despite the four-day turnaround.\n\n\u2018Someone shouted tsunami\u2019: Kamaishi set to play emotional role in World Cup story | Andy Bull Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in this World Cup bubble at the moment and, whilst those accolades are nice, I had no idea,\u201d said Youngs, who will equal Wilkinson as England\u2019s most capped back.\n\n\u201cI remember making my first start for England and Jonny was involved and playing in Australia. He\u2019s an icon of the game and to get this accolade is pretty cool.\n\n\u201cWhen you first start out it goes fast and you\u2019re in it and not really sure what\u2019s going on. And then you get older and understand what gets you there, how you do it and how you sustain it. Getting there is almost the easy bit, the hard bit is sustaining it and staying there and being consistent in it.\u201d\n\nEngland will be hoping for a far more polished performance after a litany of handling errors against Tonga meant the bonus point was not secured until the 77th minute.\n\nLast autumn, in an effort to prepare for this four-day turnaround Jones purposefully curtailed his side\u2019s preparations before their victory over Japan, against whom he made 11 changes from the previous weekend. Ruaridh McConnochie, Mark Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Piers Francis and Jack Singleton were all hoping to be brought into the 23 for Thursday, having missed out in Sapporo, while Ludlam is set to cap a remarkable rise with a start at flanker. \u201cIf you had told me this time last year that I would be starting in a World Cup game, I would\u2019ve told you you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus last week was purely Tonga and as soon as that whistle went after the game, it switches to USA. It wasn\u2019t a case or preparing for two games.\u201d\n\nThe USA have named eight England-based players in their 23-man squad, including the Saracens prop Titi Lamositele, Harlequins\u2019 former American footballer Paul Lasike and the Bedford full-back Will Hooley, whom Ludlam played alongside at junior level.\n\n\u201cWe were both at Ipswich Rugby Club and then he was at school 10 minutes down the road from me,\u201d Ludlam said. \u201cIt is weird he is playing for a different country but he is a really good bloke, he is down to earth, he is a good leader and I am sure he is keeping those USA boys in place.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday Jones claimed that the USA would be \u201call guns blazing, it\u2019s going to be like 15 Donald Trumps\u201d, but their coach, Gary Gold, opted against returning fire. \u201cAt this stage, with all due respect, we\u2019re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that. I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d", "description": "Four-day gap in Rugby World Cup programme means chances against USA for England players who did not play against Tonga", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c626f1168f6fe6d17cc9358cedc4b982a877cd/78_207_5112_3067/master/5112.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6cd04d2f9e34ae86e527709ff39aca9", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
