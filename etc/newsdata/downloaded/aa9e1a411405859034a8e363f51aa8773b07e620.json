A protester hanging from a harness beneath Brisbane's Story Bridge and brandishing \"climate emergency\" flags was taken into police custody.\n\nAt least 10 people were arrested in the city, and three others were arrested in Sydney after lying in a downtown street intersection.\n\nMore than 100 protesters dressed as bees at Sydney's Hyde Park to highlight their claim that insects are under threat due to the human impact on the environment.\n\nSome activists camped at Melbourne's Carlton Gardens overnight before marching to a street corner locked down by more than 100 protesters in inclement weather.\n\n\"I don't know that shutting the city down necessarily wins you many friends,\" Victoria premier Daniel Andrews said.\n\nClimate change protestors from the Extinction Rebellion movement gather to demonstrate at Town Hall in Sydney, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019.

The front page of Tuesday's paper was left intentionally blank for protesters to use as a placard.\n\nThe activists are running a \"Spring Rebellion\" series of demonstrations to pressure the Australian government into declaring a climate emergency.\n\nFounded in Britain last year, Extinction Rebellion has chapters in some 50 countries and wants to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2025.\n\nOn Monday, activists with the movement stopped traffic in European cities and smeared themselves and emblems of Wall Street in fake blood and lay in New York streets.\n\nIn Berlin, 300 people blocked Potsdamer Platz, placing couches, tables, chairs and flowerpots on the road. They earlier set up a tent camp outside German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office out of dissatisfaction with her government's climate policy.\n\nMerkel's chief of staff, Helge Braun, criticized the group's tactics.\n\n\"We all share an interest in climate protection, and the Paris climate targets are our standard in this,\" he told ZDF television. \"If you demonstrate against or for that, that is OK. But if you announce dangerous interventions in road traffic or things like this, of course that is just not on.\"\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/Climate\n\nClimate change protestors from the Extinction Rebellion movement gather to demonstrate at Town Hall in Sydney, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019.
