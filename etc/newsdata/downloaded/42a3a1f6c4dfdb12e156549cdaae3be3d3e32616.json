It\u2019s no real surprise when one takes a glance at the credits since director Peter Cattaneo\u2019s 1997 hit The Full Monty virtually provided the blueprint, and while he\u2019s had difficulty repeating its success ever since, he might have a decent-sized hit on his hands here.\n\nThe Personal History of David Copperfield review: Dev Patel shines in Iannucci's charmer Read more\n\nTo many Brits at least, the loose facts of the Military Wives choir\u2019s rise to fame will ring a bell or two, the women who turned a therapeutic hobby into a chart-topping success. Inspired by, rather than tied to, the true story, the film focuses on two women and their differing attempts to raise the spirits of those left behind at a military base. With their partners away in Afghanistan, the women fall into a familiar routine, glumly aware of what lies ahead as they either wait for their return or for news they hope will never arrive. It\u2019s a mode of living that Kate (Kristin Scott Thomas) knows all too well, her son killed in battle while her husband continues to fight and as she hands over social committee duties to Lisa (Sharon Horgan), she finds it difficult to let go.\n\nKate is uptight and chilly while Lisa is laidback and unconventional and the two clash as they find ways to distract the women around them. But an uneasy partnership is formed as they decide upon a choir, an idea that grows into something neither of them could have expected.\n\nWe\u2019re in safe, formulaic territory here, think Calendar Girls with less nudity and more harmonising, and it\u2019s the film\u2019s strict adherence to the rules of the subgenre that proves to be both a blessing and a curse. It works for the most part because, when done well, there\u2019s something irresistible about the formula and Cattaneo, along with writers Rosanne Flynn and Rachel Tunnard, knows how to play his audience like an instrument: cheer here, laugh there, cry now etc. We know where we\u2019re going, not just because the story is based on facts, but because we\u2019ve essentially seen this all before and there\u2019s a simple yet undeniable pleasure to be had following the wives on their road to success.\n\nBut there are also times when Military Wives starts to creak, when you can sense the script straining to effortlessly implant the true story into the by-the-numbers structure of the Britcom. Some of the earlier conflict seems forced and low-stakes and some of the music scenes play a little too earnestly, the tonal shift between crowd-pleasing humour and heart-swelling drama not always working so well. What ultimately makes the whole thing sing is its central pair, two performances that carry the film even through its most mediocre moments. Horgan is a gifted comic performer with the rare ability of taking often rather plain dialogue and turning it into something special while Scott Thomas is a pro at handling the light and the dark, bringing much-needed depth to her character\u2019s grief process. The two are both snugly in their wheelhouses but that sort of adds to the film\u2019s comfort food appeal and without their combined talents, the script\u2019s bum notes wouldn\u2019t be half as easy to forgive.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing here you won\u2019t have seen before or can\u2019t see coming but still, Military Wives is a film that\u2019s hard to entirely resist, like a song that you\u2019ll hum along to even if you forget the tune straight after.", "description": "The true story of the women who gained unlikely fame in 2011 has been turned into a pleasant, if patchy, film from the director of The Full Monty", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2cbb48e58143ae8e37a28a900c159b8e819e52/110_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4834f4a4d12162df831a75a2dfd82d85", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
