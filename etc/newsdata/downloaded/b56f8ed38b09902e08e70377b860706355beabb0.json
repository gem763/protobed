The book, which chronicled a forbidden romance between a physician and his mistress, was banned in the Soviet Union for its anti-communist messages. But in an effort to undermine the revolution, American CIA agents worked to ensure the novel was brought back to its homeland.\n\nLara Prescott\u2019s debut, The Secrets We Kept, reimagines Doctor Zhivago\u2019s dangerous journey to publication, placing women serving as CIA secretaries at the center of the story. The novel closely follows three perspectives: Olga, Pasternak\u2019s real-life mistress, on whom he based the fictional Lara (who in turn inspired Prescott\u2019s first name); Irina, a new secretary being groomed to go undercover; and Sally, the glamorous agent training her. But there\u2019s a fourth entity that takes on a crucial perspective in the novel: a Greek chorus of secretaries in the typing pool, at first unaware that a few among them are doing spy work. The Secrets We Kept opens in the secretaries\u2019 collective voice, as they reflect on their ability to remain tight-lipped about what they observe at the office: \u201cUnlike some of the men, we could keep our secrets.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Prescott, who has a background working for political campaigns, showcases a talent at blending thorough research\u2013she used Olga Ivinskaya\u2019s biographies to inform the character\u2013with energetic prose. Her writing is propulsive when she describes the high-stakes handling of the controversial book. (At one point, Irina dresses as a nun and hands out disguised copies at the Vatican.)\n\nWhen Irina and Sally\u2019s covert mission spirals into something more, the other secretaries begin to catch on. But where some writers might endow those onlookers with envy or suspicion, Prescott instead paints the group as nosy but caring, curious but protective, all-knowing but discreet. And by allowing them to address the reader and assert their point of view\u2013in a time and place where only men\u2019s voices are heeded\u2013Prescott puts the power in the women\u2019s hands.\n\nWrite to Annabel Gutterman at annabel.gutterman@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the September 30, 2019 issue of TIME.", "description": "Women are at the center of Lara Prescott\u2019s book 'The Secrets We Kept,' a fictional account of the dangers of publishing 'Doctor Zhivago.'", "authors": ["Annabel Gutterman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/lara-prescott-the-secrets-we-kept-doctor-zhivago-book.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
