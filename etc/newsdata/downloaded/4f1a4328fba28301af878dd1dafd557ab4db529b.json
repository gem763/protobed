For example, maybe you have an in-car charger (good idea to keep your gas tank filled up), or maybe you have a solar charger. There are also a number of power banks that also feature an AC outlet.\n\nPerhaps you have a gasoline generator that you can fire up, although I would urge caution if you're not familiar with this bit of kit, because they offer a huge and bewildering number of ways to hurt, maim, or even kill you or others, so safety first!\n\nTip #5: Check replaceable batteries\n\nIf you have devices that use regular batteries, then a stock of disposable batteries in the size you use could come in handy.\n\nTip #6: Know how to operate things without power\n\nFor example, know how to open your garage door. Look around you now, and start planning.\n\nTip #7: Plan for medical needs\n\nIf you or a friend or loved one relies on a breathing machine, a power wheelchair or scooter, home oxygen, or dialysis, have plan in place.\n\nTip #8: Have hard copies of important information\n\nDon't rely on having phone numbers in your phone, because once the battery dies, you will be in trouble. Write them down!\n\n#9: Have a stockpile of food and water\n\nThis goes without saying. Having ice is also good for keeping food fresh.\n\nSee also:", "description": "With Californian power companies putting together plans that could see millions of people without power, here are some tech tips to help you cope with what could be the state's largest and longest deliberate blackout.", "authors": ["Adrian Kingsley-Hughes"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/06/0d7ac434-d3db-4faa-a27c-917ec7c1e936/thumbnail/770x578/62856b4315efbb7635dfebaef25442fe/img-2675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
