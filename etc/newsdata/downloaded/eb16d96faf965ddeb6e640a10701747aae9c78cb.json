We\u2019re a day down and he\u2019s had a busy work schedule so we haven\u2019t been able to put in hours.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve still got a lot to do technically, and I\u2019ve gotta try and get the smile off his face. Hopefully he\u2019s feeling better and he can go for it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoe revealed on the show that Karim\u2019s mum had rustled up some meatballs to help her son feel better, and handed the dish over to Amy to make sure Karim got them.\n\nKarim is currently one of the favourites to lift the glitterball this year after some impressive performances.\n\nWill he be fighting fit by Saturday? (Picture: PA)\n\nAfter the second week of Strictly the pair topped the leaderboard with a fabulous 32 points for their foxtrot, getting some glowing feedback from the judges \u2013 particularly Shirley Ballas.\n\nNot only that, Karim\u2019s odds of lifting the glitterball trophy have been slashed, bringing him closer to the current favourite, Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher.\n\nKarim will have to stop being so smiley to put on a passionate tango with Amy this weekend.\n\nTheir routine will be to Paradise by George Ezra, which will hopefully give them a boost on the leaderboard after a disheartening score last week for their Kung Fu Panda inspired dance.\n\nAmy said she tried not to pay too much attention to scoring and just make sure Karim enjoys himself.\n\nShe told Zoe: \u2018I told him he did everything I asked of him. I thought he was a brilliant panda and this is the most incredible journey and all I want for him is to have fun and have the best time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When we came off he said I had the best time out there and that\u2019s all I want for him.\u2019\n\nStrictly Come Dancing airs Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
