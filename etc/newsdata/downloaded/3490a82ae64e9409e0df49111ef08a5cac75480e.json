With falling global macro indicators and geopolitical concerns on the rise, the market\u2019s appetite for high-growth/high-PE stories has diminished. This void has been replaced with the perceived safety of cheap stocks \u2013 the idea being if the market does have a pullback, then at current prices these have less to fall.\n\nAs money managers, our view on this line of thinking is that it is flawed and short-sighted. In no way does it support our belief in the best way to accumulate sustainable wealth over the long term. We encourage investors not to be lured into the fastest moving lane of investing traffic but instead to stick with strategies that are proven to work through many different cycles.\n\nHistory has proven time and time again that in Australia companies that exhibit quality factors outperform over the long term. When we talk about quality factors, we are referring to companies that exhibit properties in financial measures such as financial health, profitability, accruals and earnings growth.\n\nSometimes negative volatility is simply a case of the price reverting to the (lack of) fundamentals\n\nA portfolio strategy based on identifying great companies that are exposed to manageable levels of financial risk, generating strong levels of cash flow and are both profitable and growing is the best route for outperformance over the long-run. It is for this reason that we are often comfortable paying a premium price for a quality business.\n\nThe alternative is to invest in companies with high levels of financial risk, generating meagre cash returns and not growing profits (if it was profitable in the first place). Many of these \"qualities\" are exhibited in the stocks that can often reflect the most value.", "description": "Savvy investors should be buying the dip to get into quality names that until recently had always seemed just out of reach due to strong prices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e38cba0e2ae60609305f2ddcfe9a5b9886e56ea", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
