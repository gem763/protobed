Other safe-haven assets have also rallied. A bond rally has pushed US Treasury yields to new lows, and even the US Dollar has maintained its strength amidst market volatility.\n\nThe deteriorating global outlook\u2014 driven largely by the ever-escalating trade war between the US and China \u2014 is creating fear in the markets that the US and other global economies could be nearing a recession. The Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell have repeatedly said that they're watching the data and are ready to step in as necessary with rate cuts.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

This raises \"the appeal of holding gold given economic uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nAs the price of gold rises, it loses opportunity cost, and safe-haven demand for the asset increases. Demand \"is likely to grow further with rising expectations of economic deceleration given the state of US-China trade tensions,\" Tchilinguirian wrote.\n\nHoldings of the precious metal in ETFs are heading toward highs last seen in 2012, he said. This prompted BNP Paribas' increased forecasts for the yellow metal. BNP Paribas sees gold averaging $1,400 an ounce in 2019 and $1,560 an ounce in 2020. That's a boost of $60 and $130, respectively.\n\nIf the Fed moves more aggressively than expected, \"gold is likely to move above our forecast for that period,\" he said.\n\nThe price per ounce of gold has risen 20% year-to-date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Gold could soar above $1,600 per ounce if the Federal Reserve cuts rates four times before June 2020, according to Harry Tchilinguirian of BNP Paribas.&nb...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d6ff59e2e22af32ff204802-2000/2019-08-28t061128z1743136792rc1f4daae390rtrmadp3gold-swiss-fakes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
