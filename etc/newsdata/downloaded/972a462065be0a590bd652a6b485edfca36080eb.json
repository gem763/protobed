He also promised risk-free \u201cguarantees\u201d on rates of returns up to 22 percent or 56 percent, according to federal prosecutors.\n\n\u201cArbab admitted that knew he did not have the liquid capital to make good on these guarantees when he made them, but he did not disclose this to his investors,\u201d the DOJ press release states.\n\nArbab also confessed to the court that he told investors he was getting his MBA at the school\u2019s Terry College of Business and that a famous NFL player and UGA alum had put money into the fund. In reality, Arbab was rejected from UGA\u2019s MBA program, and the football player had never invested in his fund.\n\nHe ultimately spent the money he\u2019d bilked from investors on clothing, shoes, fine dining, alcohol, strip clubs, and three gambling trips to Las Vegas, prosecutors said.\n\nMany of the allegations that Arbab admitted on Friday were first mentioned in a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint filed by the department in May. The agency assisted the FBI in its investigation, according to the press release.\n\nHe is set to be sentenced in January 2020.", "description": "The 22-year-old biology undergrad admitted he convinced 117 people he was a business school student with a risk-free hedge fund that boasted investments from a famous NFL player.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570816048/GettyImages-150743804_1_djz5tm", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
