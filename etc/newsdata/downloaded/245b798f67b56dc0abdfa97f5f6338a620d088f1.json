See Market Snapshot.\n\n\u2018Win, win, win.\u2019 \u2014RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney\u2019s take on Amazon\u2019s One-Day Prime shipping initiative.\n\nRBC analyst Mark Mahaney\u2019s new price target, which was raised by 16% from $2,250, implies a 45% gain from current levels. The new target was also 13.5% above the average target of the 47 analysts surveyed by FactSet of $2,291.39, and was slightly above the previous Street high of $2,573.40 of analyst Qian Li of First Shanghai.\n\nWith 494.7 million shares outstanding as of July 17, according to the most-recent 10Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mahaney\u2019s target implies a market capitalization for Amazon of $1.29 trillion.\n\nMahaney, who also reiterated his bullish outperform rating, said he believes Amazon plans to roll out One-Day Prime, which was originally unveiled in April, across the U.S. within one year, and internationally within two-to-three years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: One-day shipping is expensive for Amazon, but analysts say it\u2019s driving growth in new Prime members.\n\n\u201cWe believe [Amazon] may well generate accelerating revenue and unit growth for some time as One-Day goes nationwide and world-wide,\u201d Mahaney wrote in a note to clients.\n\nMahaney raised his 2020 earnings estimate to $39.91 a share from $33.90 and his revenue projection to $337.2 billion from $334.6 billion. That compares with the FactSet consensus for 2020 EPS of $33.43 and revenue of $331.4 billion.\n\n\u201cOur 7-year survey on Online Retail indicates that a very high and rising 64% of U.S. internet users are \u2018extremely\u2019 or \u2018very interested\u2019 in next-day shipping,\u201d Mahaney wrote. \u201cSo [Amazon] is tapping into real demand here; makes One-Day a True GCI [growth curve initiative].\u201d\n\nMahaney said sellers on Amazon are just as bullish on next-day shipping as consumers. He said One-Day will also increase the platform potential for Amazon to build Shipping With Amazon, which potentially targets the more-than $900 billion third-party logistics market.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the flywheel \u2014 One-Day makes Prime more appealing for consumers, which makes FBA [Fulfillment By Amazon] more appealing to vendors, which increases supply on Prime, which makes Prime more appealing for consumers\u2026,\u201d Mahaney wrote. \u201cWin, win, win.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock has hiked up 19.2% year to date, while the online retail ETF has gained 16.9%, the Nasdaq-100 has run up 20.0% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.08% has advanced 11.8%.", "description": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were a rare gainer Tuesday, after RBC Capital boosted its target on the e-commerce and cloud giant\u2019s stock to a Wall Street-high...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ571_Amazon_ZG_20190903104548.jpg"}
