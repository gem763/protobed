Rory MacDonald at Bellator 232: Best photos view 10 images\n\nUNCASVILLE, Conn. \u2013 Bellator now has a three-time welterweight champion in the form of Douglas Lima, and Bellator president Scott Coker has a plethora of options ahead for the Brazilian in the months ahead.\n\nFor now, though, Coker says he\u2019ll look to move a few pieces around on the promotion\u2019s welterweight chessboard before booking \u201cThe Phenom\u201d in the first title defense of his new reign.\n\nOne option might be a rematch with the man he defeated on Saturday night at Bellator 232. Lima (32-7 MMA, 14-3 BMMA) and Rory MacDonald (21-6-1 MMA, 3-2-1 BMMA) now stand with one win apiece from their in-cage rivalry, and a possible trilogy battle could be on the cards. But Coker said that likely wouldn\u2019t be next.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that, but you know what, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMaybe further down the line. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhat looks more likely for Lima is a matchup against the man Coker currently sees as the top contender at 170 pounds, Lorenz Larkin (21-7 MMA, 3-2 BMMA). But Coker revealed that \u201cThe Monsoon\u201d has other business to attend to before any thoughts can turn to a possible shot at the strap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking Larkin in Japan to fight on the 29th to fight on our show,\u201d Coker revealed. \u201cWe\u2019re still working out the opponent, but he will be fighting and representing Bellator against Rizin, so he will be busy there.\n\n\u201cI think Douglas Lima would probably want to take a couple of months off, and then we\u2019ll figure it out. But I think that Larkin, unless he loses in Japan, he\u2019s probably the No. 1 guy in the slot.\u201d\n\nWhile a rematch with Lima might not be next on the schedule for MacDonald, Coker hinted that another return bout could potentially be a possibility after it was suggested to him that Jon Fitch (32-7-2 MMA, 1-1 BMMA) had expressed an interest in facing \u201cThe Red King\u201d again.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I haven\u2019t talked to Jon; he told me he was going to retire,\u201d Coker said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s not retiring, we can have that conversation. But he did tell me that unless he got the alternate slot and worked his way into this championship fight and the tournament finals, he was probably going to retire. So when I get back to San Jose, I\u2019ll reach out to him.\u201d\n\nOne thing Coker doesn\u2019t expect to hear from MacDonald is a retirement announcement. The Bellator boss said the Canadian looked fresh and focused all week in the lead-up to his unsuccessful title defense at Bellator 232, and the president said he was impressed with MacDonald\u2019s performance, despite the defeat.\n\n\u201cI thought he fought a very smart, tactical fight,\u201d he admitted. \u201cDouglas Lima is not a guy you want to stand in the pocket and throw down with because he has a heavy arsenal. I think Rory was trying to move and figure out a way to avoid the big hits and then take him down.\n\n\u201cI think he was a lot more focused than he was for his last fight, or the fight before. He\u2019s been here all week, and I haven\u2019t heard any dialog about anything other than about he wants to win this belt.\u201d", "description": "Bellator president Scott Coker reveals Lorenz Larkin could be the first man up to face new welterweight champion Douglas Lima in 2020.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/scott-coker-bellator-232-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
