It makes Johnson\u2019s government choose between holding an election to improve its position in Parliament and its goal of securing Brexit before that election takes place.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is absolutely on (the prime minister), because if he is serious about wanting an election and if he\u2019s genuine about having an election before Christmas, then he can back this bill,\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nLooming over the political maneuvering is what Johnson and Parliament are going to do about his Brexit deal and how long an extension EU leaders will give Britain to the current Brexit deadline, which is Thursday. The EU in principle has backed extending the Brexit deadline but officials were meeting again this week to figure out how long it should be.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and the SNP plan to introduce legislation on Tuesday that calls for an early national election on Dec. 9, three days earlier than Johnson proposed and years earlier than Britain\u2019s next scheduled vote in 2022.\n\nBecause U.K. law requires Parliament to be dissolved 25 working days before an election, the date of any poll will dictate how much time is available to debate Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal deal.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats expect a vote on their proposal Thursday, just days before Parliament would be suspended. That would effectively leave no time for lawmakers to consider Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nIn contrast, Johnson announced last week he will ask lawmakers on Monday to authorize a Dec. 12 election, then use the rest of the legislative term to push through his Brexit deal. Under this plan, Parliament would be dissolved on Nov. 7, giving lawmakers about seven days to debate the withdrawal agreement that Johnson and EU leaders agreed upon.\n\nThe two sides have effectively been debating Britain\u2019s departure from the 28-nation bloc \u2014 which has never seen a member leave \u2014 since British voters in June 2016 chose to leave the EU. But Johnson\u2019s deal was cemented only 10 days ago \u2014 and British lawmakers fear rushing through a document that has enormous economic and political consequences for the country.\n\nThe problem for Johnson is that his proposal requires a two-thirds vote of the House of Commons and it is opposed by opposition parties who fear it could lead to an economically damaging no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn contrast, the Liberal Democrat plan only needs a simple majority in the 650-seat House of Commons due to laws governing elections.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat plan would be conditional upon the EU agreeing to extend the Brexit deadline until to the end of January. Johnson has sought a shorter Brexit extension to keep alive the possibility of a no-deal departure, which in turn keeps the pressure on British lawmakers to approve his deal.\n\nEconomists say a no-deal departure would be very damaging to both the British and EU economies.\n\nConservative Party chair James Cleverly dismissed the new election proposal as \u201cclearly a gimmick\u201d designed to delay Brexit because it only moves the election date ahead three days. If the Liberal Democrats and SNP really want an election, they should vote for the Dec. 12 date proposed by Johnson, Cleverly said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to listen to two parties who explicitly said they want to stop Brexit from happening,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be complicit in them stopping Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe move by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP is also a challenge to the Labour Party, which has repeatedly vacillated on whether to call an early election in which they could lose seats.\n\nDiane Abbott, a senior Labour spokeswoman, said Sunday that Labour will wait to see what kind of Brexit extension the EU offers before deciding whether to support the latest domestic election proposal. She also repeated the party\u2019s position that it will back an early election only after Johnson explicitly says there won\u2019t be a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cHe could come to Parliament and categorically give Parliament an undertaking that he\u2019s not going to come out without a deal, but he won\u2019t do that, because coming out without a deal is something that people around him ... would want,\u201d she said.", "description": "Two British opposition parties on Sunday proposed an even earlier election date than Prime Minister Boris Johnson has offered, trying to force his government...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU077_london_ZG_20191027175946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
