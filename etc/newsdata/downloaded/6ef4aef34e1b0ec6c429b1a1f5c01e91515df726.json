Maybe that was true at some point in the past, but it hasn\u2019t been so for decades. Companies do hate regulations, when those regulations will hurt them, but they are fully in support of them once they\u2019ve established a beachhead in the marketplace because it makes it nearly impossible for new competitors to emerge. The latest examples of this are in social media and vaping.\n\nFacebook and Twitter are more than happy to weaponize government regulations now that they\u2019re the biggest games in town. In the arena of social media, compliance with regulations will serve a couple of important purposes for these behemoths.\n\nOne, it will likely offer them some level of immunity for the content on their sites. Are Facebook and Twitter publishers or portals? This is the billion-dollar question. If they\u2019re simply portals, a kiosk of sorts, where anyone can post whatever they want, they face no liability for the libelous content on their sites. If they\u2019re publishers, they can be sued for allowing libelous content to be published.\n\nRight now, social media companies are operating in an area in-between \u2013 they make value judgements about what is and is not acceptable content and ban users based on \u201ccommunity standards\u201d they set based on their own opinions. They do this while claiming they have little to no say over what people post on their websites. The government has, thus far, allowed this gray area exist, offering de facto immunity from liability while they act as pseudo-publishers. So they would naturally welcome regulation going forward that protects them from their pasts.\n\nAdd to that the fact that these companies would be involved in writing any regulations \u2013 do you really think anyone in Congress has even a basic understanding of how these sites operate? \u2013 and you get a \u201cchicken guarding the henhouse\u201d situation.\n\nOn the vape front, there is the added element of media-created hysteria around mystery illnesses people are experiencing when they use vape products that are, shall we say, less than legal.\n\nThe vaping industry is new, and it\u2019s saving lives (mine included). It is the most successful stop-smoking aid ever created. With millions of smokers looking every year for a way to quit (I know, I was one of them), the potential for growth and profit is limitless. That\u2019s why vaping has taken off and vape shops have popped up everywhere.\n\nOn the manufacturing and user fronts, one company dominates \u2013 Juul.\n\nWhat Juul sells is different from what you\u2019d find in an average vape shop. They sell small, pen-sized batteries and disposable cartridges (called \u201cpods\u201d) filled with \u201cvape juice.\u201d Vape shops don\u2019t generally carry those, they specialize in custom \u201cmods,\u201d battery cases where the power level can be adjusted to the user\u2019s preference. They have small tanks on them that can be refilled with whatever flavor of juice the user feels like at any given time. Juul-type products offer a small variety of flavors, while vape shops can have hundreds.\n\nWith the current hysteria, all the moves by governments, both federal and state, have been to push bans that would impact the vape shop model significantly more than the Juul model. That would push many users off the custom vape \u201cmods\u201d either back to cigarettes or to Juul products.\n\nThat\u2019s why Juul is so supportive of government intervention \u2013 their product will remain readily available in convenience stores, where they dominate sales and have Q-Tip or Kleenex-level brand recognition, which will not only eliminate vape shops, but will likely give them a larger share of the desperate-to-quit smoking market at the expense of other pod providers.\n\nThe current push is to ban flavors politicians say appeal to children like cinnamon roll and candy, which sort of exposes this whole push as a scam. If politicians really believed vaping was dangerous and deadly, they'd ban all of it, not flavors.\n\nJuul is actively on board with a government \u201cflavor ban\u201d under the guise of \u201cprotecting children.\u201d Openly pushing for it, in fact. But they\u2019re also working behind the scenes for exemptions for their popular flavors of mint and menthol. Menthol is a legitimate flavor; menthol cigarettes exist and are popular. There is no such thing as a \u201cmint cigarette.\u201d So, if flavors like cotton candy should be banned, why not mint? Kids like mint.\n\nWell, because Juul sells a ton of mint-flavored pods.\n\nJuul is more than happy to support bans that would harm their competitors, they\u2019re big enough in the mint and menthol market to easily survive the loss of their other flavors. And having the biggest player in the vape market on board for a ban would make implementing one much easier. All regulators have to give them is the price Juul wants to extract for that support: a carve-out for themselves. And they\u2019ll likely get it because that\u2019s how regulations work.\n\nEither vaping is dangerous or it isn\u2019t, right? Flavor shouldn\u2019t matter. But Juul is using its power to regulate themselves into a near-monopoly position and framing it as being responsible.\n\nAs an added bonus, the largest investor in Juul is Altria, which owns, among other things, Marlboro cigarettes. Regulations, bans, and general government intervention means they win on all possibilities.\n\nThe Facebooks, Twitters, and Juuls of the world gained market share over their competitors by offering products that won in their chosen industries, industries that weren\u2019t hindered by government interference at the time. Now that they have control, they\u2019re embracing government interference, even steering it, to protect themselves from liability and competitors. It is one of the biggest lies ever told that big business is anti-government, they\u2019re more than happy to use the government as a weapon when it suits their purposes.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "There\u2019s a common misconception in politics, a lie really, that .09/26/2019 1:22:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/260/461adef4-9c24-4bee-9ed7-f00b8a28a13e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
