REUTERS/Brendan Mcdermid\n\n\u201cFirst, the deal should be fully implemented ... meaning that sanctions should be lifted and America should return to the nuclear deal ... and then other issues can be discussed as well,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\n\u201cWe want America to remove its preconditions for talking to Iran, including its \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against the Iranian nation\u201d before any talks can be possible, he said at a news conference in New York during the United Nations\u2019 annual gathering of world leaders.\n\nThe U.S.-Iranian confrontation has ratcheted up since last year, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran\u2019s economy to force Tehran to renegotiate the pact.\n\nIran refuses to hold any talks with the United States unless Washington lifts sanctions on Tehran.\n\nIn retaliation for Washington\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy, Iran has gradually scaled back its nuclear commitments since May. However, Rouhani said Tehran\u2019s measures were reversible if the European parties to the pact carried out their promises to shield Iran\u2019s economy from U.S. penalties.\n\n\u201cThe European parties have proved their inability or lack of determination ... to keep the deal alive in practice. .. They want to save the pact, but they want Iran to pay the cost for it,\u201d said Rouhani.\n\nTrump wants to go beyond the deal to further curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program, halt its ballistic missile work and end its support for proxy forces in the Middle East.\n\nBut Rouhani, stating Iran\u2019s official stance, said Iran\u2019s defensive missile program was non-negotiable.\n\nThe United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia have blamed an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities on Sept. 14 on Iran, instead of the Yemeni Iran-aligned Houthi group that claimed responsibility.\n\nIran has distanced itself from the attacks, warning that it was ready for a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war.\n\n\u201cWe are innocent and had no involvement in the attack ... therefore we should not provide evidence to prove it. Those who blame Iran should provide evidence,\u201d Rouhani said on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States wants a peaceful resolution to tensions with Iran but that rests with Tehran. \u201cIn the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision,\u201d Pompeo told a news conference in New York.\n\nRouhani also touched on the subject of swaps of U.S. and Iranian prisoners, saying his country had in the past held talks with Washington over the issue.\n\nHe pointed to the release in June of a Lebanese citizen with U.S. residency who was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of spying for the United States.\n\n\u201cAfter his release, Americans thanked us but failed to reciprocate. Therefore, the ball is in the American\u2019s court now,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump took steps to bar senior Iranian officials and their immediate family from entering the United States as immigrants or non-immigrants, the White House said in a proclamation.\n\nRouhani played down the impact of Trump\u2019s move, saying \u201cIranian officials have no desire to travel to America. We only come here for the U.N. events that should not be banned by America.\u201d", "description": "Iran can discuss other issues with the United States providing its 2015 nuclear deal with six powers is fully implemented, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday, adding that Tehran's missile capabilities were not negotiable.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434263333&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1PK-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
