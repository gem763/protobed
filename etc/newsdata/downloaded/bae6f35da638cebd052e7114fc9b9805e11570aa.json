(It\u2019s a very fancy oceanfront mansion.) As previously reported, the couple invited around 140 guests to their wedding, which included the likes of Adele, Emma Stone, Cameron Diaz, Amy Schumer, Ashley Olsen, and Bradley Cooper. They also threw a lavish clambake rehearsal dinner on Friday evening for the attendees. People has some fresh details, though: Lawrence wore an ivory Dior wedding dress for the ceremony, and the boozy reception lasted well into the evening.\n\nLawrence and Maroney, who began dating in the spring of 2018, have rarely appeared at public events together, and are usually photographed walking around the streets of Manhattan. The only time she\u2019s discussed Maroney was back in June, when she appeared on her friend Cat Sadler\u2019s podcast. \u201cIt was so organic,\u201d Lawrence explained about her decision to get married. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked about it yet in an interview setting. I definitely wasn\u2019t at a place where I was like, \u2018I\u2019m ready to get married.\u2019 I just met Cooke and I wanted to marry him. We wanted to marry each other. We wanted to commit fully. He\u2019s my best friend so I want to legally bind him to me forever. And fortunately the paperwork exists for such a thing. It\u2019s the greatest. You find your favorite person in the planet and you\u2019re like, you can\u2019t leave. So I wanted to take that offer.\u201d She added that Maroney is \u201cthe greatest human being I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d which can\u2019t feel good for Darren Aronofsky or that other famous J.
