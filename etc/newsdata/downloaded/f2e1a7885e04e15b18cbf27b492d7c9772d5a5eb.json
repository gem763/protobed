But It May Not Matter.", "language": "en", "text": "That inevitably drew attention to the persistent question of how hard the president is willing to work on his priorities, as opposed to talking about them in public. Multiple Democratic presidential candidates have criticized Mr. Trump, who for years ridiculed Mr. Obama\u2019s golf outings, for the amount of time he devotes to golf.\n\nRepublicans said they do see theoretical opportunities for Mr. Trump to score notable victories, if House Democrats are willing to help deliver them. Perhaps the most significant would be congressional ratification of Mr. Trump\u2019s United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a renegotiated version of the NAFTA trade pact that is commonly known as the U.S.M.C.A. Trump administration officials have been working in earnest on Capitol Hill for months to approve the trade deal, but it is unclear whether Ms. Pelosi will support a vote.\n\nAnother, as mentioned in Trump\u2019s Tuesday tweet, is legislation to lower prescription drug prices. But it is unclear whether Democrats and Republicans can reach consensus on that issue.\n\nMr. Trump has more freedom of action on foreign policy and trade, which offer him some prospects for breakthroughs, if few easy deliverables.\n\nThe most likely is a potential agreement with the Taliban that would begin the phased withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and allow Mr. Trump to boast that he is winding down an 18-year military conflict with wan public support. But top military officials are worried about a potentially premature exit, and on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that an agreement \u201cmay or may not happen.\u201d\n\nDespite his three friendly meetings with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, his diplomacy with the country is stalled and Mr. Kim continues to expand his nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran has so far only led Iran to accelerate its nuclear program, and Tehran continues to resist talks that he hopes could lead to a tougher version of the 2015 nuclear agreement brokered by the Obama administration from which the president withdrew last year.\n\nMr. Trump has also said conflicting things about whether he might release some or all of a long-in-the-works peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians before Israel\u2019s elections on Sept. 17, which will decide the fate of one of his close allies, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "description": "Mr. Trump\u2019s primary focus, according to one Republican pollster, is to connect his actions as president to positive economic news \u201cin such a way that people understand and see how it\u2019s personally translating in their lives.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Crowley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/us/politics/04dc-trumpagenda-sub/04dc-trumpagenda-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
