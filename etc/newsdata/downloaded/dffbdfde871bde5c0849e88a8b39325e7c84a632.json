Sports Illustrated reported that the NFL had received a letter Thursday evening from the second woman\u2019s lawyer claiming Brown sent the accuser \u201cintimidating\u201d text messages after her allegations went public this week.\n\n\u201cI know there are questions about Antonio. We take all the situations with our team very seriously and there are some things that we are looking into,\u201d Belichick said at the start of the press conference. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to comment on any of the off-the-field situations or questions on that. Anything on football, I could answer.\u201d\n\nANTONIO BROWN'S TIMELINE OF DRAMA: DETAILS OF THE STAR WIDE RECEIVERS INCIDENTS\n\nHowever, reporters only seemed interested in the Brown allegations, asking Belichick question after question about the player.\n\nWhen asked what Brown\u2019s role would be in Sunday's matchup against the New York Jets, Belichick said, \u201cum, no. I\u2019m not going to get into that.\u201d\n\nBROWN ACCUSED OF SENDING 'INTIMIDATING' TEXT MESSAGES TO SECOND ACCUSER\n\nThen when another reporter asked if Brown would be available for the game, Belichick gave an even snappier answer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on our roster,\u201d the coach said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEventually, Belichick had enough and walked out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good.
