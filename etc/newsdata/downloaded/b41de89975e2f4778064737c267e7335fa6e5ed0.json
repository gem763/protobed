Be a ruthless editor | CBC Books", "language": "en", "text": "The 2020 CBC Short Story Prize is open for submissions! You can submit your original, unpublished writing up to 2,000 words for a chance to win $6,000 from the Canada Council for the Arts, a two-week writing residency at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and have your work published on CBC Books. The deadline to enter is Oct. 31, 2019.\n\nTo inspire and support you along the way, we are publishing a writing tip each week on CBC Books. You can also subscribe to our writing tips newsletter for even more tips.\n\nThis week's tip is from Kasia Juno.\n\n\"For a writer, avoiding boring sentences is the task of a lifetime. One strategy to avoid boredom is to pare down your prose, to make your writing as exacting and urgent as possible. Gordon Lish, who was Raymond Carver's editor for many years, is famous for taking this method to its extreme. Lish's piranha-like editing technique teaches us that texts have many hidden lives, depending on what is included, what is emphasized, what is left out. Try this Lish-inspired editing exercise:\n\nFirst, cut 100 words out of the story.\n\nThen 200.\n\nNow, get rid of a third of the story's word count.\n\n\"If this sounds hostile, it's because it is. Be hostile. Lash \u2014 or rather, Lish \u2014 at your prose. You can always put the words back.\"\n\nKasia Juno is a Montreal-based writer and PhD student.
