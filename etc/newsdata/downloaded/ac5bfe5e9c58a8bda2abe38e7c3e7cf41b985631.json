Dan Crenshaw took to Twitter to compare conditions in northern Syria before and after the Trump administration abruptly withdrew U.S. forces from the region this week.\n\n\u201cSituation when we were there: relative peace,\u201d the Texas Republican tweeted.\n\nThe congressman then listed a series of developments that have taken place in the region since the U.S. withdrawal, such as Islamic State fighters escaping from confinement and ISIS setting off a car bomb.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just day one,\u201d Mr. Crenshaw tweeted. \u201cWhich scenario looks more like an endless war?\u201d\n\nThe White House announced the withdrawal from Syria late last Sunday, catching members of Congress and U.S. allies off guard and causing Mr. Trump to face criticism from several fellow Republicans, including Mr. Crenshaw.\n\n\u201cWe should not be making this decision so abruptly,\u201d Mr. Crenshaw tweeted earlier this week, referring to the withdrawal in a subsequent tweet as a \u201cforeign policy blunder.\u201d\n\nOther members of the GOP to raise related concerns this week include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cAmerican interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal,\u201d said Mr. McConnell.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s putting the nation at risk, and I think he\u2019s putting his presidency at risk,\u201d said Mr. Graham.\n\nMr. Crenshaw, 35, served 10 years as a Navy SEAL, including five tours of duty and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He retired from the military in 2016 and announced his candidacy for Congress the following November.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
