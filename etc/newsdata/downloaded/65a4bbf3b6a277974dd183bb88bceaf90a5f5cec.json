When Julie didn\u2019t answer, she started to worry.\n\nShe called Julie\u2019s brother and they broke in through the back door.\n\nWhen there was no sign of Julie, Ann called the police, who suggested she had hitched a lift to London.\n\n\u201cBut as her mother, I knew that hadn\u2019t happened,\u201d says Ann.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until four days after Julie disappeared that police sent a forensic team to investigate. Despite combing the house, they found nothing suspicious.\n\nWeeks rolled into months.\n\n\u201cKevin would cry and ask where Mummy was. It was horrible.\u201d\n\nAnn, from Billingham, Co Durham, tried to convince herself her daughter had run away.\n\n\u201cI started feeling angry. I couldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d disappeared.\u201d\n\nIn February, Julie\u2019s husband, who worked in London, planned to move back into their house to take care of their son.\n\nHe went in to clean up fingerprint dust left by police and noticed an odd smell.\n\nHe told Ann, who called round. By this time, Julie had been missing for 80 days. As she walked inside, Ann felt sick.\n\n\u201cI worked in operating theatres as a nurse and I had a horrible feeling.\u201d\n\nAnn went into the bathroom where she noticed the bath panel was loose.\n\nShe pulled it away, revealing a horrifying sight. There, hidden under the bath was Julie\u2019s naked body.\n\n\u201cIt was a living nightmare,\u201d she says.\n\nPolice did a post-mortem and nine days later arrested an acquaintance of Julie\u2019s husband, Billy Dunlop, and charged him with murder.\n\nDunlop, who had a history of violent assaults, had been at a stag-do and on the way home called in to see a friend who lived next door to Julie.\n\nWhen he left, he noticed Julie\u2019s light was on and told his friend he planned to call in and say hello.\n\nDunlop was the last person to see Julie alive.\n\nThe case was heard at Newcastle Crown Court.\n\n\u201cI was on so much medication, I barely knew what was going on,\u201d says Ann, who suffered from \u00adpost-traumatic stress after discovering Julie\u2019s body.\n\nThe jury failed to reach a verdict, so the judge ordered a retrial. Once again, they were unable to reach a verdict and Billy Dunlop was acquitted.\n\n\u201cHe was bragging in pubs for weeks that he\u2019d got away with the perfect murder.\u201d\n\nAnn was at her lowest ebb.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my daughter had been taken from me. I felt so guilty for all those weeks being angry at her for not calling.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Dunlop\u2019s violent streak to resurface and he was arrested several times over the following years.\n\nThen in 1997, nine years after Julie\u2019s murder, he was sentenced to seven years for grievous bodily harm after stabbing his ex-girlfriend with a carving fork and beating up her lover.\n\nHe continued to threaten his ex from prison, sending her a letter saying that when he got out, he\u2019d do what he\u2019d done to Julie \u2013 and kill her.\n\nHis ex took the letter to the police, but as Dunlop had been acquitted, their hands were tied. This was because of an 800-year-old law \u2013 the double jeopardy law \u2013 which states a person cannot be tried again once acquitted.\n\nThe best police could hope for was to convict him of lying under oath.\n\nA prison officer secretly recorded Dunlop saying when he called round to Julie\u2019s house, he\u2019d told her about a fight he\u2019d been in. She\u2019d nervously laughed, which annoyed him, so he strangled her. Dunlop was convicted of perjury but sentenced to only six years.\n\nAnn was at breaking point. She wrote to her MP, who got her an appointment with then home secretary Jack Straw.\n\nHe gave her the address of a judge on the Law Commission who she could write to.\n\n\u201cIt was just so unjust. I wanted them to hear what I\u2019d been through.\u201d\n\nThe Commission recommended an amendment to the law, allowing people to be tried again if there was \u201cnew and \u00adcompelling\u201d evidence.\n\nThe amendment was approved and passed to the House of Lords \u2013 and Ann asked if she could give a speech there.\n\n\u201cAs I stood up, I thought of Julie, and all the mothers like me in the future who otherwise might not get justice,\u201d she says.\n\nA few weeks later, the bill was passed. And it applied retrospectively, meaning Dunlop could be tried again.\n\nIn May 2006, Dunlop\u2019s acquittal was quashed by the Court of Appeal. And that October \u2013 17 years after Julie\u2019s death \u2013 he was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey.\n\n\u201cTo hear the judge say Dunlop was guilty was unbelievable,\u201d says Ann.\n\nDunlop, then 43, was sentenced to a minimum of 17 years.\n\nSince Ann\u2019s campaign, the new law has been used to secure 13 convictions, including Stephen Lawrence\u2019s killers.\n\nFor Ann and her family, they live with the loss of their beloved Julie every day.\n\n\u201cI believe in life after death, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be waiting for me.\u201d\n\nAnn\u2019s story features on Catching Britain\u2019s Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us, BBC2, Wednesday\n\nParents who changed the law\n\nChild safety\n\nSara Payne successfully campaigned for the introduction of Sarah\u2019s Law in 2010, after her daughter Sarah was abducted and murdered by a paedophile in 2000.\n\nThe law means anyone can formally ask the police if someone who has access to a child, such as a neighbour or family friend, has a record for child sexual offences.\n\nThe police will reveal the information confidentially to whoever can best protect the child, if they feel it is in the child\u2019s best interests.\n\nBereaved parents\n\nAfter eight years of lobbying politicians, Lucy Herd\u2019s Parental Bereavement Law came into effect last year.\n\nThe law allows parents who lose a child to take two weeks\u2019 paid leave.\n\nLucy\u2019s two-year-old son Jack died after falling into a garden pond in 2010.\n\nAfter the tragic accident, she discovered Jack\u2019s father was only entitled to three days leave, one of which had to be taken on the day of his funeral.\n\nViolent parents\n\nThanks to Clare\u2019s Law, which was rolled out across England and Wales in 2014, people now have the right to know if their partner has a history of domestic violence.\n\nThis was the result of a five-year campaign by Michael Brown, pictured, whose daughter Clare Wood was murdered, aged 36, by her partner George Appleton.\n\nClare met Appleton on Facebook and was unaware of his violent past.", "description": "Ann Ming's daughter was brutally killed 30 years ago - and the murder led to an extraordinary fight that led to a change in the double jeopardy law", "authors": ["Elizabeth Archer"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571564.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS29579213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
