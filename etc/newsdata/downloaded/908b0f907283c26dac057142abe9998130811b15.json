This decision represents not just a moral betrayal of men and women who fought and bled by our side in the battle against the world\u2019s most powerful jihadist army, it represents a strategic blunder that is likely to cost American lives for years to come.\n\nTo understand the reason for the additional strategic risk, one has to understand the nature of the successful American military operation against ISIS. Unlike American offensives during much of the Iraq War \u2014 when hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of American troops would conduct complex and costly urban military operations with minimal effective help from Iraqi allies \u2014 during the fight against ISIS, our allies have largely born the burden of ground combat. Yes, they\u2019ve enjoyed the indispensable support of American artillery and air power, and small groups of American soldiers have rendered aid and engaged in direct combat as well, but our allies have been going house-to-house and have paid a terrible price. By some estimates, as many as 11,000 Kurds have lost their lives in the fight against ISIS \u2014 a staggering death toll borne by a relatively small population.\n\nThe result \u2014 from an American perspective \u2014 has been one of the most successful military operations in a generation. The ISIS caliphate, which once dominated a nation-state sized region covering much of northern Syria and northern Iraq, is now in ruins. ISIS isn\u2019t entirely defeated, but it\u2019s a shadow of its former strength. And the cost in American lives has been a small fraction of the cost incurred in even a single battle of the Iraq War. For example, America suffered almost 700 casualties (82 killed) during the Second Battle of Fallujah. The nation has suffered far fewer casualties during the entire fight against ISIS, stretching from June 2014 until the present day.\n\nBut if the allied bargain with America is that our local allies bleed and then we abandon them to death and military catastrophe when we weary of the alliance, who will ally with us again? Moreover, as we know from recent history, terrorists often thrive not just in chaos but especially in the power vacuums created by unwise American withdrawals. Thus, the Trump administration is creating the worst possible dynamic \u2014 it\u2019s undercutting allies at the very same time that it\u2019s creating conditions that may require us to ask for their help again.\n\nIndeed, to understand the true magnitude of the betrayal, there are now multiple reports that the Trump administration \u2014 in an effort to de-escalate tensions between the Turks and the Kurds \u2014 had previously asked our Kurdish allies to dismantle defensive fortifications along the border, rendering them more vulnerable to Turkish invasion. Now our allies will have to reallocate forces, rebuild fortifications, and \u2014 in many cases \u2014 leave the field in the ongoing fight against ISIS remnants.\n\nIn a string of tweets, President Trump sought to justify his decision by declaring that he had been elected to extricate America from \u201cridiculous, endless wars,\u201d but Trump\u2019s withdrawal does not end the war. It grants our enemies a much-needed respite. ISIS has never ended its fight against America. It\u2019s been weakened, and in some areas it has been routed, but it has not asked for peace. It does not seek peace.\n\nBy potentially further destabilizing northern Iraq, Trump not only puts our Kurdish allies at profound risk, he also creates conditions that could lead to a total loss of allied control over the tens of thousands of ISIS detainees held by the Kurds. In his statement, Trump announced that Turkey would be \u201cresponsible\u201d for \u201call ISIS fighters captured in the area over the past two years.\u201d This is a fantasy. The far more likely outcome is that ISIS fighters and ISIS operatives will assume increasing control over the relevant facilities, and there will be a likely loss of containment.\n\nIt is absolutely true that the United States faces a formidable challenge in Syria. ISIS has not been entirely defeated, there is a long-running simmering conflict between Turkey and Kurdish forces, and there is still no final peace settlement in the Syrian civil war. Resolving those challenges requires a combination of military resolve and deft diplomacy.
