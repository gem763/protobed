Over the last fiscal year, the majority of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border were from those three countries.\n\nAfter a summer of rising apprehensions at the border, the Trump administration is redoubling efforts to stem the flow of migration to the US by making it harder for some migrants to seek asylum in the US.\n\nOn Monday, Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said that as of next week, Border Patrol will no longer be releasing families into the interior of the US. In March, Border Patrol began releasing people directly from its custody with a notice to appear in court amid an influx of migrant arrivals at the southern border.\n\nMcAleenan said families claiming asylum will be sent to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings or will be repatriated.\n\nRead More", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday that it has struck an agreement with Honduras designed to curb migration to the US, marking the latest in a string of accords with Central American countries.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez", "Geneva Sands"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190904173249-02-migrants-border-patrol-190702-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
