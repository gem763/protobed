Bill Huizenga's campaign spending\n\nThe House Ethics Committee is reviewing allegations that Rep. Bill Huizenga misused campaign funds, but the Michigan Republican is dismissing the case as a partisan stunt.\n\nMichigan Democrats filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission last fall claiming Huizenga and his family improperly spent thousands of dollars in campaign funds, in addition to incorrectly itemizing reimbursements.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe FEC rejected the Democratic complaint, but apparently the independent Office of Congressional Ethics moved forward on the issue and recommended that the House Ethics Committee look into the matter.\n\nHuizenga's office said the Michigan Republican cooperated with the OCE probe; his aides insist Huizenga's reelection campaign is in compliance with FEC rules on campaign disbursements and reporting.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

We have cooperated fully in this process and will continue to do so,\" said Brian Patrick, Huizenga's communications director. \"This matter is the continuation of a partisan and politically motivated complaint filed by the Michigan Democratic Party prior to the 2018 election that has already been resolved by the Federal Election Commission.\u201d\n\nThe House Ethics panel will have another 45 days following Monday's announcement to review the OCE recommendation. If Ethics takes up the case at that point, the full OCE report will be released. However, there is no final deadline for Ethics Committee action.", "description": "The veteran Michigan Republican dismisses the Democratic complaint as a partisan stunt.", "authors": ["John Bresnahan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/81/f9/f9d155174098a671fea32a1dbf6e/20190930-bill-spending-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
