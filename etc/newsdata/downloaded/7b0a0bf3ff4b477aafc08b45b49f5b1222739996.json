It said at least 2,312 people were injured, mostly protesters, in angry confrontations with security forces.\n\nIn one Baghdad confrontation, masked officers shot volleys of tear gas canisters from a bridge to the Green Zone, the seat of Parliament and the prime minister, to drive back a crowd of unarmed demonstrators in Tahrir Square. Undeterred, the protesters surged again toward the bridge and were repeatedly repulsed.\n\nThe protests were a resumption of antigovernment demonstrations that started in the first week of October, but paused two weeks ago, after shootings by the security forces killed nearly 150 protesters nationwide, shocking the country and deepening disappointment with the government.", "description": "Demonstrations resumed despite government offers of new jobs, more money for housing and a crackdown on corruption.
