He died in March at age 47.\n\nBrant grew up in a collecting family, \u201cin an environment of immense creativity and aesthetic stimulation,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said. His father, Peter Brant, was an early collector of Andy Warhol and a major collector of Franz Kline, and former publisher of Art in America magazine, which merged with ARTnews in 2015.\n\n\u201cAs is befitting a successful creative entrepreneur, Ryan was ahead of the curve in his appreciation for cutting-edge contemporary artists\u2014most especially as an early collector and advocate of KAWS,\u201d said Amy Cappellazzo, chairman of Sotheby\u2019s fine art division, in a statement.\n\nSotheby\u2019s will offer over 130 items from Brant\u2019s collection, beginning with three works by KAWS, Don\u2019t Sink, Untitled (HTLB1), and Untitled, at a New York auction on Sept. 26, titled Contemporary Curated.\n\n\u201cUpon first glance, it is clear that Ryan possessed a very distinct yet playful eye,\u201d says Charlotte Van Dercook, head of Sotheby\u2019s Contemporary Curated auctions in New York. \u201cFrom vibrant, colorful works by KAWS to a whimsical, large-scale canvas by Francesco Clemente, the pieces on offer in our sale illustrate the avant-garde approach that he applied not only to collecting art, but also his pioneering vision as the founder of Take-Two Interactive.\u201d\n\nThe Skull by Francesco Clemente Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nDon\u2019t Sink by KAWS has a high estimate of $350,000, and The Skull by Clemente is estimated to fetch up to $80,000.\n\nTwo additional works by KAWS will be included in Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong sale of contemporary art from Oct. 6-7. Untitled (MBFR) has a high estimate of HK$6.2 million (US$795,000), while Untitled is estimated to sell for as high as HK$3.5 million ($447,000).\n\nWorks by KAWS, the New Jersey-born artist also known as Brian Donnelly, have a big appeal to Asian collectors, especially those from younger generations. In April, his painting, The Kaws Album (2005), sold for HK$115.9 million (about US$14.7 million) at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, setting an auction record for the artist.\n\nKAWS is a graffiti-artist-turned-fine-artist. He is known for subverting American iconic cartoon characters, including The Simpsons, Mickey Mouse, the Michelin Man, the Smurfs, Snoopy, and SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nFurniture from the collection of Ryan Brant will be offered at Sotheby\u2019s sale of important design in New York on Dec. 12. Other items will be included throughout Sotheby\u2019s auctions into next spring.", "description": "Over 130 pieces from the video game executive will be offered in a series of sales at Sotheby\u2019s", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110010/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
