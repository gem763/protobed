After witnessing three further knockdowns, the referee, Michael Griffin, stopped the fight.\n\nAnthony Joshua\u2019s trainer McCracken backed over concussion comments Read more\n\nRobert McCracken, Joshua\u2019s trainer, said this week he was aware Joshua was \u201cconcussed\u201d for the last four rounds of the fight against the heavy-handed Mexican before clarifying his use of the word following criticism from outside the boxing community.\n\nJoshua, the former three-belt world heavyweight champion who fights Ruiz in a rematch in December, said however that he was prepared to fight on. He was standing upright and seemingly sound in his own corner, his arms draped across the ropes.\n\n\u201cI knew where I was,\u201d Joshua told the Guardian in an interview in New York shortly before McCracken\u2019s comments. \u201cBut definitely they call it concussion \u2026 That\u2019s what they call it. But I think concussion is a weak term. You\u2019ve got to be stronger than it. You\u2019ve got to fight through the concussion if you can.\n\n\u201cThat shot on my head [to the left temple in round three] made it really difficult \u2026 If concussion is what they\u2019re calling it, that punch that gave me concussion, made it difficult.\u201d\n\nReturning to the end of the fight, when he was standing in his corner, Joshua added: \u201cI just remember, my hands on the ropes. It\u2019s a practice when I\u2019m training and stuff.\n\n\u201cI went to walk forward a bit. He\u2019s got my hands here [in front of him], went to walk forward a little bit, and he got my hands, so I\u2019ve gone back, like I thought the gumshield was going to go in. I thought there was going to be, like, a fight. If you notice I didn\u2019t even have my gumshield in my mouth. And the fight was called off.\u201d\n\nFollowing McCracken\u2019s interview with the BBC\u2019s boxing podcast, Luke Griggs, the deputy chief executive of the brain charity Headway, said: \u201cTrainers have a duty of care to their boxers and it seems clear that Anthony Joshua\u2019s trainer\u2019s sole priority was winning that fight, not protecting the fighter from a potentially fatal injury.\u201d\n\nThe criticism prompted McCracken \u2013 a leading light-middleweight in the 1990s whose only losses came by stoppage in his last two contests \u2013 to release a statement and he was subsequently backed by the British Boxing Board of Control.\n\n\u201cI am not a doctor and it may be that concussed is not the right term to have used,\u201d McCracken said in the statement. \u201cThe health of all the boxers I work with is of paramount importance to me and I have always used my judgment and experience to do what is right for them.\n\n\u201cThere is no formal concussion protocol where the doctor steps in to assess the boxer, so you have to use your experience as a coach and your knowledge of the person to make a decision on whether you think they can recover.\n\nAmnesty says Anthony Joshua is being duped over Saudi Arabia fight Read more\n\n\u201cI have had this a number of times in my career in professional boxing where boxers have recovered from a difficult round to go on and win the fight. I have also pulled boxers out of fights because I knew it was not in their interests to continue.\u201d\n\nGriffin, a Canadian who has refereed 366 bouts since 1997, including many at world level, was right to stop the fight. He judged Joshua was not fit to continue.\n\nJoshua had taken intermittent punishment, in short bursts, without Ruiz landing a punch that definitively would keep him on the canvas. They were messy exchanges, but their effect was cumulative. That is what Griffin saw in Joshua\u2019s eyes.", "description": "Anthony Joshua has admitted he knew he was concussed but was ready to \u201cfight through\u201d it against Andy Ruiz Jr", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b2fa2b7a8aed897c42d3c17952acc7af34d691/0_216_4166_2499/master/4166.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=659991f4607b341423d8234e6762851c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
