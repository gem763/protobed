Common Shares issued pursuant to the Private Placement are subject to a four month and one day statutory hold in accordance with Canadian securities laws. In relation to the Offering, the Company paid commissions to a certain licensed finder. The commissions paid to the finder consisted of a cash payment of $72,999.99. The Private Placement is subject to final approval by the TSX Venture Exchange. The Strategic Investor and Roc Global Investments participated in the private placement.\n\nThe aggregate gross proceeds of $US 7.1M from the Royalty and the Private Placement will be used for the completion of the senior debt financing, completion of due diligence work, further development of the Tugaske Potash Project and working capital.\n\nRoyalty Agreement with Strategic Project Equity Investors\n\nThe Strategic Investor and the Project Off-taker for the Tugaske Potash Project (see Gensource\u2019 news release dated May 22, 2019) have executed royalty agreements (the \u201cRoyalty Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Gensource has granted a royalty (the \u201cRoyalty\u201d) to the purchasers (the \u201cRoyalty Owners\u201d) in consideration of US$6.0 Million paid by the Royalty Owners to Gensource. In relation to the Royalty Agreement, the Company paid a cash commission of $US 120,000.00. Pertinent details of the Royalty Agreement are:\n\nGensource grants to the Royalty Owners the Royalty at the rate of 2% of gross revenue from the sale of commercial minerals (calculated and paid quarterly on the terms set out in the Royalty Agreement) extracted from the Company\u2019s mineral dispositions with respect to the Project and for the life of the Project;\n\nThe Royalty will run with the Mineral Dispositions, and will be a registered interest on the mineral leases; and\n\nThe Royalty Owners shall have the right to the Royalty on minerals produced and sold by the first module of production to be constructed on the leases. In the May 22nd news release, it was disclosed that the Strategic Investor and the Project Off-taker have signed Letters of Intent to provide 33% and 25%, respectively, of the project equity required as part of the Project finance package.\n\nGensource has worked tirelessly to bring the right groups to the Project for both debt and equity as it moves forward with creating a full project finance and ownership structure for the Tugaske Project. Our partners in this Project are strong industry players who see the value in Gensource\u2019 business and project approach and wish to be part of the future of the potash industry. As a result of today\u2019s announcement, Gensource has successfully sourced strategic support from sophisticated investors to advance the Tugaske Project to completion of the project finance stage.\n\nThe part and parcel transaction (the Royalty Agreement and the Private Placement together) announced today is unique and important for a number of reasons:\n\nIt provides the required capital for Gensource to complete the detailed senior debt due diligence process towards achieving a financial close for the project finance package;\n\nIt provides interim working capital for Gensource to accomplish the financial close;\n\nIt provides the above capital in a manner that is largely non-dilutive to existing Gensource shareholders; and\n\nIt allows the future equity owners of the Project to invest their risk capital in the Project at the current stage. Both the Royalty Agreement and the Private Placement underscore the belief in, and commitment to the Project by both of the Royalty Owners.\n\nMike Ferguson, President & CEO of Gensource, said, \u201cWe are very pleased to welcome our project partners \u2013 both the Strategic Investor and the Off-taker \u2013 to the Tugaske Potash Project as Royalty Owners. We appreciate their trust in Gensource\u2019 approach to potash production. We also appreciate their unique foresight, which allows them to see the tremendous opportunities ahead under the Gensource model. We see the equity investment as a further validation of the Gensource \u201cPotash 2.0\u201d concept. At the same time, we acknowledge the support of existing shareholders to allow Gensource to bring the Project to its current stage of development \u2013 the Royalty, being non-dilutive to existing shareholders, underscores our focus on shareholder value. We look forward to working with our project partners to complete the remaining debt and equity financing work and achieving a financial close in early 2020.\u201d\n\nAbout Gensource\n\nGensource is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and is focused on developing the next potash production facility in that province.

The group also owns real estate and has development interests, the roots of which go back to the early nineteen fifties.
