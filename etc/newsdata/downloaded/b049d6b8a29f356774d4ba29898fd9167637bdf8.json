This rises to 60 per cent for under-35s.\n\nMr Tanzer said the organisation had been \u2018studiously neutral\u2019 on the issue of Brexit but said disruption would \u2018surely follow\u2019 a no-deal scenario.\n\nHe said: \u2018What we have been vocal about, to government, is the need to avoid a no-deal Brexit, with the uncertainty and disruption that will surely follow.\n\n\u2018As we stand here today, a no-deal Brexit is still one of the possibilities just days away, and we are having to tell members, and members of the public, to prepare for it.\n\n\u2018Not only is the threat of a no-deal exit costly in terms of preparation, but it is also very damaging to consumer confidence.\n\nThe survey of 2,043 Britons also found 51 per cent were worried it will be more expensive to go on holiday after Brexit. This rises to 60 per cent for under-35s. Pictured, Bournemouth\n\n\u2018In the run-up to the March deadline, we saw an industry slowdown, and the same pattern is repeating itself as we approach another cliff edge.\u2019\n\nThe survey of 2,043 UK consumers also found more than half (51 per cent) said they are worried it will be more expensive for them to go on holiday after the UK leaves the EU. This rises to 60 per cent among those aged 34 or under.\n\nThe survey also found consumers are cutting back on how much they spend on holiday.\n\nThe average amount of money spent by people on short overseas trips this year fell by \u00a398 compared with 2017.\n\nSpending on longer foreign holidays is down \u00a394 over the same period and there has also been a drop in how much people are forking out for UK breaks.\n\nMr Tanza also addressed the collapse of Thomas Cook during the convention, saying it was \u2018more a failure of corporate finance than a failure of the travel industry.\u2019\n\nHe said: \u2018Thomas Cook\u2019s financial challenges were no secret, but the full extent of their indebtedness has only come to light recently.\n\n\u2018Thomas Cook paid \u00a31.2bn in finance charges over the past six years, plus goodness knows how much in advisory fees.\n\n'Those were profits from its holiday business, money that in a more balanced financial model would have been available to invest and develop the business.\n\n\u2018The pain of the Thomas Cook failure is being felt very widely in our industry, by tour operators, travel agents, hotels and other suppliers.\n\n'There is a lot of anger and fear, and the desire to look for someone to blame is understandable.\n\n'But we really do have to work together at this moment, to maintain customer confidence, to find new homes for displaced businesses, and to try to recruit former Thomas Cook staff, who constitute an immense repository of talent and experience.\n\n\u2018When that job is done, we can and should ask what lessons can be learned, especially about when money is collected and when it passed on, when people and companies are financially protected and when not.\n\n'And at the very least we need to ensure that everyone in the chain understands the system and makes commercial decisions on an informed basis.\u2019", "description": "A survey found those aged under 35, younger families and those in Northern Ireland, London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the East Midlands were more concerned about No Deal.
