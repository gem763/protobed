Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera, commented on the new feature launch:\n\n\u201cWe believe that opening our browser to more blockchains, including Bitcoin, is the logical next step to making our solution more relevant to anyone who has a Bitcoin crypto wallet and would like to do things with their cryptocurrencies beyond just keeping them in an account.\u201d\n\nThe features were previously released in the Beta version of the browser this summer, while the first cryptocurrency available for purchase through the browser was Ether (ETH) in February.\n\nOpera\u2019s Web 3-focused developments\n\nIn recent months, Opera has actively presented new developments related to Web 3, the term referring to a new evolution of the web, with the creation of high-quality content and involvement of blockchain, decentralized computing and digital currencies.\n\nThe company released the iOS version of its mobile web browser, Opera Touch, that supports Ethereum protocol and Ethereum Web3 apps, and a Web 3 explorer, which enables users to conduct transactions and interact with Web 3.\n\nAlthough Opera\u2019s market share among other browsers accounts for only 3% as of September 2019, its latest development is another step forward to \u201can experimental integration of Web 3\u201d and further adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs Hamel previously claimed, the company aims to remove the friction involved in \u201cusing cryptocurrencies online and accessing Web 3 via special apps or extensions,\u201d in a bid to make the emerging technologies more mainstream.\n\nIn the meantime, cryptocurrency-powered browser Brave claimed high user engagement, with daily active users standing at over 2.8 million, and the number of creators subscribed to its web advertisement network also reportedly increased substantially.", "description": "Web browser Opera now supports payments with Bitcoin directly inside the browser", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjA5MDkzMjlhYzU3YTk5OGI0ZWU5MjYyNWRmNmQ2YmUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
