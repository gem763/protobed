Not only do the classic epaulettes flatter any figure, but they take us back to another era when we might've been required to throw a trench coat over the top of our uniform before an afternoon of playground debauchery.\n\nIt's a classic piece, one that continues to be reworked by designers for the autumn/winter season.\n\nA-line skirts\n\nAlexa Chung, COS and Mango are just some of the go-to labels for your A-line skirt fix this season.\n\nA timeless but flattering shape, the thigh-grazing A-line skirt can work wonders when worn with thick woolly tights and a tight-fitting poloneck top. Throw in some biker boots for extra an school grounds-style stomp.\n\nTweed blazers\n\nThere's never a shortage of tailoring come autumn, but focusing on a blazer alone is often dismissed in favour of co-ordinating looks. They can, however, look immensely stylish when worn over the top of a slogan T-shirt.\n\nGet involved with Oxfam's Second Hand September campaign for this item by rummaging through your local charity shop to see if you can find the perfect vintage blazer for the season ahead - just be sure to give it a good wash first.\n\nPlaid, paisley and argyle\n\nPlaid is a pattern you might've sworn off having had to wear it for most of your life between the ages of 11 and 18, but it's an ideal autumn staple for adults given its versatility.\n\nLikewise with paisley and argyle, which are too easily dismissed as frumpy fashion prints. This season, designers including Molly Goddard and Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chlo\u00e9 are putting modern twists on the aforementioned prints, notes Ross, pointing to the style of Diana, Princess of Wales as a key inspiration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a look that screams prim and proper but now has a modern spin,\u201d Ross explains.\n\nKnee-high socks\n\nWho says you have to be an 11-year-old girl to wear your socks pulled up?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with pairing your shiniest brogues with some white silk knee-highs for Blair Waldorf in Gossip Girl look. Particularly this season, when that collegiate style comes back into fashion.\n\nFor a full embrace of the back to school mood, you could even through a headband into the mix, lord knows they've had a renaissance in recent months.", "description": "Regardless of your age, September always feels like a time for new beginnings.
