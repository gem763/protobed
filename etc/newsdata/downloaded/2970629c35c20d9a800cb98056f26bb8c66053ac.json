Our bond holdings are down to about 5% of our portfolio, about 18% is cash (MMA). Rest is equity. Contributing pretty heavily to savings during final few years of work.\n\nI\u2019m in a similar mindset as you, lack of yield leads me to not \u201clock away\u201d money for pitiful yields, I\u2019d just rather build cash for now. I\u2019d love to move more of our cash into bonds, but yields are causing me to hold off for now. Just \u201cdribbling\u201d money into bond funds for now- $5000 per month. Our bond funds are as follows:\n\n25% VWALX/ 50% VWIUX/ 25% VMLUX (for house we\u2019re building) is in our taxable accounts (majority of our bond money)\n\n50% VBILX/ 50% VEMBX (Emerg Mts. Bond)/ VTABX (Intl bonds)/ VWEAX (high yield) in two ROTH accounts\n\nVICSX in 401-K/ IRA accounts\n\nVBIAX (~40% bonds) and VWELX (~30% bonds) in our two ROTH 401-K\u2019s.\n\nHoping yields start trending up over next 1-2 years, but right now that looks unlikely. At least in cash, I stay \u201cflexible\u201d and can move it (slowly) to bonds. Plus, the yields on bonds are not much higher than good MMA\u2019s right now.\n\nWin", "description": "Currently my bond holdings are down to about 9% of my holdings and that 9% is invested in a 0-5 Year maturity EFT.
