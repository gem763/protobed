She claimed diplomatic immunity and left the country after the incident.\n\nDiplomatic immunity normally only covers diplomats and their families based in London.\n\nBut Sky News reports there has been a special deal in place since 1994 between the UK and the US for RAF Croughton, which also covers some other sites outside the capital.\n\nPolice said initial investigations indicated Harry was riding his vehicle on the correct side of the road, but that a woman hit him head-on after pulling out of the base onto the wrong side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn attempt by Northamptonshire Police to stop the suspect leaving was declined, and the US Embassy have confirmed she is no longer in the UK.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom publicly appealed to the woman to come forward (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nMr Dunn\u2019s parents have also received a letter from Woody Johnson, US Ambassador to the UK, expressing \u2018profound sadness\u2019.\n\nGovernment ministers have called for the American woman to face questioning in the UK.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom, who is the family\u2019s local MP in South Northamptonshire, called on the woman to step forward.\n\nShe said: \u2018Obviously I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure they get justice for Harry.\u2019\n\n\u2018But, at the same time, I would appeal over the head of the Foreign Office to the woman; it was an accident from all accounts \u2013 obviously I wasn\u2019t there and it needs a police investigation \u2013 but surely she must see that this family needs closure.\u2019\n\nMr Dunn\u2019s father Tim said: \u2018We\u2019re disgusted, appalled. How could she be having this cloak wrapped around her?\n\n\u2018I\u2019m angry someone could do this then get on a plane and go. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s living with herself.\u2019\n\nA campaign group called Justice For Harry has been set up on social media and has raised over \u00a34000 of its \u00a310,000 target though a gofundme page.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
