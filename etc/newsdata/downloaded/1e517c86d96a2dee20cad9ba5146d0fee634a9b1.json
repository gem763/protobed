His big concern is the planet and his inspiration is Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\n\"This is about our future,\" the 24-year-old explains, echoing the teenage campaigner. He says he began to read about climate change after seeing her protests, and realised the threat.\n\n\"Russia is the world's fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and our government won't act without pressure. So it's important to strike for the climate.\"\n\nBut it seems many Russians have a problem with Greta.\n\n'A kind and very sincere girl'\n\nPresenters and commentators on state TV channels have mocked the climate activist relentlessly, even cruelly.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Putin on Greta: \"I don't share everyone's enthusiasm\"\n\nSocial media users have insulted her and this week President Vladimir Putin patronised the teenager, suggesting someone should \"explain\" just how the adult world works. \"I'm sure Greta is a kind and very sincere girl,\" he added.\n\nThere's a lot of talk of mysterious forces \"controlling\" her and column inches asking the eternal Russian question \"who benefits\" from her activism.\n\nIt is possible they just don't get it.\n\nEnvironmental activism is not big in Russia, where many feel they have more pressing things to fret about. High prices, poverty and corruption all regularly top the lists of concerns, way above climate change.\n\nThen there's the fact that politicians often hail the economic benefits of global warming: opening up the Northern Sea Route, for example, for both shipping and energy exploration in the Arctic.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"You are failing us\" - Greta tells world leaders\n\nRussia is a major fossil fuel exporter, of course.\n\nAnd the idea of getting warmer is unlikely to worry people too much - not in a country where for half of the year your nostril hairs freeze as soon as you step into the street.\n\nAre Russians waking up to climate change?\n\nMany would struggle to do much to help halt climate change, even if they did care.\n\nIn most homes you have to open a window in winter to regulate the heating because radiators are turned on centrally, full blast.\n\nRecycling does now exist in some places and it's improving. But it's still haphazard at best and voluntary. As one colleague once explained, memorably: \"In Russia, we have lots of trees.\"\n\nBut as of this summer, there are a lot fewer of them.\n\nWildfires swept forests in Siberia and far eastern regions this year on an unprecedented scale. Those, and mass floods, were blamed on climate change.\n\nImage caption A satellite image shows wildfires in Siberia during the summer\n\nThe melting permafrost has also become a more common topic of debate.\n\nEven President Putin, who suggested Greta Thunberg consider the \"reality\" of developing countries' ambitions when she lectured on climate change, has expressed concern that Russia is warming 1.5 times faster than the average worldwide.\n\nThree years after signing the Paris climate accord, the government has suddenly ratified it.\n\nRussia seems to be waking up, belatedly, to the threat.\n\nBut climate protester Arshak Makichyan suggests the harsh reaction to Greta Thunberg suggests the authorities are anxious not to be pushed into action.\n\n\"I think they're afraid the climate protests will grow here and they can't argue with the science,\" the young violinist says. \"They're attacking Greta, because that's easier.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Last Friday's Moscow protest as part of the global climate strike was small, but not insignificant\n\nThe Friday pickets are still tiny. Some 700 people joined in at their peak, over several dozen cities.\n\nBut, to Arshak, it's all relative.\n\n\"Half a year ago, I was on my own every week,\" he points out. \"The climate issue is new here. Before, it felt like no-one cared. So for me, a few hundred across Russia is a big deal!\"", "description": "Vladimir Putin does not rate Greta Thunberg\u2019s warning on climate change, and many Russians agree.", "authors": ["Sarah Rainsford", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9799/production/_109090883_img_20191003_170419_699.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
