Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- \u201cwhich is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.\u201d\n\nNone of the Democrats disagreed with Sanders\u2019 description of health care in American today, although they have slightly different solutions.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I thought Obamacare was supposed to fix health care.\n\nMillions of us were thrown off our health insurance plans by Obamacare, and now I find out that it didn\u2019t even make things better for anyone else. The government intervenes, everything goes to hell, then Democrats cite the hell they created to demand another massive government intervention.\n\nThe motto of all socialist schemes should be: \u201cThis time, it will be different.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats' universal answer to the drug problem -- which is actually a \u201cMexico Is on Our Border\u201d problem -- is to say they\u2019d go after the pharmaceutical companies and then, in the next breath, demand that we legalize drugs.\n\nIn the midst of their crusading anger at the pharmaceutical companies, not one Democrat mentioned Purdue Pharma. You know -- the primary culprit in the prescription drug epidemic, at least according to dozens of state attorneys general and hundreds of private lawsuits accusing the company of aggressively marketing OxyContin and hiding its addictive nature.\n\nIt would be like vowing to go after \u201cmiddle-aged men\u201d to stop underage sex trafficking on Orgy Island -- but not mentioning Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Democrats are furious with pharmaceutical companies, \u201cwealthy corporations\u201d (Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s phrase) and \u201cthe rich\u201d (any guy with an alarm clock). But not with a specific multibillion-dollar company that makes OxyContin, and the kazillionaire family that owns it, the Sacklers.\n\nSpeaking of which, last year, Beverly Sackler, the recently deceased matriarch of the company, made political contributions to both Sen. Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nSome poor medical researcher working to find a cure for cancer will have to pay -- but the Sacklers get off scot-free.\n\nAnother big policy disagreement concerned guns, specifically: Do we allow people to turn in their guns voluntarily or should the government confiscate them?\n\nAs with liberals\u2019 comical inability to tell an AK-47 from a semiautomatic, the gun facts flying around Tuesday night were not always well-researched. Beto O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cThis is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence.\u201d\n\nWow. Not even close. According to the CDC, the number was less than 15,000 in 2017.\n\nTo liven things up, at one point, a smug Pete Buttigieg snapped at O\u2019Rourke, \u201cAnd I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d This was in response to remarks not at all about Buttigieg\u2019s courage. That\u2019s gonna get old, fast.\n\nVice President Joe Biden bragged that he was \u201cthe only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets ...\u201d\n\nYes, and in direct response to that assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA, Republicans swept Congress in the very next election, winning control of the House for the first time in nearly half a century.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t alive that glorious autumn evening in 1994, it was better than the November 2016 election. All night, there was breaking news, as one powerhouse Democrat after another lost his seat to a Republican. Every 15 minutes the GOP would set some new, jaw-dropping record. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., became the first speaker of the House to lose his election in 134 years. Republicans marched through the South like William Tecumseh Sherman, finishing off the \u201csouthern Democrats.\u201d Tennessee went all red, with Republicans replacing the Democratic governor and two Democratic senators -- including the Senate seat previously held by Vice President Al Gore. Not one Republican incumbent lost his seat.\n\nPlease, Joe, promise to \u201cbeat\u201d the NRA again!\n\nBUTTIGIEG: \u201cNo, this is really important, OK? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban.\u201d\n\nThis message was approved by Trump 2020.", "description": "With all the rancor in politics these days, the CNN/New .10/16/2019 19:12:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Ann Coulter", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/df70e45d-db25-4f5c-adf4-10277a1f7f10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
