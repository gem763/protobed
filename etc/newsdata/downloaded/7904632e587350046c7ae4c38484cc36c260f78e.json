A handful of prior investors also participated, including Andreessen Horowitz and the venture capital arms of Humana, Kaiser Permanente and Providence Health & Services.\n\nWhy it matters: Omada has raised more than $125 million, attracting interest from some of the largest venture capital firms and health care companies. Those companies are betting Omada's technology \u2014 which provides online counseling and coaching to people who have chronic diseases, most notably diabetes \u2014 can lower health care costs.\n\nWorking in Omada's favor: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Medicare both gave a stamp of approval for Omada's diabetes prevention program. Cigna, Humana and Kaiser all have large Medicare plans.", "description": "Investors are betting that the company can bring down health care costs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/A559LvQDFn5-dqSlD00jUgGXzkU=/1920x1080/smart/2017/12/15/1513302999684.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-15"}
