The court said earlier this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\n\"Boris Johnson promised #Scottish court he would comply with#BennAct & not seek to frustrate it. Looks like he's breaking both promises,\" Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker involved in the case said on Twitter.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent an unsigned letter to the European Union requesting a delay to Britain's exit from the bloc and also said he did not want the extension after his latest Brexit setback in parliament on Saturday.
