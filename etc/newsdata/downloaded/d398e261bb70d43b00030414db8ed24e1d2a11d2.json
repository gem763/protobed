She best speaks to trials of Americans who came of age in this century and educated women, much as Trump tapped displaced blue collar workers and their offspring in towns and rural areas. His, however, is a cohort fading in importance, as many of its members gain skills and migrate to larger cities offering better job opportunities. That new economy, often defined by computers and artificial intelligence, has fundamentally altered the challenges that workers face today.\n\nIn the 19th century, farming was the primary occupation. Freeholders and tenant farmers relied on knowledge of weather and planting techniques to squeeze a living out of the land. Men and women passed down the work ethic of independence and critical skills to their sons and daughters. It took two people to run a family farm, as gardening, canning, milking, and sewing were as essential to survival as fields of grain and cattle that barely yielded livable profits. The mechanization of agriculture consolidated farms and released workers to cities where mass production factories, and the commercial enterprises modeled after it, demanded workers conform to the practices dictated by professional managers and engineers.\n\nHenry Ford, doubling worker pay and then introducing the 40 hour week in the 1920s, offered workers a bargain. If they follow directions, they can live well and enjoy weekends off. The New Deal and the union movement generalized that to most workers through contracts or simply raising expectations. Health and pension benefits followed. Through the early 1960s, many workers lacked a high school diploma and were socialized to believe the notion the conformity would deliver security. Automation, globalization, and artificial intelligence have shattered all that, as workers in the digital economy increasingly are left to shift for themselves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor many with marketable skills, their laptops have now become their workplaces because their jobs can be performed from almost anywhere. Many workers enjoy independence as contractors, but most workers outside the government and rapidly shrinking unionized workplaces suffer terrible insecurity. On a whim, they can lose their jobs and benefits or the ability to pay for them, have no pensions even as life expectancies lengthen, and carry too much student debt to save for old age.\n\nTrump behaves as if the world has not changed. Tariffs on China cannot bring back factory jobs because most move elsewhere in Asia, and bullying General Motors to open new plants to replace the ones it has closed is not a jobs policy. Democrats have a growing base because they address these problems, though they harken to solutions that have failed in the past. Higher education is essential, however, free tuition and loan forgiveness do not zero in on the essential problem. Given unrestrained access to government money, universities irresponsibly boost tuition, spawn bureaucracies, and do not deliver enough skilled graduates.\n\nObamaCare did not solve the problem of monopoly pricing and soaring costs, but the prescription drug plan of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi falls far short of the kind of thoughtful regulatory regime the Germans use to facilitate new drugs without price gouging. Social Security is severely underfunded. Democrats propose to raise taxes, not raise the retirement age and not address the most fundamental problem. The trust fund is invested in low yielding bonds instead of stocks that outperform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell leads the \u201cparty of no.\u201d That leaves policy innovation to Democrats, who score points by proposing expensive socialist solutions. Warren is terribly skilled at identifying pressure points, blaming villains such as greedy corporations and corrupt government, and offering undeliverable promises. The president has no power to break up large corporations, as antitrust policy is a matter of law and ultimately officiated by the courts, and independent analyses indicate that her wealth tax would hardly generate the revenue she claims.\n\nWarren is the Pied Piper of this election cycle. Her policy solutions sound plausible to many young folks and suburban women across the country because they know Europe has very cheap or public health care, higher education, and the like. But Europe also has heavy regulation, economic stagnation, and higher unemployment, and the typical workers fork over half their wages in taxes. If French malaise and \u201cyellow vest\u201d poverty is the future Americans want for themselves, she is the ideal president.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and professor at the University of Maryland.", "description": "Her ideas sound reasonable but will not solve the root causes of modern economic insecurity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenelizabeth_051619gn20_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
