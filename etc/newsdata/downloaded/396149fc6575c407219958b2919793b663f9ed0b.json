The country has spent months this year battling blazes as the El Nino weather pattern has extended the annual dry season.\n\n\u201cMany of the palm oil and pulp groups with the largest burned areas in their concessions have either not received any serious civil/administrative sanctions, or have had sanctions imposed that do not appear to fit with the level or frequency of burning,\u201d the environmental action group said in its report.\n\nRasio Ridho Sani, director general of law enforcement at Indonesia\u2019s Environment Ministry, said law enforcement had been \u201cvery strict\u201d through administrative sanctions, including revoking licences and civil lawsuits.\n\nHe said on Monday that Indonesia was studying a plan for imposing harsher penalties on firms found burning forest and peat land.\n\nThe government sealed off burned areas in concessions controlled by 52 companies and the authorities were investigating five companies on suspicion of starting fires or being negligent in containing fires on their land, he said.\n\nGreenpeace said 3.4 million hectares had been burned from 2015 to 2018 in Indonesia, with 2.6 million hectares burned in 2015 alone.\n\nCiting analysis of mapping and concession data, Greenpeace said concessions linked to three pulpwood companies saw about 403,300 hectares - an area more than five times the size of Singapore - burned from 2015 to 2018.\n\nConcessions linked to the companies include subsidiaries, units, suppliers or affiliates, Greenpeace said.\n\nGreenpeace said Sinar Mas and its subsidiary Asia Pulp & Paper accounted for nearly two-thirds of the 403,000 hectares and said the other two firms were APRIL Group and state-owned Perhutani.\n\nAPRIL told Reuters its evaluation of the data showed the burnt area in its concessions was \u201ca fraction of Greenpeace\u2019s estimate\u201d.\n\nAsia Pulp & Paper said the numbers published by Greenpeace were inaccurate as some of the companies listed as its suppliers were not its suppliers.\n\nReuters could not immediately reach Perhutani for comment.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nGreenpeace said the three groups were handed a total of 24 civil or administrative sanctions, but said this had not always covered the largest or most serious burnt areas. It cited government data it gained via freedom of information requests.\n\nThe group said none of the 10 palm oil concessions with the largest areas of burned land in 2015-2018 received any serious sanctions. Seven of those concessions had high numbers of hotspots, which show up on mapping images and indicate a fire, this year, Greenpeace said.\n\nParent firms of some of the companies were sanctioned but not for the concessions that saw major fires, it said.", "description": "Indonesia has not imposed serious enough penalties on pulpwood and palm oil firms that had large fires on their land from 2015 to 2018, and more fires on some of those farms also polluted the region's air quality this year, Greenpeace said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433297859&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0S2", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
