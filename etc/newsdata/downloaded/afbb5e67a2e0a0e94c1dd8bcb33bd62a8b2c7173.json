No such technology exists to forecast what President Trump is going to do.\n\nWhile he cannot control the weather, Trump can create pressure systems in his natural habitat: Twitter. Over the course of one Scaramucci (about 10 days), as Hurricane Dorian churned through the Atlantic , a metaphysical storm gathered force, with the president at the center. It swept up all sorts of people who weren\u2019t in Dorian\u2019s path: meteorologists in Alabama, politicians from Texas and Tennessee, even a Baptist pastor in Kentucky.\n\nThe hurricane destroyed homes and claimed lives. The deluge of presidential tweets caused a different kind of chaos \u2014 superficial to some, serious to others. We compiled an oral history of the two storms. Not everyone went fully on the record, and the White House ignored multiple requests to comment.\n\n\n\nRadar from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA-42 WP-3D Orion aircraft shows the eye of Hurricane Dorian during a reconnaissance mission over the Atlantic Ocean on August 30. (Noaa/Noaa Via Reuters)\n\nKEVIN LAWS, science and operations officer for the National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Ala.: We are located about 25 miles south of Birmingham in a small town named Calera. We have about 25 or 26 employees, not all meteorologists, and we work 24/7, 365. The weather never stops, so we never stop.\n\nJENNI L. EVANS, centennial president of the American Meteorological Society: I\u2019m a hurricane researcher, so Dorian was always something to be looking at. Dorian formed in the zone where you would expect very intense hurricanes to originate.\n\nA GULF COAST METEOROLOGIST: I recall seeing meteorologists on social media in conversations amongst themselves, basically talking about, \u201cWell, if it does miss Hispaniola and does miss Puerto Rico, then it has a lot of opportunity to start to develop.\u201d At that point, this is something that needs to be watched.\n\nLAWS : There were definitely some outlying tracks showing the storm moving into Alabama. We actually had an internal discussion that entire week leading up to Friday [Aug. 30] on what to do in our office, in putting it in the forecast . . . We had one briefing with all partners, and I want to say it was Friday, Aug. 30, at 11 o\u2019clock. We were also involved in a state coordination call, a governor\u2019s call. I think they had one last one on Saturday [Aug. 31], early. That was the last one we had because [Dorian\u2019s] track had shifted so far east.\n\nAbout 24 hours later, at 10:51 a.m., Sept. 1, Trump moved on from tweeting about sitcom star Debra Messing: \u201cIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nLAWS: It\u2019s a quiet Sunday morning, and we\u2019re already past [Dorian] and looking into our future here, which was hot and dry like usual. I wasn\u2019t there [in the office] personally, but we started getting calls to the forecasters [from the public]. And I think comments came up on our Facebook page about the storm. And the forecasters got concerned because it seemed to be all of a sudden. Bizarre questions like, \u201cWhen are we going to be impacted?\u201d So we thought, \u201cLet\u2019s put this statement out on Twitter.\u201d\n\nThe statement came 20 minutes after the president\u2019s tweet: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nLAWS: We didn\u2019t know anything about [the president\u2019s tweet]. Our office is very nonpolitical. So we don\u2019t keep up with what anybody says.\n\nMONICA MEDINA, former principal deputy undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): I saw them doing their job. They\u2019re just saying, \u201cNope, there\u2019s confusion out there in the world. We are clarifying. We are coming out with the definitive best information.\u201d And I was like, \u201cGreat. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d Then the media started reporting that it was them correcting the president.\n\nLAWS: After we put that statement out, all these political statements started coming in. We were like, \u201cWait, why are people saying this now?\u201d . . . Nobody ever called to ask our side of it. They just assumed we did it on purpose [to respond to the president].\n\nGULF COAST METEOROLOGIST: We\u2019ve seen this before from other politicians \u2014 where they\u2019ll be well-intended in what they\u2019re trying to say, but somewhere along the line they mess up one of the details, and it\u2019s a forgivable mistake. . . . My first thought: \u201cIt was an accident. Okay, it happens, and hopefully it\u2019s corrected.\u201d And then it wasn\u2019t.\n\nLAWS: All of a sudden the spotlight\u2019s on everybody. And everybody goes through the thought: \u201cWell, should we delete?\u201d But if you delete [the tweet], that also sends a message. And we decided, let\u2019s just let it stand. In our opinion it was a genuine statement of truth and fact.\n\nMEDINA: Over-warning people is significant. You get businesses to close, and people don\u2019t go on their vacation. Or they go up on their roof and fall because they\u2019re putting storm shutters on. People do hurt themselves, or worse.\n\nEVANS (American Meteorological Society): I remember hearing [Trump] saying the Alabama thing and people trying to correct him. And I thought that will just be the end of it.\n\nDorian was now a Category 5 hurricane, beginning its long thrash of the Bahamas.\n\nANNA BERARDELLI-KNOWLES, resident of Nassau, Bahamas: When the hurricane came, I was at home with my kids in Nassau. It was horrifically scary. We were only being hit by the outer bands, we had a lot of rain, and a lot of wind. . . . We had tons and tons of rain, we had flooding. But we did not have anything like what Abaco and Freeport had. So we knew we needed to help the people there.\n\nBy Labor Day, Sept. 2, the islands of the Bahamas were in serious trouble.\n\nBERARDELLI-KNOWLES: A group of us \u2014 friends who are all boat captains \u2014 we got together and made a plan to use our personal boats to help. We all left Nassau quickly, and worked out of Harbour Island. It happened so fast. We got supplies, medical supplies, we had insulin, we had food, we had satellite phones, we had towels, and we knew we needed to go in and get evacuees out, and that\u2019s what we did.\n\nGULF COAST METEOROLOGIST: From the professional side, you\u2019re completely in awe of what you\u2019re seeing. But the reality is: You see it approaching a small island where there are people who have no chance of escaping. . . . You\u2019re sobered by it.\n\n\n\nDamage and debris is seen in the Mudd and the Peas neighborhoods of Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, after Hurricane Dorian. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n[Here in Alabama, no sign of Trump\u2019s hurricane]\n\nEVANS (American Meteorological Society): One of the reasons we do what we do as meteorologists is we care about people. The math is fun, but the forecast is really helping people to live their lives in the best way.\n\nMeanwhile, in Alabama. . .\n\nELIZABETH VAN ANTWERP, resident of the Mobile Bay area of Alabama: We didn\u2019t even buy extra groceries. We watched the European model and followed that one. And Alan Sealls. He\u2019s the only weatherman worth listening to in this area.\n\nANTHONY MILLER, her partner: [Dorian] wasn\u2019t coming here.\n\nVAN ANTWERP: It was obvious it wasn\u2019t coming here.\n\nThat evening, ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl reported on \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d that Trump had \u201cmisstated the storm\u2019s possible trajectory.\u201d The president responded on Twitter, but used the wrong handle for Karl. He instead tweeted at a Baptist pastor in Hodgenville, Ky.\n\nREV. JONATHAN CARL, South Fork Baptist Church: It was Labor Day weekend, and my wife and four daughters [and I] went down to Nashville for an overnight Sunday. We got some lunch with a cousin and his family and journeyed home. I got home, put the girls to bed, got the luggage in, and settled down to check Facebook late that night, like people do.\n\nTrump had tweeted: \u201cSuch a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonathancarl of @ABCWorldNews. I suggested yesterday at FEMA that, along with Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, even Alabama could possibly come into play, which WAS true. . .\u201d\n\nCARL: I\u2019ve been mistaken for the journalist before, but never by the president of the United States. . . . You get pulled into this spectrum of vitriol and hatred. . . . I woke up that night and really felt the Lord saying: \u201cHey, there are some things here we can all learn from.\u201d So I wrote my open letter: \u201cDear Mr. President, I\u2019m a Casualty of Your Drive-By Tweeting War. We all are.\u201d . . . He used the term \u201clightweight.\u201d We are all lightweights in the big picture. There\u2019s only one who gets it all right all the time.\n\nBy Wednesday, Sept. 4, Dorian had moved on from the Bahamas and was churning its way toward the Carolinas. Just before noon, the president decided to address the press in the Oval Office. He had a map showing a Dorian trajectory, which was embellished toward Alabama with a black marker, it seemed. At 1:26 p.m., the White House tweeted out video of the briefing.\n\nDENNIS MERSEREAU, weather reporter, North Carolina: I was actually getting ready to walk out to the grocery store, and I was putting on my shoes as I was mindlessly scrolling through Twitter, I saw the White House\u2019s tweet from the Hurricane Dorian briefing scroll through my feed. I normally ignore those things, but this one caught my eye because the hurricane map looked a bit weird. So I watched [the video], and my jaw dropped.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump during an Oval Office briefing on the status of Hurricane Dorian on Sept. 4. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nMEDINA (ex-NOAA): The president had the NOAA storm track map from maybe August 31st or September 1st. It was September 4th and he was using the wrong map. What if you\u2019re out there in the world, you google \u201cstorm map,\u201d and this is what you get?\n\nMERSEREAU: I had to watch the video three or four more times, just to make sure it wasn\u2019t a technical glitch, or some sort of pixilation. But then I realized \u2014 oh, my God, he really drew on it with a Sharpie. I screamed a couple of choice words that I\u2019m sure my neighbors just loved. And I took a screenshot, and just fired off the tweet right then.\n\nMersereau wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe President of the United States altered a National Hurricane Center map with a sharpie to falsely extend the official forecast toward Alabama so he didn\u2019t have to admit he was wrong in a tweet.\u201d\n\nThe tweet went viral, and was eventually retweeted over 28,000 times. The public began to make memes off the Sharpie\u2019d map. The media reported that falsifying a government weather report is a federal crime.\n\nMEDINA: I was general counsel of NOAA. If I was sitting in NOAA, somebody would\u2019ve brought [the Sharpie edit] to my attention and then I would\u2019ve had the obligation to make it stop, as a government employee.\n\nREP. STEVE COHEN (D-Tenn.): I watch a lot of MSNBC and CNN, so I watched it unfold on one of those newscasts.\n\nJOE WALSH, Republican primary challenger to Trump: I was somewhere on the campaign trail and I saw it. Someone put in front of me: the image of him, and Alabama, and the Sharpie around Alabama.\n\nGEORGE CONWAY, conservative lawyer, Trump critic and husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway: I was offline and didn\u2019t see it until 6 p.m. that day. I was in a car, being driven to dinner somewhere, and started seeing references to a Sharpie on Twitter. I was very confused. I know Trump uses Sharpies, but I had no idea what it was about. Then I just saw the pictures.\n\nWALSH: My first reaction was to shake my head and laugh.\n\nCONWAY: I was stunned. But then I sat back and thought, \u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s something he\u2019d do.\u201d\n\nCOHEN: I found it hard to believe. My first thought was that [Trump] didn\u2019t know the difference between Alabama and Georgia.\n\nCONWAY: I did enjoy the memes.\n\nMARY CAMPBELL, a search engine analyst in Wilmington, Del.: I saw somebody had tweeted that he had actually added material to the map. So I saw that and, like a lot of other people, I said, \u201cWow, he could use the Sharpie to change a lot of things.\u201d\n\nCONWAY: People drawing the border wall and saying it\u2019s all finished. . .\n\nCAMPBELL: The border was the very first thing that came to mind. I went to Google images and put in the word \u2018desert.\u2019 I just picked one that looked good. ... I just used black lines and saved.\n\nBERARDELLI-KNOWLES (Bahamas): I didn\u2019t know that was even going on. Nobody here had any idea what the news was saying. We couldn\u2019t have cared less. We were just trying to pull people out who were stranded, who needed help.\n\nMERSEREAU (weather reporter): I got a lot of spam, a lot of hate mail. But you know, it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about the integrity of weather forecasting.\n\nWALSH: In a way, it encapsulates Trump. He\u2019s pathological. I thought, even as I and other people laughed, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a stupid story, it\u2019s a big story.\u201d\n\nBILL WELD, former Massachusetts governor and Republican primary challenger: We had just been discussing Sharpies for the previous two days, as it turns out. I was on the streets of Manchester, New Hampshire, campaigning and people wanted their baseballs signed. I had been signing baseballs on the street using a pen, a ballpoint, and the Sharpie signature is much more professional.\n\nMATT SCHLAPP, Republican activist and Trump supporter: We were on the streets [in Hong Kong] with these young democracy protesters, talking about human freedoms and having a limited idea of government. . . . It was a little scary. They would fire rubber bullets into the crowd. People were getting their heads smashed.\n\nWALSH: I talked about it with the team. They knew it really incensed me and wanted to make a big deal about it. It was about dishonesty. It was about a Sharpie. He drew it, he lied about it. So, boom, we decided, why don\u2019t we put \u201cDon\u2019t Lie\u201d on a Sharpie?\n\nSCHLAPP: I follow a lot of news on Twitter, so I saw it. To be honest, mostly what I thought was: One of the most important stories in the globe is taking place, and American reporters are talking about Sharpies?\n\nWELD: We started signing campaign literature with a Sharpie. We were thinking about Sharpies, about the benevolent uses of Sharpies. I had the upside uses of Sharpie present on my mind, and I remember thinking about \u201cSharpiegate\u201d: what a waste of a useful product.\n\nNewell Brands, the producer of Sharpie pens, did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nSCHLAPP: In Hong Kong, people were in the streets writing the names of their lawyers on their arms in Sharpie marker because they didn\u2019t know if they were going to survive. . . . In their zeal to write every negative thing about Trump, [the media] were missing the real story. He\u2019s the first president in 30 years giving [Hong Kong] hope that Beijing can change.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump pauses while speaking in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 4. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nBERARDELLI-KNOWLES (Bahamas): Nobody was in front of a television. We didn\u2019t even know where the storm went after it left the Bahamas. We were all exhausted, working 12 hours a day, doing everything we could to help.\n\nGEORGE CONWAY: I got to dinner with a large number of people and everyone was making fun of the guy, as you do. As ridiculous as it was, and it was ridiculous, it showed exactly what his psychological state is.\n\nSCHLAPP: There is no question that there are times the president is so engaged in pushing back on small stories he distracts people from these larger stories.\n\nThat evening, Trump tweeted a map of Dorian trajectories from Aug. 28, four days before his Alabama comment, and said: \u201cThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nMONICA MEDINA (ex-NOAA): The storm originally might have gone toward Alabama. He wasn\u2019t wrong. He was out of date. And the out-of-dateness made it wrong. And continuing to talk about it causes confusion.\n\nThe next day, Thursday, Sept. 5, Dorian was off the coast of South Carolina and the president tweeted multiple times about Alabama. At 9:39 a.m., he tweeted: \u201cAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News!\u201d\n\nWALSH: It\u2019s Day 2, and Day 3 and Day 4, and the president is doubling down, tripling down, quadrupling down.\n\nREP. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON (D-Tex.), chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology: I thought [Trump] had made a mistake. But when he defended what he did, then that really went a step too far.\n\nThe president had no public events scheduled on Friday, Sept. 6, as Dorian strafed North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane and NOAA released an unsigned statement about the Alabama matter. The statement referred to the Sept. 1 tweet from the Birmingham National Weather Service as \u201cinconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nMEDINA (ex-NOAA): I was watching one of the MSNBC shows, and the story broke about it, and I was like \u201cOh, [curse word].\u201d This is different. This is so much worse. This is so wrong. This is just a breach of protocol.\n\nLAWS (NWS Birmingham): You would think we would be upset and devastated, but I just didn\u2019t really get that feeling. [Staffers] were probably down a little bit about it, maybe, but at the same time they\u2019re like, \u201cWe have a job to do.\u201d\n\nEVANS (American Meteorological Society): I had been in Denmark for a few days with my husband, and he follows Twitter. He said, \u201cHave you seen what the president\u2019s doing and what\u2019s happening at NOAA?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was gobsmacked.\n\nMEDINA: If somebody had told me to issue this statement, I would have quit.\n\nOver the weekend, Dorian dissipated, the president tweeted more about Alabama and played two rounds of golf at his club in Virginia, and the National Weather Service\u2019s annual conference began in Huntsville, Ala. The director of the Weather Service addressed the conference on Monday, Sept. 9.\n\nLAWS: I would probably say there [were] 600 people. There wasn\u2019t an empty seat anywhere. It was in a big, grand ballroom.\n\nA GULF COAST METEOROLOGIST: You could definitely feel an element of tension throughout the whole [conference]. At that point, things are happening so quickly in the news, and you\u2019re trying to keep up and it\u2019s tough. You just knew that something had to be said, but how was going to come out?\n\n\n\nNational Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini addresses a meeting of the National Weather Association in Huntsville, Ala., on Sept. 9, 2019. Uccellini defended forecasters who contradicted President Trump's claim that Hurricane Dorian posed a threat to Alabama as it approached the United States. (Jay Reeves/AP)\n\nLouis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, said in his speech: \u201cLet me be clear: The Birmingham office did this to stop public panic, to ensure public safety \u2014 the same goal as all the National Weather Service offices were working toward at that time.\u201d\n\nLAWS: That was a huge weight off everybody in the room, and probably across the agency. . . . It\u2019s great to see directors come in here and say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back, we believe in you, and you did the right thing.\u201d There was a standing ovation. That\u2019s never happened before here.\n\nThat day the New York Times reported that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross threatened to fire managers at NOAA over the Birmingham tweet. The Washington Post later reported that Trump and the White House helped set this in motion. Trump denied this to reporters on Wednesday, Sept. 11.\n\nTRUMP: No, I never did that. I never did that. It\u2019s a hoax by the media. That\u2019s just fake news.\n\nTwo chairwomen of House committees on science and oversight drafted a letter to Ross requesting information related to his department\u2019s dealings with NOAA concerning Hurricane Dorian. The acting chief scientist of NOAA began investigating potential violations of scientific integrity.\n\nJOHNSON (Texas congresswoman): I started to work on the letter [to Wilbur Ross] with the committee staff, because we felt a responsibility not to let this play out as a joke, to not to let this play out as if it was not serious.\n\nMEDINA: I think they were so devastated by this, the rank-and-file folks [at NOAA]. They work so hard. They work around the clock. They take their jobs incredibly seriously.\n\nJOHNSON: I don\u2019t want scientists to be operating under the fear of being reprimanded when they\u2019re doing the best work they know how to do.\n\nKATHY SULLIVAN, chief of NOAA under President Obama, in a statement: Trust is like glass: shatters in an instant, with a single blow, and takes a long time to restore.\n\nMEDINA: It\u2019s kind of like the hurricane itself. There\u2019s damage and now people have to rebuild.\n\nBERARDELLI-KNOWLES (Bahamas): The damage is just catastrophic. We\u2019re going to rebuild, but it is going to take a long time. It\u2019s going to take a long time.\n\nCOHEN: I\u2019m blessed to be in Congress at this time to try and bring some justice and sanity in what is a very bizarre presidency. . . . But there are times that I\u2019m lulled into a sadness.\n\nSCHLAPP: I could not have cared less if some meteorologist said some storm was gonna hit Alabama or miss, but what I cared about was people getting beaten up in the streets [in Hong Kong]. We get so stuck in the silliness of coverage.\n\nCONWAY: I did not discuss it with Kellyanne. There\u2019s just nothing to say about it.\n\nELIZABETH VAN ANTWERP (Mobile Bay area): I would say that the president is not a meteorologist.\n\n\n\nDauphin Island Public Beach, near Mobile, Ala., on Sept. 7.
