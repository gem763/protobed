Fendi, which was under Karl Lagerfeld's creative directorship for 54 years, also paid tribute to the legend with their Fall/Winter '19 collection.\n\nBut beyond his inimitable contributions to Chanel and Fendi, Karl founded The House of KARL LAGERFELD, which shared the iconic vision and design aesthetic of its founder. The brand celebrates his colossal legacy and breathes his passion, intuition and inexhaustible creativity into the core of its DNA.\n\nContinuing his posthumous hard work then both for Chanel and The House of Karl Lagerfeld, we welcomed Pharrel Williams' Chanel Pharrel capsule collection announcement in March, that he had partnered with the late legend on. This collection was described by the house as \u201can urban capsule collection highlighting Pharrell Williams\u2019 long-term relationship with the House\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE: Karl Lagerfeld lives on in new beauty and fashion partnerships\n\nThis came shortly before Karl Lagerfeld collaborated with L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris on a \u201crock-chic\u201d make-up collection, that was officially released on September 27 2019.
