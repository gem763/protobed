Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and includes 23 other Democrats and 17 Republicans.\n\n[What you need to know about the impeachment inquiry into Trump]\n\nThree previous presidents have reached this inquiry stage: Andrew Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. The Nixon and Clinton impeachment processes included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate.

Articles of impeachment are not criminal indictments but are similar in that they are charges against a person that could be pursued in a trial.\n\nThere can be more than one charge: Johnson faced 11, Nixon faced 3 and Clinton faced 2.\n\nVotes on each article of impeachment Full House of Representatives 235 Democrats 198 Republicans 1 Independent Yes on any article of impeachment No to all No further proceedings.

The Constitution says the Senate has \u201cthe sole power to try\u201d but does not require that a trial occur. McConnell could hold a vote to dismiss the articles.\n\nIf there is a trial in the Senate, U.S. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would preside. First, the president would be summoned to appear and address the charges \u2014 basically, enter a plea. If he does not appear, the Senate would operate as if the plea is not guilty.\n\nDuring the trial, House \u201cmanagers\u201d \u2014 House lawmakers who are designated to argue the case for impeachment \u2014 outline the charges, and the president\u2019s attorneys defend him.

The bar is high for conviction: a two-thirds majority of the senators present.\n\nIf convicted of any charge, the president is removed from office and cannot pardon himself to avoid losing his position, according to the Constitution. The vice president becomes president.\n\nClinton was handily acquitted, but only one \u201cnay\u201d vote on each of three charges kept Johnson from being removed from office.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWhy now?
