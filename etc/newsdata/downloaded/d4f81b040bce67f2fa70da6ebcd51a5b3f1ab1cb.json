REUTERS/Stringer\n\nLam visited the Kowloon mosque before she was due to head to Japan to attend Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony in Tokyo, and as the city cleaned up the mess from violent protests on Sunday, the latest in five months of political turmoil.\n\nIn running battles in Kowloon district police used tear gas and water cannon trucks to disperse petrol bomb-throwing protesters, spraying jets of blue dye into the crowds.\n\nIn one instance, a cannon drenched the front gate and steps of the Kowloon mosque, Hong Kong\u2019s most important Islamic place of worship where a few people had gathered including journalists. Blue stains from the dyed water remained on the road in front as worshippers gathered for prayers on Monday.\n\nProtesters had said they would not target the mosque in Sunday\u2019s march after a leading pro-democracy leader was brutally attacked by masked men last week that the police said were \u201cnon-Chinese\u201d.\n\nSome non-Chinese residents including those from South Asia have been recruited in the past by the city\u2019s organised criminal gangs, or triads, to attack individuals.\n\n\u201cSouth Asians have not been involved in any protesting \u2014 anti-Hong Kong or pro-Hong Kong. We\u2019re just living peacefully,\u201d said Waqar Haider, an interpreter who works with ethnic minorities.\n\nLam visited the mosque on Monday morning dressed in a shawl and apologised to Islamic leaders, according to a spokesman.\n\nChief Imam Muhammad Arshad said the apology was \u201caccepted\u201d and that the Islamic community hoped to continue living in Hong Kong in peace.\n\nPolice said in a statement the mosque had been accidentally sprayed and that they \u201crespect religious freedom and will strive to protect all places of worship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a mistake. They apologised. They saw some protesters standing outside the gates. The protesters also apologised,\u201d said Mohammed Assan, 32, who was praying at the mosque at the time.\n\n\u201cThe police do their work and the protesters have a right to protest. Everybody needs freedom. They demand to live with freedom.\u201d\n\nAfter two weeks of relative calm, Sunday\u2019s large turnout of tens of thousands of protesters reflected strong support for the anti-government movement despite police branding the march illegal.\n\nFamilies and the elderly took to the streets in what began as a peaceful march, many wearing masks or carrying umbrellas to shield their faces in defiance of an anti-mask law that authorities invoked this month to try to quell the unrest.\n\nA more radical faction of mainly young protesters later clashed with riot police.\n\nAcross the Kowloon peninsula protesters torched stores and metro stations. Hundreds of shops were trashed, with mainland China banks and shops with links to the mainland targeted.\n\nMany people in Hong Kong are angry at what they see as mainland China\u2019s attempts to limit the freedoms the semi-autonomous city is supposed to enjoy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle enshrined in its handover from Britain in 1997.\n\nThe protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\nProtesters are demanding universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, amnesty for those charged over previous demonstrations, and an end to the government\u2019s labelling of the protesters as rioters.\n\nSunday\u2019s unrest followed an annual policy speech last week in which Beijing-backed Lam sought to ease tensions with measures to resolve a chronic housing shortage.\n\nShe also has promised to withdraw a China extradition bill that ignited the unrest and engage in a dialogue with the public, but has so far resisted other protester demands.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nSince the protests escalated in June, over 2,600 people have been arrested, many under 18 years of age, while two people have been shot and many more injured.\n\nAs the economy faces its first recession in a decade, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday offered more support for small and medium-sized enterprises which have borne the brunt of the chaos.\n\nBusinesses will probably have to foot the bill for the vandalism, as few had insurance for riot damage, industry insiders said.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam apologised on Monday to the city's Muslim community after police hit a major mosque with water canon as they battled thousands of pro-democracy protesters overnight in the Asian financial hub.", "authors": ["Sarah Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443258183&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0DV", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
