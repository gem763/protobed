He specifically decried the fact that \u201cpublic agencies \u2014 including public schools \u2014 are becoming secularized.\u201d\n\nMilitant secularism, he said, is to blame for the country\u2019s greatest ills, including drug use, mental illness and \u201can increase in senseless violence.\u201d Given such crises, Barr urged his audience to fight back against \u201cso-called \u2018progressives\u2019 \u201d and others who insist upon respecting America\u2019s pesky, constitutionally mandated separation of church and state.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not decay,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIt is organized destruction. Secularists, and their allies among the \u2018progressives,\u2019 have marshalled all the force of mass communications, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere are two ways to read these remarks, which were one of three speeches by administration officials in recent days on Christianity\u2019s role in U.S. governance.\n\nOne reaction: They\u2019re terrifying. This man who swore to uphold the Constitution has apparently forgotten its prohibition on state establishment of religion. Our nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer \u2014 the person ultimately responsible for ensuring equal treatment under the law \u2014 appears to be demonizing anyone who does not share his religious and political values.\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s also another, more encouraging way to interpret Barr\u2019s comments: Maybe it was all just one giant, coded subtweet of the boss.\n\nAD\n\nWelcome to The Resistance, Bill Barr?\n\nBarr decried the government\u2019s \u201cattacks on religion.\u201d One could be forgiven for reading this as a passive-aggressive swipe at a president who, during the 2016 campaign, called for blocking immigrants based on their religious beliefs.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s originally proposed \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d got watered down after he took office. But even the final version was not exactly an endorsement of religious liberty.\n\nNeither is the administration\u2019s recent push to allow greater religious discrimination by enabling federal contractors to hire and fire based on religious belief. This means allowing a for-profit private company to fire an employee for being gay or transgender \u2014 but also for being Catholic rather than Protestant. Companies may \u201ccondition employment on acceptance of or adherence to religious tenets as understood by the employing contractor.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch policies are surely a greater threat to religious freedom than asking, say, cake bakers to respect public accommodation laws.\n\nBarr bemoaned the \u201cunremitting assault\u201d not just on private exercise of faith but also \u201ctraditional values.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know exactly what was being invoked here. Maybe he was envisioning regressive traditions of days past, such as respect for the patriarchy.\n\nBut perhaps he was instead invoking traditional values such as: Always keep your word. Keep it in your private business dealings, but also when making promises to friends and allies who have put their lives on the line for you, whether at home or in northern Syria.\n\nAD\n\nOr maybe: Don\u2019t boast about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals. Also, maybe don\u2019t grab them there in the first place.\n\nOr: Don\u2019t commit adultery, with a porn star or anyone else, especially not a few months after your third wife gave birth.\n\nAD\n\nAlso: The only people who should be asked to participate in American elections are Americans. Not foreign powers, especially not adversarial foreign powers.\n\nDon\u2019t lie, cheat or steal (including from Uncle Sam); don\u2019t blaspheme; welcome the stranger; have compassion for the poor and sick; and do unto others as you would have them do unto you, even when they don\u2019t have political oppo to offer in return.\n\nAD\n\nBarr didn\u2019t specifically mention these values, many of which are enshrined in the Judeo-Christian traditions he celebrated in his talk. He did, however, lament the rise of \u201cmoral relativism,\u201d which he said public schools were \u201cactively promoting.\u201d So, too, presumably, are members of his own party, who selectively condemn bad behavior only when committed by someone other than Trump.\n\nAD\n\nSo maybe this wasn\u2019t a battle cry against Barr\u2019s religious or political opponents. Maybe it was just a cry for help.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Maybe his comments on religion apply to his boss.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3PZw_OIGaMbdrlzXVs31gWlg52w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X7ESHRHKDAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
