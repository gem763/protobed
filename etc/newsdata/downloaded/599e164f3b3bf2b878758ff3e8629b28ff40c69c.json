(Norm Shafer/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe two young, white University of Virginia students had a secret.\n\nIt was September 1826, and the men \u2014 both scions of wealthy Southern slaveholding families \u2014 were suffering from the same sexually transmitted disease. Conferring, they identified a possible culprit: an enslaved black woman whom both had raped.\n\nThey also thought of a solution.\n\nJoined by several classmates, Turner Dixon and George Hoffman attacked the woman, \u201c[accused] her of giving them a venereal disease \u2026 stripped her naked and beat her\u201d bloody, as U-Va. professor Alan Taylor recounts in his new book, \u201cThomas Jefferson\u2019s Education.\u201d Her name is lost, but her age is known: 16.\n\nWhen the woman\u2019s owner \u2014 a local tavern keeper \u2014 complained to faculty, U-Va. professors verbally reprimanded the two ringleaders and wrote letters to their parents. Because Dixon and Hoffman \u201cappeared sorry\u201d and voluntarily paid the tavern keeper $10, professors declared the punishment sufficient, according to Taylor.\n\nRecords show a student who mishandled a library book earned harsher discipline, Taylor wrote.\n\n[U-Va. acknowledges its slave history]\n\nWhile shocking today, the incident was unremarkable for its time and place, Taylor said in an interview. Throughout the first half of the 19th century, male students studying at Southern universities regularly mistreated, beat and raped the enslaved men, women and children who catered to their everyday needs, Taylor said. The brutal behavior was ignored or accepted by professors, administrators and local authorities.\n\n\u201cThese men are 16 or 17 years old, they\u2019ve been raised on plantations and been trained from youth that it is their job to command people and abuse them if there is any resistance to their command,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cFor a student to lash out and hit an enslaved person, that was routine in this world.\u201d\n\nLittle, if any, previous scholarship has explored the horrific abuse endured by enslaved people working at Southern colleges in the lead-up to the Civil War, according to Maurie D. McInnis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. It\u2019s now coming to light courtesy of two books \u2014 Taylor\u2019s and \u201cEducated in Tyranny: Slavery at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s University,\u201d which McInnis co-edited with Louis P. Nelson \u2014 that tackle the subject at U-Va., Thomas Jefferson\u2019s pride and joy.\n\nBoth books (Taylor\u2019s publishes Oct. 15, while McInnis\u2019s published in August) draw on years of painstaking scrutiny of archival records, which U-Va. made available as part of its ongoing attempt to grapple with its slaveholding past.\n\nLast year, the university produced a 96-page report that concluded slavery was \u201cin every way imaginable . . . central to the project of designing, funding, building, and maintaining the school.\u201d It also vowed to erect a monument honoring the enslaved laborers who built its campus.\n\n[They were once America's cruelest, richest slave traders. Why does no one know their names?]\n\nU-Va.\u2019s efforts come as dozens of universities across the country undertake similar examinations \u2014 and as America marks the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Jamestown. The dark milestone has spurred a reckoning with the awful reality of slavery and the myriad ways it shaped the nation.\n\nThe two authors said they hoped to surface the invisible history and day-to-day agony of the enslaved people who for decades serviced America\u2019s prestigious institutions of higher education. McInnis said U-Va., established at the start of the 19th century by the slave-owning Founding Father who penned the Declaration of Independence, afforded a perfect case study.\n\n\u201cThe central paradox at the heart of U-Va. is also the central paradox of the nation, the unresolved paradox of American liberty,\u201d McInnis said. \u201cHow is it that the nation that defined the natural rights of humankind did so within a system that denied those same rights to millions of people?\u201d\n\nShe paused. \u201cWhat does it mean, to have a university founded by the man who said all men are created equal \u2014 and to have that same university built and maintained through the stolen liberty of others?\u201d\n\n\u2018A landscape of slavery\u2019\n\n\n\nA statue of Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president and the founder of the University of Virginia, surveys passersby. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nThomas Jefferson established the University of Virginia in 1819 with a clear mission: create more Thomas Jeffersons.\n\nJefferson \u2014 who by then had served as both U.S. president and vice president \u2014 envisioned U-Va. as a breeding ground for the next generation of the country\u2019s political elite, beneficiaries of his educational program molded in his image, Taylor said. Still, he wanted students to differentiate themselves in at least one important way: He wanted them to end slavery in America.\n\nIn his late 70s at the time, the former president said he was \u201ctoo old\u201d to take any action himself, a claim he first advanced in his 40s, according to Taylor. Instead, Jefferson insisted, the up-and-coming generation should fix the problem by \u201cemancipating the enslaved and deporting them to Africa,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to whiten Virginia,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHe believed the University of Virginia would help to achieve that.\u201d\n\nInstead, early U-Va. graduates became \u201cleading voices in the pro-slavery movement, soldiers in the Confederate Army, and political leaders in the Confederate States of America,\u201d McInnis wrote in \u201cEducated in Tyranny.\u201d\n\n[She was captured and enslaved 400 years ago. Now Angela symbolizes a brutal history.]\n\nThe vast majority of the student body \u2014 numbering between 100 and 150 people each year \u2014 hailed from wealthy, Southern slaveholding families. Plantation-owning parents clamored to send their sons to U-Va., lauded as a prestigious alternative to the Northern schools they feared as dangerous hotbeds of anti-slavery sentiment, according to Taylor.\n\nUltrarich Southerners were also some of the only Americans able to afford tuition at U-Va., then \u201cthe most expensive college\u201d in the country, Taylor said.\n\nThe design of U-Va.\u2019s grounds and buildings \u2014 featuring \u201cincredible segregation of student-faculty-white space and enslaved-African-American-work space\u201d \u2014 ultimately reinforced vile theories of white supremacy employed to justify slavery, McInnis said in an interview.\n\n\u201cJefferson physically designed a campus that internalized everything he had learned living on plantations,\u201d McInnis said. \u201cIt is architecturally set up to be a landscape of slavery.\u201d\n\n\u2018See no evil\u2019\n\n\n\nA statue of Thomas Jefferson stands in front of the Rotunda at the University of Virginia. (Norm Shafer/For The Washington Post)\n\nU-Va. had one real rule about enslaved people: Students were not allowed to bring any to campus.\n\nIn part, professors feared the student body would compete to see who could arrive with the most enslaved servants, straining the school\u2019s resources, Taylor said. Besides, U-Va. already had a significant labor force: usually between 100 and 200 enslaved servants, about half of them women, according to McInnis.\n\nThe enslaved helped build almost every inch of the university, from its deep brick cellars to its soaring white columns. Once students arrived, U-Va.\u2019s enslaved cooked their meals, cleaned their rooms, washed their clothes, tended fires in dormitories, planted and cared for the school gardens, and maintained classrooms and outhouses, Taylor said.\n\nEnslaved people also catered to students\u2019 daily whims. \u201cEvery afternoon, an enslaved servant called on his assigned student,\u201d Taylor wrote in \u201cThomas Jefferson\u2019s Education.\u201d The enslaved person then \u201c[took] orders for errands on the grounds or in town.\u201d\n\nThey also had to obey the sometimes conflicting dictates of every student or professor they passed on campus, McInnis said. This meant having \u201cnot one master but hundreds \u2026 making navigating daily life fraught with peril,\u201d she wrote in \u201cEducated in Tyranny.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, the enslaved faced unchecked abuse from the privileged pupils they served.\n\nSometimes \u201cbored students\u201d played \u201ccruel pranks\u201d \u2014 tricks such as \u201csetting buckets of cold water atop a door to douse a servant entering to clean,\u201d Taylor wrote.\n\nOther times, students nearly beat the enslaved to death, including one who looked \u201cuppity\u201d while serving food, Taylor said, and another who was slightly too slow to clear away feces left behind by a student\u2019s dog.\n\nSchool records reveal students punching, kicking and mutilating enslaved people with canes. Some, frustrated with the pace of service in campus dining halls, threw knives at their enslaved waiters, according to McInnis. Once, a student convinced that an enslaved girl had spoken to him \u201cwith insolence\u201d beat and kicked the 10-year-old until \u201cshe passed out and a physician had to be called,\u201d McInnis said.\n\nAt U-Va. \u2014 as at every Southern university in America during this era \u2014 bullying the enslaved formed \u201cpart of daily existence,\u201d McInnis said. It was also performance art, Taylor added: a way for rich young men to prove their mettle to their peers.\n\n\u201cThe episodes we do know of, other students are watching and applauding,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis was a whole generation of men who just behaved monstrously.\u201d\n\nEnslaved women, as McInnis wrote in her book, were at special risk.\n\n['Their pain was unparalleled': How slaves helped build democracy's symbols and save Georgetown University]\n\nRapes were routine, whether conducted in nearby houses of prostitution staffed by enslaved women or in the dark alleyways and shady corners of campus. Students, who arrived in Charlottesville steeped in a plantation culture of sexual tyranny, felt the \u201censlaved women working at the university were just one of the \u2018Virginian Luxuries\u2019 they had a right to,\u201d McInnis wrote.\n\nIt can be difficult to track sexual assaults in the archives, McInnis said, because squeamish faculty often used euphemisms. Still, the few cases available are haunting, she said \u2014 like the time three students seized a \u201csmall negro girl . . . about 12 years old,\u201d per U-Va. records, dragged her to an out-of-the-way cemetery and raped her.\n\nMost of the time, professors \u201cdid nothing\u201d or referred the matter to local authorities, who also did nothing, according to McInnis. Occasionally, faculty members might deliver \u201cverbal admonishments,\u201d she wrote. (Meanwhile, professors commonly dismissed students for failing to wear the prescribed school uniform.)\n\nNo calls for discipline came from the school\u2019s great founder, either.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that Jefferson knew about students\u2019 brutalization of the enslaved, according to Taylor. As a slave owner himself, Jefferson knew that slavery everywhere \u2014 including at his cherished college \u2014 led to violence against the enslaved, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing in the record from him,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cFrankly, Jefferson does not want to see or think about it . . . you know, \u2018See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.' \u201d\n\n\n\nRestraints commonly used in the slave trade on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nTaylor said he knows many Americans will find the revelations about student behavior horrifying. But books like his and McInnis\u2019s are necessary at this political and cultural moment, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a broad understanding that 'slavery is bad, people got whipped,\u2019 but there\u2019s also an urge to compartmentalize it: \u2018That was bad, but it\u2019s over with, and we should focus on the good stuff like U-Va.\u2019s cutting-edge education and science,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to ruin people\u2019s day \u2014 but if you want to understand society, you\u2019ve got to understand how everything is woven together, the good with the bad.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAs plantations talk more honestly about slavery, some visitors are pushing back\n\nAaron Burr \u2014 villain of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 \u2014 had a secret family of color, new research shows\n\nMissouri v.
