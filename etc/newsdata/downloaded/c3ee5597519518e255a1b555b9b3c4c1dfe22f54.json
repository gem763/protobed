Is it right for the president\u2019s personal counsel to press an allied nation to investigate the president\u2019s political opponents? Trump\u2019s alleged request that Ukraine work with his personal counsel raises the issue of a potential personal political favor \u2014 at the same time that vital foreign aid to Ukraine was on the line. There is not a Republican alive who would find it acceptable for a Democratic president to press a foreign country to work with his personal lawyer to investigate a domestic political rival.\n\nThere is a pressing need for lawmakers to be informed of the substance of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2014 and to seek evidence that corroborates or refutes his account. And while the Wall Street Journal report is disturbing, it\u2019s also important to note that it\u2019s based in large part on anonymous sourcing. While Giuliani\u2019s admitted efforts to spur a Ukrainian investigation are now widely known, we don\u2019t yet know the whole truth (or anything close to the whole truth).", "description": "", "authors": ["David French", "Nationalreview.Com Corner Problem-With-Rudy-Giuliani-Spin-On-Ukraine"], "top_image": ""}
