As the Washington Post writes, the resort was sued in 2016 by a guest who said he\u2019d been bitten multiple times by bed bugs. The Trump Organization denied the allegation, without going into detail, wrote the Post. It settled the case in 2017.\n\nOn Monday Trump said he wasn\u2019t concerned about appearing to promote his own brand, but watchdogs call the potential move a failure of ethics. \u201cThis president is now openly using the power of his office to essentially do an ad to prop up a floundering business he owns,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, the communications director for the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nRead: Trump touts his struggling Doral club in Miami as site for 2020 G-7 summit.\n\nBOOST FOR BOLSONARO\n\nTrump said on Twitter that President Jair Bolsonaro has the \u201cfull and complete support of the USA!\u201d as the Brazilian government said it would reject aid from the world\u2019s wealthiest nations to fight the fires.\n\nRead: Brazil rejects G-7\u2019s $40 million to fight Amazon fire, likening gesture to colonialism.\n\nIt was at least the second such offer from Trump, who said last week that the U.S. was \u201cready to assist.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s critics have accused him of taking a lax approach at best to preventing deforestation. In rebuffing the G-7 aid offer, Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo said mechanisms to fight deforestation already exist under the United Nations climate convention.\n\nNow see: Tim Cook donates nearly $5 million to charity, and Apple pledges aid for Amazon rain forest\n\nTrump also said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would remain prime minister of Italy. Reuters reported Monday that Italy\u2019s 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party were set to agree on outgoing Prime Minister Conte\u2019s returning as head of a new government.\n\nFED TWEET\n\nTrump has frequently criticized the Federal Reserve over monetary policy, jawboning the central bank to aggressively cut interest rates. Tuesday was no exception, with the president tweeting that the Fed \u201cloves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world.\u201d\n\nTrump has previously blamed the Fed for what he says is keeping the value of the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.06% high and putting companies like Boeing BA, -0.90% and Caterpillar CAT, +1.46% at a disadvantage. The Fed does not directly control the dollar, but lower interest rates can weaken the value of a country\u2019s currency.\n\nNow see: Fed should refuse to \u2018play along\u2019 with Trump\u2019s trade war: William Dudley\n\nA BIAS TOWARD DEMOCRACY?\n\nAs a dinner discussion in Biarritz on Saturday turned \u201crough and tumble,\u201d the Washington Post and others reported on Tuesday, and President Trump again pressed the argument that such topics as Iran\u2019s nuclear-arms threat cannot productively be navigated without Russian leader Vladimir Putin at the table, fellow G-7 summit attendees wondered aloud whether a democratic approach to governance should not be a prerequisite for participation.\n\nAs other leaders at the dinner argued in the affirmative, Trump, according to the Post\u2019s reporting, crossed his arms and \u201cbecame more combative.\u201d\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump blamed Democrats for what he called a \u201cnasty rumor\u201d of bed bugs at his Miami-area resort that he has promoted for the next Group of...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ143_trump__ZG_20190826125818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
