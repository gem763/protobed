Lawmakers of both parties have questioned whether Trump gave Turkey a \u201cgreen light,\u201d and called on him to press Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop the operation.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said after a Sunday telephone call with Erdogan that he was informed of the Turkish operation, and had ordered U.S. forces to withdraw from the target area.\n\nSince then, the administration has been at pains to make clear it does not support the incursion, calling it a \u201cbad idea\u201d and pressing the Turks to stop.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe oppose and are greatly disappointed by Turkey\u2019s decision to launch a unilateral military incursion into northern Syria,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said at a Friday news conference. In addition to putting U.S. partners \u201cin harms way,\u201d he said that it \u201crisks the security of [prisoner] camps and will put the region in danger.\u201d\n\nEsper insisted, as have other officials, that anti-Islamic State operations by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Force outside the incursion zone have not stopped, and that no prisoners were known to have escaped.\n\nAD\n\nHe and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that Turkey continued air and artillery attacks on a zone about 20 miles deep along the northeastern Syrian border, and that ground forces have entered up to six to seven miles into Syria in some places.\n\nAD\n\nThey said that the United States had \u201crepositioned\u201d an unspecified number of U.S. troops in the region to provide force protection for about 1,000 American troops based in eastern Syria. Kurdish forces have, until many took off for the front lines against Turkey, provided protection for U.S. installations.\n\nIn statements Thursday, Trump said that options for dealing with the situation included sending in \u201cthousands\u201d of American forces, a proposal he rejected; imposing severe economic sanctions on Turkey; or providing U.S. mediation between Turkey and the Kurds.\n\nAD\n\nOf those options, the president said he favored sanctions.\n\nTurkish officials said they are not interested in mediation. In a meeting Friday with reporters, Sedar Kilic, the Turkish ambassador to the United States, said that his government had no intention of \u201cslaughtering\u201d Kurdish fighters, as some U.S. lawmakers have alleged, but that it was determined to bring an end to Kurdish occupation of the border area and would not stop until it had reached its goals.\n\nAD\n\nAs has Erdogan and other Turkish officials, Kilic expressed puzzlement and no small amount of exasperation at the United States\u2019 refusal to recognize the danger posed by the Kurdish fighters and their political movement, which he said was \u201ctrying to carve out a Marxist-Leninist state.\u201d Most Kurds in Syria, he said, did not support the movement, or the fighters.\n\nHe said that Turkey\u2019s operations were defensive and legal under the charters of both the United Nations and NATO, to which Turkey belongs.\n\nRachel Siegel contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The action came as the administration stepped up its criticism of Turkey\u2019s military operation against U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xIppZUv9kvltym6_Pjo1Us3ezFY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HPQHIDHMLEI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
