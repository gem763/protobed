But as the counting has continued, Morales' lead has mounted.\n\nThat has led to accusations of fraud by his opponents and protests across the country, including riots in six of Bolivia's nine regions and the capital, La Paz, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, according to The Associated Press.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Juan Karita/AP Juan Karita/AP\n\nIn a national television address on Wednesday, Morales lashed out at his opponents, declaring that \"a coup d'etat is under way.\"\n\n\"The right wing prepared the coup with international support,\" he said.\n\nThe leftist leader did not elaborate on where the international support was coming from, but he has frequently railed against what he says is U.S. imperialism.\n\nIn the latest count, the former coca farmer and union leader who became the country's first indigenous leader, leads Mesa by just over 10 percentage points \u2013 the cutoff threshold to avoid a runoff. Most of the remaining 2% of ballots to be counted are from rural areas said to favor Morales.\n\nBut delays in the counting and a gap in reporting that was followed by a sudden uptick in the vote for Morales has led to suspicions.\n\nThe Organization of American States cited the \"drastic\" and inexplicable shift in the vote as possibly fraudulent and said a run-off should be held no matter the final tally of the first round. The U.S., Brazil and the European Union have also expressed concern over the vote.\n\nMichael G. Kozak, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, warned Bolivian authorities against election fraud.\n\n\"I think you will see pretty strong response from the whole hemisphere, not just the U.S.,\" Kozak said during a House hearing, according to the AP.\n\nAfter preliminary results were announced Sunday, Mesa, Morales' predecessor, celebrated \"an unquestionable triumph\" thinking that he'd made it to a second round.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Mesa claimed the ballot counting was a \"gigantic fraud.\"\n\n\"If there is anyone who breaks the constitutional order it is Evo Morales,\" he said.\n\nSince first taking office in 2006, Morales has presided over an improving economy in the impoverished Bolivia, which has seen a strong 4% average growth in GDP, largely from exports of natural gas and metals, such as zinc and gold. However, those exports have trailed off in recent years and corruption remains a major problem.\n\nThe country's constitution limits the presidency to two terms, but Morales has won permission from the Constitutional Court to stay in office until 2025.\n\nBolivia has seven million eligible voters. All seats in the country's bicameral legislature were also on Sunday's ballot.", "description": "Evo Morales, the country's longtime leftist president, is claiming victory in Sunday's polling against former President Carlos Mesa.
