Every liberty movement is \u201canti-government,\u201d after all. If you\u2019ve been to Philadelphia, chances are you\u2019ve visited its most popular historical attraction, the Anti-Government Bell.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t joke about that, actually. The way things are going in Philly, they really might start calling it the Anti-Government Bell if Xi Jinping insists.\n\nUse of the word \u201canti-government\u201d to describe Hong Kong\u2019s motives is no longer the most egregious example of ESPN assimilating Chinese state propaganda. Behold:\n\nWow, nothing to see here except @ESPN implicitly acknowledging China's claims to the South China Sea by using the \"Nine-Dash Line\" on a graphic today #StandWithHongKong: pic.twitter.com/KCDIV77h5H \u2014 John Cooper (@thejcoop) October 10, 2019\n\nThat dashed line is the so-called Nine-Dash Line, which China claims marks the boundaries of its proper dominion over the South China Sea. International bodies don\u2019t recognize that claim. An international court in the Hague ruled against China on the question as recently as 2016, in fact. The line in the ESPN graphic doesn\u2019t come from any official international map.\n\nSo how the hell did it end up on SportsCenter?\n\nIf this is real, this would be a major blunder. I\u2019ve literally never seen that map outside of China. https://t.co/ASmsaHqdEm \u2014 Julian Ku \u53e4\u8209\u502b (@julianku) October 10, 2019\n\nWhen do we see the first anti-Uighur \u201c30 for 30\u201d documentary on this garbage network in order to appease Disney\u2019s masters?\n\nThe Washington Wizards hosted a Chinese basketball team for an exhibition last D.C. and things went \u2026 as you\u2019d expect:\n\nOur \u201cGoogle Uyghurs\u201d sign has been confiscated. pic.twitter.com/fX4tF4oOxR \u2014 Jon Schweppe (@JonSchweppe) October 9, 2019\n\nIs \u201cGoogle Uighurs\u201d a \u201cpolitical\u201d message? That was the excuse in Philly for confiscating a fan\u2019s \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d sign, which does clearly take a stance on a matter of political import. \u201cGoogle Uighurs\u201d does not, yet it was banned too. What if fans start waving signs that read, simply, \u201cUighurs\u201d? Does that get suppressed?\n\nI mean, we don\u2019t Americans getting curious about the subject.\n\nThere were other pro-Hong-Kong protesters both inside and outside the arena last night. I\u2019m too jaded to believe that demonstrations at NBA games will persist this year once this dispute with China fades from the news cycle, but maybe the visibility of this clusterfark will wake Americans up to Chinese bootlicking by its favorite corporations more generally. Case in point:\n\nApple removed an app late Wednesday that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track the police, a day after facing intense criticism from Chinese state media for it, plunging the technology giant deeper into the complicated politics of a country that is fundamental to its business\u2026 In a statement on Wednesday, Apple said, \u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws.\u201d\n\nMichael Brendan Dougherty notes that it\u2019s bad enough Apple would deprive the protesters of a tool that makes oppression by the state more difficult; the insult to the injury is the company adopting Beijing\u2019s own party line about the protesters being the aggressors in the stand-off. That\u2019s the common thread between Apple, the NBA, and ESPN. It\u2019s not good enough for them to do China\u2019s bidding. Validating China\u2019s view that its enemies are in the wrong is essential.\n\nThe exhibition game today in Shanghai between the Lakers and Nets was played as scheduled, as I suspected would happen. China\u2019s not going to ban a popular spectator sport indefinitely over one tweet by one guy who\u2019s been isolated by virtually his entire profession. The point in penalizing the league this week by knocking it off Chinese TV, etc, was to show NBA personnel that further pronouncements on Hong Kong and other \u201cinternal matters\u201d won\u2019t be tolerated. This week was a wrist slap, next time it\u2019s the death penalty. Do you think America\u2019s \u201cwokest sports league\u201d got the message? I\u2019ll leave you with this to judge.", "description": "Great.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
