But that's Sunday. Now, it's about having a great time with my fourball and the rest of the field and enjoying the game of golf here at the beautiful Selborne.\"\n\nThe pro-am section of the Vodacom Origins of Golf at Selborne is followed by the main 54-hole professional tournament that tees off this Thursday.\n\n- Michael Vlismas Media", "description": "Former Springbok Chiliboy Ralepelle is showing off his skill on a different field by taking part in the Vodacom Origins of Golf pro-am.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9475/c26ff76030f140ec90d8e7933537448e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
