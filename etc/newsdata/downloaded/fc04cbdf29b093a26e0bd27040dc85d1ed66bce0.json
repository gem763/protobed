You haven\u2019t truly made it until you\u2019re selling booze.\n\nBut even in this star-obsessed era, there are just a few bottles that actually feature a famous name or face, including the Pol Roger Winston Churchill Champagne Cuv\u00e9e, the Frank Sinatra edition of Jack Daniel\u2019s and John Wayne Duke Bourbon.\n\nJoining this select group is actor and woodworker Nick Offerman. Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch Whisky is immortalizing him with a limited-edition 11-year-old bottling that is now being released across the country. The special dram even features a line drawing of him right on the label.\n\nThe so-called Lagavulin Offerman Edition ($75) grew out of a running gag on the TV series Parks and Recreation. Offerman\u2019s character, the blustery Ron Swanson, loves the Islay whisky and he drinks it on multiple episodes. How was the brand selected for the show? \u201cIt\u2019s some pretty hilarious serendipity,\u201d he told me. \u201cLagavulin was the first Scotch anybody ever gave me. I was 29 years old at the Chicago Film Festival, and my friend the filmmaker Scott King bought me a glass of Lagavulin. I tasted it and it\u2019s a campfire in a glass. And I said \u2018holy cow, I see what all the fuss is about when it comes to delicious single malt Scotch.\u2019 And little did I know that it was such an intense and particular flavor that it ruined me. I\u2019m not persnickety, if there\u2019s whiskey to be had then we\u2019re in luck, but when given my druthers I always have asked for Lagavulin\u2014it became my easy favorite.\u201d\n\nOfferman admits that he was amazed and slightly baffled when he opened his desk drawer on the set of Parks and Recreation and discovered a bottle of Lagavulin. He assumed that somehow the props department had found out that he liked the brand and the bottle was ultimately featured five or six times in the first season alone. Only a year later at a birthday party for Mike Schur, the creator of the show, did he realize it was also his favorite Scotch and that\u2019s why it had been chosen in the first place. \u201cWe marveled because at the time it was really pretty unheard of especially for a couple of dumb American guys in their 30s,\u201d he says.\n\nThanks to the success of Parks and Recreation, Offerman has gotten to work on a number of projects with Lagavulin, including a memorable yule log video for the holidays. So when this idea for a special whisky \u201cwas pitched to me I was absolutely gobsmacked,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being invited to pitch a game for the Cubs or something. It just seems out of the realm of possibility.\u201d\n\nWith Lagavulin distillery manager Colin Gordon he tasted different whiskies from the brand\u2019s warehouses to help select the special-edition Scotch. What was Offerman looking for in the samples? \u201cI suppose it\u2019s interesting, it feels like it\u2019s right in pace with my woodworking tastes. I like simple and bold things,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I like to build a Craftsman oak table in the style of Gustav Stickley much in the same way that I like my Scotch to have signature peat and smokiness. For some reason, I tend towards the bucolic so I want to taste some leather and some soil. If there\u2019s some actual oak sawdust stirred into the mix it won\u2019t hurt my feelings.\u201d\n\nWhile Offerman is specific in terms of what he\u2019s looking for in a Scotch, when it comes to drinking he just likes \u201cit in a glass. That\u2019s my favorite way to drink any Lagavulin.\u201d He\u2019s actually serious and doesn\u2019t like to add ice or even water to his whisky, since \u201cto my way of thinking you\u2019re just diluting your good time.\u201d\n\nI wondered if his wife actresses Megan Mullally likes his eponymous whisky, especially since she drinks a river of Martinis on her show Will & Grace. Offerman lets me down gently. \u201cShe\u2019s never had a Martini in her life,\u201d he reveals. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to her chops that she can pull that off.\u201d While they used to drink beer or wine, now \u201cas a top-drawer singer both on the Broadway stage and touring with her band Nancy & Beth, she has pretty much foregone alcohol entirely.\u201d\n\nThe Lagavulin Scotch is not the only project that Offerman is working on right now. He is finishing 12 ukuleles that he built from scratch and the second season of crafting show Making It that he co-hosts with Amy Poehler, is finished and will air this winter. He\u2019s also in the middle of a tour for his new one-man comedy show, All Rise, which runs through December 14 and makes stops at New York\u2019s Beacon Theater and D.C.\u2019s The Kennedy Center.\n\nWhile it\u2019s probably too early to say, he\u2019d like to do another special edition of Lagavulin. \u201cThis piece of good fortunate strikes me as utterly ridiculous. Getting the job as Ron Swanson was like winning the biggest lottery a boy could ever hope for and then from that this relationship with Lagavulin sprouted and it\u2019s been just absolutely wonderful,\u201d he says. \u201cI get to go to a beautiful island in Scotland once a year and shoot dumb funny commercials for this product that\u2019s been my favorite libation for most of my adult life and so as long as they still find me adorable, I\u2019m happy to come to any dinner party they care to throw.\u201d", "description": "Actor Nick Offerman talks about his special edition of peaty Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch Whisky, his new one-man comedy show, and woodworking.", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571029268/191011-Rothbaum-Nick-Offerman-tease_tppkwv", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
