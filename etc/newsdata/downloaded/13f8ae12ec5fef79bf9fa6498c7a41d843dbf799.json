James took on the role of facilitator and attempted just seven shots through the game\u2019s first three quarters while tallying six points and 10 assists.\n\nDavis, meanwhile, had hit 10-of-18 field goal attempts for 29 points.\n\nThe LeBron James-Anthony Davis dynamic started to take shape in Sunday's win over the Charlotte Hornets. (Kelvin Kuo/Reuters)\n\nJames takes over in 4th\n\nBut when James subbed in for Davis to start the fourth quarter, he took over on offense in a pivotal stretch that increased the Lakers\u2019 87-80 lead well into double digits. When Davis returned to the court with 5:43 remaining, Los Angeles had stretched its lead to 106-91. Both players remained on the court until the final 2:20 as the Lakers secured their victory before emptying the bench.\n\nIt was a potential blueprint for how the Lakers will run their offense behind their new superstar tandem.\n\nJames finished the night with 20 points, 12 assists and six rebounds, while Davis tallied 29 points, 14 rebounds, three assists and three blocks. Davis posted 19 shots from the floor to James\u2019 14. Davis finished 6-for-6 from the line while James hit all five of his attempts.\n\nAnd, most importantly for the Lakers, they secured a convincing victory.\n\nSign of things to come?\n\nOf course there will be games where James is the focus. Matchups and game flow will dictate how the Lakers offense operates on any given night.\n\nStory continues\n\nJames outshot Davis 22 to 17 and outscored him 32 to 21 during Friday\u2019s 95-86 win over the Utah Jazz \u2014 a game where points inside were considerably harder to come by with defensive stalwart Rudy Gobert manning the paint for Utah.\n\nThe Lakers are three games into an 82-game season and are sure to tinker with different dynamics focusing on James and Davis.\n\nFor a Lakers team that long-coveted bringing Davis aboard, it\u2019s a challenge they will surely relish.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The LeBron James-Anthony Davis dynamic started to take shape in Sunday's win over the Charlotte Hornets.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RXwe_FxPXG8PlutT5yWcHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xp6tztjtH0GDVhShRSzgRQ--~B/aD0yMDQzO3c9MzA2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a6d05760-f937-11e9-bffc-dad9b24f65fa", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
