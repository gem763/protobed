However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nEver in the mood to tune out the entire world and just focus on a podcast or new album in peace? Same. To do so, you'll need a pair of high-quality, over-ear headphones with top-of-the-line noise-cancellation technology, And right now, eBay is selling brand new pairs of the headphones that do it best, the Sony WH-1000XM3s, for the lowest price we've ever seen them available for.\n\nCurrently these Sonys are going for $250 on eBay, which is $100 cheaper than their usual retail price. Earlier this year, We chose the Sonys as the best noise-canceling headphones money can buy, even outperforming the mega popular Bose Quiet Comfort 35 Series II headphones in our tests, which came as a quite a shock to me as a proud owner of the QC35s for years. But even I have to admit, the WH-1000XM3s are truly special.\n\nWhat gave the Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones an edge over the Bose QC 35IIs was one feature in particular that Sony aptly titled \u201cAdaptive Sound Control.\u201d This is just a fancy way of saying that the headphones are smart enough to sense your surroundings and adjust the level of active noise-cancellation (or ANC) accordingly, whether you\u2019re on a crowded plane or just trying to focus in a chatty office.\n\nAlso worth noting is the touch-controlled \u201cQuick Attention\u201d mode. By placing your hand over the earcup, you can communicate without having to remove your headphones, which, in my opinion, is a total gamechanger for ordering a cup of coffee or having a quick conversation. Not only that, but we found that the Sonys remain comfy after hours of wear, and have an extra long battery life\u2014in short, they\u2019re life-changing, even if you're a Bose loyalist.\n\nKeep in mind that although these aren't being sold directly by Sony, this top-rated seller on eBay has nearly 100% positive feedback, and comes with an eBay Money Back Guarantee in case you're not satisfied for any reason. Pssst, you can also buy refurbished models for just below $200, but either way go, new or refurbished, you definitely won't want to miss out on this eBay deal.\n\nGet the Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones on eBay for $250 (Save $100)\n\nGet the refurbished Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones on eBay for $200 (Save $150)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
