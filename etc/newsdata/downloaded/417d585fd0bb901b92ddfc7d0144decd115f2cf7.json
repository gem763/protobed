The three Southeast Asian nations were cited in the May report for the first time, and the Treasury says it keeps newcomers on the list for at least two straight reports. China -- which was formally labeled a currency manipulator in August -- Japan and South Korea were the other Asian economies cited at the time.\n\nA country makes it on the watchlist if it\u2019s met two of three criteria: a trade surplus with the U.S. of at least $20 billion; a current-account surplus of a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product; and persistent, one-sided intervention in the currency equivalent to 2% of GDP in six months of a year.\n\nFor China, dynamics around trade negotiations with the U.S. may influence whether the nation retains its \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d label. Both countries appear to have agreed on a \u201cphase one\u201d deal for now, though Chinese officials have yet to confirm any agreement.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how some of the countries stack up against the Treasury\u2019s criteria:\n\nSingapore\n\nThe city state found its place on the watchlist in May for its massive current account surplus of almost 18% of GDP and intervention in the foreign exchange market.\n\nOn the intervention front, Singapore may have less to worry about. Unlike other central banks, the Monetary Authority of Singapore conducts policy by intervening in the foreign currency market rather than setting interest rates. And it\u2019s made it clear that the intervention is to keep inflation under control, not to manipulate the currency for export advantage.\n\nThe central bank has pledged more transparency in its foreign exchange purchases, a move lauded by the Treasury in its last report. As a proxy for currency intervention, the drop in foreign-exchange reserves since June shows the MAS\u2019s action hasn\u2019t been one-sided in the market.\n\nThe city state\u2019s current account surplus remains a standout.\n\n\u201cSingapore\u2019s current account is, as usual, huge, hence meets at least one of the criteria,\u201d said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corp. in Singapore. \u201cIt depends on the U.S. Treasury\u2019s estimates on Singapore\u2019s FX intervention as to whether Singapore meets the FX intervention criterion.\u201d\n\nMalaysia\n\nMalaysia was cited for its $27 billion goods surplus with the U.S. and a current account balance that squeaked just above the 2% mark. Cheung sees both still meeting the U.S. report\u2019s criteria.\n\nThe trade surplus with the U.S. doesn\u2019t appear to have shown much improvement, given that its year-to-date tally earlier this month is about unchanged from the same period in 2018.\n\nOn the current account, the surplus has actually widened since the Treasury\u2019s May report, reaching 3.06% of GDP in the second quarter.\n\nVietnam\n\nWhat saved Vietnam from violations in all three categories in May was the Treasury\u2019s interpretation that foreign exchange intervention was made in both directions in order to better link the Vietnamese dong to the greenback, and that there was \u201creasonable rationale\u201d for rebuilding inadequate reserves.\n\nAnalysts at ING Groep (AS: ) NV see that patience running out for the next report -- especially with Vietnam exceeding both of the other two thresholds.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has often found a different basis (for instance, national security) to impose tariffs on a country,\u201d Francesco Pesole, ING\u2019s London-based FX strategist, said in an Oct. 14 research note. \u201cVietnam seems particularly at risk of being hit by U.S. tariffs and the Trump administration may consider using the FX manipulator label to threaten tariffs.\u201d\n\nCan Van Luc, chief economist at Hanoi-based Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, said the central bank has been more flexible in managing the currency. The government has also been doing much to improve the trade situation, including \u201cconducting a master plan on anti-trade fraud, while trying to buy more from America,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it takes time to balance trade with the U.S.\u201d\n\nRest of Asia\n\nThailand, which successfully dodged the watchlist in May\u2019s report, could find itself in the crosshairs this time as its trade surplus with the U.S. in the 12 months through August nears $20 billion and its current account surplus remains above the 2% threshold.\n\n\u201cThailand strikes us as being uncomfortably close to being placed on the monitoring list,\u201d said Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore.\n\nJapan is likely to be flagged on two of three violations again -- a goods trade surplus with the U.S. that\u2019s already climbed to more than $48 billion so far this year, and a large current account balance. In its latest monthly report on the issue, Japan maintains that it\u2019s still not intervening in the foreign exchange market.\n\nWestpac\u2019s Cheung sees South Korea remaining on the watchlist despite earlier signals from the U.S. to the contrary -- owing to its trade surplus with the U.S. in the 12 months through August widening back to above $20 billion in addition to its bloated current account surplus.", "description": "U.S. Currency Manipulation Threat Puts Asian Nations on Guard", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb277f33c849392983e6c6cad34632184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
