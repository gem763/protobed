USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany -- When Simone Biles turned up at the national championships with a sequined goat on her training leotard, she meant it as a joke, a clapback at the trolls and critics.\n\nBut while Biles might cringe at the idea of actually calling herself the GOAT \u2013 greatest of all time \u2013 others will happily do it for her. Fellow gymnasts, coaches, icons of the sport \u2013 there is universal agreement that Biles is the best there is, of her generation and every other.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about domination, nothing like that has ever happened in our sport,\u201d Nadia Comaneci, who is still on a first-name basis with the world 40-plus years after scoring gymnastics\u2019 first perfect 10, told USA TODAY Sports.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will ever be anything like that. She\u2019s one of a kind.\u201d\n\nSimone Biles, simply the best. (Photo: Matthias Schrader, AP)\n\nBiles is all but assured of winning the all-around title at the world gymnastics championships Thursday. She hasn\u2019t lost an all-around competition since nationals in 2013, and it\u2019s been five years since anyone\u2019s even gotten close to her. (It was Larisa Iordache of Romania, at the 2014 worlds, for those wondering.)\n\nIt would be her fifth all-around title. It also would be Biles\u2019 22nd medal at the world championships, one less than the record set by Belarus' Vitaly Scherbo -- who did two more events, mind you.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the medals and titles that set Biles apart. It\u2019s, well, everything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what she\u2019s doing to the sport. She\u2019s revolutionizing it in a way I think no one will ever be able to do or has done,\u201d said Nastia Liukin, the 2008 Olympic all-around champion who is now a commentator for NBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody will ever top that.\u201d\n\nBiles has near-perfect technique, which has allowed her to push the bounds of the sport physically. Look at the few men who have attempted the triple-twisting, double somersault that she now does on floor exercise, and none managed to do it as cleanly. They landed with their chests forward or their knees bent so they could control their landings.\n\nWhen Biles did it during team finals, she landed perfectly upright, her feet cemented to the floor. Oh, she got so much height that the people in the first half-dozen rows had to look up to watch her, too.\n\nShe now has four skills named for her, two on floor exercise and one each on vault and balance beam. Pretty much every one of her routines could be put on an instructional DVD \u2013 if there were a chance anyone could come close to duplicating what she\u2019s doing, that is.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really absolutely out of this world to me,\u201d said Svetlana Boginskaya, the 1989 world champion who now coaches in Biles\u2019 hometown of Houston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alien gymnastics. It\u2019s inhuman gymnastics.\u201d\n\nMost impressive is that Biles, with her power and precision, had changed the game before the Rio Olympics. But after taking a year off, she\u2019s come back even better. Stronger. With more difficult skills.\n\nThe triple-double on floor and a double-twisting, double somersault dismount off beam are new this year. The Biles vault was new last season. She\u2019s even improved uneven bars, her least favorite and \u201cweakest\u201d event, so much so that she was the silver medalist at worlds last year.\n\nShe's so superior that the International Gymnastics Committee watered down the value of her double-double on beam because they didn't want to encourage mere mortals to try it.\n\nLiukin marvels at all of that, having tried to come back for the 2012 Olympics.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how difficult it actually is,\u201d Liukin said. \u201c(They don\u2019t realize) how many different directions she\u2019s being pulled in on a constant, day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nYet Biles has made it all look easy.\n\nIn some ways, that keeps her from getting the full credit she deserves. People are so used to Biles doing \u201cSimone things\u201d that we lose perspective on just how rare they \u2013 and she -- are.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been the hardest part for me,\u201d Liukin said. \u201cTo not tell myself, `Oh, she\u2019s just Simone.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiles is not doing this in a vacuum, either. The expectations on her are sky-high, and she is nearing that crossover celebrity status. The video of her triple-double at nationals practically broke the Internet, and she will no doubt be the face of the Tokyo Games with Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt now retired.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best thing about the sport right now because she is the sport at this particular point,\u201d Comaneci said.\n\nAt some point, Biles will retire \u2013 the 22-year-old says Tokyo will be her last Olympics \u2013 and new gymnasts will come along. That\u2019s how it is in sport. We\u2019re sure we\u2019ve seen the greatest ever, only to have someone else do them one better.\n\nBill Russell gave way to Michael Jordan who gave way to Kobe Bryant who gave way to LeBron James. Mark Spitz\u2019s records were eclipsed by Phelps. And so it goes.\n\nBut there are a few athletes who are transcendent \u2013 Phelps, Serena, Tiger, Brady -- and Biles is among them. She is already doing skills that can't be matched. Before she is done, she will set records that won't be touched.\n\n\u201cShe is, absolutely, the best I have ever seen,\u201d said Liang Chow, who coached Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas when she won the all-around gold at the London Olympics.\n\nIf anyone has earned the right to call herself the GOAT, it's Biles. Since she won't, we will.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Simone Biles is heavily favored to win her fifth all-around title at the world  gymnastics championships.
