We\u2019re protesting against government inaction.\u201d\n\nHe was eventually removed. A spokeswoman for BA said \u201cwe are investigating what happened as a matter of urgency\u201d.\n\nThe group said they were protesting plans to expand the airport, which aims to have 6.5 million passengers a year by 2022 compared to the 4.8 million in 2018, and which has said there could be demand for as many as 11 million by 2035.\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester stands on the top of the roof during a demonstration at London City Airport, in London, Britain, October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nOn Thursday, 18,000 passengers were due to arrive or depart from the airport, with 286 flights scheduled. While some protesters got inside the terminal building, flights were continuing, though some were delayed.\n\nAn Aer Lingus plane was forced to stop taxiing and return to its gate when a passenger got up to give a speech about climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry to disturb everybody here. We have two generations of human civilisation left if we carry on doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d the unnamed man said in a video of the incident, as he politely declined efforts by staff and passengers to get him to sit down.\n\nAer Lingus said that a passenger was removed from the flight to Dublin due to \u201cdisruptive behaviour on board.\u201d\n\nExtra security measures at the airport meant that most of the protesting happened well away from the runway.\n\nProtesters glued themselves to the terminal building, occupied a nearby Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station and blocked roads around the airport.\n\nPolice have made hundreds of arrests so far this week as the protesters have sought to shut down London with two weeks of civil disobedience.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\n\u201cWe continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police to ensure the safe operation of the airport, which remains fully open and operational,\u201d a spokesman for London City Airport said.\n\nPolice said that they had arrested one person on a flight on the runway with a number of people arrested outside the airport, without specifying how many.\n\nThe airport said it is \u201ccommitted to building a more sustainable future for the airport and the aviation industry\u201d and has said it will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. British Airways owner IAG also pledged on Thursday to meet that emissions target.", "description": "A protester lay on top of a plane while another forced a jet to turn around on the runway as climate change activists descended on London City Airport on Thursday, causing some disruption but ultimately failing to cancel flights.", "authors": ["Henry Nicholls", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439211179&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990R9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
