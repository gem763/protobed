(AP) \u2014 The first all-female spacewalk is back on, six months after a flap over spacesuits led to an embarrassing cancellation.\n\nNASA announced Friday that the International Space Station\u2019s two women will pair up for a spacewalk later this month. Astronauts Christina Koch (Cook) and the newly arrived Jessica Meir will venture out Oct. 21 to plug in new batteries. It will be the fourth of five spacewalks involving battery work. The first is this Sunday; Koch will go out with a male colleague.\n\nKoch was supposed to go spacewalking with another female crewmate in March. But NASA had to scrap the plan because there wasn\u2019t enough time to get a second medium-size spacesuit ready.\n\nNASA\u2019s deputy chief astronaut Megan McArthur says it will be a milestone and worth celebrating.", "description": "NASA originally scrapped the first plans because they didn't have properly sized spacesuits for the astronauts.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97ad27200000e2004c8c6b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
