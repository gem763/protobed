One of those men explicitly tied his case to Trump in a New York courtroom, further challenging Trump\u2019s claim not to know \u201cthose gentlemen.\u201d\n\nAnd we\u2019d be remiss not to mention Rudy\u2019s not one, but two, embarrassing butt-dials to an NBC reporter, in which he complained about needing money and Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s family.\n\nAs signs emerged of softening support for Trump among GOP senators, Trump\u2019s defenders in the House flailed, holding a bizarre pizza-fueled takeover of the secure room in the basement of the Capitol where the closed-door impeachment depositions are being held, even though several of them already have unrestricted access to the chamber.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it seems hard to imagine that the House won\u2019t ultimately impeach the president,\u201d said Richard Arenberg, a veteran Capitol Hill staffer who spent three decades working for Democrats. \u201cAmbassador Taylor\u2019s statement was devastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything\u201d depended on investigations\n\nTaylor kicked the week off with a hair-raising account of his discovery of the \u201cirregular\u201d diplomatic pressure campaign on Ukraine, which involved Giuliani and Trump\u2019s Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nTaylor\u2019s dramatic opening statement read like a mystery novel \u2014 and recounted how Sondland told Taylor that Trump wanted Ukraine\u2019s president to personally announce politically helpful investigations.\n\nRead: The 5 Bombshells From Bill Taylor's Testimony on Trump and Ukraine\n\nTrump wanted to put Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201c\u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations,\u201d said Taylor, who was appointed acting ambassador to Ukraine last spring by the Trump administration.\n\nTaylor said Sondland told him that \u201ceverything\u201d in U.S.-Ukraine relations depended on Ukraine announcing those investigations \u2014 including millions in vital military aid that the Trump administration withheld.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelensky and [Zelensky adviser] Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we would be at a stalemate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI understood a \u2018stalemate\u2019 to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed assistance.\u201d\n\nDemocrats emerging from Taylor\u2019s testimony looked visibly agitated.\n\n\u201cAll I have to say is that in my 10 short months in Congress... this is my most disturbing day in Congress so far,\u201d said Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.).\n\nRepublicans were left to argue that Taylor\u2019s narrative hadn't held up as well during cross examination, without pointing to any specifics.\n\nInstead, they stormed the hearing room the next day, stalling the deposition of a new witness, Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper, for hours.\n\nThey complained loudly about the process, ordered pizza, and broke House rules by bringing cell phones into the secure room known as the SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) in a security breach.\n\nUltimately, they couldn\u2019t stop Democrats\u2019 impeachment momentum.\n\nNext week, the Dems will hear from Tim Morrison, a National Security Council official thought to be the first witness who was on the notorious July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, which helped kickstart the whole impeachment shebang.\n\nMeanwhile in New York\n\nAs if all that D.C. drama weren\u2019t enough, a criminal case in New York against some of the central players in the impeachment scandal also raced forward.\n\nA report in Politico indicated that the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division has \u201ctaken an interest\u201d in Giuliani, too, adding to the already-reported probes by the FBI and prosecutors for the Southern District of New York into Giuliani\u2019s links to Ukraine.\n\nProsecutors told a judge this week they\u2019re sifting through the data of more than 50 bank accounts in the case against Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who\u2019ve been accused, alongside two others, of attempting to buy political influence by splashing out on illegal GOP campaign donations.\n\nParnas and Fruman pleaded not guilty this week, and Parnas vowed to beat the rap.\n\nBut to do that, he may just tie his case closer to the president. On Wednesday, Parnas\u2019 lawyer told the judge that some of the voluminous evidence in his case might be covered by presidential executive privilege \u2014 remarks that threaten to drag Trump\u2019s White House lawyers directly into the very courtroom.\n\n\u201cMr. Parnas was using Rudy Giuliani as his lawyer,\u201d Parnas' attorney, Ed MacMahon, told the judge, according to CNN. \u201cAnd then we have the issue of Mr. Giuliani working as personal attorney for the President.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump talks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Friday, Oct. 25, 2019, before boarding Marine One for the short trip to Andrews Air Force Base.
