It's not a fair deal for the United States.'\n\nTrump spoke out just hours after Turkey began bombing Kurdish strongholds in northern Syria and marched troops across the border in order to establish a 'peace corridor' in the north of the country.\n\nIt comes after Trump agreed to withdraw US troops from the region and hand security operations over to Turkey during a routine call with President Erdogan.\n\nErdogan says he wants to drive terrorists - by which he means the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces - away from Turkey's border so he can resettle some 2million Syrian refugees there.\n\nDonald Trump also suggested that he isn't worried about ISIS fighters escaping from Kurdish prisons because 'they'll go back to Europe' (pictured, Turkish commandos in Syria)\n\nTurkish soldiers riding in a tank roll towards the Syrian border yesterday evening as the first ground troops prepared to pour into Kurdish territory over the border\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' howitzers deployed at the Syrian town of Tell Abyad, as part of Turkey's Operation Peace Spring on Thursday\n\nHowever, critics say the move will destabilise the region, lead to civilians being killed, and may cause an ISIS resurgence.\n\nOf particular concern are prison camps being run by the SDF which contain some 10,000 ISIS fighters, around 2,500 of them foreigners - mainly from Europe.\n\nUnder Trump's plan, Turkey would take responsibility for these prisoners.\n\n'The Kurds are fighting for their land,' Trump told reporters gathered in the Roosevelt Room of the White House for a briefing about business deregulation.\n\n'As somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example.\n\n'They mentioned names of different battles. But they\u2019re there to help us with their land and that\u2019s a different thing'\n\nThe article Trump appears to be referencing was penned by conservative Kurt Schlichter for Town Hall.\n\nSyrian opposition fighters backed by Ankara move towards Syria's northern border on Thursday, a high calibre machine gun mounted on the back of their truck\n\nSyrian opposition fighters backed by Turkey enter Tel Abyad towards Syria in Akcakale in Sanliurfa province on Thursday - Turkey has launched a broad assault on Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria, with intensive bombardment followed by a ground offensive made possible by the withdrawal of US troops\n\nSchlichter took a strong position against abandoning the Kurds last time Trump floated the idea in December last year, but appears to have changed his mind since.\n\nDespite giving his support to Erdogan in their phone call, Trump has since said he thinks attacking the Kurds is a 'bad idea' and warned of 'a big economic price' if Turkey 'doesn't treat Syrian refugees and Kurds humanely'.\n\nHowever, he refused to be drawn on exactly what his red lines would be.\n\nTrump added that Turkey had committed to 'ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place - and we will hold them to this commitment.'\n\nTurkey's defence ministry said Thursday morning that they had struck 181 targets east of the Euphrates River since the incursion started.\n\nThe SDF said Turkish warplanes had caused 'huge panic' when they attacked the Kurdish-held territory, and claimed the bombardments had killed and wounded civilians.\n\nVideo footage released by Turkey's Defence Ministry shows 'hero' commandos moving through fields under cover of darkness and firing rounds after Operation Peace Spring was launched on Wednesday afternoon.", "description": "Donald Trump launched a rambling defence of his decision to pull US troops out of Syria and hand the region over to Turkey on Wednesday night, hours after Erdogan attacked America's Kurdish allies.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19514050-0-The_president_tried_to_reposition_the_ISIS_fighting_Kurds_in_Tur-a-28_1570698799436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
