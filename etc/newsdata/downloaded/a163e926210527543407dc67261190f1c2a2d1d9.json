Clearly both sides know the stakes are high.\u201d\n\nThe agreement to resume negotiations came together Wednesday night, Washington time, when U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve T. Mnuchin talked by phone with China\u2019s lead negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that top trade officials from both sides would meet in early October, but Lighthizer\u2019s office, which is overseeing the talks for President Trump, said only that the parties had agreed to hold meetings in Washington \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nBoth sides noted that deputy-level discussions would take place in mid-September. The USTR said they would \u201clay the ground work for meaningful progress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina had a somewhat different spin on the advance work. \u201cThe two sides agreed that they should work together and take practical actions to create favorable conditions for consultations,\u201d China\u2019s Commerce statement read.\n\nAnalysts said that, for the Chinese, that probably means they want the Trump administration to address the deescalation of various tariffs placed on imported goods from China.\n\nOver the last year and half, Trump has imposed higher tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese merchandise. The latest round, 15% taxes on $110 billion of shoes, clothes, electronics and other consumer goods, took effect on Sunday.\n\nTrump has announced two more rounds of tariffs to pressure the Chinese to make concessions, to buy U.S. farm goods, cut its trade surplus and address structural economic issues. On Oct. 1, previously imposed 25% additional tariffs on $250 billion of mostly industrial products from China will rise to 30%. And on Dec. 15, 15% tariffs will be added to another roughly $170 billion worth of China-made consumer products, including cell phones and laptops.\n\nChina, for its part, has announced retaliatory tariff increases of 5% to 10% on $75 billion of U.S. products, including oil, soybeans and cotton. Beijing also said that on Dec. 15 it would reimpose tariff hikes that had been suspended on American-produced cars and car parts.\n\nAnalysts said it was possible that tariffs slated to take effect Oct. 1 and Dec. 15 could be put on hold if talks look promising.\n\nThe Chinese have made clear that they want a removal of tariffs and relaxation of supplier restrictions that Trump has placed on Huawei Technologies in the name of national security. Huawei is one of China\u2019s top global technology firms and is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment.\n\nExperts said it wasn\u2019t clear to them what Lighthizer and the U.S. side were willing to offer, or what it considered to be \u201cmeaningful progress,\u201d after talks broke down in May and the U.S. team accused China of reneging on previously made agreements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLighthizer has pushed for market access and other structural changes in Beijing\u2019s industrial policies that would level the playing field for American firms. He has insisted that China\u2019s agreement must be enforceable, but Beijing has balked at U.S. pressure to enshrine changes in national law.\n\nLighthizer and Mnuchin last met with Liu and the Chinese negotiating team in late July in Shanghai. But there was little progress made, and upon return from China, Trump promptly announced 10% higher tariffs on about $300 billion of mostly consumer goods from China. Last month he ratcheted that up to 15% and also told U.S. firms to leave China.", "description": "China announced that its trade negotiators will travel to Washington early next month for talks with U.S. counterparts, boosting the chances for a resolution to the tariff war after weeks of uncertainty and escalation.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Don Lee Covers The U.S.", "Global Economy Out Of Washington", "D.C.
