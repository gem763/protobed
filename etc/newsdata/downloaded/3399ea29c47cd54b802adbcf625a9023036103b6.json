I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea that a private entity can create a modern currency.\u201d\n\nHis comments strike a notably different tone to both Facebook, which is developing its Libra digital currency, and competitors.\n\nIn the payments space, Apple is striving for market share with players such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal via Apple Pay.\n\nAll three of those companies have signed up to participate in Libra, despite revelations this week that all may be considering a U-turn.\n\nApple pits itself against bitcoiners\n\nIn addition to jarring with Apple Pay executives on cryptocurrency interest, Cook will likely rile cryptocurrency proponents by believing that governments should control money.\n\nThose who support decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) conversely criticize the way states and central banks corrupt money supply and the backing of fiat currencies.\n\nFor Cook, however, these are exactly the right guardians for economic tools. He noted:\n\n\u201cCurrency, like defence, should remain in the hands of states \u2014 it\u2019s at the heart of their mission. We elect our representatives in order for them to assume the responsibilities of government. Businesses are not elected \u2014 they should not encroach on this space.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 7, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey stated that there are no plans for a platform-specific \u201cTwitcoin\u201d cryptocurrency, noting that he will instead focus on promoting Bitcoin.", "description": "In a recent interview, Tim Cook stated he believes money should remain a matter for governments, not businesses", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGQ2ZTMwYjhlZDhmODgwMDgzNzFkNTJjNTk2MDc3NWQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
