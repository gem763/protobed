Mr. Trump had tweeted Sunday that Alabama was at risk \u2014 something the National Weather Service disputed only 20 minutes later that day.\n\nThe Trump campaign decided to make light of the situation on Thursday, with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeting that Trump marker \"has the special ability to drive CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy!\"\n\nThe black markers, hundreds of sets of which sold shortly after he announced them, come in sets of five for $15.\n\n\"Buy the official Trump marker, which is different than every other marker on the market, because this one has the special ability to drive @CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy! #KeepMarkersGreat\" Parscale tweeted.\n\nOn Thursday, the Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump himself had taken a pen to the map.\n\nThe president has continued to insist that Alabama was in grave danger in NOAA's earlier models.\n\n\"The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida & other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn't). Check out maps...\" the president tweeted Friday morning.\n\n\"Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology,\" Mr. Trump complained in another tweet, claiming that \"This nonsense has never happened to another President.\"", "description": "President Trump is also continuing to defend his claim that Alabama was in grave danger from Hurricane Dorian", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/4bc82de6-7461-48b8-86fd-4549c0783768/thumbnail/1200x630/012687268ba2e8fca3d09668fafe6532/ap-19247669047307.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
