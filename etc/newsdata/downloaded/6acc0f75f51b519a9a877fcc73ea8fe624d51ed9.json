The Wolfpack carried a 13-0 lead to the break.\n\nTrailing 16-3, Syracuse (3-3, 0-2) reached the NC State 20-yard line with more than 10 minutes to play but was thwarted on a fourth-down play.\n\nThe Orange made it to the end zone with three minutes left on DeVito's 2-yard pass to Trishton Jackson.\n\nSyracuse regained possession at its own 24 with 1:47 to play with no timeouts. The Orange reached the NC State 39 before a penalty and a sack.\n\nIt was a big contrast from last season's meeting, when Syracuse won 51-41.\n\nThis time, Syracuse produced 117 total yards in the first half, with 52 of those coming on a pass with 11 seconds to play. That set up Andre Szmyt's missed 44-yard field goal on the last play of the half, with the ball hitting the left upright.\n\nNC State opened the scoring on Christopher Dunn's 32-yard field goal to cap the Wolfpack's first possession. Dunn was good from 43 yards out on the next drive.\n\nSyracuse managed just one first down in four first-quarter possessions.\n\nDunn kicked a field goal from 23 yards in the third quarter to push the lead to 16-0. Szmyt connected from 33 yards out for the Orange's first points with 54 seconds to play in the third quarter.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "North Carolina State's defense kept Syracuse bottled up for most of the game  and the Wolfpack scored the team's only touchdown on a gadget play in a 16-10 ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
