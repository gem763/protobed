It was a Nationals initiative but One Nation claimed the credit.\n\nThis provoked fury among Nationals MPs, especially Queenslanders, who had been lobbying to introduce the code.\n\nFormer leader Barnaby Joyce poured cold water on leadership talks on Tuesday but said there was frustration among the Nationals, be it over the dairy issue or being sidelined by the Prime Minister on drought.\n\n\u2018\u2018What the Nationals get upset with is we drive an agenda, we do so much work in a space, then obviously if Pauline Hanson comes out and announces it, it\u2019s not that she developed the policy, it\u2019s not that she drove the agenda \u2013 we did,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018We were driving forward with that, and the ultimate outcome was that a National party minister has brought this about. Not an independent senator. A National party minister broad the dairy code about.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Senator McKenzie and leader Michael McCormack were safe, he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018You\u2019ll wait forever before the Nationals spill a leader,\u2019\u2019 Mr Joyce said.\n\n\u2018\u2018They don\u2019t do that. It doesn\u2019t happen. So Bridget has my support. Michael has my support.\u2019\u2019\n\nEven inside the Liberal party, there is some discontent with what MPs say is an increasingly dictatorial style of Mr Morrison.\n\nOne described the Prime Minister as \u2018\u2018Caesar\u2019\u2019.\n\nMorale in Labor remains low and there is some low-level quibbling from some MPs about Albanese\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u2018\u2018There\u2019s a dangerous level of sullenness in the party at the moment\u2019\u2019 said one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut many more said that apart from a bit of dissent, \u2018\u2018not a single person is saying we should do something\u2019\u2019.\n\nMr Albanese used his address to caucus to reinforce the decision to back legislation enabling free trade deals with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru, which has caused friction with sections of the union movement.\n\n\"There are a lot of 55-45 calls in this job but this was not one of those, it was a good outcome,'' he said.\n\nOutwardly, the Coalition was on track on Tuesday night to chalk up another success in parliament. Labor was poised to wave through the lower house the big stick legislation, which will allow the forced divestment of energy assets of companies found to be engaging in anti-competitive conduct.", "description": "At the end of a long and arduous year, low-level grumbling about leadership is gnawing away at the major parties.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2248%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_25/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/542b879f0790fdf43a8b5d7e697ea0cf9f86179e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
