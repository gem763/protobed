After deploying aircraft, heat-sensing technology and dog teams, police found the duo\u2019s remains on 8 August.\n\nA coroner later concluded the two suspects had died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.\n\nOn Thursday, Schmegelsky was allowed to watch the clip after signing a non-disclosure agreement, which bars him from speaking about the contents until the investigation concludes.\n\n\u201cWhen he saw the video, of course, he was very emotional,\u201d Sarah Leamon, who represents Alan Schmegelsky, told the Guardian. She described the contents as a \u201clast will and testament\u201d for the fugitive 19-year-old.\n\n\ufeffBryer\u2019s mother had previously seen the video, but police had resisted showing it to Alan, a move Leamon called \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter all, he is Bryer\u2019s father. In my view there was no reason for the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] to have made the unilateral decision to only show it to Bryer\u2019s mother,\u201d said Leamon.\n\nWhile the video has been the subject of scrutiny by the RCMP over the last few weeks, the Globe and Mail has reported that a number of other videos were shot by the two men as they evaded capture.\n\nPolice have previously said they would update the public in the coming weeks about the status of the investigation. However, they have not yet said when further information will be released.", "description": "Police allow father to watch 30-second cellphone video of Bryer Schmegelsky, who was accused of three murders, with Kam McLeod", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b861b6dc92ad95fb4ead29c4bf40075d849f7fb/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa411ae278f40d6e7127e3386a9243ce", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
