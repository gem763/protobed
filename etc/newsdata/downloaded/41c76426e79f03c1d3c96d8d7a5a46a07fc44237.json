And even if I wasn\u2019t doing it, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not doing it.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018It would be horrific. I don\u2019t like heights, I don\u2019t like the dark. I don\u2019t like camping. \u2018That is a good point actually, you can\u2019t make a mess in the jungle because it\u2019s already nature. I couldn\u2019t be tidy in the jungle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s nothing about the show I\u2019d be good at.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
