She was 92. She had been admitted to a hospital in Busan due to age-related illnesses.\n\nCheong Wa Dae spokeswoman Ko Min-jung said a private funeral will be held \"to respect the wishes of the deceased and visitors or flowers are not encouraged.\"\n\nMoon headed to Busan earlier that day to be at his mother's bedside during her final moments.\n\nIn a memoir published in 2011, Moon wrote, \"Although we were poor, my mother often told me that money is not everything. Her lessons have helped me greatly throughout my life.\"\n\nMoon's parents fled from northern Korea to the southern city of Geoje in South Gyeongsang Province in December 1950 in the chaos of the Korean War. He and his mother moved to Busan when he opened his law practice there.", "description": "Moon's Mother Dead at 92", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/30/2019103001303_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
