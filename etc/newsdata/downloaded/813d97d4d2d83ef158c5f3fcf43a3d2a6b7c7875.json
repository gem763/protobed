Add Interest\n\nTaliban attacks have continued unabated even as Afghanistan held presidential elections on Saturday, and weeks after U.S.-led peace talks collapsed.\n\nThe insurgents now control or hold sway over roughly half the country.\n\nThe attack on the Shortepa district headquarters in northern Balkh province started early in the morning, according to Munir Ahmad Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the insurgents had overran the compound.\n\nFarhad denied the claim, saying Afghan security forces were still in control of the district headquarters. He said that Afghan reinforcements drove the Taliban from the area. \"Security situation is under the control right now,\" he added.\n\nThere has been some destruction to the district police chief headquarters, said Farhad.\n\nThe district is very remote, said Mohammad Afzel Hadid, head of the Balkh provincial council. He also confirmed that the Taliban were defeated after reinforcements arrived.\n\nThe Taliban had casualties during the battle, said Hadid, but he couldn't provide any figure.\n\nIn a separate Taliban attack in eastern Ghazni province, at least three civilians were shot and killed by Taliban, said Ahmad Khan Serat, spokesman for the provincial police chief.\n\nHe added that six other civilians were wounded when the Taliban targeted the civilian vehicle traveling from Jaghatu district toward Ghazni city.\n\nThe Taliban did not immediately comment on the attack in Ghazni.\n\nLast week, there were at least 68 attacks by the Taliban across the country during election day, most of them rockets fired from distant outposts. At least five people were killed, including one policeman, and scores more were wounded.\n\nDespite upgraded security, authorities said 431 polling stations stayed closed because it was impossible to guarantee their security since they were either in areas under Taliban control or in places where insurgents could threaten nearby villages.\n\nResults of the vote are not due for weeks.\n\nThe Afghan government was sidelined in the U.S.-Taliban talks, aimed at ending America's longest war. The Taliban have refused to negotiate with Kabul officials as they consider the Afghan government a U.S. puppet.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
