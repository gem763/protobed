Initially, her niece did not want to explain how her hair had been cut, but she eventually told her aunt about the attack. She also said the boys had been bullying her at school and taking her lunch for weeks. According to Allen, her niece was afraid to tell teachers about the incident because she feared retaliation from the boys and also didn\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble.\n\nAllen and the girl\u2019s grandmother, Cynthia Allen, who is the girl\u2019s legal guardian, contacted police on Wednesday and reported the incident to the school. Lakeisha Allen said that in a meeting at the school Thursday, administrators told her they are looking into the incident.\n\n\u201cWe take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse,\u201d Stephen Danish, Immanuel Christian\u2019s head of school, wrote in a statement. \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, the school said it has asked law enforcement to investigate the allegations and referred all questions to the Fairfax County Police Department. In a separate email reply to a Washington Post question, the school said all of the parties involved in the incident are remaining out of school while the police conduct their investigation.\n\nA Fairfax County police representative said an investigation is underway and did not provide a timeline for its conclusion.\n\nImmanuel Christian is a private K-10 National Blue Ribbon school with 469 students. Just under half the pupils are students of color, according to information provided by Immanuel officials. African American students account for 11 percent of the school population. Tuition for middle school students is $11,500. Vice President Pence\u2019s wife, Karen Pence, teaches art part-time at the school to students in grades one through five.\n\nAllen said she wants the boys to be punished for their alleged actions. Her niece agrees that there should be repercussions for the boys but said she also had sympathy for them.\n\n\u201cI felt hurt and angry, but I also felt compassion for them because something must have happened to them and that\u2019s why they bully,\u201d the girl said.\n\nShe said she plans to return to school Monday.", "description": "Fairfax police are investigating after the 12-year-old girl said the boys called her names and cut several of her dreadlocks.", "authors": ["Joe Heim", "Reporter Covering A Range Of Topics", "Including Race", "Schools", "Student Culture", "White Nationalism", "Native American Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
