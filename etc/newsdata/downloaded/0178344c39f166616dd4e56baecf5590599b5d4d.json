Wearing shackles and a suicide vest, a judge set her next court date for Tuesday.\n\nKolts is accused of 24 counts to make, possess, throw, project, place or discharge a destructive device.\n\nParents alerted authorities that she daughter had two dozen pipe bombs at the home in Wimauma, deputies said Friday.\n\nBesides the pipe bombs, deputies found smokeless pistol powder, fuse material, 23 different knives, two hatchets, two BB/pellet type rifles, six BB/pellet type handguns, nunchucks. They also found dozens of books and DVDs on murder, mass killing, domestic terrorism and bomb-making.\n\n\u201cWhat is even more frightening is that each of the pipe bombs contained nails, metallic pellets or a combination of both, and it would have taken less than 60 seconds per device to add the powder and fuse material she already possessed to detonate each device,\u201d Sheriff Chad Chronister said at a news conference Friday.\n\nIn addition, the parents believe she made other pipe bombs that were taken out of the house.\n\nAuthorities has known about her because an online printing company contacted the sheriff\u2019s office that she had ordered several suspicious items. At the time, they determined she was not a serious threat.\n\n\u201cShe became consumed with the Columbine and Oklahoma killings,\u201d Chronister told reporters. \u201cAt that time, she wasn\u2019t diagnosed with any type of mental health diagnosis at the time. She stated, at that time, her intentions were not to harm anyone. Her parents said she was a little on the autism spectrum.\u201d\n\nDeputies contacted Kolts at her job in Tampa on Thursday and she was interviewed at her home. She admitted to making the devices and wanting to hurt others, Chronister said.\n\n\u201cWhile this case is certainly alarming, it\u2019s not to demonize an individual struggling with mental health. It\u2019s to highlight the importance of speaking up when you see something that is not right,\u201d explained Sheriff Chronister. \u201cWe cannot say it enough, if you see something, say something.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 5 (UPI) \u2014 A 27-year-old Central Florida woman was denied bail Saturday after being arrested on charges she made 24 pipe bombs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
