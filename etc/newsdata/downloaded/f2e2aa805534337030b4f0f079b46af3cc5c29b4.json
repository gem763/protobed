But, over recent months, she has had a much quieter time on the show \u2013 and she wants that to change as she has started to feel \u2018bored\u2019.\n\nSpeaking to BANG Showbiz, she said: \u2018I\u2019m not very busy really, just bistro stuff, but not busy with a storyline.\u2019\n\nAsked if she has anything big coming up, she added: \u2018Nothing I know of but hopefully something will come up soon. It\u2019s nice to have some time off but then you think I\u2019m bored now, I\u2019ve just finished college so I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe star has grown up on screen, having started on the show in 2011. Adopted daughter of Anna and Eddie Windass, Faye was eventually introduced to her real dad Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine), who remains on screen.\n\nTim is set to be exposed as a bigamist in a brand new storyline, so no doubt Faye will have something to say on that.\n\nAs for the on/off relationship with Seb, it seems that a reunion in the future is unlikely as the show is reintroducing Seb\u2019s latest love interest Alina Pop (Ruxundra Porojnicu) after she returns having been freed from the slavery ring she was trapped within.\n\nIt remains to be seen what\u2019s to come for Faye but we too reckon it\u2019s about time that she was central to the action again. Over to you, Corrie!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "She'd love a Corrie storyline.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_78908336-e1571736061975_1571736646.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
