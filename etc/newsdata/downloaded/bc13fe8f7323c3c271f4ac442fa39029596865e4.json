But I don\u2019t trust his party, at all, on this issue.\u201d\n\nFresh briefings from Downing Street published as Mr Farage\u2019s musings went live seem to appear to suggest he was right to offer that closing disclaimer, as the Prime Minister has moved to mollify Remain-voting Tory MPs by promising he would not explicitly endorse a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Times reported Thursday that Boris Johnson himself had moved to rule out fighting a general election on the principle of a full, no-deal Brexit if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached, the paper quoting his remarks that he \u201cpassionately\u201d wanted to strike a deal and had \u201cno intention\u201d of making a commitment otherwise.\n\nThe remarks may indicate that the Prime Minister is moving towards the position once held by Theresa May, of striking a deal at almost any cost.\n\nUnited Kingdom, Republic of Ireland Leaders in Last-Minute Meet to Discuss Brexit Deal https://t.co/g87NH4W9CZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2019", "description": "After Nigel Farage expressed renewed optimism in the direction of Brexit, Boris Johnson appeared to rule out a no-deal election platform.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177307971-e1570721194365-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
