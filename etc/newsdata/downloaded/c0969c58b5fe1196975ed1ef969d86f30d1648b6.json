(AP) - Bills coach Sean McDermott took a swipe at Buffalo\u2019s former front office in defending the team\u2019s decision to stand pat at the trade deadline despite having several needs to address.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s not a responsible move for us to make, we\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d McDermott said Wednesday, a day after the deadline passed. \u201cThere\u2019s been way too many years of irresponsible decision-making, let\u2019s just put it that way.\u201d\n\nThough McDermott didn\u2019t mention names, it\u2019s clear he was referring to former general manager Doug Whaley, who was fired a day after completing the 2017 draft.\n\nWhaley was best remembered for trading Buffalo\u2019s 2015 first-round pick to move up five spots in the 2014 draft to select receiver Sammy Watkins fourth overall. Watkins had three inconsistent and injury-shortened seasons in Buffalo before being traded in August 2017.\n\nWhaley was also knocked for handcuffing the team\u2019s payroll structure by signing underperforming players to hefty contracts.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s comments were out of character for a coach who isn\u2019t known for publicly voicing criticism.\n\nThey also revealed how McDermott felt a need address a fanbase clamoring for the Bills to upgrade a team already off to a 5-2 start and preparing to host Washington (1-7) on Sunday.\n\nMcDermott didn\u2019t deny the Bills were open to making trades. The challenge was striking the right deal that fit the team\u2019s short- and long-term needs.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of teams go out there and just do things. And we\u2019re trying to do this the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we didn\u2019t find something that would be responsible for us to do.\u201d\n\nMcDermott and GM Brandon Beane have spent much of the past two years undoing Whaley\u2019s mistakes by purging a roster with just four players remaining from the team that closed the 2016 season.\n\nThe two have stuck to a philosophy of rebuilding through the draft, while not overpaying in free agency. The Bills are projected to still have about $24 million in salary cap space available despite 17 offseason free-agent additions on the roster.\n\nThe Bills aren\u2019t near complete and continue to have several holes to fill, many of which were exposed in a 31-13 loss to Philadelphia last weekend.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s run defense is coming off a game in which it allowed a season-worst 218 yards and three touchdowns rushing. It continues a three-game slide that coincides with second-year tackle Harrison Phillips sustaining a season-ending knee injury.\n\nVeteran linebacker Lorenzo Alexander referred to the run-stopping issues as being correctible.\n\n\u201cWe never want to be dominated the way we were last week,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cWe\u2019ll bounce back. I don\u2019t have any worry in my body about the guys in this locker room.\u201d\n\nOn offense, a Josh Allen-led unit featuring nine new starters continues showing signs of growing pains. Though Buffalo has topped 300 yards six times, it has also scored three or more touchdowns just once.\n\nThe Bills have especially had difficulty finding consistency at their No. 3 receiver spot behind offseason free agent additions John Brown and Cole Beasley.\n\nBeasley said the offense is still finding its identity and noted it might have been counterproductive to add yet another player.\n\n\u201cAdding another new guy would slow things down a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have tons of room to grow, and I think (McDermott and Beane) understand that as well.\u201d\n\nWhaley\u2019s tenure briefly overlapped with McDermott being hired in January 2017, with Beane hired in May.\n\nIf Whaley considered himself a risk-taker, something he acknowledged after trading up to select Watkins, McDermott and Beane haven\u2019t taken many shortcuts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep a strong eye on where you\u2019re trying to go and how you\u2019re trying to get there, and again responsible decision-making,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do what we feel is right for us. And in this case, we felt like standing pat is the right move.\u201d\n\nNOTES: RT Cody Ford (elbow), CB Levi Wallace (shoulder) and S Kurt Coleman (hamstring) were listed as limited in practice. \u2026 OL Victor Salako was signed to the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bills coach Sean McDermott took a swipe at Buffalo's former front office in defending the team's decision to stand pat at the trade deadline despite having several needs to address.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/dolphins_bills_football_70068_c0-217-4964-3112_s1200x700.jpg?bab9eacc3fa55ec968fe70d27f15ac414cc9c1a0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
