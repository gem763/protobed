I'm sure he'll fight again but I don't think he's got the hunger.\n\n'It's hard, look, all of a sudden he's earned some great money, he's prancing around in Los Angeles getting in the ring doing all this cringey stuff with the WWE guys, everyone's loving it - it's brilliant for him.\n\n'He's got the Robbie Williams thing, good luck to him.\n\n'I don\u2019t believe he has the same hunger, that he had, well certainly pre-Klitschko, but even pre-Wilder. As long as he's happy and healthy good luck to him, I think he's hilarious.'\n\nFury's last fight was in Las Vegas against Otto Wallin, who he beat via unanimous decision, although he suffered some nasty facial wounds.\n\nLast December he challenged Wilder for his WBC strap and survived two knockdowns to claim a draw, although many believe the British heavyweight should have won on points.", "description": "The 31-year-old from Manchester has seen a potential rematch with WBC champion Deontay Wilder disappear and has instead decided to dip his toes into the world of WWE wrestling.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/14/19956846-0-image-a-15_1571578284756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
