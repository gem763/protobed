USA TODAY\n\nThe Washington Nationals will be without their top reliever and closer for Game 1 of the National League Championship Series.\n\nDaniel Hudson was placed on paternity leave just hours before Friday's first pitch against the Cardinals in St. Louis. Hudson is allowed to be away from the club for a minimum of one day and a maximum of three days, but Nationals manager Dave Martinez said they hope to have him back for Game 2 on Saturday.\n\n\"The baby didn't want to come out until later this morning,\" said Martinez. \"I told him, 'Hey, family's first. We get it.' The baby wasn't ready to come out.\"\n\nIt's a big loss for the Nationals. Hudson has been one of the most reliable arms out of a bullpen that ranks last in the league in ERA.\n\nIn four postseason appearances, he has two saves and has not allowed an earned run. He earned the save in the wild-card game and in the Game 5 NLDS victory against the Dodgers.\n\nRoenis Elias, who has missed several games with a hamstring injury, and Javy Guerra have been added after not being on the NLDS roster. Hunter Strickland is not on the roster.\n\nIn his absence, pitcher Wander Suero will replace Hudson on the active list.\n\nContributing: Gabe Lacques in St. Louis", "description": "Nationals closer Daniel Hudson was placed on paternity leave Friday and will not be with the team for Game 1 of the NLCS against the Cardinals.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published P.M.
