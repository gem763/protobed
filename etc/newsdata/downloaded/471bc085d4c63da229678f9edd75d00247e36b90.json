I think that would facilitate the decision on our side if we know that there would be elections, there would be a referendum, there would be [..] a deal and there is time needed for ratification.\"\n\nH\u00fcbner also confirmed that a European Parliament resolution at the plenary next week is likely to support an extension, paving the way for the EU Commission to offer one once leaders have signed off on such an agreement.\n\n\"We will probably support the request for the extension, but it would have to be justified. We have a new parliament, we don't know how it will look, but we are confident that we will have the support,\" she said.\n\nHowever, H\u00fcbner said that the UK would be expected to continue participating as a fully-fledged member state for as long as it remained in the bloc.\n\nBoris Johnson has said he would rather \"die in a ditch\" than ask the EU to delay the UK's scheduled departure date from the EU on October 31.\n\nBut the House of Commons last week passed a Bill which means he is legally obliged to request an extension if he fails to secure a deal after a crunch summit of European leaders on October 18.\n\nThat has led to speculation that he will either resign, paving the way for a different leader to request an extension, or perform a dramatic U-turn and ask Brussels to extend the UK's exit date until January.\n\nFrance threatens to veto third extension\n\nNot all member states are enthusiastic about the prospect of a third extension to Brexit.\n\nThe French government, which has taken the most hardline approach to Brexit of the 27 remaining member states, last week threatened to veto an extension due to a \"worrying\" lack of progress in talks.\n\nJean-Yves Le Drian, France's foreign minister, said the lack of realistic proposals Johnson had put forward were a sign it was not serious about talks.\n\n\"It's very worrying. The British must tell us what they want,\" Le Drian said.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, also threatened to veto an extension in March\n\nAsked about the prospect of an extension beyond October 31, he said: \"We are not going to do this [extend the deadline] every three months.\"", "description": "The EU is likely to offer the UK a third Brexit extension, according to a senior member of the European Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9322/069c07c6974144e0a2eebbbafadd2973.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
