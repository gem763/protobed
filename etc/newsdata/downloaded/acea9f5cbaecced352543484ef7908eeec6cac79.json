(AP) - The U.S. Army is defending a decision to close its historic 57-year-old space and technical library at Redstone Arsenal.\n\nArmy officials said it was a joint decision made by interested parties.\n\nThe Redstone Scientific Information Center, or RSIC, closed its doors Sept. 30, Al.com reported. The center was established in 1962 by a charter between the Army and NASA. It was overseen by a board of directors made up of senior leaders and scientists at Redstone\u2019s various missile organizations.\n\nDr. Wernher von Braun and Maj. Gen. Francis \u201cFrank\u201d McMorrow agreed to build the original facility, which held information about rocketry and space science used to advance United States rocket programs.\n\nIn a statement released this week, the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation & Missile Center, or AvMC, said the collection had become too big and expensive to maintain.\n\n\u201cThe sheer size of the collection - approximately 450,000 items - demanded an increase in space requirements,\u201d the statement said. But it added decreased funding and resources have made it untenable to continue managing the library.\n\nAvMC said the library is now virtual and \u201cconsists of online-only access to scientific journals and e-books\u201d plus electronic versions of technical documents. The e-documents will not be fully available until July 2021.\n\nAs for the rest, NASA documents were returned to NASA and \u201cexcess library materials\u201d will be offered to other Defense Department or government libraries first locally and then outside Huntsville. The Army\u2019s statement said there are \u201cno plans at this time to create another local library approaching the size and scope of RSIC for the entire Redstone Arsenal community.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center said it \u201chas acquired selected books and other documents from RSIC and is in the process of developing an on-site library, which will be a branch of the NASA agency-wide library system.\u201d\n\nMarshall said its employees will \u201chave access to RSIC\u2019s online subscriptions through spring 2020.\u201d After that, \u201cthe NASA agency on-line library will provide subscriptions for all centers including Marshall.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. Army is defending a decision to close its historic 57-year-old space and technical library at Redstone Arsenal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
