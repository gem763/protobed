That\u2019s why, for National Women\u2019s Health & Fitness Day on Sept. 25, we asked the most popular fitness gurus to share the truth about #fitspo (Chipotle and good lighting are often necessary).\n\nComfy gym clothes are treasured.\n\nFitness motivator, model, and entrepreneur Jen Selter went viral in 2013 when she took a spontaneous photo of her backside, unofficially inventing the \u201cBelfie\u201d (a butt selfie). The 26 year old has since been signed by talent agency PMG Sports; she sells her own line of protein bars; and is a featured athlete on Fitplan App, a fitness workout and personal trainer app. Oh, and Selter has 12.7 million Instagram followers (with a combined 38 million people on social media).\n\nThe former gym receptionist often films her workouts on her own New York City rooftop, telling Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cBefore moving into a building, I make sure it has a great gym and common area, or it is really a deal-breaker for me.\u201d\n\nHowever, fame follows. \u201cI don\u2019t like being recognized when I am working out, so I usually wear undercover outfits. I find it very comfortable to wear Alo yoga joggers, sweats, and a big hoodie or T-shirt,\u201d Selter tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWhen I am not filming, you won't find me in a crop top!\u201d\n\nInjuries happen.\n\nRebecca Louise of the BURN program has 607,000 Instagram followers counting her every move. So when her active lifestyle leads to injury, she doesn\u2019t let that distract her from helping people reach their goals.\n\nFor instance, in 2017, Louise suffered an ACL tear while skiing with her boyfriend. \u201cWe still had to fly to Hawaii to film a contracted video shoot,\u201d Louise tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cSo I wore a hot and sticky knee brace under my leggings.\u201d\n\nAs a work-around, Louise dedicated six full weeks to upper-body workouts. \u201cMy customers had really buff arms by the end,\u201d Louise tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nAnother time, Louise was filming in Los Angeles (near her Huntington Beach home) and caught an itchy full-body rash from an unknown plant. \u201cI was covered in red marks,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe crew gave me Benadryl to relieve the pain but it made me incredibly drowsy \u2014 I could barely keep my eyes open.\u201d\n\nPlus-size fitness experts don\u2019t always feel so body-positive.\n\nPersonal trainer Roz \u201cThe Diva\u201d Mays is often seen wearing little more than a sports bra or a bikini, but don\u2019t make assumptions because she\u2019s curvy.\n\n\u201cPeople view me as the patron saint of body love,\u201d Mays, also a certified pole instructor with 44K Instagram followers, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019m called \u2018inspirational\u2019 and \u2018brave\u2019 because I wear skimpy workout clothes. But exercise is my comfort zone.\u201d\n\nCharacterizing plus-size fitness experts as bastions of body-positivity is stereotypical. \u201cPeople are well-intentioned,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it feels patronizing to always hear, \u2018How do you have the nerve to wear that?\u2019\u201d\n\nMays says the awestruck comments can sometimes contradict her own feelings about her body. \u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t like the way I look, but I am excited about what I can do.\u201d\n\nMother Nature can make or break a workout.\n\nKatrina Scott and Karena Dawn of the Tone It Up franchise met 11 years ago at \u2014 where else \u2014 a gym in Manhattan Beach, Calif. They became best friends, and then launched a fitness app, nutrition plan, and global tour series, gaining 1.4 million Instagram followers to date.\n\nBut striving for beautiful outdoor backdrops means you\u2019re at the mercy of the elements. During a shoot in Turks and Caicos, the women were exercising on a beach in unbearable heat. \u201cThe humidity was so strong \u2014 our bodies were cooking,\u201d Scott tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe camera crew was filming with umbrellas over their heads and jumping into the ocean to cool off in between takes.\u201d\n\nThe humidity was too much for Scott, who dry-heaved and collapsed on the sand, just before the wind blew the women\u2019s yoga mats away. Between calloused feet, the blinding sun, and friction from the rough sand, exercising on the beach did a number on the women\u2019s bodies.
