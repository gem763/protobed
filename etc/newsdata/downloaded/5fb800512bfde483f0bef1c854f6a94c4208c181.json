As a result, people often required gentle persuasion to accept the post.\n\nJohn Bercow was dragged to the chair in 2009 but would\u2019ve stomped barefoot over broken light-bulbs to have got there. He couldn\u2019t wait to park his rump on that plump cushion and start making his diminutive presence felt\n\nControversial Bercow had an anti-Brexit sticker on the windscreen of his Land Rover\n\nHow times change. The position is now a plum posting.\n\nJohn Bercow was dragged to the chair in 2009 but would\u2019ve stomped barefoot over broken light-bulbs to have got there. He couldn\u2019t wait to park his rump on that plump cushion and start making his diminutive presence felt.\n\nJudging by the obsequious send-off he was afforded at his final session of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions yesterday, a heavy-duty winch may now be required to remove him when he relinquishes his throne today.\n\nTributes slurped round the chamber like dollops of Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup. In turn, His Speakership smiled bashfully, a flattened palm resting against a heavily blood-vesselled cheek.\n\nMainly though, he nodded his head like a pampered prince being slobbered over by a particularly gushing courtier. \u2018Quite so! Quite so!\u2019 How he will miss this weekly opportunity to self-preen.\n\nFor what is supposed to be a grilling of the Prime Minister increasingly became The John Bercow Show. Although the son of a down-to-earth London taxi-driver, somewhere along the way he has affected the manner and linguistic stylisms of a powder-wigged Regency fop.\n\nJudging by the obsequious send-off he was afforded at his final session of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions yesterday, a heavy-duty winch may now be required to remove him when he relinquishes his throne today\n\nThose who tune into PMQs will have noticed that for him no word is too opaque, no phrase in his peculiarly orotund repertoire is too ornate.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not remotely interested in your pettifogging objection chuntered inelegantly from a sedentary position,\u2019 has been a popular retort. Similarly, referring to male MPs as \u2018young man\u2019 \u2013 even those several years his senior.\n\nOften such remarks are meant as put-downs, designed to humiliate. Regular targets are those on the government benches. During the general election debate, for example, he adopted a tone with Vicky Ford (Con, Chelmsford) which was so unnecessarily dismissive it made me wince. It may be no coincidence that Ford had previously objected to Bercow\u2019s behaviour.\n\nAnother complaint is that he allowed the half-hour PMQs slot to drag on. Yesterday, it lasted 75 minutes, surely a record.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s tribute to the at-last-departing Speaker was a vial of cyanide wrapped inside a chocolate bon-bon. Sweet and lovely on the outside, pure poison in the middle.\n\nHe said the tennis-fan Speaker had presided not just as an umpire with a \u2018Tony Montana scowl\u2019 but as \u2018a player in his own right\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the Scarface mobster and an allusion to Bercow having overstepped the mark with his needless interferences.\n\nBercow's wife Sally, left, and their children were in Parliament yesterday to witness his final PMQs before he stands down as speaker\n\nJohnson noted how Bercow had spread his opinions like \u2018an uncontrollable tennis-ball machine delivering a series of literally unplayable and formally unreturnable volleys and smashes.\u2019 Translation: He\u2019s also a bully.\n\nAlso, his habit of letting sessions over-run and which had \u2018stretched time more than Stephen Hawking\u2019. Johnson ribbed him, too, for failing to honour his pledge to stand down last year, saying Bercow\u2019s farewell had taken longer than Frank Sinatra\u2019s.\n\nBercow roared with laughter but then why not, as he was yet again the centre of attention.\n\nJeremy Corbyn predictably laid the grease on thick. He praised Bercow for his promotion of LBGT rights. There was a snippy mention of how he\u2019d made the Commons less of a palatial club and he made an overly chummy reference to their mutual support of Arsenal Football Club.\n\nCorbyn incidentally, was in pretty good voice, as he has been ever since deciding to back an election. Whether this was his eagerness for power or because he might be moved to quieter pastures by Christmas isn\u2019t yet clear.\n\nJeremy Corbyn predictably laid the grease on thick. He praised Bercow for his promotion of LBGT rights. There was a snippy mention of how he\u2019d made the Commons less of a palatial club and he made an overly chummy reference to their mutual support of Arsenal Football Club\n\nScottish Nationalists\u2019 leader Ian Blackford said the tartan welcome mat would always be laid out for Bercow. Good old Blackers.\n\nWhat a ludicrous braggard he is. He spoke as if he sits on Hadrian\u2019s Wall with a crown and sceptre deciding who comes in and out of Scotland.\n\nA love-in followed with Sir Kenneth Clarke (Con, Rushcliffe). Appearing in his own last PMQs, he hoped Bercow\u2019s successor would live up to his \u2018considerable achievements\u2019. Sir Ken didn\u2019t say he wished they would continue to thwart Brexit but that\u2019s what he meant. Bercow returned the compliment. \u2018I, for one, want to salute him. He is a great man.\u2019\n\nHis Speakership spoke as if his own imprimatur was the highest accolade anyone could receive.\n\nThe Labour benches, who\u2019ve delighted in Clarke\u2019s rudeness towards Boris since he became Prime Minister, burst into applause.\n\nGush followed gush.\n\nThose who tune into PMQs will have noticed that for him no word is too opaque, no phrase in his peculiarly orotund repertoire is too ornate. The speaker his pictured here with Keith Vaz\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville-Roberts, with a voice like a sozzled duchess, murmured in Welsh: \u2018I do not think we will see your like again, and we will miss you in this House\u2019. Many of us wondered what the Welsh was for \u2018pass the sickbag\u2019. Ronnie Campbell (Lab, Blythe Valley) called Bercow a \u2018canny laddy\u2019. Sir John Hayes (Con, South Holland and the Deeping) praised his \u2018encyclopaedic grasp of detail.\u2019\n\nObserving all this in the visitors\u2019 gallery were the Speaker\u2019s wife Sally and their three young children. When Bercow turned to address them, his voice quivered. \u2018I will never forget it,\u2019 he gurgled. \u2018And I will always be grateful for it.\u2019\n\nCue more Labour applause. Add glissando violin strings. Gently fade out. Roll end credits.\n\nAll that was left was for the Speaker to announce he had appointed a new house chaplain to replace Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is to be ordained as the Bishop of Dover. This was just days after he told MPs how he\u2019d originally appointed Hudson-Wilkin despite opposition from \u2018various bigots and racists\u2019.\n\nWith one final primp, he enunciated: \u2018I was right and they were wrong.\u2019\n\nHow John Bercow would love that phrase to be carved in stone on a statue of himself.", "description": "John Bercow was dragged to the chair in 2009 but would've stomped barefoot over broken light-bulbs to have got there.
