So you kind of feel a sense of responsibility to represent that as authentically as possible\", Zellweger said.\n\n\"And then the rest was pretty difficult to know because we're talking about very private moments that haven't been shared and it's sort of an interpretation of what the experiences of the person who was living under those circumstances at that time might be like\".\n\nZellweger is known for method acting, where she doesn't break character even when a scene is finished filming - a trait that helped her fellow cast members inhabit Garland's world too.\n\nWittrock didn't even recognize his co-star the first time he saw her in character.\n\n\"From kind of that point on until the end, I very rarely saw this Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, you know? I hung out with Judy,\" he told Reuters Television.\n\nZellweger's performance has received positive reviews.\n\n\"Ren\u00e9e was perfect because she's a great actress, but also she sings, she's very funny and she has a big heart,\" said Rupert Goold, the director of the film. \"Audiences feel they know Ren\u00e9e at a certain level, that she's one of them. And I think that's a very Garland-like quality.\"\n\n\"Judy\" is released in the US on September 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Dennis Porter; writing by Moira Warburton; Editing by Michael Perry)", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger said she felt a \"sense of responsibility\" to portray the late singer Judy Garland as authentically as possible in the movie \"Judy,\" which was shown at the Toronto Film Festival on Tuesday to a standing ovation.
