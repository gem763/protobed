It takes effort, but consumers should be empowered to limit their usage.\n\nInformation used to be scarce. Now it\u2019s plentiful, to put it mildly. What\u2019s scarce now? Attention, specifically your attention. And lots of people want to seize it, monetize it and commodify it.\n\nThat was the topic of a program at Princeton University where I spoke last week, presented by Princeton\u2019s James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. Princeton assigns its incoming freshman a book to read over the summer, and this year it was former Google executive James Williams\u2019 book, \"Stand out of our Light: Freedom and Resistance in the Attention Economy.\"\n\nWilliams, who has had second thoughts about his work at Google, thinks that many tech companies see their users as a form of prey \u2014 or maybe herd animals would be a better metaphor. Our attention is lured in via clickbait and algorithmic jiggery-pokery that\u2019s designed to keep us emotionally stirred and engaged (which mostly means angry) and then monetized to make tech companies rich.\n\nCommodifying-manufactured outrage\n\nThis, Williams argues, has negative effects. Quoting poet Theodore Roethke he says, \u201cA mind too active is no mind at all.\u201d Yet social media and other tech platforms are designed \u2014 deliberately \u2014 to keep us in such a state, too busy reacting to the latest fad or outrage (it\u2019s usually outrage) to actually think.\n\nReynolds: I deleted my Twitter account. It's a breeding ground for thoughtlessness and contempt.\n\nWilliams writes, \u201cThe most visible and consequential form of compromised \u2018daylight\u2019 we see in the digital attention economy is the prevalence and centrality of moral outrage. Moral outrage consists of more than just anger: It also includes the impulse to judge, punish and shame someone you think has crossed a moral line. ... Moral outrage played a useful role earlier in human evolution when people lived in small nomadic groups: It enabled greater accountability, cooperation and in-group trust. However, the amplification of moral outrage on a societal, or even global, scale carries dire implications for the pursuit of politics worth having. In the past, when we lived in environments of information scarcity, all the world\u2019s moral transgressions weren\u2019t competing for our attention.\u201d\n\nWilliams adds, \u201cWhen children behave like this toward one another, we use words like \u2018cyberbullying\u2019 or \u2018harassment.\u2019 Yet when it\u2019s adults doing the shaming and threatening, we\u2019re inclined to shrug our shoulders, or even cheer it as \u2018karma,\u2019 \u2018sweet, sweet revenge,\u2019 or \u2018justice in the court of public opinion.\u2019 But it isn\u2019t any of those things. It\u2019s nothing more \u2014 and nothing less \u2014 than mob rule, a digital Salem.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right, of course. One needn\u2019t look far to see that today\u2019s social media seems to keep people angrier, more reactive and less thoughtful than we used to be. (And it\u2019s not as if people were paragons of reflective virtue beforehand.)\n\nIndeed, the consensus at my program seemed to be that things are actually even worse than Williams says they are. And as Julie M. Albright argues in her new (and excellent) book, \"Left To Their Own Devices: How Digital Natives are Reshaping the American Dream,\" people are becoming increasingly tethered to their smartphones and increasingly untethered from each other and from the real world.\n\nWhat do we do?\n\nIn my own recent book, \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" I suggest a number of societal and regulatory responses, including antitrust regulation of the Big Tech platforms and a new policy on the part of employers, etc., not to overreact to social media mobs, most of which disperse as fast as they formed. But what should we do as individuals?\n\nSmartphone (Photo: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPersonally, I quit Twitter. For me at least, it was the most addictive yet also most unsatisfying social medium. If lushly illustrated sites like Instagram are the equivalent of a fancy Las Vegas casino with chandeliers, free champagne and elegant carpeting, Twitter is the social media equivalent of a row of gas station slot machines being repetitively worked by emaciated, chain-smoking senior citizens.\n\nFor other people, the most stress-inducing platform might be Instagram \u2014 everyone looks so beautiful and fit, even it if is partly due to Photoshop \u2014 or maybe Facebook \u2014 why are their kids doing so much better than mine? Or maybe it\u2019s Tinder, for reasons that should be obvious. These don\u2019t particularly bother me, because I don\u2019t compare myself with other people much, but others\u2019 experiences are different.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley: We might be better off if Facebook, Instagram and Twitter vanished\n\nAnd that\u2019s my first piece of advice: Pick the social media platform that you find most stressful, and quit it. Don\u2019t quit social media or your phone cold turkey. Just quit one platform. If you\u2019re like me with Twitter, you\u2019ll be surprised how your stress level drops.\n\nNext, start limiting your exposure to the others. Don\u2019t quit, just establish \u201cphone free\u201d time. (I put my phone on the charger at night and sit down with a book and a drink for some quiet time each night before bed.) Again, you\u2019ll probably be surprised how much you enjoy the quiet.\n\nLimit your kids\u2019 exposure, too, if you have kids. One panelist noted that she doesn\u2019t let her 15-year-old daughter have a smartphone. Rather than resenting it, the daughter seems happy to miss out on all the social media drama among her schoolmates. Remember, what social media companies are selling is your attention. Why give them more of it than they deserve?\n\nNone of these steps will change the world. But they may change your life for the better. Sometimes, that\u2019s enough.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
