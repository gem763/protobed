Of the 1000 bricks he saved, he has successfully given almost 500 of them to the families and fans.\n\nA teenager has saved 1000 bricks from a memorial wall at West Ham's old stadium from being turned into rubble as he attempts to return them all to the families who sponsored them\n\nWhen Hammers fan Jonjo Heuerman, from Kent, learnt that his beloved club's home was going to be torn down, including a memorial wall, he refused to let the memories of hundreds of fans be condemned to landfill.\n\nThe hero teen's mum, Donna, 52, has been lumbered with the bricks in her back garden for almost a year but says her son is doing something 'so wonderful' that if needed she would happily house 1000 more.\n\nJonjo said: 'When I found out that the wall was going to be demolished it just seemed like such a waste of these bricks that meant so much to so many people.\n\n'I built a good relationship with the construction company and they said they would save as many of them as they could.\n\n'I had them delivered to West Ham United Supporters Club where they were initially stored. When the old Supporters Club building was mothballed, they were moved to our house and we have been working through them ever since.\n\nJonjo and his mum have kept the 1,000 bricks in their garage after the West Ham Supporters Club closed last year\n\nWest Ham moved from their home of 112 years, the Boleyn Ground, in 2016 to the former Olympic Stadium in Stratford\n\nGraffiti is seen outside the stadium during the demolition of West Ham's Boleyn Ground in 2017\n\n'I created a group on Facebook and started to invite West Ham fans from all over the country, I posted pictures of the bricks looking for the families they were inscribed for.\n\n'I didn't expect to get any returns but so many people have come forward, and we now arrange collection days and deliveries where we can.\n\n'We arrange for around 50 bricks to be picked up at one time and the most amazing part is hearing the stories behind each brick, it makes it all worthwhile.\n\n'One story that really sticks out is a lady who lost her 8 year old grandson to a car accident when on his way to his friend's house.\n\n'They had a brick placed in his name nearly 20 years ago and she said it was like she had been given a piece of him back.\n\n'It was a really emotional moment and it showed us that these bricks might seem like nothing to someone, but everything to someone else.'\n\nJonjo Heuerman has been fundraising since he was eight and has been honoured by the royal family for raising almost \u00a3350,000 for The Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK. He is pictured returning a brick to the family of Gary Miller\n\nJonjo Heuerman contacted the construction company and asked to have the bricks sent to him so he could reunite the families with the bricks they had inscribed\n\nDonna added: 'I can't say I was thrilled to have 1000 bricks in my garden, but when I knew why I was all for it.\n\n'He has been fundraising since he was eight and has been honoured by the royal family for raising almost \u00a3350,000 for The Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK.\n\n'This was a bigger job than usual when it comes to his fundraising but I'm really enjoying it and I so very proud of Jonjo.\n\n'He lost his grandmother to bowel cancer when he was eight and has been raising money for the charity ever since.'\n\nIt was in 2017 when Jonjo realised that a cherished wall in his favoured football club would be torn down, each brick of the wall was inscribed to commemorate a fan of the club, mostly when they had passed, but sometimes to mark their first game or as a gift from a family member.\n\nHe contacted the construction company and asked to have the bricks sent to him so he could reunite the families with the bricks they had inscribed.\n\nIt took a couple of months but one day he finally received confirmation that 1000 bricks have been saved and he could arrange for them to be delivered to him.\n\nWhen the Supporters Club closed he realised he didn't have anywhere to put this bricks he asked his mum if he could store them in the back garden whilst he continued to find the owners of each brick.\n\nJonjo said: 'I couldn't just let them go to waste, I knew that each brick told a story about a person I would have been friends with if I had known them, we all support the Hammers.\n\n'West Ham United had replicated the inscriptions onto new stones at The London Stadium but the original bricks carried so much sentiment.'\n\nDonna added: 'It was a shock of course, but I couldn't say no, I knew why we had to take them, and I supported my son.'\n\nSince the delivery, in 2017, he has reunited families from all over the country, and in other parts of the world, with their cherished inscribed bricks.\n\nHe set up a Facebook group and started inviting West Ham fans from all over, posting pictures of the bricks and hoped that he would get some responses from the families the bricks were laid for.\n\nJonjo was inundated with responses from people who wanted to claim the bricks.\n\nJonjo said: 'It's such a pleasure to meet these people.\n\n'Everyone has a story and each one is as unique as the last, I figure that if I can give 1000 families a piece of their history then it's all worth it.\n\n'I'm a huge believer in doing the right thing, and this feels right.'\n\nDonna added: 'We've still got a long way to go but so far it's going well, and the bricks can stay for as long as they need.'", "description": "West Ham fan Jonjo Heuerman, from Kent, decided it was up to him to save the bricks dedicated to Hammer fans after the club said they could not save them during their old ground's demolition.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19986544-0-image-a-23_1571654536035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
