Last week the US even bombed its own base, between Ain Issa and Kobani near the Turkish border, as part of the hasty pullback.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Esper revealed that the Pentagon was actually considering repositioning American troops and mechanised forces, which include armoured vehicles and tanks, to help its Kurdish allies ward off Isis around the oil fields.\n\nAt a news conference at Nato headquarters in Brussels, Mr Esper did not provide details about the number of troops.\n\n\u201cWe are now taking some actions ... to strengthen our position at Deir Ezzor, to ensure that we can deny Isis access to the oil fields,\u201d Mr Esper said.\n\n\u201cWe are reinforcing that position, it will include some mechanised forces,\u201d he added.\n\nAs the perfect illustration of Mr Trump\u2019s back-and-forth on the Syria issue, the president issued a eries of tweets on Friday that conflated all of his positions. \u201dGoing well! Isis secured by Kurds with Turkey ready as backup,\u201d he tweeted, despite Kurdish fears over the status of the camps holding Isis members and their families. \u201cI simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED!\u201d the president added, despite the announcement that US positions in Syria would be strengthened with more troops.\n\n....COMING HOME! We were supposed to be there for 30 days - That was 10 years ago. When these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\nKurdish commander Mervan Qamishli told The Independent Kurdish forces welcomed the move after originally feeling betrayed at the US withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThe US presence is good as it is cooperation to eliminate Isis terrorism and stops foreign ambitions from Syria, Iran or any others,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe stand with any initiative and from any entity if it\u2019s serving the north Syrian people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has dramatically flip-flopped on its strategy in northern Syria, where for four years it had been fighting alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to defeat Isis.\n\nIn a surprise announcement earlier this month the US president announced a pull back, saying US forces would step aside and not hinder an imminent Turkish attack on Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nDays later Ankara launched its controversial cross-border incursion against the Kurds, which has displaced more than 200,000 and seen at least 100 Isis fighters break free from Kurdish-run prisons in the fighting.\n\nMr Trump, who was accused of effectively green-lighting the operation, defended his decision saying he wanted to disentangle the US from decades of war in the Middle East and bring troops home.\n\nCaught in the crossfire, hundreds of US soldiers were hastily redeployed to Iraq. Shortly afterwards, jets wiped out US military position at the Lafarge Cement Factory, between Ain Issa and Kobani near the Turkish border in the retreat.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Trump backed a Russia-Turkey brokered ceasefire in Syria and confirmed US troops \u201cwere getting out\u201d.\n\nHe urged Syria\u2019s neighbours to take on the mantle of securing the Middle East, adding: \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\u201d\n\nBut amid fears Isis could stage a comeback, the US also confirmed it planned to maintain a small 200-strong foreign the southern city of Tanf as well as a small force to guard the oil fields in the north.\n\nMr Esper said his Turkish counterpart had told him that Ankara had recaptured some of 100 Isis militants who are believed to have escaped from prison in Syria as a result of the Turkish incursion.", "description": "The United States is set to deploy hundreds of troops and tanks to guard oil fields in northeast Syria from Isis fighters in another U-turn on President Trump\u2019s original promise to \u201cbring soldiers home\u201d.The change in plan was confirmed in part by US defence secretary Mark Esper on Friday, who admitted", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eP8KZQfffNg1iIQaYOQOOA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/26fa3d0ab2e14bdf985c2afe07681975", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
