We didn\u2019t want to be sort of railroaded, not into a circus as such, but a meeting we weren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d Tim Dunn said earlier this month.", "description": "British police officers will reportedly interview the wife of a U.S. diplomat who was allegedly involved in a car crash that killed a teen in August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/british_us_flags_01212019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
