Photo: FADEL SENNA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, a 28-year-old Moroccan journalist was sentenced to a year in prison for an abortion that she denies ever getting, in a case that critics have condemned as part of a concerted effort to suppress journalists\u2019 critical coverage of the government, the Guardian reports.\n\nOver the past month, the prosecution of Hajar Raissouni \u2014 as well as of her fianc\u00e9, Rifaat al-Amin \u2014 has sparked nationwide outrage. On August 31, Raissouni and al-Amin were arrested after leaving a gynecologist\u2019s office in the capital of Morocco, where abortion is illegal in nearly all cases. Raissouni claims she wasn\u2019t there to terminate a pregnancy; instead, she says she was visiting the doctor to get a blood clot removed. During the trial, a lawyer for her doctor provided medical evidence regarding Raissouni\u2019s hormone levels that further demonstrated she had not undergone an abortion.\n\nNevertheless, the couple was put on trial, and each was sentenced to a year in prison: Raissouni for \u201chaving an illegal abortion and sexual relations outside marriage,\u201d al-Amin for being complicit. (Premarital sex is also outlawed in Morocco.) Additionally, the doctor who treated Raissouni \u2014 who says he did not perform an abortion on her \u2014 was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nWhile most abortions are outlawed in Morocco, the Guardian reports that they\u2019re not often prosecuted, but that \u201ccharges involving a person\u2019s personal life are sometimes used by the Moroccan authorities to push back on individuals seen as too critical, including journalists and members of the political opposition.\u201d Critics says that Raissouni was unfairly persecuted for her writing at the independent outlet Akhbar al Yaoum, where she covered unrest in northern Morocco.\n\n\u201cA blatant injustice, a flagrant violation of human rights, and a frontal attack on individual freedoms,\u201d Ahmed Benchemsi, a Human Rights Watch communications director, said of the sentencing on Twitter. \u201cThis is a black day for freedom in Morocco.\u201d (On the Reporters Without Borders\u2019 World Press Freedom Index, Morocco ranks 135 out of 180 countries.)\n\nBut throughout her Monday court appearance, Raissouni remained steely-eyed, the New York Times reports \u2014 even as her friends erupted in tears upon hearing the verdict. Leaving the courthouse, she still didn\u2019t appear dejected. Instead, as she walked into a group of frazzled-looking law-enforcement officers, she threw up a peace sign.\n\nDon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down pic.twitter.com/twqoYLfb2t \u2014 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0634\u0629 (@Lfreksha) September 30, 2019\n\nStay in touch.
