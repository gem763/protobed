But Brydge says that isn\u2019t true: it hasn\u2019t actually heard from Libra\u2019s creator, and the Kickstarter campaign hasn\u2019t responded to Brydge\u2019s attempts to reach out.\n\nBrydge filed a lawsuit last week alleging that the Libra keyboard, which attaches to an iPad Pro to turn it into something that closely resembles a MacBook Pro, violates a patent it owns and relies on for its own iPad keyboards.\n\nSentis wants to \u201creach an agreement to benefit both companies,\u201d but Brydge says it\u2019s heard nothing\n\nBut there was some confusion in the lawsuit: there\u2019s almost no information out there about the company behind the Kickstarter campaign, named Sentis. So instead, Brydge sued Kickstarter as well as a company named OGadget, which it believed may actually be behind the Libra keyboard. OGadget later told The Verge that it was hired to do marketing for the Libra keyboard, but that it does not make the device.\n\nSentis, through the Kickstarter campaign for Libra, told backers that it has not \u201creceived any official claims from Brydge.\u201d That\u2019s possible, given that Brydge did not sue Sentis. Though that partly seems to be because Brydge doesn\u2019t know how. (Sentis also appears to be based in China, unlike Kickstarter and OGadget.)\n\nSentis adds \u201cHopefully, we can reach an agreement to benefit both companies.\u201d But despite claiming to be in communications with Brydge, Brydge says it has not heard from Sentis and has not received any responses from the company.\n\nThe Verge has also not heard back from Sentis in response to three messages sent last week. We\u2019ve reached out again to Sentis on Kickstarter and by email to two different addresses.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign for Libra has grown a small amount since Brydge\u2019s claims were made public on Thursday. It\u2019s added around $5,000 and 60 backers \u2014 to around $225,000 and 1,760 total \u2014 but it appears to have lost a number of backers as well. Several backers left comments about the Brydge lawsuit before canceling their pledge.\n\nLibra\u2019s keyboard stands out from other iPad keyboard attachments thanks to its inclusion of a trackpad. Apple added mouse and trackpad support to iPadOS last month \u2014 support is fairly basic and is buried inside of accessibility settings, but it\u2019s there for those who want it. Sentis is one of the first companies out the door offering a keyboard with a working trackpad to convert iPad Pros into something closer to a traditional laptop.\n\nThe device looks fairly similar to one of Brydge\u2019s iPad keyboards, though. Brydge claims the device violates one of its patents around how those keyboards are constructed, particularly as it relates to a U-shaped hinge that the tablet slots into.\n\nAs part of its lawsuit, Brydge revealed work on a prototype keyboard with a trackpad. The company\u2019s CEO told The Verge last week that the device would start shipping in January or February 2020 in limited quantities.", "description": "The maker of the Libra keyboard has told multiple Kickstarter backers that it\u2019s \"actively communicating\" with Brydge regarding a lawsuit filed over the device last week.
