It looked easy, but do not underestimate this pass. It was the earliness of that ball which hurt United. He read the situation.\n\nHarry Maguire was trying to race back because he was playing his opponent onside. Saka had to be quick, and he was.\n\nSaka (right) celebrates Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's strike after VAR awarded the goal\n\nArsenal's 20-year-old midfielder Matteo Guendouzi worked his socks off at Old Trafford\n\nHe fed Aubameyang, and it became 1-1. Arsenal look like they have unearthed a gem in Saka. He looked like the \u00a372million winger on show.\n\nThat is not meant as a dig at Nicolas Pepe, their summer signing from Lille, but rather a compliment for Saka. Only a deflection denied him scoring the winner, too. What a talent he looks.\n\nSpecial mention also has to go to Matteo Guendouzi for his performance on Monday night. He was popping up everywhere.\n\nWhenever there was a problem, he was there, stamping it out. The 20-year-old midfielder put in a shift and a half here.", "description": "Arsenal look like they have unearthed a gem. He looked like the \u00a372million winger on show.
