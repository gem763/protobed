Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee introduced Wednesday legislation to move 90% of positions in 10 executive departments \u2014 including Agriculture, Education and Energy \u2014 to 10 states outside Washington, D.C., and \u201cinto the heart of economically distressed regions across the country.\u201d\n\nMr. Hawley pointed to the Agriculture Department\u2019s decision in June to move two of its agencies to the Kansas City area, bringing with them nearly 600 staff positions.\n\n\u201cEvery year Americans\u2019 hard-earned tax dollars fund federal agencies that are mainly located in the D.C. bubble. That\u2019s a big part of the problem with Washington: they\u2019re too removed from the rest of America,\u201d Mr. Hawley said in a press release.\n\nHe said the Helping Infrastructure Restore the Economy (HIRE) Act would \u201cmove policymakers directly into the communities they serve, creating thousands of jobs for local communities and saving taxpayers billions of dollars along the way.\u201d\n\nThe legislation calls for moving the Agriculture Department to Missouri and Education Department to Tennessee, the states represented by the bill\u2019s sponsors, as well as moving the Commerce Department to Pennsylvania and Energy Department to Kentucky.\n\nUnder the bill, Health and Human Services would move to Indiana; Housing and Urban Development to Ohio; Interior to New Mexico; Labor to West Virginia; Transportation to Michigan, and Veterans Affairs to South Carolina.\n\nAmericans work too hard for Washington to waste their tax dollars.\n\n\n\nToday, @HawleyMO & I introduced the HIRE Act to move 90% of federal jobs outside D.C.\n\n\n\nIt will help boost local economies and lower costs.\n\n\n\nNow that\u2019s a winning combination!https://t.co/o00ZPAfJrs \u2014 Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cMoving agencies outside of Washington, D.C. both boosts local economies and lowers costs \u2014 that\u2019s a winning combination,\u201d Ms. Blackburn said. \u201cThis legislation would enable Americans across the country to have greater access to good jobs.\u201d\n\nThe decisions to move the BLM and USDA offices outside the Beltway have met with pushback from unions and others over the disruption to federal workers and potential loss of clout for agencies that find themselves outside the nation\u2019s power center.\n\nThe Public Lands Foundation, which represents retired BLM staffers and others, called on the Senate to block the BLM move to Grand Junction, Colorado, saying the relocation would prove \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe fully believe this reorganization would functionally dismantle the BLM,\u201d said PLF President Edward W. Shepard in a Sept. 25 letter to key Senate chairs.\n\nFoes say the federal agencies will lose important experience as veteran staffers opt to remain in D.C. while the Senate Republicans said relocating agencies would save money, given the high cost of living in the Beltway.\n\n\u201cRetaining quality employees is easier when costs of living are low, commute times are short, and federal salaries are high relative to the region,\u201d the press release said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
