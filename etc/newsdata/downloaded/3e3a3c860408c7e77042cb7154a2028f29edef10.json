Trump alleges that the committee has no legitimate legislative purpose to request his state tax returns, and that the New York law violates the First Amendment.\n\nNeal has not yet requested Trump\u2019s state tax returns, and has been more focused on trying to obtain the president\u2019s federal tax returns. The Democrats\u2019 filing states that the Ways and Means Committee hasn\u2019t yet decided whether or not it will request Trump\u2019s state tax returns.\n\nIn their filing, the committee defendants argued that Trump doesn\u2019t have standing to sue because he hasn\u2019t provided an injury that pertains to them, and that Trump\u2019s case is not yet ripe.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s claim is far too abstract and speculative to warrant judicial intervention at this juncture,\u201d the House\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nAdditionally, the committee defendants argued that the deliberations about whether to request Trump\u2019s state tax returns are protected from a legal challenge under the Constitution\u2019s speech or debate clause. The House\u2019s lawyers argue that the deliberations are a legislative act protected by the clause, and that the clause also protects Congress\u2019s deliberative processes with respect to impeachment.\n\nThe committee defendants also argue that Trump has failed to state a claim against them.\n\n\u201cAt bottom, the relief Mr. Trump seeks in this case is as brazen as it is extreme,\u201d they said. \u201cIn the absence of any injury to him now, and admitting that a request by the Committee Defendants by itself will never harm him, Mr. Trump nonetheless asks this Court to invade the Committee\u2019s ongoing deliberations concerning whether and how to gather information for its work.\u201d\n\nAt a court hearing in September, House General Counsel Douglas Letter said that if the committee defendants lose their motion to dismiss on speech or debate clause grounds, they can immediately appeal the decision.\n\nNew York officials who are defendants in the lawsuit, Attorney General Letitia James (D) and state tax official Michael Schmidt, filed their own motion to dismiss the lawsuit in August, arguing that the lawsuit doesn\u2019t belong in federal court in Washington, D.C. Trump disagrees and argues that the federal court in D.C. does have jurisdiction over the New York officials.\n\nJudge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, heard oral arguments on the New York officials\u2019 motion in September, but has yet to issue a ruling. Under an order Nichols issued in August, the New York officials can\u2019t provide any requested Trump tax returns to the Ways and Means Committee until one week after Nichols rules on the New York officials\u2019 motion.", "description": "House Democrats on Monday urged a federal judge to dismiss them from President Trump\u2019s lawsuit challenging a New York law that allows congressional committees to request his state tax returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_10162019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
