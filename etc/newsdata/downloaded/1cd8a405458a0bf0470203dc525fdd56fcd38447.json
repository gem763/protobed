McDavid, who has 12 points, was kept off the scoresheet for the first time this season. Draisaitl earned an assist on Neal's goal.\n\nThe Blackhawks got a badly needed win in the third game of an early seven-game homestand as they skated before an announced crowd of 21,260 that was their 500th straight sellout at the United Center.\n\nEach team had several prime chances in a freely skated, but scoreless first period.\n\nDraisaitl and Oscar Klefbom both burst in a alone, but were stopped by Crawford. Smith made close-in saves on Jonathan Toews and Alex DeBrincat.\n\nEdmonton managed only one shot on two late power plays in the first, although Ryan Nugent-Hopkins clanked a shot of the right post with 4:30 left in the period.\n\nWATCH | 9 'what were you thinking' penalties...in 90 seconds:\n\nKasperi Kapanen had a penalty that left fans scratching their heads, Rob Pizzo looks at 9 more. 1:55\n\nChicago outshot Edmonton 17-6 in the second, and Kane opened the scoring 4:11 into the period from a faceoff in the Edmonton zone.\n\nSet up after Dylan Strome won a draw in the left circle, Kane fired in a quick high shot from the hashmarks with Andrew Shaw heading to the net to screen.\n\nCapping a burst down the right side, McDavid jammed the puck past Crawford and over the goal line with 2:46 left in the second, but the goal was disallowed because the net was dislodged on the play.\n\nMcDavid accelerated around Chicago defenceman Olli Maatta and cut in on Crawford, but the veteran goalie blocked McDavid's stuff-in attempt with his right pad. McDavid plowed into Crawford and kept jamming at the puck, forcing the net off its moorings.\n\nNylander made it 2-0 at 6:20 of the third, beating Smith between the pads with a low shot from a sharp angle from the right side. Following a scramble at the Edmonton blue line, Nylander corralled the puck, slipped past defenceman Joel Persson as fired it in.\n\nNeal knocked in his power-play goal from the left side of the net to cut it to 2-1 after taking Nugent-Hopkins' feed from across the crease.", "description": "Patrick Kane and Alexander Nylander scored, Corey Crawford stopped 27 shots, and the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Edmonton Oilers 3-1 Monday night for their first win of the season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320878.1571110690!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/oilers-blackhawks-hockey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
