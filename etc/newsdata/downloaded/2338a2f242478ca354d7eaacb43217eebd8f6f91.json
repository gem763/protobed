So many are choosing not to sell.\n\n\u201cGood houses are attracting four or five bidders,\u201d Ms Bloom said. \u201cThe landscape is changing very quickly, even banks are predicting a 15 per cent price hike in Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d\n\nMood swing\n\nA survey of mortgage brokers by MyState bank revealed their mood has swung from pessimism to optimism in the eight months since the Hayne royal commission recommended sweeping changes to financial advice and lending.\n\nBut there are real estate trouble spots, typically involving safety and structural issues in high-rise apartments.\n\nFor example, analysis by BIS Oxford Economics revealed two in three Melbourne apartments sold off the plan during the past eight years had made no price gains, or have lost value, despite most of that period having benefited from boom prices and record immigration.\n\nSimon Pressley, head of research for buyers' agent Propertyology, said buyers needed to be cautious, particularly investors in Melbourne and Sydney where vacancy rates and supply are increasing.\n\n\u201cInterest rate cuts have been a sugar fix and some recent responses are not sustainable,\u201d Mr Pressley said.\n\nHe recommended property investors consider diversifying from Melbourne and Sydney into large regional centres, such as Cairns in Queensland, Ballarat in Victoria, or Armidale in NSW.", "description": "Property prices in the nation\u2019s wealthiest postcodes are making the fastest recovery as rising sentiment, falling interest rates and supply shortages drive up demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4cb56f3a5dfb789a537ded5ffb94f2c9c7fa5016", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
