Kangaroos dying and even foxes are dying.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to trap for turtles but there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough water for turtles. I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019ve gone to.\u201d\n\nThere are large parts of the Macquarie River that have dried up completely as the state remains in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record.\n\nValley water storages in the Macquarie are sitting at 11%. In the Namoi, in north-west NSW where water shortages have been acute, they\u2019re at 1.5%. The Border Rivers, in the region between the NSW and Queensland border, are at 6%. In Sydney, dam storages have dropped below 50% for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A nearly dried up dam in the drought-stricken NSW and Queensland border town of Mungindi.

Most places are drier than usual, warmer than usual.\n\nRepeat episode?\n\nThe summer of 2018 brought record-breaking heat for Australia. It\u2019s too early to say whether this summer will bring such extremes.\n\nBut early outlooks for spring and December are again pointing to above average temperatures. And with the exception of parts of Western Australia and the west of Tasmania, the outlook is for below average rainfall.\n\n\u201cFor most of Australia it\u2019s this consistent dry story for the remainder of the year,\u201d Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, says. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely it\u2019s going to be hotter than usual and it\u2019s very likely it\u2019s going to be drier than usual.\u201d\n\nFor the first eight months of the year, the country\u2019s mean temperature was the second warmest on record. Mean maximums were the warmest on record over the same period and mean minimums the equal-sixth warmest.\n\nRainfall through winter was below to very much below average for most of the country, including New South Wales, southern and western Queensland, parts of northern and eastern Victoria, the east coast of Tasmania, the majority of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and most of the eastern half of Western Australia, and some coastal areas in the west of that state.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rainfall through winter was below to very much below average for most of the country, including New South Wales.

The rains that had helped his property last year had caused catastrophe further north. And outside of the floodplains, places were still in drought.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s really affected agriculture in this part of the country is climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cThat brings hotter than normal temperatures, drier than usual weather and higher minimums.\n\n\u201cThen what is happening is when we get a rainfall event there\u2019s more of a chance of them being massive, like the one at Julia Creek, which created havoc.\u201d\n\nEmmott is on the board of the advocacy group Farmers for Climate Action. In a bit more than a week, he says farmers will be travelling to Canberra to call for a national strategy on climate and agriculture.\n\n\u201cI think things can change and they actually are but they would change so much quicker if we had a government that took some leadership,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have to drag them kicking and screaming, we\u2019d get places a lot quicker. This applies to both sides of politics. They talk the talk and then do nothing.\u201d", "description": "The outlook is grim, with low water storage levels and extreme temperatures forecast", "authors": ["Lisa Cox"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dde6531046374545d6cbdc0e59195f1b74bf86a7/284_156_4736_2844/master/4736.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60a71ebfb8783e63ff85de46a50a8162", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
