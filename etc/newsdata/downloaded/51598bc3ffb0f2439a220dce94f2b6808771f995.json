Gansu plans to build several giant hydro plants in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, defying warnings that this could restrict downstream water supplies.\n\nElsewhere, green groups say scarce water resources are being diverted from agriculture to profitable coal-fired power plants, with China building thirsty \"coal production bases\" in dry areas such as Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Shaanxi.\n\nBut even flood-prone southwestern provinces have suffered from droughts once regarded as unthinkable.\n\nIn Yunnan, dozens of rivers have been dammed to generate power, and complex canal systems built to improve irrigation.\n\nWater diversion has made shortages more likely. Several rivers in the province have dried up over the last decade, and drought has been common. In April, hundreds of wells and streams dried up, creating a crisis for thousands of farmers.\n\n\"The negative impact of these big engineering projects could be quite serious and some of the problems could be transferred to other areas, especially in the west,\" said Ma.\n\n\"We spent our resources mainly on engineering and on technologies to drill deeper, build dams and work on water diversion projects, but we need to work on conservation.\"", "description": "A woman takes a break as she harvests cotton near to the Shiyang river, which dried up in recent decades.", "authors": ["Carlos Barria"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ4ZejxMJU1BWrhm-rxlrz5R8wSFa4FSCR03gwcnKzNCOOzckuGnSO27B-32-wKGYEWeM8xeIVEp-1cAi3VLlsNRg6RymiwNCMWWoRO_clTz2"}
