Well for \"Game of Thrones,\" at least.\n\nLiam Cunningham: Yeah, probably for us, too. [laughing]\n\nIsaac Hempstead Wright: Yep, definitely the last.\n\nCunningham: We shouldn't even be here now.\n\nRenfro: Now that the whole series is done, I'm curious about the worst fan theory you ever heard during filming.\n\nHempstead Wright: That f------ Bran is the Night King. [Cunningham looked surprised at the use of a swear word.] This isn't live! Is it?\n\nRenfro: No, but it is being recorded.\n\nHempstead Wright: Well, you can bleep that out.\n\nBy the seventh season of \"Game of Thrones,\" some fans were convinced Bran was the Night King.

Absolute nonsense.\n\nCunningham: Oh and Varys being a mermaid.\n\nRenfro: That one's just fun though. People actually thought Bran could be the Night King.\n\nCunningham: It was nuts. Just nuts.\n\nHempstead Wright: I personally hated that one because people became convinced that I was the spitting image of an ancient ice zombie.\n\nBran and the Night King next to one another. HBO\n\nCunningham: Well, just a small stretch of the imagination and there is a ... you know. He's slightly more blue than you.\n\nHempstead Wright: Yeah, yeah.\n\nRenfro: What shows have you been watching lately?\n\nHempstead Wright: I binge-watched \"Chernobyl\" this year. I thought that was fabulous.\n\nCunningham: I started very late, but I'm watching \"Peaky Blinders.\" I watched maybe four or five episodes with my son and I need to catch up. But I keep traveling so I'm not getting the chance to bury myself in it. I have loads of gorgeous things to watch \u2014 and one of them is \"Chernobyl.\"\n\nLiam Cunningham starred as Ser Davos Seaworth for seven seasons on \"Game of Thrones.\" Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nRenfro: What is one thing you would hope fans take away from the final season of \"Game of Thrones\"?\n\nCunningham: That we all collectively did our best to try and tell this gorgeous story, and we took people on a journey with us. I think we achieved that. And hopefully it raised people's expectations for future shows. If we raised the bar of quality for storytelling, we'll have done some good.\n\nHempstead Wright: Yeah, I mean ... I sort of ....\n\nCunningham: You've forgotten the question again, haven't you?\n\nHempstead Wright: I haven't! No I haven't. \"What would I like the audience to take away from 'Game of Thrones'\"?\n\nCunningham: Go ahead then.\n\nBran was crowned King of the Six Kingdoms on the series finale of \"Game of Thrones.\" HBO\n\nHempstead Wright: I think just a sense of how to finish a story well. We did a very noble thing, which is to end it on a high with only six episodes when we could have dragged it on for 10 more seasons and everyone would have watched it and it would have been fine \u2014 but I think it's a real lesson in quitting while you're ahead.\n\nCunningham: \"Always leave 'em wanting more\" is an old showbiz epithet.\n\nRenfro: And Isaac, your character's ending is one of the few story lines we know George R.R. Martin told [showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss] about. What did they tell you about that conversation?\n\nHempstead Wright: Well, I don't want to step on George's toes and say anything about it that I shouldn't, but that was kind of the gist they gave me, that there were a couple of things George has got clearly set out. I'm honored to be a small part of that.", "description": "Insider spoke with the two HBO actors about Bran not being the Night King at the 2019 Emmy Awards red carpet in Los Angeles, California.", "authors": ["Kim Renfro"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89131df4fc24250114576c-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
