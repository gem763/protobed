The probability of a rate cut peaks by August at 88 per cent, before drifting lower again.\n\nIf markets no longer fully expect another cut, economists still do.\n\nLow inflation expectations feed into actual inflation outcomes and make it even harder to generate a stronger lift in prices. \u2014 CBA economists Kristina Clifton and Gareth Aird\n\nThe dismal scientists duly noted on Wednesday that the disinflationary scare of early this year appears to have evaporated.\n\n\"Core inflation has probably bottomed,\" RBC Capital's Su-Lin Ong admitted.\n\nBut most still believe we will get another cut by either the end of this year, or early in the next.\n\nOng is one of a number of economists who have retained their calls for a December cut (February is the other popular choice). She believes the central bank has \"a clear easing bias\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, Lowe reiterated on Tuesday night that the bank is still \u201cprepared to ease monetary policy further if needed\u201d.\n\nCore inflation is \"too low\" with little sign of any upward momentum, Ong says. That means \"further RBA action [is] needed\".\n\nANZ economists Hayden Dimes and David Plank say they \"still think the RBA will need to ease further if it is to drive spare capacity out of the labour market and get the unemployment rate down towards 4.5 per cent\" \u2013 the bank's estimate of the level at which wages pressure begins to emerge.\n\nWhat we are left with now is a stabilisation in consumer price inflation, but at very low levels and well below the bottom of the RBA's 2-3 per cent target band.\n\nAnd stability when inflation is too low risks instability elsewhere in the economy, as governor Lowe noted on Tuesday night in another excellent speech.\n\n\"It is possible that, in some circumstances, a low and stable inflation environment provides fertile ground for the emergence of some financial stability risks,\" Lowe said.\n\n\"As we have seen too often, the crystallisation of these risks can have very large welfare consequences, with people losing their jobs, their incomes and their savings. So just achieving low and stable inflation is not enough to maximise economic welfare.\"\n\nIn that speech Governor Lowe lauded the flexible nature of the inflation target. Still, close to four years of CPI growth below the bottom of the target range is \"starting to feel like a long time\", CBA economists Kristina Clifton and Gareth Aird say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The RBA have argued that the current inflation target has served us well. And that lowering the target would reduce its credibility.\"\n\n\"However it could be argued that that credibility is being undermined by the fact that the target has been missed for such a long period of time. We are now seeing a decline in inflation expectations across a range of different measures.\n\n\"Low inflation expectations feed through into actual inflation outcomes and make it even harder to generate a stronger lift in prices.\"\n\nThe market is beginning to think it might not be needed.
