It\u2019s not cheating. This is where most people start the long - and crowded - trek.\n\nThe Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.\n\nWitnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation\u2019s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.\n\nClimbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.\n\nAfter the descent, visit picturesque Lake Kawaguchi to photograph Mount Fuji from afar.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "People come from all over Japan to climb to the summit of Mount Fuji to see the sunrise.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jae C.
