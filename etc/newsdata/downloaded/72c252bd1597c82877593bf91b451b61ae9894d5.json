Five have been confirmed rescued, while dozens remain unaccounted for, with reports of multiple fatalities remaining unconfirmed early on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe boat at the time was docked near Santa Cruz Island, which is located off the coast of Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. It has since sunk.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters respond to a boat fire off the coast of southern California Monday.

More than an hour later, the US Coast Guard of Los Angeles announced on Twitter that a rescue operation for \u201cmore than 30 people in distress\u201d was launched.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the coast guard said the crew members of the ship were rescued. At least one crew member sustained minor injuries.\n\nThe bodies of four people involved in the tragedy had been recovered on Monday afternoon, but more than two dozen people were still missing and feared dead. Coast Guard official Matthew Kroll said the four bodies had signs consistent with drowning.\n\nAt the coast guard station in Oxnard, law enforcement officials had minimal information to share to crowds of reporters that had gathered by mid-morning local time.\n\nUS Congresswoman Julia Brownley, who represents the area, was on the scene and met with authorities, who were working to locate missing people and had sent out helicopters. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here is just about deployment and search and rescue,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a mission.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the region had already been through so much devastation with last year\u2019s deadly wildfires: \u201cSadly, we\u2019ve been through two major California fires ... [but] never had this particular kind of emergency.\u201d\n\nAudio of the frantic mayday call captured someone on board shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d before the call was cut off.\n\nA nearby \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d pleasure craft evacuated the crew members who were able to escape the ship.\n\nThe passengers reported missing were below deck and sleeping when the fire started, US coast guard official Monica Rochester said at a press briefing, as a search and rescue mission was still in full flow on Monday. The five crew members were on the bridge of the vessel, awake at the time flames were spotted, and were able to jump off the boat when the fire erupted.\n\nWhile firefighters tamed the blaze, the vessel sank 20 yards off the shore in more than 50ft of water, the US Coast Guard reported.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the vessel had just a portion of its bow sticking out of the water. Rochester said the US coast guard was still in a response phase and conducting shoreline searches for survivors.\n\nThe Ventura County fire department released dramatic pictures on Twitter on Monday morning, depicting the ship engulfed in smoke and bright orange flames in the early morning darkness.\n\nVCFD PIO (@VCFD_PIO) #CoastInc: @VCFD responded to boat fire off the north side of Santa Cruz Island at approximately 3:28am. @USCG helping support rescue operations for people aboard a dive boat. #ChannelIslands @USCGLosAngeles @CountyVentura @SBCOUNTYFIRE pic.twitter.com/DwoPGfBjtA\n\nCoast guard senior official Aaron Bemis told CNN that the fire kept resisting being extinguished, appearing to die out and then bursting back into flames, possibly because of the amount of fuel on the ship. He said that it kept \u201cbeing put out and re-flashing\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe report that we got is that they were trapped by the fire,\u201d Bemis told CNN of the missing passengers. \u201cThe fire was so intense that even after it was put out, we were not able to actually embark the vessel and look for survivors at [that] point.\u201d\n\nThe vessel was named Conception, a diving tour boat. The boat is owned by a company called Truth Aquatics, a local boat rental service that offers diving tours off southern California.\n\nThe boat was being used for a three-day diving tour of islands, including Santa Cruz Island, just off the coast of Santa Barbara, according to Truth Aquatics website. Passengers boarded the boat at Santa Barbara Harbor Friday night, and the vessel was set to return to Santa Barbara late on Monday afternoon.\n\nCalifornia Diving, a local diving publication, described the boat as \u201cCalifornia\u2019s crown jewel of live-aboard dive boats\u201d when it was built in 1981.\n\nRochester said the boat was in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with regulations.\n\nThe US coast guard was \u201cworking deliberately with the vessel owner/operator, who is with us at the time working on a plan to conduct further assistance for his vessel,\u201d she said.\n\nAuthorities set up a family assistance point at an event center in Santa Barbara, north of the Channel Islands. Officials there said they did not have much information that they could share, but were there to provide support in any way they could.\n\n\u201cPeople are coming in wanting information,\u201d said Suzanne Grimmesey, an official with the Santa Barbara department of behavioral wellness. \u201cThere are a lot of unknowns across the board.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to help them cope with what they are experiencing. We have clergy, we have chaplains, we have Red Cross, we have hospice care.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Up to 39 people were on diving boat that caught fire, five of whom have been confirmed rescued", "authors": ["Sam Levin", "Lauren Aratani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/302da68a5498169c99fc32662883c2fbf92dc778/0_0_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d492d12821d2b9b3827b025960fbbb54"}
