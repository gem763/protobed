Adam Schiff.\n\nNow it has emerged that Reeker\u2019s participation was nixed for a previously advertised Atlantic Council event in D.C. two days ago titled, \u201cRevitalizing NATO\u2019s Southern Strategy for an Era of Great Power Competition.\u201d\n\nJoin us on Oct. 22 at 3pm to hear Gen. Jim Jones, @StateDept\u2019s Phil Reeker, @ARVershbow & @ItalyinUS discuss why NATO urgently needs to do #MoreintheMed even as we face great challenges to the east. RSVP here: https://t.co/gn3I0nSGlC \u2014 Atlantic Council (@AtlanticCouncil) October 19, 2019\n\nReeker\u2019s name was removed from an event promotion on the Atlantic Council\u2019s website.\n\nThe event took place as scheduled on Tuesday but without Reeker.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic Council was informed late last week that Acting Assistant Secretary Philip Reeker would be unable to participate in our event on October 22 due to scheduling conflicts,\u201d Alex Kisling, the Atlantic Council\u2019s deputy director for media relations, told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cMr. Reeker was just one of several scheduled speakers, and the event went forward with an important focus on international security issues,\u201d Kisling said.\n\nThe cancellation in part prompted a letter to Reeker from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) the top-ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, asking for an explanation as to why Reeker\u2019s name was removed as a panelist for the Atlantic Council event.\n\nIn his letter, which was obtained by Breitbart News, Jordan noted that the Atlantic Council is financed by Burisma.\n\nJordan also highlighted a New York Times article that reported details about Biden\u2019s involvement in Burisma showed \u201cHunter Biden and his American business partners were part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well-connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations backed not just by domestic Ukrainian forces but by officials in the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nJordan asked Reeker why he rescheduled his impeachment testimony to the weekend, noting that less House members would be able to attend. Jordan asked the diplomat to reschedule for a weekday when more House members could be there.\n\nJordan explained he wrote directly to Reeker because the lawmaker had \u201cno confidence\u201d that Schiff is \u201coperating fairly or in good faith.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Reeker was invited to speak at an Atlantic Council event.\n\nOn July 17, he was a panelist at an Atlantic Council flagship conference titled \u201cThe United States and Central Europe: Celebrating Europe Whole and Free.\u201d\n\nReeker also spoke at a September conference organized by the McCain Institute and the Economic Policy Research Center (EPRC).\n\nOthers associated with Schiff or his impeachment inquiry have evidenced ties to the Burisma-financed Atlantic Council.\n\nYesterday, Breitbart News first reported that acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who provided key testimony to the Democrats\u2019 controversial impeachment inquiry, has evidenced a close relationship with the Atlantic Council think tank, even writing Ukraine policy pieces with the organization\u2019s director and analysis articles published by the Council.\n\nIn addition to a direct relationship with the Atlantic Council, Taylor for the last nine years also served as a senior adviser to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), which has co-hosted events with the Atlantic Council and has participated in events co-hosted jointly by the Atlantic Council and Burisma.\n\nAnother senior adviser to the USUBC is David J. Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain and employee at the McCain Institute. Kramer played a central role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier to the news media and Obama administration. Taylor participated in events and initiatives organized by Kramer.\n\nThe links may be particularly instructive after Breitbart News reported that itinerary for a trip to Ukraine in August organized by the Atlantic Council for ten Congressional aides reveals that a staffer on Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with Taylor. The pre-planned trip took place after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint and reportedly after a Schiff aide was contacted by the so-called whistleblower.\n\nThomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee, took the trip in question to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan \u201cUkraine Study Trip\u201d in which ten Congressional staffers participated.\n\nEager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that says it \u201ceducates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.\u201d The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program.\n\nA closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation\u2019s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor.\n\nSpokespeople for Schiff\u2019s office did not reply to multiple Breitbart News requests for comment on Eager\u2019s meeting with Taylor.\n\nWhen Breitbart News first reported on Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine, Schiff\u2019s office quickly replied to several comment requests, denying any impropriety related to Eager\u2019s association with the Atlantic Council or the trip.\n\nThe unanswered Breitbart email requests to Schiff\u2019s office about Taylor\u2019s meeting with Eager posed the following question:\n\nWhile in Ukraine, did Mr. Eager speak to Mr. Taylor about the issue of reports about any representatives of President Trump looking into alleged Biden corruption in Ukraine?\n\nThe dates of the pre-planned trip are instructive. Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine sponsored by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council began 12 days after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint.\n\nSchiff and his office have offered seemingly conflicting statements on the timeline of the California Congressman\u2019s initial contact with the so-called whistleblower.\n\nSpeaking on September 17, Schiff told MSNBC, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s spokesperson, Patrick Boland, was quoted on October 2 saying, \u201cAt no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d Boland said Schiff\u2019s committee received the complaint the night before it publicly released the document.\n\nOn October 2, however, the New York Times reported that Schiff received some of the contents of the complaint through an unnamed House Intelligence Committee aide initially contacted by the so-called whistleblower, described as a CIA officer.\n\nThe Times reported the aide \u201cshared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff.\u201d The referenced officer refers to the so-called whistleblower.\n\nThe newspaper also reported:\n\nBy the time the whistle-blower filed his complaint, Mr. Schiff and his staff knew at least vaguely what it contained.\n\nSpeaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, Schiff conceded that he was not clear enough about his contact with the so-called whistleblower.\n\n\u201cI should have been much more clear,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nBurisma is a key financial backer of the Atlantic Council. In 2017, Burisma and the Atlantic Council signed a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma\u2019s financial support reportedly to focus \u201con European and international energy security.\u201d Burisma specifically finances the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, which sent the Schiff staffer to Ukraine.\n\nBesides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank. Only four months ago, the company co-hosted the Atlantic Council\u2019s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference. Burisma advertises that it committed itself to \u201c15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.\u201d\n\nCommon funding themes\n\nBesides Burisma funding, the Atlantic Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., and the U.S. State Department.\n\nGoogle, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund, and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe charges in the July 22 report referenced in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented.\n\nOne key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d\n\nThis was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.\n\nEven though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThat footnote reads:\n\nIn a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.\n\nThe so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:\n\nWrite that Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko \u201calso stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.\u201d\n\nDocument that Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani \u201chad spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nBolster the charge that, \u201cI also learned from a U.S. official that \u2018associates\u2019 of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\u201d The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, \u201cI do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.\u201d\n\nThe OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.\n\nThe OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nThe so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
