STOVL aircraft can operate off the short decks of \u201cski-jump\u201d carriers like Britain\u2019s new Queen Elizabeth-class vessels, and then land vertically. This makes these ships smaller and cheaper than American-style carriers with their long flight decks, catapults and arresting gear for conventional aircraft launch and recovery.\n\n\"This will completely undermine\u2026the whole carrier program,\" one source told Sky News. \u201cThere is no operational reason whatsoever for the RAF to have the \u2018A\u2019 [land-based] variant. If it can't fly from an aircraft carrier, it shouldn't be purchased.\"\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "What is London to do?", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YRkNf6NJPxLcuvHixNp9Ng--~B/aD0xMDE1O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/4f988d59ca81480a0ad9fdcfe62244f0", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
