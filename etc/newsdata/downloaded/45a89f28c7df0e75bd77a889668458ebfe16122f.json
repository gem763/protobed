Christopher Giancarlo, former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or CFTC, argued the dollar could lose status in the future.\n\nThis would be specifically due to other countries rolling out digital currencies. The answer, he argued, is to create a new form of dollar.\n\n\u201cWe propose a digital dollar\u2014a government-sanctioned blockchain protocol, created and maintained by an independent nongovernmental group but administered by banks and other trusted payment organizations,\u201d he explained.\n\nGiancarlo continued:\n\n\u201cCash brought into the system would be exchanged for digital U.S. dollars on a blockchain, with the cash lodged in special escrow accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nHow decentralized?\n\nUnlike many banking sources that have discussed digital currency, the digital dollar concept hints directly at decentralizing power over money.\n\nWhile stopping short of claiming central banks should lose their ability to control national currencies, Giancarlo nonetheless argues that by shunning digital currency, the U.S. is set to weaken the dollar\u2019s appeal. He warned:\n\n\u201cSignificant actors, including central banks and social media platforms, may launch new currencies in the next few years. As their networks grow, they could eventually erode the dollar\u2019s status as the most popular currency for international exchange.\u201d\n\nGiancarlo compared the potential dollar decline to the pound sterling\u2019s loss of power after World War II.\n\nThe theory chimes with Bitcoin (BTC) proponents, with Saifedean Ammous\u2019 book \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard\u201d also noting global reserve currencies come and go at regular intervals.\n\nFor Ammous, however, the reason for this is tied to poor government handling of currency, including overt meddling in its issuance and value. Leaving the gold standard, he claims, all but guaranteed the fate of modern fiat currencies, including the dollar.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported meanwhile, Giancarlo previously said he expects 2019 to become the starting point for a concerted international response to cryptocurrencies from regulators.", "description": "Washington risks devaluing the dollar\u2019s status in the future if it fails to respond to innovation, says the former regulator", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDNjZmVhZjg1ODNlYzI1ZmQ3ODYxNTBiMjY4YWI4NjQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
