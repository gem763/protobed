At just 23, she is set to break the record for annual Flat wins achieved by a female jockey in a calendar year \u2013 with 92 victories under her belt for 2019 so far.\n\nRacing is in Hollie\u2019s blood. It is all she has ever known. And she\u2019s happy that old stereotypes about female jockeys are finally being put to bed.\n\n\u2018I was born into racing really,\u2019 explains Hollie. \u2018Dad rode on the Flat and over jumps and my mum rode in Arab racing.\n\n\u2018There are many successful female jockeys on the scene at the moment and this is only going to increase\u2019 (Picture: Dan Abraham/focusonracing.com)\n\n\u2018My Grandma bred Arabs and raced them too, so I have always been around horse racing. My Dad had point-to-point horses when I was really young. I have not looked back or been interested in anything else, ever.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp until recently, female jockeys were still relatively rare, but it\u2019s changing quickly. And Hollie thinks archaic attitudes are changing too. She knows female athletes are more than capable of excelling at the elite level.\n\n\u2018There may have been times where trainers have been a bit shy towards using me because I am female,\u2019 Hollie tells us.\n\n\u2018Perhaps people were quite old fashioned beforehand, which is why women had fewer opportunities \u2013 but I think the approach to female jockeys has changed massively now.\n\n\u2018People are realising that, if given the opportunity, female jockeys are just as good as men.\n\n\u2018You have got to have your own mindset too. If you go into the game thinking: \u201cI am not going to do well because I am a girl and I am disadvantaged\u201d, you won\u2019t be helping yourself. It is the wrong way to go about it.\n\n\u2018There are many successful female jockeys on the scene at the moment and this is only going to increase.\u2019\n\nBeing a jockey is a dangerous game, and Hollie has had her fair share of falls, breaks and bruises. But she knows that\u2019s just part of the deal and she doesn\u2019t let fear put her off her game.\n\n\u2018I have broken quite a lot of bones over the years, but the worst for me is the head injuries I\u2019ve had.\n\n\u2018After every fall I have had, I have been there the next day to try and get back on track\u2019 (Picture: Mark Cranham/focusonracing.com)\n\n\u2018You might look physically fine but mentally you are not. Even though I felt fine at the time, a head injury did effect me for quite a while and it was very frustrating that I couldn\u2019t ride and was missing out on races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I got kicked in the face and lost my teeth and, at the time, I was quite relaxed about it and remember thinking to myself; \u201coh whatever you can get new teeth\u201d.\n\n\u2018But I have only just got everything fixed now, it took over a year \u2013 which felt like a long drag. I was very busy racing, so I probably wasn\u2019t the best patient for a quick fix.\u2019\n\nThe psychological impact of injury hits Hollie harder than the physical. Racing is her life, so when she can\u2019t do that for any period of time, she feels at a loss.\n\n\u2018It is not great as a jockey getting knocked back and put on the sidelines,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018We are so busy day-to-day that we don\u2019t really know what to do with ourselves when we have time off, so it\u2019s a case of getting back as soon as you can when you have a bad fall.\n\n\u2018I think after every fall I have had, I have been there the next day, no matter what has happened, to try and get back on track as quick as I can.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great that we have the Injured Jockey Fund to help and support us as jockeys when we need it too. If we didn\u2019t have that I think that things would be very different. There have definitely been a few occasions where I have had to pull myself up from feeling low after injury.\u2019\n\n\u2018Being a strong woman is about staying focussed and not letting setbacks bring you down\u2019 (Picture: Dan Abraham/focusonracing.com)\n\nBut, despite the low moments, Hollie\u2019s sheer love for the sport keeps her pushing on. When your day job produces that much adrenaline, it\u2019s not hard to see where the appeal comes from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A lot of the love for the sport that you experience as a jockey is the thrill that you get from riding in races,\u2019 says Hollie. \u2018Although a lot of it is down to lifestyle too.\n\n\u2018It is not your usual nine-to-five job, it is a lifestyle, and you don\u2019t even think of it as going to work every day, even though it is very hard.\n\n\u2018I just love horses too, so it is great that I have a job where I can work with them every day.\u2019\n\nLooking to the future, Hollie\u2019s dreaming big and wants to continue her successful streak.\n\n\u2018I just want to keep riding as many winners as I can and keep improving,\u2019 says Hollie. \u2018I am looking forward to QIPCO British Champions Day to end the season, it is great to be surrounded by jockeys and horses at the top of their game.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m yet to ride my first group winner, so that would be a good goal to set and I am hoping to achieve that in the next year or two.\u2019\n\nSo, what does Hollie think makes a strong woman? It\u2019s all about the ability to bounce back and keep fighting.\n\n\u2018I think that you have to be resilient,\u2019 she says. \u2018I think being a strong woman is about staying focussed and not letting setbacks bring you down, whether that is mentally or physically \u2013 resilience is key.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollie is currently lying 13th in the Flat Jockey Championships. The Champion Jockey will be crowned at QIPCO British Champions Day on the 19 October at Ascot.\n\nStrong Women Strong Women is a weekly series that champions diversity in the world of sport and fitness. A Sport England study found that 40% of women were avoiding physical activity due to a fear of judgement. But, contrary to the limited images we so often see, women of any age, size, race or ability can be active and enjoy sport and fitness. We hope that by normalising diverse depictions of women who are fit, strong and love their bodies, we will empower all women to shed their self-consciousness when it comes to getting active. Each week we talk to women who are redefining what it means to be strong and achieving incredible things.\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018Two of my friends took their own lives \u2013 now I\u2019m walking 1,300 miles to raise awareness\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018My rugby team fought for equality in Japan \u2013 but the fight against prejudice isn\u2019t over\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018I was struggling to cope with my husband\u2019s MS \u2013 mountain biking brought me back from the brink\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Hollie Doyle is an elite female jockey, and she won't let little injuries - like getting her teeth kicked out by a horse - stop her.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris", "Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/strong-women-36-90e0_1570802380.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
