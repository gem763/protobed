Business Insider Intelligence\n\nNot only are Cerner's extensive list of hospital clients \u2014 which includes The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA's) 147 acute care facilities \u2014 in for a big tech boost, but the alliance allows AWS to deepen its footprint in the cloud computing market, of which it could control upward of 50% globally by the end of this year.\n\nHere's a look into the AWS-powered projects Cerner introduced to its health system and hospital clients:\n\nWith its new-and-improved cloud-based health platform, Cerner seeks to knock down barriers that stand in the way of integrating innovative methods efficiently into workflows. Embedded in the platform will be toolkits, dashboards, and analytics to boost interoperability of data among hospitals. AWS' infrastructure will mitigate the number of manual steps likely holding hospitals back from innovating: 62% of health systems move \"somewhat\" or \"very\" slowly when scaling innovation, according to a 2019 survey of health system executives.\n\nCerner also debuted a predictive analytics model to reduce opioid abuse. Cerner is bulking up its opioid abuse prevention toolkit with AI and predictive analytics in an effort to help clients better guide treatment plans for patients at high risk for abusing opioids \u2014 which should prove to be a topical use case for the tech considering that an estimated 130 US citizens die of an opioid overdose every day, per the NIH. And more hospitals will likely feel the pressure to curb their prescription of opioids in light of the US' crippling epidemic.\n\nTwo of the three largest EHR vendors recently inked deal with tech giants' cloud computing arms \u2014 but Epic is still unchartered territory. Meditech enlisted Google Cloud as its cloud provider earlier this month, which should allot Google's cloud division a deeper inroads into the healthcare cloud market since Meditech controls 16% of the EHR market. But Epic \u2014 which sits atop the US EHR market with a 28% share \u2014 is the last big-name vendor without a major cloud partnership, according to TechTarget.\n\nBut we don't expect this to last long: With its top competitors tied up with a couple of the biggest names in the cloud computing space, Epic should forge an alliance soon. AI diagnostics and precision medicine \u2014 which hospitals are becoming more bullish on \u2014 will require expertise by way of robust cloud-based networks, so EHR vendors without strong cloud infratructure could risk losing hospital clients to those that do.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
