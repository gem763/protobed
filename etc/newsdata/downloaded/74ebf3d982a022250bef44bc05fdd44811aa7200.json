(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nA Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds.\n\nThe ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word \u201cimpeachment.\u201d Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign.\n\n\u201cFor Antonio Delgado, serving in Congress is all about serving country and community \u2014 not fighting on Twitter or shouting on cable news,\u201d says one ad set to run in the Albany market, touting prescription drug, ethics and agriculture bills that passed the House with the support of the Upstate New York freshman.\n\n\u201cForget the noise \u2014 Haley Stevens is focused on Michigan, and getting the job done,\u201d says an ad running in the Detroit area, highlighting another freshman\u2019s work on manufacturing, pensions and \u2014 yes \u2014 prescription drugs.\n\nThe campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a \u201cwalk and chew gum\u201d image for the party \u2014 that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to know about the progressive legislative accomplishments of these representatives, who are fighting for the kitchen table issues that matter most in their districts \u2014 lowering the cost of prescription drugs, protecting people with preexisting conditions, and taking care of our veterans,\u201d said Abby Curran Horrell, the group\u2019s executive director.\n\n[For House Democrats, impeachment probe widens the divide they hoped to bridge]\n\nAs a 501 (c) (4) nonprofit, House Majority Forward can raise unlimited money and is not required to disclose its donors, but it cannot directly advocate voting for or against a particular candidate. It can, however, conduct informational campaigns that highlight candidates\u2019 records to voters.\n\nOther Democrats included in the campaign are Reps. Cindy Axne (Iowa), Angie Craig (Minn.), Matthew Cartwright (Pa.), Abby Finkenauer (Iowa), Susie Lee (Nev.), Elaine Luria (Va.), Chris Pappas (N.H.), Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.). All except Cartwright are freshmen.\n\nThe ads come amid considerable Democratic anxiety about the political fallout from Pelosi\u2019s decision last month to back a formal impeachment probe. Multiple lawmakers have privately pressed her to provide backup from party organs to combat Republican attacks \u2014 particularly in the 31 House districts held by Democrats where Trump won in 2016.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign quickly announced a combined $10 million television and digital spending effort. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC focused on House races, has also launched a major impeachment-focused campaign.\n\nA super PAC funded mainly by billionaire presidential candidate Tom Steyer separately announced a $3.1 million ad campaign last week targeting vulnerable Senate Republicans. That campaign addresses impeachment head on, asking \u201cWho would bargain away the security of our nation and our elections for his own political gain? . . . Will our senator?\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "House Majority Forward has reserved more than $1\u2009million of TV airtime to protect 11 vulnerable lawmakers, most of them freshmen.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "October At Am", "Mike Debonis Covers Congress", "With A Focus On The House", "For The Washington Post.
