Tony Evers Calls Legislative Session for Gun Control", "language": "en", "text": "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) is calling a special session of the state\u2019s legislature in hopes of securing universal background checks and other gun controls.\n\nWBAY reports that Evers announced the special session by stressing that he has been pressing for \u201ccommon sense safety\u201d legislation since assuming office.\n\nHe highlighted universal background checks, which he claimed would \u201censure that no matter a person is buying a firearm, or who they are buying it from, the process is the same for everyone.\u201d He did not mention that California has had universal background checks since the 1990s, yet criminals continue to be armed, and high profile firearm attacks continue to occur in that state.\n\nBut Evers did say, \u201cOur kids are calling us to act. They are asking to be the adults in the room.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\nEach and every day that Republican leadership chooses ideology, false dichotomies, other things that don\u2019t matter, over what is right, that\u2019s a choice that has consequences. Each and every day that Republican leadership chooses weakness and cowardice over common sense, that\u2019s a choice that has consequences. The consequences of inaction are just too high, folks.\n\nEvers tried to assure gun owners by saying, \u201cThis is common sense stuff. I\u2019m not taking away people\u2019s guns.\u201d\n\nThe special session is scheduled for November 7.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
