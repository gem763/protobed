And it will be a Saudi decision first and foremost, specifically Prince Mohammed\u2019s decision,\u201d he added.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz is the half-brother of the crown prince, whose ambitious reform plans for the kingdom\u2019s economy largely rest on the anticipated $100 billion windfall from the Aramco listing.\n\nAfter an initial listing on the domestic stock exchange, Aramco is believed to be planning to sell the rest of a planned tranche of five percent of the firm on an international bourse.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis\u2019 current objective is to raise $100 billion through the IPO process, even if that means ultimately selling up to 10 percent of the company to outside investors,\u201d Energy Intelligence said in a report this week.\n\nIt cited sources as saying they expect the Saudis to settle on a valuation of $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion for the firm.", "description": "Riyadh (AFP) \u2013 The timing of the highly anticipated stock market debut of Saudi energy colossus Aramco will be dictated by de facto ruler Crown", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/c4dc3c_saudi-leaders-had-hoped-long-awaited-initial-public-offering-kingdom-energy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
