But I would caution them,\" he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday.", "description": "The Leader of the House has gone from a thorn in Theresa May's side to a member of Boris Johnson's cabinet", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571189.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Members-PM-Johnsons-Cabinet-Leave-Their-Weekly-Meeting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
