Order,\u201d his antiquarian language and his constant needling of the government, John Bercow, the speaker of Britain\u2019s House of Commons, became a celebrity of the Brexit era.\n\nTrue to form, his announcement on Monday that he would leave his post and his seat in Parliament came wrapped with one final rebuke for Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s hard-line government. By timing his departure for the end of October, Mr. Bercow ensured that the current Parliament, packed with Johnson-averse lawmakers, would choose his successor.\n\nThat starved a future Parliament \u2014 perhaps one controlled by Mr. Johnson and purged of the Conservative rebels who defied him last week \u2014 from installing a more acquiescent speaker, one who would clear the government\u2019s path to an abrupt Brexit. But it also left Mr. Bercow in place for long enough to preside over the electric run-up to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nIt was a fitting send-off for a speaker who galvanized so-called backbench members of Parliament, lawmakers who are usually consigned to following the orders of party leaders but, with Mr. Bercow\u2019s help, have taken the reins at pivotal moments of the Brexit crisis.", "description": "John Bercow, who infuriated Brexit supporters and successive Conservative governments, announced on Monday that he would step down as speaker of Britain\u2019s House of Commons.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/world/09bercow-1sub/09bercow-1sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
