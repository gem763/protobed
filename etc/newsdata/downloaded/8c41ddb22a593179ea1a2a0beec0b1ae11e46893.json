The situation brought criticism from the NFL Players Association and the Post-Gazette\u2019s Gerry Dulac the problem stemmed from operator error and not a mechanical problem. He added that the NFL had called Steelers officials to investigate.\n\nAs Rudolph ran from the pocket midway through the third quarter, the 24-year-old quarterback left his feet to throw, completing a 26-yard pass. But his helmet and face mask were struck by Baltimore safety Earl Thomas\u2019s helmet. As Rudolph fell limply to the ground, the back of his helmet smacked the turf at Heinz Field. He lay motionless on the field, with Pittsburgh lineman Alejandro Villanueva and others signaling that the quarterback needed urgent medical attention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Chiefs put their undefeated record on the line against the Colts\n\nA medical cart came onto the field, but Rudolph was helped to his feet and woozily and unsteadily was walked off, with Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster fighting back tears and Ryan Shazier, the Steelers linebacker who has not played since suffering a spinal injury during a December 2017 game, looking on from the sideline.\n\nHope Mason Rudolph is OK after this hit.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/FGADzi2Z6R \u2014 Jordan Dajani (@JordanDajani) October 6, 2019\n\nIt did not appear that Rudolph\u2019s health was affected by the medical cart\u2019s apparent malfunction. The breakdown did not, though, escape the notice of the NFLPA, with George Atallah, the assistant executive director of external affairs for the union, tweeting: \u201cEmbarrassing. I guess $15 billion a year [the NFL\u2019s revenue last year] can\u2019t buy you a working medical cart.\u201d\n\nThomas, who was flagged for roughing the passer, confessed that he was concerned about Rudolph. \u201cI hit the strike zone like we talk about,\" he told reporters. \"I didn\u2019t go high. I didn\u2019t intentionally try to hurt him. I\u2019m worried about him. I heard he\u2019s at the hospital. My prayers go out to him and his family. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt anybody.\u201d\n\nSteelers offensive lineman Zach Banner tweeted Sunday evening that he had been in contact with Rudolph. \u201cMason and I talked over the phone. For however many seconds, I was scared about losing my friend, and then God answered my prayers,\u201d he wrote. \"I love you @Rudolph2Mason. Get better!\n\nA second-year quarterback out of Oklahoma State, Rudolph has been Pittsburgh\u2019s starter since Ben Roethlisberger suffered a season-ending elbow injury Sept. 15. Rudolph has completed 63 of 94 passes for 646 yards and seven touchdowns. Undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges replaced Rudolph on Sunday, and the Steelers lost to the Ravens, 26-23, in overtime.\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nGardner Minshew II: From college nomad to mustachioed cult hero to NFL\u2019s top rookie\n\nPackers-Cowboys, Steelers-Ravens, Bears-Raiders highlight Week 5\n\nTom Brady passes Brett Favre on all-time list in Patriots-Redskins game\n\nAD", "description": "The NFL is looking into why a cart could not be used and the NFL Players Association is highly critical.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cjC1VOzMxFRD7JKr8h5lBUToTAI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T6VLF2HINYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
