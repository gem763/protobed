Jump on that big wave with your surfboard. The Sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars are in the healing sign of Virgo and will remain there all week. They're galloping along like a pack of wild horses. A Uranus trine to them is giving a high-voltage quality to the mood. Life is moving fast. The energy is intense.\n\nVirgo is a trouble-shooter. It finds flaws and offers its healing energy to put it all right. Health, nutrition, work and relationships are all up for scrutiny. If worries are stalking you, rest at ease. You'll be fine. At the opposite end of the sky, we have spiritual Neptune in his own sign of Pisces forming a deep bond to Virgo.\n\nNeptune will help you relax and make you aware that you're not alone. We are all one. Where problems are diagnosed, the focus will be on healing and fixing them. Stay connected to the source through breathing, the sound of running water, the sound of the wind blowing through the trees and through yoga and meditation. This is a unique time for bonding with your inner self.\n\nMercury, the Master of Strategy, will reach the far side of the Sun on Tuesday and begin his journey back toward Earth. He's been on an outward journey in his merchant ship visiting exotic foreign ports looking for opportunities for you. Now, as he begins his journey back, he'll join Venus as an evening star. The action-planet, Mars, is filling his sails and sending him on his way. This is a turning point for you where rubber hits the road.\n\nThat big Uranus trine mentioned above is coming into the whole picture from Taurus and offering new ways of dealing with things. He'll bring innovation, epiphanies and eureka moments. Every problem has a solution. It's all going to work out.\n\nHere is your horoscope for the week of Monday, September 2, 2019.\n\nAries\n\nOrdeals, challenges and difficulties, do they ever stop?

Herein lies the kernel of a new opportunity that will lead to something really good.\n\nTaurus\n\nYou've got an action-packed agenda and demanding situations to deal with.
