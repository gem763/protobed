The fund has a five-star rating from Morningstar Inc. and has ranked in the top 5% of its peer group since its inception at the start of 2016, according to the research firm.\n\nHe also knows that investors often give up on any investment style when its performance lags behind that of others. While value investing has underperformed during the current bull market of more than a decade, it always pays off eventually for investors who stick with it, Mr. Greenblatt says; no style works, he says, for investors who give it up after periods of underperformance.\n\n\u201cBuying the cheapest stocks still works,\u201d says Mr. Greenblatt, who is 61. \u201cCall it value if you want to, but to me it\u2019s the way I invest.\u201d\n\nThe author of several books\u2014including \u201cThe Little Book That Beats the Market\u201d and \u201cThe Big Secret for the Small Investor\u201d\u2014Mr. Greenblatt may be the best-known value investor this side of Warren Buffett, and is widely seen as the likely successor to him as the de facto spokesman for the buy-it-at-a-discount style of investing.\n\nHere are edited excerpts from a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWSJ: Value investing means different things to different people. What does it mean to you?\n\nMR. GREENBLATT: It does not mean low price-to-book-value, low price-to-sales ratio investing, which is how most people define it.\n\nStocks aren\u2019t pieces of paper that bounce around, they\u2019re ownership shares of businesses that we value and try to buy at a discount. Thinking about it that way, value investing is self-defined: It is actually valuing businesses\u2014the way a private investor values them based on cash flows and expected cash flows\u2014and then trying to buy them at a discount to what those cash flows are worth.\n\nWSJ: Is there any secret sauce that goes with that?\n\nMR. GREENBLATT: We\u2019re looking to get more than our fair share of companies that are undervalued. Good companies in good businesses\u2014meaning they get high returns on capital, they\u2019re growing sales and earnings, they\u2019re relatively cheap and more\u2014are a good place to start hunting, but the key is in the analysis.\n\nWe do a lot of analytical work to make sure the numbers we use are correct. Reported numbers don\u2019t mean as much to us as drilling down and seeing real cash flows and the company\u2019s efficiency of investing money and spending money.\n\nI have taught at Columbia for 23 years, and I make a promise to my students the first day of class that if they do good valuation work on a business, the market will agree with them. I never tell them when that will happen, but in 80% or 90% of the cases, two or three years is enough time for the market to recognize the value of a business if you\u2019ve done a good job valuing it.\n\nAt the end of the day, what matters is that you get the right numbers.\n\nWSJ: With that focus on businesses and fundamentals, does it matter to you at all if the broad market is overvalued?\n\nMR. GREENBLATT: With Gotham Large Value, we have a fund that is 100% long. We\u2019re not taking our exposure down to 20% when we think the market\u2019s expensive or going to 100% invested when we think it\u2019s cheap. We buy\u2014at all times\u2014the cheapest stocks we can find.\n\nRight now, the market is relatively expensive compared to the history we have looked at. We\u2019re in the 16th percentile toward expensive over the last 28 years, meaning the market has been cheaper 84% of the time and more expensive 16% of the time based on data for the S&P 500.\n\nBecause it\u2019s more expensive than normal doesn\u2019t mean that you wouldn\u2019t invest in the market, it means that if the market has averaged 10% returns over the last 28 years, we would expect lower than that. It works out to closer to 4% or 5%. That\u2019s still positive, and buying the cheapest stocks in the S&P 500, we would expect to do better than that.\n\nWSJ: Some people don\u2019t worry about the value in value investing, because they believe all active management is dead. How do you respond to that?\n\nMR. GREENBLATT: I started a talk at Google a number of years ago by saying, \u201cWarren Buffett says most people should index, and I agree with him. But Warren Buffett doesn\u2019t index, and neither do I.\u201d\n\nHow come? Well, most people don\u2019t have the ability to value businesses at a discount and the discipline to hold them. When people can check their returns 30 times a minute on the internet, time horizons shrink, investors are impatient and sell at any sign of underperformance, so they fail to participate in periods of overperformance.\n\nIt\u2019s a great environment for value investors who do their work, but a bad environment for all active management\u2014including what is traditionally classified as value investors\u2014because of people\u2019s lack of patience. Patience is the thing in short supply.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t very good at valuing a business, and they\u2019re not very good at picking managers\u2014another hard art\u2014so they\u2019re left between a rock and a hard place. That\u2019s why they\u2019re better off indexing.\n\nMr. Jaffe is a writer in Boston.
