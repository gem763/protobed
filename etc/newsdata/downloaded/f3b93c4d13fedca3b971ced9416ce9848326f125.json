But the Sutton Island salts are different.\n\nFor one thing, they're mineral salts, not table salt.\n\nThey're also mixed with sediment, suggesting they crystallised in a wet environment - possibly just beneath evaporating shallow ponds filled with briny water.\n\nGiven that Earth and Mars were similar in their early days, Rapin speculates that Sutton Island might have resembled saline lakes on South America's Altiplano.\n\nStreams and rivers flowing from mountain ranges into this arid, high-altitude plateau lead to closed basins similar to Mars' ancient Gale Crater.\n\n(Image: NASA)\n\nLakes on the Altiplano are also heavily influenced by climate in the same way as Gale.\n\n\"During drier periods, the Altiplano lakes become shallower, and some can dry out completely,\" Rapin said.\n\n\"The fact that they're vegetation-free even makes them look a little like Mars.\"\n\nSutton Island's salt-enriched rocks are just one clue among several the rover team is using to piece together how the Martian climate changed.\n\nScientist are also analysing sedimentary layers in rock structures that may reveal when Mars' lakes and rivers disappeared.\n\nEarlier this year, a separate group of scientists claimed rivers bigger and more powerful than those on Earth flowed on Mars later in the planet's history than previously thought.\n\nCuriosity has made a number of observations during its time on Mars, including spikes in methane, which is usually an indicator of life.", "description": "Shallow briny pools on surface of Mars may once have been teeming with life", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis", "Image", "Nasa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538116.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NASA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
