Thanks, millennials!", "language": "en", "text": "\u2018They are turning 30. They\u2019ve had 10 years to be in the workforce. They\u2019ve had 10 years to build a credit score. They\u2019ve had 10 years to meet a significant other and get prepared to build a household. We\u2019re seeing this behavior show up in this millennial demographic which should help buffer the economy from a more significant slowdown.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Tony Dwyer, Canaccord Genuity\u2019s chief market strategist, explaining to CNBC this week why he believes millennials are a critical component of his bullish stance on where the stock market goes from here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big deal,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe peak birth year in the millennials [1990] is almost as big as the peak birth year of the baby boom generation.\u201d\n\nDwyer is looking for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.16% to hit 3,350 by the end of next year. At last check, the broad market gauge was up slightly at 3,013 in Tuesday\u2019s session. The Dow DJIA, +0.17% was barely in the red.\n\nHe is particularly fond of consumer-discretionary stocks, which he believes will benefit from the spending trends of the younger generation.\n\n\u201cIf a household is fully employed, they have income and they can go to the bank and get a home-equity line of credit or credit-card debt or whatever a bank is willing to lend them, you have some pretty consistent spending behavior as we\u2019ve seen over the past 10 years,\u201d Dwyer told CNBC.\n\nWatch the full interview:\n\nDwyer\u2019s views echo those of Smead Capital Management Chief Executive Bill Smead, who explained last week how \u201cincredibly economically impactful things\u201d are about to happen as millennials begin to prioritize necessity spending. Big ticket items, Smead says, will soon be prioritized over \u201cApple AAPL, +0.39% devices, craft beer and Chipotle CMG, -1.11% burritos.\u201d", "description": "Tony Dwyer, Canacccord Genuity chief market strategist, says he believes that millennials are a critical component of his bullish stance on where the stock...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT775_millen_MG_20191022100558.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
