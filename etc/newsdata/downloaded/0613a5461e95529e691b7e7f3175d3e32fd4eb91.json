(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nAs Richard Panik thought about his career-best 22-goal season with the Chicago Blackhawks three years ago, a sly smile crept across his face. The Capitals\u2019 offseason acquisition knows that 44-point season is the standard for his future in Washington \u2014 and he isn\u2019t shying away from it.\n\n\u201cWashington is an offensive team, so there are going to be plenty of opportunities, and I have to execute them,\u201d said Panik, a forward who signed a four-year, $11 million contract with the Capitals in July.\n\nOn his fifth team since he made his NHL debut with the Tampa Bay Lightning during the 2012-13 season, Panik made his Capitals debut Wednesday in a 3-2 preseason win over the St. Louis Blues at Capital One Arena. Panik scored the game-tying goal with the Capitals on a power play with a minute left in the third period. Center Nicklas Backstrom scored the game-winning goal with 6.9 seconds left in the game.\n\nThis season, the 6-foot-1, 208-pound forward is expected to fill the third-line right wing role that Brett Connolly \u2014 who signed with the Florida Panthers on July 1 \u2014 occupied the past three seasons. Playing on a line with center Lars Eller, Connolly had three strong years, including a career-best 22 goals last season. The Capitals are hoping Panik will have a similar offensive resurgence slotted on the third line with Eller and left wing Carl Hagelin. Eller is day-to-day with an upper-body injury.\n\n[Evgeny Kuznetsov\u2019s suspension leaves the Capitals short a center to start the season. Travis Boyd could be the answer.]\n\nPanik tallied 14 goals and 19 assists with the Arizona Coyotes last season, calling it the most consistent campaign of his NHL career. The 28-year-old Slovak averaged 16:37 of ice time, a career high.\n\n\u201cThe style we play in Arizona, I didn\u2019t have much offense, but yeah, I just want to transfer [the consistency] to this season and be ready every game,\u201d Panik said. \u201cIt sounds cliche, but that is what I was struggling with in the past, and I think now I\u2019ve figured it out \u2014 to be there at the right time, right position, and play the game hard.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Panik also will be expected to contribute on the penalty kill, an area Capitals Coach Todd Reirden stressed all last season. The unit struggled last season until the Capitals acquired Hagelin and defenseman Nick Jensen at the trade deadline. With the additions of Panik and forward Garnet Hathaway, the group will look to compensate for offseason departures.\n\nPanik spent nearly 90 minutes on the penalty kill for the Coyotes last season. He had done small stints on the power play and penalty kill with other teams but never had a regular role until last season. Panik drew two holding penalties during Wednesday\u2019s preseason game, with one coming while he was killing a penalty in the first period.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, I didn\u2019t want to play that,\u201d Panik said. \u201cI wanted to play more power play. Now when I am older, I think it gets you more in the game and it gets you to keep moving your feet. You aren\u2019t just sitting on the bench.\u201d\n\n[Brendan Leipsic, on his fifth team since 2015-16, hopes to find a home with the Capitals]\n\nAnd as Panik continues to work on his consistency and adjustments on the ice, his off-ice transition to Washington has been fairly seamless. He moved into the area with his wife, Nikola, and 16-month-old daughter, Lilien. They are staying in a hotel, awaiting the arrival of furniture before they move into their new home.\n\nThe hotel room can be a little small for Lilien, who Panik concedes always has a lot of energy to burn. Panik posted an Instagram story of himself this week holding Lilien at the top of an escalator, her little feet quickly trying to keep up with the fast-moving staircase in a treadmill-like fashion. Lilien had started wandering toward the escalator seconds before, so Panik crouched patiently and held her until she was done experimenting with the foreign contraption.\n\n\u201cI had to hold her, you know. I can\u2019t just let her go. And my wife, she just started videotaping,\u201d Panik said.\n\nAs for the Instagram caption?\n\n\u201c\u2018How to get my kid tired out,\u2019\u201d Panik said. \u201cIt was fun.\u201d\n\nPanik and his wife are expecting another baby in late October. They don\u2019t know the gender of their second child, but after having a girl, Panik can only imagine adding a boy to the mix.\n\n\u201cShe has a lot of energy, but I think boys have more energy,\u201d Panik said with a laugh. Defenseman Radko \u201cGudas, he has a little boy, and he has so much energy, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nPanik knows Gudas from their time playing together in Tampa Bay and in the American Hockey League, where they won the Calder Cup together with the Norfolk Admirals in 2012. Their wives are friends, which has helped ease the transition. Panik also spent time with defenseman Michal Kempny during their stints in Chicago, and Kempny\u2019s girlfriend is close with Panik\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cThat helps with the kid, too,\u201d Panik said. \u201cYou got free babysitters.\"\n\nAnd while having familiar faces in the room can help Panik settle in, on the ice his teammates know what he brings to a Capitals team ready to bounce back from an early playoff exit.\n\n\u201cHe can win the games,\u201d Gudas said. \u201cHe can carry his line. He\u2019s a big, strong, smart player that has a really good shot and really good hockey sense. I always enjoy playing with him and even living with him. So I\u2019m really happy he\u2019s on our team. He\u2019s a good friend, too, so I think he\u2019s going to fit well.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nCapital One Arena revises bag policy to ban backpacks of all sizes\n\nSvrluga: Evgeny Kuznetsov doesn\u2019t need our scorn.
