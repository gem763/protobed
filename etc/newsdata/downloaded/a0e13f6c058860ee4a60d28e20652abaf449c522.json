It is essential to a broad range of technologies, from cutting-edge quantum computing to M.R.I. scanners in hospitals. It has fostered the development of billion-dollar industries, fueled essential lifesaving medical tools, supported work leading to more than 5,000 patents and helped generate multiple Nobel Prizes. In short, it is crucial to innovation.\n\nWithout helium, a lot of scientific research would come to a halt. Hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of technical equipment would be shut down, and the education and training of every student who uses it would cease.\n\nYet due in large part to disruptions in the supply chain \u2014 particularly the continuing economic isolation of Qatar by many of its neighbors \u2014 and unplanned production outages, scientists and engineers across the United States are grappling with shortages and rising prices of liquid helium.\n\nSolving this problem could be an easy bipartisan win for the Trump administration and Congress \u2014 researchers and businesses in every state rely on helium. Our leaders should take steps to help alleviate the shortages and keep America\u2019s innovation train running.", "description": "Liquid helium has helped build billion-dollar industries and generate multiple Nobel Prizes.
