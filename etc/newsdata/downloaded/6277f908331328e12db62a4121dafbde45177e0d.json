He spent four years playing in the minors with limited success before moving on to play receiver at UCF, paving the way for his path to the Texans.\n\nAkins was already 26 when he was drafted by the Texans in the third round of the 2018 draft after playing four seasons for the Knights.\n\nHouston offensive coordinator Tim Kelly thinks his winding trail to the Texans has aided in his transition to the NFL.\n\n\u201cThat definitely stands out. He\u2019s been a professional athlete before, so he\u2019s able to kind of deal with the highs and the lows of what comes along with that,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat helps him really be a steady presence in the tight end room \u2026 (and) he\u2019s really done a good job of being consistent.\u201d\n\nAkins said the daily grind of professional baseball taught him not to dwell on his struggles and always look ahead. He gave up baseball after failing to advance past Class-A in four professional seasons.\n\n\u201cI think baseball, what it really taught me was just control what you can and don\u2019t worry about what you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in baseball it\u2019s a game of failure so \u2026 now I can clear my head and just play. If I know my assignments and do my job, I think it just gives me an advantage to just play relaxed and just go out there and play ball and have fun.\u201d\n\nThat mindset allowed Akins to contribute immediately as a rookie when he appeared in each game with six starts. He caught 17 passes for 225 yards last season last season but never got into the end zone while mostly working as a blocker.\n\nThat changed last week when the 6-foot-4, 243-pound Akins caught his first two career touchdown passes in the second half to help the Texans rally for a 27-20 win over the Chargers.\n\nAfter playing receiver in college, Akins was thrilled to score for the first time in the NFL.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a reward to get the ball after doing all these blocks and going in the trenches and moving bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor.\u201d\n\nKelly said that Akins is very coachable and is always working to get better. So he was also excited when Akins had a chance to be in the spotlight for his performance on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been put in situations where balls have come his way and he\u2019s made the play,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cLast year \u2026 he didn\u2019t really have that many opportunities as far as balls coming his way and for whatever reason, the past couple of weeks the ball has found him and he\u2019s made the most of those opportunities.\u201d\n\nAkins has kept a close eye on the guys he played with during his baseball career and delights to see that many of those players have made it to the majors. He played with current Rangers stars Rougned Odor and Joey Gallo and roots for them. But now that his NFL career has taken off, he rarely misses baseball, becoming wistful only one time a year.\n\n\u201cOnly in October,\u201d he said with a smile referring to the MLB postseason.\n\nBut as October approaches this year he may miss it a little less than normal as he becomes a bigger part of a Texans offense trying to build on its big game against the Chargers. What won\u2019t change is the no-nonsense approach Akins brings to work every day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I\u2019ve always done,\u201d he said. \u201cJust do my job and when they present me with a play I just try to capitalize and do the best I can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Second-year Houston Texans tight end Jordan Akins has a maturity and understanding of being a professional athlete superior to most people with his experience thanks to a career he completed before playing a snap of college football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/texans_chargers_football_19191_c0-176-4214-2632_s1770x1032.jpg?83235509dd2ecf1249b981e214abf8eeb6113b7b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
