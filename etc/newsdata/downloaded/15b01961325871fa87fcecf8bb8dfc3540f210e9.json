They admitted their motivation was their support for abortion-on-demand.\"\n\nThe high-powered progressive lawyer, Debra Katz, made the remarks at the University of Baltimore\u2019s 11th Feminist Legal Theory Conference. Her comments were first quoted in the book \"Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh\" by Ryan Lovelace, which Fox News has obtained.\n\nKAVANAUGH ACCUSER'S LAWYER SAID ALLEGATIONS COULD HELP UNDERMINE ABORTION RULINGS: 'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED CHRISTINE'\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine\u2019s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,\u201d Katz said in the video.\n\n\u201cHe will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important.\"\n\nOn \"The Todd Starnes Show,\" Hemingway added such statements from Katz and the Times should not be surprising.\n\n\"It seems like just another day, and exactly what they do,\" she said.\n\n\"When Carrie and I wrote the book... we talked about how this is the game plan -- you throw out unsubstantiated, unsupported allegations to try to destroy someone. And then, when it doesn't work, you keep the game plan going.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition, Hemingway claimed the continued criticisms of and allegations against Kavanaugh ring similar to that of the 1991 confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nHemingway said many Americans were similarly skeptical of the goings-on in the hearings -- which were overseen by current Democratic presidential candidate and then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del.\n\n\"A vast majority of Americans found [Thomas' accuser Anita Hill] lacking in credibility,\" she claimed.\n\nOn Sunday, The New York Times suddenly made a major revision to the piece concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Kavanaugh \u2014 hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to impeach him.\n\nThe update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim, Harmon Joyce, said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "The New York Times' supposed bombshell allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh are part of a coordinated effort to damage him, according to Mollie Hemingway.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Kavanaugh-Hemmingway.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
