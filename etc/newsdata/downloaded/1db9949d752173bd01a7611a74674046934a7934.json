Before that, she served as deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, where she was a public defender for the Trump administration\u2019s controversial policies at the border.\n\nHer next gig, according to NBC News, will be as press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence. She appears to have plenty of the necessary qualifications for the position, but there is one, in particular, that made her an obvious choice:\n\n\u2018She\u2019s pro-Trump, and that checks all the boxes.\u2019\n\nThat is what one senior administration official who used to work with her at the DHS, told NBC about what makes her a good candidate.\n\nAnother source said \u201cshe impressed a lot of people in the administration with her work in DHS and on the immigration portfolio in the height of media interest.\u201d\n\nBut the internet is much more interested in this tidbit:\n\nPence has hired Katie Waldman, 27, to be his new press secretary, per NBC. She was a spokesperson for DHS under Nielsen, then comms director for Sen McSally. Also worth noting: Waldman is dating Stephen Miller https://t.co/ESjkw3fbyC \u2014 Nick Miroff (@NickMiroff) September 19, 2019\n\nYes, apparently she is dating Stephen Miller, the senior adviser to Trump and White House lightning rod, who\u2019s long been a punching bag on Twitter TWTR, -0.72% , where both names blew up as trending topics Wednesday:\n\nWait, wait...THIS woman is dating Stephen Miller??? pic.twitter.com/kODiL0jFWj \u2014 Meerkats R Pontificating (@MeerkatsRMammal) September 19, 2019\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anyone dating Stephen Miller. \u2014 Charlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) September 19, 2019\n\nIf you are confused about the fact that Stephen Miller has a girlfriend, don\u2019t be. His girlfriend is Pence\u2019s press secretary and supported the zero tolerance policy that resulted in mass family separations. They are a match made in Neo-Nazi hell. \u2014 Ryan Knight \ud83d\uddfd (@ProudResister) September 19, 2019\n\nNot everybody was piling on this aspect of the story, however:", "description": "Katie Waldman is currently the communications director for Arizona Republican Martha McSally.
