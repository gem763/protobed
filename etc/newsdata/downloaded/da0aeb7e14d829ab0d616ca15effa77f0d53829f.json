They Are the Problem,\" was written by attorneys Derecka Purnell and Marbre Stahly-Butts and focuses on the 1994 crime bill signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton. The authors stressed law enforcement is filling prisons at all costs, despite severe overcrowding.\n\n\"The reality is this: The police fill prisons,\" the authors wrote. \"We can\u2019t repair the harm that the 1994 crime bill has done by promoting mass incarceration without reducing the size and scope of the police.\"\n\nThe article concluded, \"Systems of oppression, like slavery, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration, must be reduced and abolished \u2014 not reimagined. Police officers, who primarily put people in cages, are the enforcers of mass incarceration. We must reckon with the reality that the police are part of the problem and stop investing money, power and legitimacy in them.\"\n\nDAN BONGINO SAYS 'FAILED COMMUNIST MAYOR' BILL DE BLASIO IS PUTTING COPS IN DANGER\n\nPurnell and Stahly-Butts decried the 100,000 new police officers the crime bill commissioned and claimed the surge only helped reduce overall crime by 1.3 percent. They also noted a 26 percent drop in overall crime from 1993-2000 but were unwilling to credit law enforcement, instead attributing the drop to pre-school and job programs.\n\n\u201cPolice officers have become the scapegoat of everybody\u2019s problems,\u201d Tatum said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re having a problem, you call the police, when you are the problem, you blame the police and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe article used the topic of incarceration to slam President Trump's recently signed criminal justice reform bill and accused the White House and Congress of not going far enough. It also claimed over 150 black-led groups were against the legislation.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nick Givas contributed to this report.", "description": "Former police officer Brandon Tatum said on Tuesday that a New York Times'\u00a0op-ed calling the\u00a0police\u00a0\"the problem\" is \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\"\u00a0and \u201cdamaging to the reputation of law enforcement.\u201d", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-8.27.45-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
