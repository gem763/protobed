Well aware of the actual start time, my colleagues sat patiently on the floor, working on their laptops with coffee in hand. By the time Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas entered the building to chat with Michel Martin \u2014 and eventually make their way up to the Tiny Desk \u2014 the building was buzzing.\n\nAs the trio approached the desk, they were immediately drawn to the knickknacks and toy instruments scattered throughout the area. They ended up working them into their performance, adding a little childlike flair to three selections from their latest album, Happiness Begins, including \"Only Human\" and a jazzy rework of \"Sucker.\"\n\nIt turns out the date of the performance was also Joe's birthday, so our video producer (and proud Joe-Bro fan), Morgan Noelle Smith brought a cake, and the large crowd serenaded him with \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nThe Jonas Brothers announced their reunion in February after a six-year hiatus and soon dropped a new single, \"Sucker,\" which debuted at number one of the Billboard Hot 100. It was the group's first number one. During their time apart, Kevin focused on family, Nick went solo and Joe formed the band DNCE. But watching their joyful and often playful set at the Tiny Desk, it was clear all the chemistry remains alive and well.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Sucker\"\n\n\"I Believe\"\n\n\"Only Human\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nNick Jonas: vocals, keys, guitar: Joe Jonas: vocals; Kevin Jonas: vocals, guitar; Jack Lawless: drums; Tarron Crayton: bass; Tom Crouch: guitar; Michael Wooten: keys\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Jeremiah Rhodes, Bronson Arcuri, Kara Frame; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR", "description": "The brothers and their backing band gave a playful performance of three tracks from their latest album, Happiness Begins.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/27/jonasbros-charbage_wide-f2966807cc7afa1baebf4d2ec967446ff6cc3b99.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
