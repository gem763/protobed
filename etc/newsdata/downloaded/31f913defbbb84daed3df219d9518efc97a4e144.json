Adding organic matter soon \u2013 compost or well-rotted manure \u2013 gives friendly soil organisms time to work their magic and incorporate the good stuff over the winter.\n\nFirst it helps to understand your soil type and texture, be it clay, sand or loam. For a simple test, grab a handful of damp soil and squish it into a ribbon as you would Play-Doh. If you can form a 10cm+ ribbon it\u2019s clay, water-retentive with a tendency to turn rock solid when dry. Sandy soils fall apart without forming a ribbon at all, leaching nutrients and water faster. Loam soils are a halfway house, forming a short ribbon before falling apart.\n\nWhatever your soil, the solution to shortcomings is always organic matter. Rich in the nutrients plants need to grow, organic matter also retains moisture while binding sand and opening up the structure of claggy clay for good root growth. The traditional method involves digging to a spade\u2019s depth to add organic matter deeper: back-breaking work I have never bothered with. I add it as a mulch, which also helps to suppress weed seedlings.\n\nYou can tell if soil lacks organic matter if it\u2019s light in colour; the darker the better. If your soil needs a lot of improvement, add a 10-15cm layer of organic matter, though for most soils 3-5cm is enough. I find 1.5 tonnes covers 30 sq m of soil in a 5cm layer. But there\u2019s no need to cover every inch of space, crops such as garlic and onions actually prefer poorer soil.\n\nLast autumn I concentrated a 7-8cm depth of compost on my leafy brassica bed. This spot is still rich and won\u2019t need anything extra when I plant potatoes in spring. All gardening is a balancing act.", "description": "Healthy soil leads to healthy veg and, as \u2028we swing into autumn, it\u2019s time to enrich your plot for 2020.", "authors": ["Jack Wallington"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2019/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000211560242-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
