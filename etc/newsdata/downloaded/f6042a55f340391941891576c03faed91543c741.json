(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nMaking the click-through worthwhile: Last night brought some genuine surprises. The first was which candidates brought their A-games when they needed them most; the second was an early endorsement by one of the Democrats\u2019 biggest names; the third was that two candidates are running out of money. Meanwhile, Beto O\u2019Rourke continues to say the quiet part out loud; and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces his intent to snub Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou Can\u2019t Script October \u2014 in Either Baseball or Politics\n\nGenuine surprise of last night, number one: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, two candidates who were starting to slide into irrelevance, had their best nights yet. That may not be enough to get them into the first tier, but at a time when the Democratic primary is getting ready to weed out the riff-raff, both candidates made an unexpectedly strong case that they\u2019ve got something useful to say.\n\n(I write my debate assessments as the debates come to a close and try not to look at other people\u2019s wrap-ups and declarations of the winners and losers before sending them off to be reviewed by the editors for typos. If I echo the conventional wisdom, fine; if I don\u2019t, who cares, and perhaps being one of the first assessments posted online ends up shaping that post-debate conventional wisdom. But whatever happens, I don\u2019t follow the crowd.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotice that Buttigieg is at 12 percent in Iowa in the RealClearPolitics average, and 8.7 percent in New Hampshire. That may not sound like much, but nobody else outside of the big three is anywhere near double digits anywhere. The South Bend mayor\u2019s rise is Exhibit A of counterevidence when other candidates whine that the process is rigged in favor of well-known candidates who have been in politics forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKlobuchar had, until last night, been a strong contender for the biggest \u201cwhy is she running?\u201d status. She wasn\u2019t the biggest centrist or the most progressive, she\u2019s from a state that might, theoretically, be competitive this cycle but isn\u2019t most cycles and up until last night, \u201cMinnesota Nice\u201d appeared to be a synonym for boring. What does Klobuchar do well? It turns out she can politely but firmly poke holes in Warren\u2019s arguments, making the Massachusetts senator\u2019s high-dudgeon \u201cyou\u2019re attacking me because I\u2019m the only one standing up for the people\u201d schtick sound overwrought and ridiculous.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nWhat we saw last night \u2014 particularly in the one-on-one concern-off held by Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke on gun violence \u2014 is that progressive Democrats get really used to being able to play the \u201cI care about people, and you don\u2019t\u201d card against their opponents, and they\u2019re really shocked and indignant when their own style of criticism is turned against them. You get the feeling that Buttigieg really sees O\u2019Rourke as a political dilettante, play-acting at leadership having never had that much executive responsibility in office.\n\nO\u2019ROURKE: Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who march for our lives, who, in fact, came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan that calls for mandatory buybacks, let\u2019s follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let\u2019s do what\u2019s right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The problem isn\u2019t the polls. The problems is the policy. And I don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done.\n\nGenuine surprise of last night, number two: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar are endorsing Bernie Sanders \u2014 Omar already has, AOC will do so in a big Sanders rally in the Bronx Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Ocasio-Cortez was inclined to prefer the field\u2019s most outspoken socialist, but this is a little early, and a shot in the arm just when Sanders campaign needs it. Think about it, Sanders had a heart attack two weeks ago; for a lot of campaigns, that would wrap it up. The Vermont senator was as loud and lively and fired up as ever last night; no doubt he beat back that heart attack by yelling and berating it into submission. Sanders has the most cash on hand, and as I predicted before the heart attack, \u201cSanders will probably have enough financial resources to stay in the presidential race as long has he likes, all the way to the Democratic convention in Milwaukee if he wants.\u201d In most polls, both national and state, he\u2019s in a third place that is respectable but distant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is also really good news for Joe Biden, because the former vice president wants and perhaps needs at least two big progressive alternatives in the race competing for the same voters, and hopefully knocking each other around. The Sanders health scare looked like it was setting up an early Biden-Warren showdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden did not have a great night \u2014 he really hasn\u2019t had any great debate nights this cycle \u2014 and those advantages of having the biggest name and most Democrats\u2019 \u201cdefault choice\u201d are starting to fade. His fundraising is \u201cmeh\u201d \u2014 $9 million cash on hand? For a former veep? \u2014 and the lingering odor from the Hunter Biden deals obviously doesn\u2019t help him. (A more deft candidate would have used Trump\u2019s attacks to make most Americans forget that the primary was still going on.) Biden needs the current status quo \u2014 still the national frontrunner, a close second in Iowa, a close second in New Hampshire, the leader in Nevada, the leader in South Carolina by a wide margin, and most progressives split between Warren and Sanders \u2014 to stay in place.\n\nGenuine surprise of last night, number three: Are the two Texans in the Democratic presidential race about to depart because they\u2019re running out of money? The latest fundraising reports, revealing the campaigns\u2019 cash on hand as of September 30, suggest that another culling is coming soon. It\u2019s mid-October. Longshot campaigns that looked like cute larks or boutique candidates in the spring have had their moment in the sun and are running on fumes. Julian Castro has less than $1 million in the bank. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s down to $3.3 million. The candidates who didn\u2019t qualify for the debate all have less than $2 million. You can\u2019t run campaigns in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina with that kind of money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGenuine surprise of last night, number four: The Washington Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals. I only casually follow baseball, but what\u2019s noteworthy about this year\u2019s Nationals is that they\u2019ve finally made it to the championship after a lot of talent-laden Nationals teams in past years flopped in the playoffs. And it\u2019s ironic that they make to the World Series after mega-slugger Bryce Harper departed the team in free agency. And it\u2019s even more ironic that they\u2019ve made it so far after looking miserable in spring; on May 23, the team had 19 wins and 31 losses.\n\nBeto: Okay, Maybe the Cops Will Have to Confiscate Your AR-15\n\nThis morning, Beto O\u2019Rourke told Joe Scarborough that if people refused to comply with his mandatory buyback of AR-15s, \u201cin that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm.\u201d There are roughly 16 million AR-15s or similar models in private hands in the United States today.\n\nIs it too late to get the Democrats to nominate this guy?\n\nThat\u2019s It. No More Mr. Nice NATO Ally.\n\nI mean it when I say it\u2019s time to begin the process of expelling Turkey from NATO. Our so-called ally is apparently no longer willing to talk: \u201cTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he will refuse to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, who is due to travel to Turkey to argue for a ceasefire in the ongoing Syria conflict.\u201d\n\nLast night, in another one of those moments where you wonder how much Joe Biden understands what\u2019s going on in the world, the vice president declared, \u201cErdogan understands that \u2014 you talk about should he stay in or out of NATO \u2014 he understands if he\u2019s out of NATO, he\u2019s in real trouble.\u201d\n\nDoes he? Does he look, sound, or act like a man who prioritizes staying on good terms with his NATO allies?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about Erdogan for a long, long, long, long time. He\u2019s steadily accumulated more and more power to reach authoritarian status. Turkey jails more journalists than any other country in the world. And now he\u2019s invading a neighboring country, blowing up the forces of a U.S. ally, and in the process releasing Islamic State fighters from prison.\n\nJust what does this guy have to do to get us to believe he\u2019s no longer an ally to NATO or U.S. interests?\n\nADDENDUM: A Morning Jolt reader, perusing coverage of the NBA and China, reminds me of an old Charles Barkley quote: \u201cI can be bought. If they paid me enough, I\u2019d work for the Klan.\u201d\n\nAt the time, we were all pretty sure he was joking.", "description": "Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, two candidates who were starting to slide into irrelevance, had their best nights yet.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
