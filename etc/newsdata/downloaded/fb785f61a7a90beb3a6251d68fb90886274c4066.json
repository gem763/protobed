Not once, but a few times did Justin Trudeau take to brown paint to go native in the heart of some darkness, smiling and cocksure.\n\nIn one photo, the first to surface and broken by Time, Trudeau, then a 29-year-old educator, is \u201cdressed up in an Aladdin costume,\u201d per his own words, at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party thrown by the West Point Grey Academy in 2001. Dark like a scorched corpse, the turbaned Trudeau stares into the camera while his flat, dusky hand clasps the clavicle of a light-skinned companion. The second portrait, reported shortly after the first, shows Trudeau blacked up for a performance of the Jamaican song \u201cDay-O,\u201d most commonly known for its rendition by Harry Belafonte. The third visual is in motion: In the video posted by Global News, a shaggy Trudeau lifts his arms and bares his tongue, playing the savage. And yet another photo from the ill-conceived 2001 affair has been made public.\n\nMore archaeological material may very well meet the public in time, as all of these images have so suddenly (and so conveniently). I have this pet theory that nobody plays the darky just one time.\n\nThese stills are about as exciting as so many clipped and scattered toenails, gross and jagged in their own way but still an unspecial nuisance. Minstrels never died out, and America\u2019s first and perhaps only original art form traveled the globe. The supposed shock, though, is not that the glee of racial masquerade traverses borders, but that this blackened-up face isn\u2019t in keeping with Trudeau\u2019s white benevolent visage \u2014 or that of the supposedly benevolent nation he represents. That surprise belies a certain willful ignorance, as if the white person who says nice things cannot have a racist past \u2014 or present.\n\nI\u2019m Calgary\u2019s Muslim mayor. We can learn from Trudeau\u2019s \u2018brownface\u2019 moment.\n\nOne has to be specially obtuse to miss the symmetry between the smiles of Trudeau\u2019s past and present \u2014 the minstrel and the politician. No sooner was the first image published than supporters and unaffiliated bystanders hurried to defend it. They still argue, in tweeted replies and Facebook comments and wherever else debate can be found online, that the performance is an aberration, no matter how many photographs are added to the pile.\n\nOn Thursday, the Globe and Mail spoke to a conspicuously diverse set of voters out and about in Trudeau\u2019s Papineau, riding for their thoughts on the racist costumes. Though nobody let him have it, the white (or white-passing) among the nine seem to take special care to not only forgive Trudeau, but diminish the significance of blackface \u2014 ultimately suggesting he did nothing worth apology in the first place. \u201cWe should leave in the past what happened in the past,\u201d said a young-looking person named Mo\u00e9ra Lafleur. \u201cI think this whole thing was unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThis preemptive insistence on the harmlessness of the act is a familiar performance of its own. America annually revives its own undeveloped discourse on blackface; this year began with the passion of Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.), who appears in his 1984 medical school yearbook in either blackface or Klan robes (we may never know which). Despite public pressure to resign from major figures within his party, Northam had plenty of support and remains in his post. Who among us hasn\u2019t tittered behind some racial makeup, apologists wonder.\n\nBut neither can so many vocal critics be trusted. In the name of political party crossfire, Republicans lambasted Northam; while responding to the news of the prime minister, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer denounced \u201copen mockery and racism,\u201d calling Trudeau \u201cnot fit to govern this country.\u201d This just days after Scheer pledged a rather forgiving creed on racist and homophobic incidents in his party\u2019s past. This latest scandal from our neighbor to the north amplifies not only a single politician\u2019s personal history, but also the living contradictions of whiteness, progressive or otherwise.\n\nAs Scaachi Koul wrote in the New York Times shortly after Donald Trump took office, \u201cThe idea that Canada is a safe space is a lie \u2014 and an easy one to catch for anyone who has actually lived here as part of a minority group and watched how the country chooses to forget about you.\u201d She reprised this critique for BuzzFeed following the recent hoopla: \u201cOur prime minister has built his reputation on being the Reasonable One, the Non-Trump, the Good Boy. \u2026 But, unfortunately, though Canadians tend to do things with less zeal, it seems our leaders are pulling the same s--- anyway.\u201d\n\nWhat Justin Trudeau's brownface photo says about white ignorance\n\nNot unlike his bromantic partner in memes, our former president Barack Obama, Trudeau has long appropriated the vernacular of radical change without fully interrogating white power. He\u2019s given Trump pats for military violence in Syria and approved a multibillion-dollar pipeline expansion, disturbing some First Nations groups and undermining his environmentalist cred.\n\nCanada under Trudeau remains more hazardous for those exposed to racist citizens and overpolicing (or rather: policing) by the state. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, in a country like Canada, to take diversity for granted,\u201d Trudeau said in 2015. This is true \u2014 if only because politics in the name of diversity never means having to materially improve the conditions of people credited with manifesting diversity for existing.\n\n\u201cIn forty plus years of Canadian multiculturalism,\u201d writes University of Toronto professor Rinaldo Walcott, \u201cdiversity has been largely discredited as a practice, idea, or process that can produce the kinds of social, cultural, political, and economic change and impact that would render the long terrible and brutal history of race and racism null and void.\u201d\n\nWriting for the late publication Grantland, Wesley Morris described what he called \u201cthe trapdoor of racism,\u201d the unexpected reminder that an inoffensive white person is still white, with all attendant baggage. \u201cFor people of color, some aspect of friendship with white people involves an awareness that you could be dropped through a trapdoor of racism at any moment, by a slip of the tongue, or at a campus party, or in a legislative campaign.\u201d The folly, though, is the unconditional trust: something Trudeau never earned from the people who matter most. Where Trudeau is concerned, Americans should feel foolish for being surprised that the politician who is neither a friend to us nor many of his people took racism for a spin more times than he can recall. It shouldn\u2019t have taken blackface to show us that. But, then again, nothing feels so solid as the split moment before a fall.", "description": "He never earned unconditional trust from the people who matter most.", "authors": ["Lauren Michele Jackson", "Lauren Michele Jackson Teaches In The Departments Of English", "African American Studies At Northwestern University.
