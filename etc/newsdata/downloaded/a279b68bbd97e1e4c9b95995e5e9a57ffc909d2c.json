LOUIS (AP) - Howie Kendrick just missed the cycle but he will take the win instead for the Washington Nationals.\n\nKendrick finished a double shy of hitting for a cycle, Patrick Corbin pitched six strong innings, and the Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-2 Tuesday night.\n\nKendrick flew out in his third at-bat and walked in his last at-bat.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a chance to do it,\u201d Kendrick said about hitting for the cycle. \u201cIn that last at-bat, I would have liked to have a chance to hit. If it\u2019s meant to be, it would have happened. We are all pulling for each other. All these games are big and it\u2019s nice to get a win. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis leads the NL Central by two games over the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers, and the Nationals hold the NL\u2019s top wild card by 1 1/2 games over the Cubs and Brewers.\n\nCorbin (13-7) struck out 11 while giving up two unearned runs and five hits in six innings. He walked four in his second win in two starts at Busch Stadium. The last one came May 20, 2016, when he pitched for the Diamondbacks.\n\n\u201cI felt really good all night. I had good fastball command on both sides of the plate and my slider was really good,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cThey came out and they\u2019re pretty aggressive so I was able to use that pitch a little bit more. They\u2019re a great team over there. You make a mistake and you\u2019ll pay.\u201d\n\nDaniel Hudson got the last six outs for his fourth save.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got one of the best pitching staffs in the league. Period,\u201d Kolten Wong said. \u201cCorbin\u2019s one of the best lefties in the game. He kept us off-balance. He did his thing.\u201d\n\nMiles Mikolas (9-14) pitched six innings before he was lifted for a pinch-hitter. He allowed three runs on eight hits and became the first Cardinals pitcher to lose 14 games in a season since Braden Looper went 12-14 in 2008.\n\nKendrick hit a solo homer in the fourth, giving Washington a 2-1 lead. Since returning from the injured list on Aug. 12, Kendrick is hitting. 466 (27 for 58) with seven doubles, four homers, 13 RBIs, four walks and 14 runs scored in 23 games. His 16 home runs this season are most since he hit a career-high 18 in 2011 when he played for the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nJuan Soto led off the sixth with a double. The play was close at second and St. Louis challenged the safe call. The decision stood after a review of 1 minute, 29 seconds. He later scored on a two-out single by Victor Robles to extend Washington\u2019s lead to 3-1.\n\nThe Cardinals made it 3-2 in the sixth when Harrison Bader stole second as pinch-hitter Jose Martinez struck out. The throw by Yan Gomes went into center for an error and Tommy Edman scored from third.\n\nRobles drove in a run in the eighth on a single and Gomes hit an RBI double to give the Nationals a 5-2 edge. Washington added a run in the ninth on a sacrifice fly by Soto.\n\nSt. Louis loaded the bases with one in the third but only managed one unearned run to tie it 1-1. Mikolas scored on an error by shortstop Trea Turner with two outs.\n\n\u201cPatrick Corbin had the bases loaded there. It was a fantastic job of pitching to give up just the one run,\u201d said Chip Hale, who is filling for the ailing manager Dave Martinez. \u201cThat was a pivotal part of the game.\u201d\n\nWashington took a 1-0 lead in the second. Kendrick led off with a triple that hit the wall in center. He scored on Asdrubal Cabrera\u2019s sacrifice fly.\n\nLOTS OF STRIKEOUTS\n\nCorbin\u2019s 11 strikeouts pushed his season total to 224. Corbin along with Stephen Strasburg (235) and Max Scherzer (222) have helped the Nationals become the first National League team in National League history to have at least three pitchers record at least 222 strikeouts in a season.\n\nHOMER HAPPY\n\nKendrick\u2019s home run in the fourth was the 215th homer this season for the Nationals. It ties a franchise record set in 2017. Washington has 10 players with at least 10 home runs this year, tied for second in the National League with the Chicago Cubs and behind the Los Angeles Dodgers (11).\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: Martinez, who turns 55 on Sept. 26, remains in the hospital. Martinez, who is in his second season managing the Nationals, had a diagnostic procedure called a cardiac catheterization performed Monday in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more energy in the voice and I think they\u2019re just doing a few more tests,\u201d Hale said Tuesday before the game. \u201cHe\u2019s resting and as soon as he can travel he\u2019ll be with us.\u201d\n\nCardinals: C Matt Wieters (left calf strain) has been out since Aug. 31. He has responded well doing baseball activities the last two days. \u201cWieters is cleared,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cHe\u2019s available.\u201d Wieters gives Shildt a left-handed hitting option off the bench. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really had it,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have that as an option.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: Max Scherzer (10-6, 2.65)is a St. Louis native. In four career starts in Missouri, Scherzer has pitched 25 innings and allowed four earned runs for a 1.44 ERA. He\u2019s struck out 35 with just four walks.\n\nCardinals: Adam Wainwright (12-9, 4.00) worked a season-high 6 1/3 innings in a 3-2 win over the Nationals on April 30 in Washington. He has started opposite Scherzer only once in his career - a 4-2 home win on Sept. 24, 2008, when Scherzer was with the Diamondbacks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Howie Kendrick just missed the cycle but he will take the win instead for the Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Warren Mayes"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/nationals_cardinals_baseball_26797_c0-197-4697-2935_s1770x1032.jpg?7a8f0d3e49685b2d7234a81bb93a1520ecdfe18b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
