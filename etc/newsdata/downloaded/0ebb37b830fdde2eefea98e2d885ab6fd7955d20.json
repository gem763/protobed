Our chief white house correspondent Jon Karl joins us now. It would be unprecedented. No administration has ever tried to take away a state's authority to regulate its own air quality. Reporter: It would be, George. The state of California has been regulating emissions setting a stricter standard since the 1960s. Now the trump administration is poised to take that away requiring California to go along with the more lenient standards dictated by the trump EPA. It's a move that would appear inconsistent with the trump administration's embrace of the power of states to do all sorts of other regulations from abortion to guns, but the administration says that they are doing this because California with its huge car market was effectively imposing their standard on the rest of the country. But, George, the administration is certainly going to face court challenges. There's no question about it. It's one of a series of actions the administration has taken to weaken climate change regulations and to take on the state of California on a number of fronts. They're clearly going to take this to court. Reporter: If you look at the attorney general of the state of California, by the way, he's already said he will go to court on this, he has challenged the administration in court on a whole range of issues ranging from education to immigration and down the line. This one is almost certain to go to the supreme court. Jon Karl, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "President Trump is setting up a major confrontation over climate change that is likely to go all the way to the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190918_gma_karl1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
