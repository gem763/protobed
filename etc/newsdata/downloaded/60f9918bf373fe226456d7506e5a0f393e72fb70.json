That could be great news for Walmart.\n\nWalmart (ticker: WMT) doesn\u2019t report earnings until Nov. 14, more than two weeks from now. The company is expected to report a profit of $1.09 a share on sales of $128.5 billion, and it better surpass those numbers if it knows what\u2019s good for it: Its stock has gained 6.1% during the past three months and 28% in 2019. That\u2019s a lot of good news already reflected in its $119.10 price.\n\nWe\u2019re feeling pretty confident that Walmart can do what it needs to do.\n\nAs Walmart has ratcheted up its online business, it has also gotten better at using all of its assets to make it work, writes Gordon Haskett Research Advisors analyst Chuck Grom. He points to Walmart\u2019s grocery pickup and delivery, its health clinics, and its other initiatives to help draw new customers in while giving existing ones even more reasons to shop there. \u201cIn the near term, this is unequivocally helping comps, and when we think ahead over the next five to 10 years, Walmart\u2019s focus on building out that ecosystem could pay dividends for many years to come,\u201d Grom explains.\n\nStill, we\u2019re more concerned about what happens in a couple of weeks, and that is where Procter & Gamble (PG) comes in. P&G reported its results this past week, and they were lights out. Earnings per share came in at $1.37, on sales of $17.8 billion, easily topping forecasts for $1.25 and $17.4 billion, respectively. Better yet, P&G raised the top end of its 2020 organic-growth range and lifted its earnings guidance. P&G stock gained a well-deserved 4.9% for the week.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with Walmart? After all, it\u2019s a retailer, while Procter & Gamble manufactures consumer goods. Those businesses aren\u2019t as distinct as they might seem. Walmart sells P&G products\u2014lots of them. In fact, it accounts for some 15% of P&G\u2019s sales, notes Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman, so if P&G is doing well, there\u2019s a good chance that Walmart is, too. Furthermore, Gutman says, the correlation between Walmart\u2019s \u201ccomps\u201d and Procter\u2019s organic-volume growth on a trailing-five-year basis has climbed above 70%, from negative 20% in 2016.\n\nGutman acknowledges that P&G isn\u2019t a perfect read-through for Walmart. Walmart, for instance, sells groceries, which Procter doesn\u2019t make, while P&G\u2019s international sales make up 60% of total revenue, compared with just 25% for Walmart.\n\nStill, the two companies have something else in common that makes Walmart a good bet: their size. \u201cSince around 2015, both companies\u2019 top-line trajectories have trended in a similar direction,\u201d Gutman writes. \u201cWe believe the convergence in growth trends we are witnessing, with P&G and Walmart both displaying stronger top-line growth, reaffirms the view that large companies are better leveraging scale to gain share across the consumer landscape.\u201d\n\nAnd it may be doing so just when Amazon, every retailer\u2019s biggest boogeyman, no longer looks so invincible. Amazon\u2019s shares dropped 1% on Friday after it missed earnings expectations, as operating margins fell to 3% from 4% due, in part, to higher shipping costs. Yet even before its earnings miss, Amazon looked as if it was playing catch-up. Its stock price has dropped 3.5% during the past 12 months, even as Walmart has gained 20% and Target (TGT) has climbed 31%.\n\nWe won\u2019t know for two weeks, but don\u2019t be surprised if the good times continue for Walmart.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "Walmart stock has gained 28% in 2019, and the retailer\u2019s initiatives can attract new customers and give existing ones more reasons to shop there.
