Both have continuously swayed since the under-construction building's collapse on Oct. 12, which left three dead and dozens injured.\n\nExperts are using small explosives, known as energetic materials, to bring the cranes down.\n\nGerald Herbert/AP\n\nThe goal is that they will come down in the same place as they are standing. However, McConnell noted that because of how unstable the cranes are, they might not fall as experts hope.\n\n\"That's our goal, but it may not happen that way,\" he said.\n\nGerald Herbert/AP Photo\n\nResidents in the nearby area will be evacuated starting four hours before the crane's official demolition.\n\nThe bodies of two men who died are still inside the building. Authorities have not been able to reach them but hope that they will be able to recover the bodies.\n\nOfficials have not yet said what caused the collapse. Ten of the victims injured filed a lawsuit Friday against five companies involved in the construction, citing negligence.", "description": "The demolition of the cranes at the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans has been delayed.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hard-rock-01-as-ap-191019_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
