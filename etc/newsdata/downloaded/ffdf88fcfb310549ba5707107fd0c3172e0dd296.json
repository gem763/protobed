(Hannah Natanson/The Washington Post)\n\nUrine. Graffiti. Broken windows. Roaming gangs of teenagers who harass passersby in shadowy stairwells.\n\nFor more than a decade, this has been the experience of many commuters who use the parking garage at the Wheaton Metro station.\n\n\u201cThe smell of urine, I\u2019m pretty sure, is soaked into the concrete at this point,\u201d said Erin Mulcare, who stopped using the garage two years ago after her car was broken into. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so upsetting that in 10 years, nothing has changed.\u201d\n\nOver the years, commuters and neighborhood residents have repeatedly raised the alarm about conditions at the garage. They\u2019ve asked elected officials and Metro to install unbreakable plexiglass windows, new lighting and security cameras, and to increase the police presence.\n\nNow, in response to \u201ccommunity concerns,\u201d Metro said it plans to install security cameras \u201cthroughout the garage\u201d by the end of the year.\n\n\"In addition, the garage will undergo a major rehabilitation project beginning next spring that will include brighter paint, the installation of additional emergency phones, and transparent doors to enhance safety in stairwells,\" Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said in an email.\n\nJannetta said Metro has not determined the cost of the project, which will be funded from the agency\u2019s capital budget. Asked why Metro did not act earlier to address complaints about the garage, Jannetta said the agency had not considered Wheaton \u201cfor cameras in the past because its crime rate is quite low relative to other locations.\u201d\n\nThe garage has seen no crimes \u201cagainst persons\u201d so far this year and just four \u201cproperty crimes,\u201d Jannetta said \u2014 three instances of vandalism and one incident involving \u201cdestruction of property.\u201d\n\nAsked about crime at the garage, Metro Transit Police pointed to Metro\u2019s numbers. A spokeswoman for the Montgomery County Police Department, which partners with Metro to patrol the garage, said it is impossible to determine exact police statistics for the site because the department\u2019s online incident-tracking system cannot differentiate between the garage, the station itself and the nearby mall.\n\n[Metro\u2019s new parking policy and fees get pushback from suburbs]\n\n\n\nA stairwell in the Wheaton station garage. (Sean Corbett)\n\nHowever, the garage was the scene of several high-profile crimes over the past four years, including two sexual assaults committed by the same man in December 2014. Christian A. Jordan was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the assaults.\n\nIn July 2015, a man was fatally shot in the garage; his killer received a 20-year sentence. And a few months later, four carjackers attacked and robbed a man walking through the garage. The carjackers were never found.\n\nThe Wheaton garage, one of 44 parking facilities Metro owns and maintains adjacent to its stations, has 977 spots. Daily parking costs $4.45 Monday through Friday and is free on weekends and holidays.\n\nSilver Spring resident Sean Corbett, who has parked in the garage to ride Metro to his job since 2008, said he is certain Metro is underestimating crime at the facility. He said he reached that conclusion while serving on a \u201csafety task force\u201d of residents and politicians commissioned to study Wheaton\u2019s downtown in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt became very clear that a lot of things that should be reported as issues are not reported,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cFor example, vandalism like graffiti \u2014 often they don\u2019t report it; they just send in a crew and scrub it away or paint over it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what happened earlier this month, Corbett said, when he alerted Metro to graffiti left in a stairwell that included profanity and an anti-gay slur.\n\n\n\nResidents say broken windows in the Wheaton station garage don\u2019t stay fixed for long. (Sean Corbett)\n\nCorbett said he was pleased that the agency sent someone to paint over the scrawled words within a day or so. Jannetta said \u201ccomplaints related to graffiti and cleanliness are addressed as quickly as possible, and within hours in the case of offensive or hateful content.\u201d\n\nBut such temporary fixes are ultimately inadequate, Corbett said. He called them stopgap measures unlikely to do much to address overarching, recurring issues of vandalism, disrepair and crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blight, honestly, and when you walk into the garage you can feel it: It\u2019s grimy, it\u2019s dingy, it\u2019s dark,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last year or so, it feels like conditions within the garage have just been deteriorating further and further \u2014 but that graffiti was just a line too far for me.\u201d\n\nIn addition to contacting Metro, Corbett also reached out to state Del. Emily K. Shetty (D-Montgomery). Shetty, who lived in Silver Spring for five years, said she used the Wheaton garage \u201cthousands of times.\u201d She was already concerned about the facility and had advocated for improvements while serving on a local transit advocacy group.\n\nBoth Corbett and Shetty said they know scores of neighbors who, like Mulcare, stopped parking in the Wheaton garage out of disgust over the state of the facility or concern for their safety. The topic comes up at almost every Wheaton community meeting and town hall, Corbett said. Shetty described a long history of \u201clingering complaints and little action\u201d from Metro.\n\n[Red Line documentary takes deeper look at graffiti along the tracks in Northeast Washington]\n\n\n\nThe Wheaton Metro station parking garage on Sept. 12, 2019. (Hannah Natanson/The Washington Post)\n\nStill, after Corbett emailed her about the graffiti this month, Shetty decided she would give it one more try and contact Metro herself. As a newly empowered delegate (Shetty took office this year), she thought she might have a better shot at spurring action.\n\nWhen Shetty reached out, Metro informed her of its intention to install security cameras and renovate the garage. That was the first Shetty \u2014 or any other residents \u2014 heard of the agency\u2019s plans, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful they\u2019re doing all of these needed repairs to the facility, but I would love to see the garage moved up in the calendar,\u201d Shetty said. \u201cAfter at least 10 years, it\u2019s not surprising that many in the community feel very frustrated at the pace at which Metro is undertaking these repairs.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Arias has lived in Silver Spring for about 30 years, and she\u2019s used the Wheaton garage \u2014 which opened in 1990, according to Metro \u2014 almost as long.\n\nArias used to pass through the garage and its pedestrian bridge almost weekly on her way to shop for groceries at the Westfield Wheaton mall. That changed two years ago, she said, when she was harassed by a group of teenagers who yelled anti-Hispanic slurs at her while she crossed the bridge.\n\nSince that night, Arias said, she either shops at another, less convenient grocery store or waits until the weekend, when her husband can accompany her.\n\n\u201cThat bridge, the garage, the windows are broken, there\u2019s trash everywhere, it looks abandoned,\u201d Arias said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why those kids \u2014 why people feel free to do bad things. They just know nobody is coming.\u201d\n\nMontgomery County police and Metro said they \u201cregularly\u201d send officers to patrol the garage. Montgomery police said they had no plans to increase surveillance; Metro said it does not \u201crelease details regarding police patrols or deployment strategies.\u201d", "description": "Commuters say the parking garage at the Wheaton Metro station is covered in urine and graffiti, emboldening errant gangs of teens to harass passersby.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
