Sign up here.\n\nSerbia\u2019s plan to join a Russian-led economic union is drawing ire from the European Union, which the Balkan nation says it wants to be part of.\n\nThe EU\u2019s executive commission has made clear that Serbia will have to cancel any bilateral trade agreements with other countries if and when it joins the EU, and leaders said they\u2019d rather see Belgrade aligning its policies more with the bloc\u2019s. Serbian officials have ignored the criticism and will sign a deal to join the Eurasian Economic Union on Oct. 25. The Russian-led bloc also includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe plan is \u201cnot a hindrance to European integration,\u201d Serbian Trade Minister Rasim Ljajic said by email last week. The European Commission\u2019s warning isn\u2019t going to \u201caffect Serbia\u2019s decision to enter into this agreement in Moscow,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EU has no say over which groups Serbia joins while it\u2019s not a member, but some of its representatives indicated they would like to see greater commitment to membership, especially after an EU progress report earlier this year showed that Serbia was only partially aligning its foreign and security policies with the EU\u2019s.\n\nSerb leaders have said that EU membership is a priority, a goal they hope to achieve around the middle of next decade. At the same time, Serbia has historic and religious ties with Russia, which is helping it prevent the further recognition of Kosovo in international bodies. Additionally, Russia has donated fighter jets and tanks to Serbia and Serb leaders, including President Aleksandar Vucic, are frequent visitors to Moscow.\n\n\u2018European Orientation\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be marching in several directions at the same time,\u201d Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, who spent years working in the Balkans, said last month in Helsinki. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about your European orientation then obviously you make political decisions that bring you closer to it. This is not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Union, established by Russian President Vladimir Putin to create a rival to the EU\u2019s open market and help rebuild Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union, has four other members aside from Russia.\n\nEconomists in Belgrade have also questioned the benefit of the trade membership for Serbia, whose main export markets are in western Europe, not in the east.\n\n\u201cRussia accounts for only one quarter of what we export to Germany and Italy,\u201d said Ivan Nikolic, an economist and member of central bank\u2019s advisory council. \u201cWe are accessing a new market but the question is what we can offer. We are exporting food products, and fruit and vegetables, but we are not price competitive.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add details on trading bloc in second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Gordana Filipovic in Belgrade at gfilipovic@bloomberg.net;Misha Savic in Belgrade at msavic2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrea Dudik at adudik@bloomberg.net, Michael Winfrey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
