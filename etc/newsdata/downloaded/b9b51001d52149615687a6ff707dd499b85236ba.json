It was a Friday night in Sayre, Okla., a town of fewer than 3,000 people on the old Route 66. He told his family he was heading to a high-school football game in nearby Elk City. The trio was last seen by friends at a bowling alley.\n\nThe beginning of the night could have been a John Cougar Mellencamp song. But how it ended was a mystery. The sleek muscle car carrying three teenagers simply vanished. Law enforcement officials stumbled on it last year \u2014 four decades later \u2014 while testing sonar equipment at Foss Lake, a recreation area about 20 miles on the other side of Elk City, where Williams told his family he was heading.\n\nLast week, DNA testing confirmed suspicions the bodies were those of the missing teens: Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, all of Sayre.\n\nThe mud-caked Camaro was submerged in just 12 feet of water, about 50 feet from the end of a boat ramp. It was found alongside a 1950s Chevrolet. Strangely, that car was connected with an earlier but supposedly unrelated missing persons case. It contained the bodies of Cleburn Hammack, 42, John Alva Porter, 69 and Nora Marie Duncan, 58, who disappeared in 1969 after they stopped to ask for help getting their car started. They were all from nearby towns.\n\n\n\nThe road that dead ends at the ramp intersects another road about 700 feet from the lake\u2019s edge. To some, it seemed unlikely local kids would have turned off the main road and driven across a small parking lot into the lake.\n\n\n\nThree teens missing from Sayre, Okla., since Nov. 20, 1970, From left: Jimmy Allen Williams, Leah Gail Johnson and Thomas Michael Rios.

For years he had taken his boat to Foss Lake without a clue he was just feet from the watery grave.\n\n\u201cI could have touched the top of their car. I was that close to them,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s an unbelievable thought to know they were that close all this time and took nearly 40 years to realize it.\u201d\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019s body was found along with brown cowboy boots, his bank card and a 1972 gold-colored Sayre High Eagles ring.\n\nAccording to CBS, authorities said accidental drowning was the probable cause of death, doing little to shed light on the mystery that has hung like a dark cloud over the dust bowl town for decades.\n\n\u201cEveryone suspected foul play,\u201d Dayva Spitzer, publisher of the Sayre Record and a longtime resident, told the AP in 2013 after the car was pulled from the lake. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about it for 43 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the kids were frightened by it, and we didn\u2019t talk about it much,\u201d said Gayla Splinter, who lived in nearby Erick when the teens went missing. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a mystery.\u201d\n\nNothing remains of the initial investigation into the case, if there was one. According to the AP, the Sayre Police Department doesn\u2019t have any records from the 1970s. All they have is a missing persons report listing each teen\u2019s name, age, height, weight, birth date and race.\n\nWilliams told the Oklahoman the cops thought Jimmy and his friends ran away \u2014 perhaps to join the counterculture, not an uncommon occurrence in the Vietnam era. But that didn\u2019t make sense to the Williams family. Jimmy hadn\u2019t taken any of his clothes and was expecting a paycheck from the local grocery store where he worked on Saturday.\n\nJimmy\u2019s family posted handbills offering $500 for information on their son\u2019s disappearance. The family even consulted a psychic, Tulsa World reported.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, Betty Williams baked her son a birthday cake every year in case he turned up.\n\nLucia VanZandt, whose brother Thomas died, told the AP their mother \u201cdidn\u2019t ever want to leave Sayre because she told us if Thomas came back, he\u2019d be looking for us.\u201d\n\nGary Williams told the Oklahoman newspaper the discovery does provide some closure, but he still isn\u2019t sure the deaths were accidental. \u201cI think they came across some bad people,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think it was foul play, but I\u2019ll never be able to prove that.\u201d", "description": "More than 40 years after they disappeared, DNA testing has confirmed that bones found in a Camaro at the bottom of a lake are those of Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, all of Sayre, Okla.", "authors": ["Gail Sullivan", "October", "Gail Sullivan Covers Business For The Morning Mix Blog."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7X-cc3tJBVgiDvyRftTcEZvnrx8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZCVRWWJI7A3HFLC326XVWLHAJE.jpg"}
