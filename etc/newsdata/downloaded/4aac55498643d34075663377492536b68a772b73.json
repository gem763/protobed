The pair share son Croyde, 16 and two daughters, Kili, 10, and eight-year-old Trixie.\n\nThe star insists that while they have a rollercoaster relationship, their kids are always their priority.\n\n'We\u2019ve got three children. Our eldest is 16 and the girls are 8 and 10. That\u2019s very demanding and you have to remain amicable for the sake of the children.'\n\n'Even if on days when you really just want to hire an assassin and take each other out. Which I think, anybody getting divorced, you do have those days, course you do.'\n\nCandid: Speaking on Monday's Lorraine Beverley, 45, said that while the exes are now on good terms for the sake of their children, there are 'days when you really want to hire an assassin'\n\n'But we know, bigger picture, the children are more important than anything.'\n\nTheir marriage broke down in the years following James' devastating brain injury in 2000.\n\nJames suffered terrible head injuries when he was hit by the wing mirror of a truck while cycling across America. The damage to the frontal lobe of his brain affected his personality, with Beverley explaining:\n\n'He was very different,' adding though that she's amazed by his recovery. 'He\u2019s come an incredibly long way in that period of time.'\n\n'It culminated in him going to university and getting his Masters.' It was while studying for his Masters at Cambridge that James met new girlfriend American financier Jordan Connell.\n\nFamily: Beverley and James divorced in March after 17 years of marriage, and while they have a rollercoaster relationship, their kids are always their priority Beverley explained\n\nJordan, who is in her early 30s, spent 12 months studying for an MBA at the prestigious university before returning to her native city of New York.\n\nShe is now understood to split her time between London and the US, and was seen supporting James during his ill-fated stint on Strictly last month.\n\nBeverley pointed out that it's positive that James has met someone new who didn't know him before his injury.\n\n'The great thing is that he\u2019s met somebody who didn\u2019t know him before the accident,' she told Lorraine.\n\nStill friends: The TV presenter added that she's happy the sportsman, 47, has found love again with a new girlfriend\n\n'[If you knew him before] you\u2019re constantly looking for the first person. You see differences. If you didn\u2019t know him before, you\u2019d probably think he was perfectly normal. But scruffy and clearly can\u2019t dance, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily think, that\u2019s a guy with a brain injury.'\n\nBeverley added that James, who was the first celeb to be voted off Strictly last month, has always suffered from low self-esteem, explaining: 'I\u2019ve always said, show me a room of Olympic gold medallists and I\u2019ll show you a room of people with very low self-esteem. I love watching sport but those individuals are not necessarily easy to live with, whether they\u2019re male or female.'\n\n'That single-mindedness determination can be a wonderful thing but it can also mean you\u2019re sat on your own on a beach for three hours. I didn\u2019t want to live that life anymore. We weren\u2019t setting a good example for the kids on what a relationship should look like.'\n\nNew love: James has been dating American financier Jordan after meeting during their studies at Cambridge University\n\nBeverley has also moved on from the marriage and is currently dating James Pritchett, a 31-year-old eco-housing property developer.\n\nThe couple, who recently attended Chris Evans' Carfest event, were introduced by mutual friends and have been on several dates over the last two months.\n\n'It's early days, younger man, what\u2019s not to like?' she teased. 'One of the challenges as a divorced woman is finding time for everything. We\u2019re left sorting out the P.E kits and swimming bags and who needs to be where. Having a relationship in that environment is really challenging.'\n\n'I have to say, \u2018I can\u2019t be around\u2019 and he\u2019s unbelievably understanding. He said, \u2018I always knew you came as a package of four\u2019.'She added: 'If I can fit some fun in my week, so much the better.'", "description": "Beverley Turner has admitted it's been tough reaching an amicable relationship with her ex husband James Cracknell.", "authors": ["Joanna Crawley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19389948-0-image-a-12_1570444420050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
