The tax measure is part of the Conservative Party's overall climate plan, which includes a vow to repeal the Liberal government's carbon tax.\n\nInsurance and relocation supports\n\nThe Liberals are also promising to:\n\nCreate a low-cost national flood insurance program to help homeowners in high-risk flood zones who don't have adequate insurance protection. According to the Liberal Party, claims in Canada related to severe weather are four times higher now than in 2008, averaging $1.8 billion a year in the last decade.\n\nWork with provinces and territories to complete flood maps so Canadians understand the risks of buying home in risky areas. Liberals are offering a $150 million investment for that initiative over the next three years.\n\nDevelop a national action plan to help homeowners at highest risk of repeat flooding with potential relocation.\n\nWork with stakeholders and experts to design an Employment Insurance Disaster Assistance Benefit to help people whose jobs and livelihoods are negatively affected by disaster.\n\nAccording to the Liberal Party, the gross cost of the measures would be about $370 million in 2020-21, increasing to $432 million in 2023-24. Costs associated with retrofits and the Net Zero Home Grant would be financed through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation by drawing down on the Crown corporation's shareholder equity.\n\nCosts for training and flood mapping would be paid out of the government's general revenues, costing an estimated $70 million net in 2020-21, decreasing to $20 million by 2023-24, according to the party.\n\nThe Liberal Party has not yet released any independent costing analysis of its campaign promises from the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), as the Conservatives and NDP have done. The party repeatedly has said that further costing will be announced \"over the course of the campaign.\" Earlier today, the Green Party released its fully costed platform with analysis from the PBO.\n\nA couple surveys floodwaters from behind a row of sandbags on the street in an east end community of Ottawa, Wednesday, May 1, 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nToday's announcement is the second in what's expected to be a series of Liberal platform promises related to action on climate change.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trudeau announced that a re-elected Liberal government would halve the corporate tax rate for companies that develop or manufacture products with zero emissions \u2014 part of the party's plan to move to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nNet-zero emissions plan\n\nEligible sectors could include manufacturing related to renewable energy, production of renewable fuels, zero emission vehicles and batteries for them, carbon capture and removal technology and electric vehicle charging systems.\n\nIt's part of the Liberal promise to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050. The European Union and other countries made the same climate pledge at the United Nations in New York City this week.\n\nThe Liberal Party's plan is to set legally-binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions in 30 years. The party says the net-zero plan would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians.\n\nNet-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees.", "description": "Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is promising Canadians access to interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace\u00a0leaky windows or retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient and resilient to floods and wildfires caused by climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295588.1569347814!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-liberals-20190924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
