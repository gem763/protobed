Just a few hours later, he got his wish.\n\nThe Raiders released the mercurial All-Pro wide receiver, the conclusion of an unprecedented and stunning series of events this summer that finally came to a head this week.\n\nThere were reports earlier in the week that he had threatened to punch general manager Mike Mayock, called him a \u201ccracker\u201d and contemptuously punted a football away, daring Mayock to fine him. Brown later apologized to the team, which appeared to finally put the issues behind him.\n\nBut then Brown posted a video to YouTube Friday night that included snatches of a phone conversation with head coach Jon Gruden that Brown apparently taped. He followed up Saturday morning with a message on Instagram that concluded with, \u201cRelease me @raiders.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2018 season, Brown was fed up with the Pittsburgh Steelers and requested a trade. The Steelers dealt Brown to Oakland in March for third- and fifth-round draft picks. Brown lasted almost six months with the Raiders and did not play in a game for the team.\n\nBefore Brown\u2019s request for a release, the Raiders informed him that due to his fines for conduct detrimental to the team, he would not be eligible for termination pay if released. They also voided $29 million in guaranteed money. The sports contract-tracking website Spotrac reported that the Raiders have not paid Brown a dime, because even his signing bonus was contingent on reporting to a certain percentage of the team\u2019s offseason program.\n\nDrew Rosenhaus, Brown\u2019s agent, told NFL Network Saturday that Brown still wants to play football and will try to sign with another team soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that things didn\u2019t work out with the Raiders, but obviously, he\u2019s going to get a new opportunity, a new beginning, and I\u2019m always optimistic it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d Rosenhaus said, per NFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero.\n\nEarlier this summer, Brown\u2019s football future seemed to be in jeopardy when he reportedly threatened to retire if he could not continue wearing the same helmet model he\u2019d worn throughout his career, one that was no longer approved by the NFL for safety reasons. He filed two grievances against the league and lost both.\n\nHe also got frostbite on his feet for wearing improper footwear in a cryotherapy chamber.\n\nThe Raiders open their 2019 season Monday against the Denver Broncos on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d the Antonio Brown era over before it truly began.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
