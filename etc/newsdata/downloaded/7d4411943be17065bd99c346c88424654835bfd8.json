Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and MSNBC anchor, told The Hill. \u201cI think he only knows how to go into the gutter \u2014 and he is going to go all the way.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d comment came at a moment when he was facing immediate peril on another front.\n\nHe tweeted that \u201call Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching\u201d shortly before William Taylor, the head of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe testimony was even worse than expected for Trump, with Taylor asserting that the administration had sought to make military aid to Ukraine contingent upon the Eastern European nation investigating former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe White House\u2019s central defense of Trump\u2019s conduct regarding Ukraine has been that there was no quid pro quo involved. This argument has come to look increasingly untenable.\n\nOther troubles are pressing in on Trump, too.\n\nPolls have shown that public opinion is shifting in favor of the impeachment inquiry and that a growing share of the population believes he should be removed from office.\n\nMore broadly, Trump faces a difficult climb to reelection next year given that his average approval rating has never risen above 50 percent at any point during his tenure.\n\nEven several Republicans expressed dissent about the \u201clynching\u201d tweet on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyHouse rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff Poll: 14 percent of GOP voters say Trump should be impeached Turkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate MORE (R-Calif.) said it was \u201cnot the language that I would use.\u201d Sen.

This includes his call for the death penalty for the now-exonerated Central Park Five, propagating the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory against former President Obama, and referring to \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d after racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.\n\nIn July, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen, all of whom are nonwhite, should \u201cgo back\u201d to the places \u201cfrom which they came.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was widely condemned as racist, not least because all four women are American citizens, and only one was born outside the United States.\n\nDemocrats see cynical political strategy behind such moves \u2014 one reason they believe similar rhetoric will be heard more often as impeachment and the 2020 election campaign heat up.\n\n\u201cHe knows that this kind of activity or language will not hurt him with his base. It is very clear that part of the strategy is to inflame his base and just keep them angry,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who was Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'Outrageous' to suggest Gabbard 'is a foreign asset' Clinton attacks on Gabbard become flashpoint in presidential race Saagar Enjeti: Clinton remarks on Gabbard 'shows just how deep the rot in our system goes' MORE\u2019s senior spokeswoman during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThat was his strategy in 2016, and that is his strategy in 2020,\u201d Finney added.\n\nThe \u201clynching\u201d furor was the latest controversy in quick succession where GOP members of Congress have been more reluctant to back Trump than they were earlier in his presidency, however.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to essentially abandon the Kurds in northern Syria as well as his initial desire to hold the forthcoming Group of Seven (G-7) summit at his own Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida both drew GOP criticism. Trump made an uncharacteristically swift U-turn on the G-7 idea.\n\nReferring to those controversies and to the \u201clynching\u201d tweet, Finney said, \u201cFrom everything I have heard and seen, Republicans just didn\u2019t want to defend that. It was just too much. There will be a cost to those who protected this person or didn\u2019t speak out.\u201d\n\nEven so, Trump himself has drawn attention to his high approval ratings with Republican voters \u2014 something that will continue to give pause for thought to GOP members who might otherwise be tempted to distance themselves from him.\n\nBut Trump critics such as Sharpton have a different view. They look at the president\u2019s behavior and are convinced he knows he is in trouble.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has wrestled him for the last three decades, it shows he is rattled,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cHe would never say that unless he was totally off his game.\u201d\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "President Trump created a firestorm on Tuesday when he deployed racially inflammatory language yet again \u2014 this time referring to the impeachment inquiry into his activities as a \"lynching.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_092019as4_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
