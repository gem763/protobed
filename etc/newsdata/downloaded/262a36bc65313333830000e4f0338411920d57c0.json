Archie, born in May, is the first child of Prince Harry and the former Meghan Markle and seventh in line to the British throne.\n\nTutu greeted the baby with a delighted smile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very heartwarming, let me tell you, very heartwarming to realize that you really, genuinely are caring people,\u201d he told the royal couple, according to a statement by his Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe all try to make things better,\u201d Harry replied.\n\nThe royal couple posted on social media a photo of the 87-year-old archbishop giving Archie a gentle kiss on the forehead.\n\n\u201cThank you Archbishop Tutu for your incredibly warm hospitality, Archie loved meeting you!\u201d they wrote.\n\nGifts for the baby included children\u2019s books written and signed by the archbishop.\n\nTutu, who has been treated for prostate cancer for years, rarely makes public appearances. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end the system of white minority rule, or apartheid, and promote racial reconciliation in South Africa, and he has lent his moral stature to causes and campaigns around the world over the years.\n\nTutu and his wife, Leah, last week called a meeting with the royal couple a \u201crare privilege and honor.\u201d\n\nThe 10-day, multi-country tour also includes stops for Harry in Botswana, Angola and Malawi with a focus on wildlife protection, mental health and mine clearance - a topic given global attention by Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, when she walked through an active mine field during an Africa visit years ago.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baby Archie made a rare public appearance on Wednesday as his parents, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, continued their first official tour as a family in South Africa.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/south_africa_royals_visit_62062_c0-313-4563-2973_s1770x1032.jpg?e1f9fca1c9ba4097f77528ba516e95d91c688235", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
