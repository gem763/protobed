Didn\u2019t they see that protesting Jews over Israel when they are not even talking about Israel is racist? Didn\u2019t they understand that saying we were responsible for the behavior of the Israeli Jews just because we shared their ethnicity was racist? That making every conversation with Jews about Israel is racist?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conversation about anti-Semitism is already inherently about Israel,\u201d one of the students archly explained, repeating a deeply anti-Semitic trope that has been voiced across the spectrum from David Duke to Louis Farrakhan to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters. Right-wing anti-Semites see any accusation of anti-Semitism as a Jewish conspiracy to take away the rights of whites, while left-wing anti-Semites sees the same accusation as an attempt to silence Palestinians.\n\nApparently, so do some Bard students.", "description": "", "authors": ["Batya Ungar-Sargon", "Forward.Com Opinion I-Was-Protested-At-Bard-College-For-Being-A-Jew"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
