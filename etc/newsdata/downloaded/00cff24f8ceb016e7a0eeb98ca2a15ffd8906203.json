His departure is optically useful and may allow WeWork's bankers and backers to bill the company as learning from its mistakes and placing grown-ups in charge.\n\nBut, as evidenced by one curious episode last year, Neumann wasn't the only overoptimistic hype man when it came to WeWork.\n\nIn May 2018, one of SoftBank's most senior executives appeared onstage at a conference in London and said WeWork was raising funds at a $35 billion valuation \u2014 and could one day be a $100 billion business.\n\nHe also outlined how WeWork would expand from simply renting out office space to playing a more active role in construction and design and said the firm's revenue growth would come from cross-selling services to its shared-office customers.\n\nThe executive was Rajeev Misra, the London-based chief executive of SoftBank Investment Advisers. This is the arm of SoftBank overseeing its mammoth $100 billion Vision Fund, which has funneled billions of dollars into Uber, DoorDash, Slack, and, of course, WeWork. (Misra does not sit on WeWork's board. SoftBank's board seat is occupied by Ron Fisher, the firm's vice chairman and head of investment.)\n\n\"A year ago we were told that WeWork was extremely overvalued, $17 billion for a real-estate company doing office space,\" he said. \"Well guess what, they're looking to raise capital at $35 billion today. Maybe it's overvalued, but I believe they're a $100 billion company in the next few years.\"\n\nHe added: \"They will completely go horizontal, and go beyond office space into manufacturing furniture for themselves, to becoming a leader in real estate as an industry, to building offices, to mechanizing construction, etcetera etcetera.\"\n\nMisra was speaking at CogX, a comparatively new UK conference focused on artificial intelligence \u2014 a key plank of the Vision Fund's investment strategy. SoftBank was also sponsoring the conference. Both were unusual. The Vision Fund hadn't yet closed the full $100 billion, and SoftBank was generally keeping a low profile.\n\nStill, Misra seemed comfortable talking about the fund's investment strategy onstage before an audience of startups, investors, journalists, and other industry figures.\n\nPerhaps he was too comfortable. It turns out no one had ever mentioned WeWork's new fundraise publicly, nor had anyone mentioned a $35 billion valuation. WeWork's most recent raise had been in July 2017, the year before, which reportedly valued the company at a more modest $20 billion.\n\nAnd certainly no one had mentioned a prospective $100 billion valuation.\n\nBusiness Insider published a write-up of his remarks the next day with additional comment from WeWork, which had evidently been caught off guard.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a gaffe. Though Misra's remarks were also captured on video by the conference organizers and posted to CogX's YouTube channel, that video quietly disappeared after Business Insider asked both WeWork and SoftBank about his comments. SoftBank declined to comment at the time.\n\nA few days later, Axios' Dan Primack suggested that Misra's revelation might have even violated regulatory rules. It wouldn't be the first time a SoftBank executive had let the news of a major deal slip early.\n\n'A year ago we were told that WeWork was extremely overvalued'\n\nBusiness Insider recorded Misra's remarks and is now publishing that audio in full.\n\nHere is what the finance executive said about WeWork (emphasis added). For context, Misra was asked by the conference moderator whether the Vision Fund was fueling a bubble and spiraling valuations:\n\n\"Valuations are high in certain companies \u2014 valuations are low in certain others. When you're taking a 10-year view, a 10%, 20% difference in valuation doesn't matter if you can get the WeWorks. It's like saying, look, I'm going to [unclear] and try to negotiate the 10% or 15% extra discount. We can do that anyway \u2014 we got into Uber at a 30% discount to the previous round, in the secondary.\n\n\"But the key that we look for is cos that we believe going to be the winners in that industry. WeWork, a year ago we were told that WeWork was extremely overvalued, $17 billion for a real-estate company doing office space. Well guess what, they're looking to raise capital at $35 billion today. Maybe it's overvalued, but I believe they're a $100 billion company in the next few years. They will completely go horizontal, and go beyond office space into manufacturing furniture for themselves, to becoming a leader in real estate as an industry, to building offices, to mechanizing construction, etcetera etcetera.\n\n\"The key is to own the customer. They own their consumer and that is extremely valuable. [They have] 1 or 2 million members right now, 100,000 last year, they ended last year at half a million across the globe. They will own consumers who use their app, work in their offices five days a week. And the ability to cross-sell through those members and the ability to go downstream to create those offices substantially cheaper ... Not to get into WeWork in a big way, getting back to valuation, we believe if we invest in winners, of course we don't do early-stage investing any more, we do late-stage growth investing, if we believe our investment will go up 3, 4, 5x, why bother 10%, 20% valuation.\"\n\nElsewhere in the recording, Misra talked about SoftBank bringing \"synergies\" to Uber because it also held stakes in other rival ride-hailing companies around the world. He also discussed SoftBank's acquisition of Arm, its investments in the Indian hotel marketplace Oyo, and how SoftBank helped its portfolio firms scale into Asia.\n\nThose charged with oversight helped contribute to the hype\n\nWeWork would go on to hit a $47 billion valuation \u2014 but has since had a dramatic reversal of fortunes.\n\nIn the run-up to its planned IPO, Misra's exuberance for a sky-high valuation had been mirrored by the other bankers WeWork talked to. According to a Financial Times report, JPMorgan told the company it could be worth up to $63 billion in its public listing. Goldman said it could be as much as $96 billion. Morgan Stanley reportedly valued it at as much as a staggering $104 billion.\n\nIntense media and investor scrutiny of WeWork's business practices, Neumann's unusual degree of control over the company, and his lifestyle (there are reports of smoking weed on private jets and presidential ambitions) have since driven the IPO process off the rails. Neumann has now left his post. There are rumors of thousands of employee layoffs coming. And when the company does eventually go public, its valuation seems certain to be dented, and potentially halved.\n\nIn the aftermath, Misra's lofty pronouncements in 2018 \u2014 like the heady valuations suggested by Morgan Stanley and the rest \u2014 highlight how those meant to keep Neumann and WeWork in check instead helped directly contribute to its overhyped image and stratospheric expectations.", "description": "The SoftBank executive Rajeev Misra inadvertently revealed a new fundraising effort by WeWork in 2018 \u2014 and made lofty predictions about its future.", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc8ffb896a67428d359cc52-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
