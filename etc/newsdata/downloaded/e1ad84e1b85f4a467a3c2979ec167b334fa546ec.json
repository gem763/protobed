Its special opening episode (set in South Africa) was slightly longer than the usual hour and evidently so incredible the notion of just cutting it by five minutes was unthinkable.\n\nPerhaps the BBC\u2019s logic made sense in a way.\n\nReview: The girls\u2019 team had the librarian from hell and chose wine-tasting over a safari. While the boys were so thick they lost the task. Your heart went out to Lord Sugar on The Apprentice\n\nNever the PM. The 16 candidates were the entrepreneurs, businessmen, and female pioneers of British industry who were going to shape the country\u2019s future - in either the post-Brexit or non-Brexit era.\n\nIn which case, we are in BIG trouble of course.\n\nThe first task required the 16 contestants to set up a \u2018bespoke\u2019 tour for tourists in Cape Town, giving the two teams\u2019 clients what Lord Sugar called \u2018an unforgettable experience.\u2019\n\nThat at least was never in doubt.\n\nTeamwork: The first task required the 16 contestants to set up a \u2018bespoke\u2019 tour for tourists in Cape Town, giving the two teams\u2019 clients what Lord Sugar called \u2018an unforgettable experience\u2019\n\nThe series started with the candidates making the kind of outrageous, ludicrous, statements The Apprentice has become renowned for:\n\n* \u2018I have such expensive taste, a million is not enough. I need billions to have the lifestyle I will lead!\u2019 (womenswear consultant Mark-Ryan Parsons)\n\n* \u2018I am so ambitious you can actually cut me and ambition comes out of my blood!\u2019 (marketing expert Jemelin Artigas)\n\n* and most preposterous of all: \u2018look, we ain\u2019t a bunch of idiots are we?\u2019 (Cockney geezer and Guy Ritchie character Thomas Skinner, whose London accent was so thick, his company could have manufactured \u2018pillows\u2019 or \u2018pillars\u2019)\n\nThere was certainly nothing \u2018idiotic\u2019 about starting the first task on The Apprentice \u2013 doing something you had no experience in \u2013 by saying things like: \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to have no problems whatsoever. We\u2019re going to get there, smash it, sell the tickets, then go and have a bit of dinner!\u2019 or declaring \u2018it\u2019s a piece of p**s. How can we lose? If we do lose I\u2019ll eat my hat!\u2019\n\nRuthless: Lord Sugar must have been dying to go into partnership with Lottie Lion who preened: \u2018I can be quite vindictive in business if need be'\n\nOther candidates\u2019 introductions meanwhile were not so much bizarre as self-defeating.\n\nLord Sugar must have been dying to go into partnership with Lottie Lion who preened: \u2018I can be quite vindictive in business if need be. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019ve gone too far. But nothing in business is too far.\u2019\n\nBloody librarians! It seems these days they\u2019re more ruthless and amoral than merchant bankers and property developers.\n\nAt least Lubna Farhan was an accountant (or \u2018finance manager\u2019).\n\n\u2018I am disgustingly ambitious!\u2019 she said charmingly, as if it was a good thing, let alone something to boast about.\n\nThe afore-mentioned Mark-Ryan Parsons meanwhile claimed \u2018I\u2019m like a pig in business\u2019 \u2013 an analogy that didn\u2019t make sense (even to him) but was so unpleasant it stunned everyone into silence.\n\nYour heart went out to Lord Sugar - as usual. Dealing with these saps in the boardroom every week for three months was bad enough.\n\nLord Sugar had to find one he could go into business with and invest TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS in him/her.\n\nTask: As for the \u2018boys\u2019 team, they contrived to lose the task - despite having lions, elephants, and rhinos on a South African safari\n\nYou\u2019d assume the eight \u2018girls\u2019 had ruled themselves out of contention already.\n\nI mean, what sort of airheads would blag a trip to South Africa and then choose to organize a WINE TOUR rather than go on safari?!\n\nThe sub-team in charge of the activity LOST some of the tourists unfortunate enough to buy tickets for it and couldn\u2019t FIND the cellar where the winetasting was taking place.\n\n\u2018A farcical situation,\u2019 according to Claude Littner, and let\u2019s face it, after all his years on The Apprentice he should know.\n\nAs for the \u2018boys\u2019 team, they contrived to lose the task - despite having lions, elephants, and rhinos on a South African safari rather than a few bottles of its Chardonnay and Sauvignon.\n\nShocking: What sort of airheads would blag a trip to South Africa and then choose to organize a WINE TOUR rather than go on safari?!\n\nWith headhunter Scarlett Allen-Horton as Project Manager, the girls\u2019 tour was bad they had pay \u00a3249.03p in refunds and only made a profit of \u00a3525.93p but still won the task, albeit by only \u00a344.\n\nThey were shocked to hear the result \u2013 unlike veteran viewers of the show who recognized they were being set up for a classic twist on The Apprentice: the worst team coming out on top.\n\nAs for which candidate will win this year's title, it\u2019s always impossible to tell at the beginning, or at any stage unless \u2013 unlike Lord Sugar \u2013 you've seen what their proposals consists of.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine it being Iasha Masood (for her squeaky voice alone) or Lubna Farhan whose mutual dislike/open feuding with Lottie Lion promises to be the highlight of the series - until one of them is fired (soon).\n\nThomas Skinner and Lewis Ellis compounded their diminishing prospects by not just being thick but thuggish \u2013 first during the task and then even in the boardroom: a combination unlikely to wow Lord Sugar. He duly warned Ellis about his future conduct, tutting: \u2018I have to say Lewis that, as the project manager, one is bitterly disappointed. I\u2019m also disappointed in your outburst of temper.\u2019\n\nFrankly, he should have set some standards and fired them both.\n\nUnimpressed: Thomas Skinner and Lewis Ellis compounded their diminishing prospects by not just being thick but thuggish \u2013 first during the task and then even in the boardroom\n\nMarianne Rawlins, Jemelin Artigas, Carina Lepore, Pamela Laird, and Scarlett Allen-Horton meanwhile were such identikit, dated, stereotypes, their business plans will have to be something special to make them stand out or impress more than they did here.\n\nThat left Dean Ahmad (who worked in \u2018sports management\u2019), Kenna Ngoma, and Riyonn Farsad as viable contenders - in theory. Somehow though you\u2019d be surprised if Lord Sugar didn\u2019t end up giving his investment to Souleyman Bah. Not just a paralympian but the only one of the 16 candidates who seemed like a decent person - that you wouldn\u2019t mind having a drink with or not too full of themselves to put gazelle poo in his mouth and join in an animal excrement spitting contest. (Long story, you had to be there, etc.)\n\nThe only thing we know for sure is it won\u2019t be Shahin Hassan, \u2018a chartered engineer working in product development for a luxury car manufacturer\u2019, who was so nondescript that even his comments in the taxi home were boring rather than bitchy.\n\n\u2018Some people call you The Falcon, is that right?\u2019 Lord Sugar had asked earlier, quoting from Shahin\u2019s CV.\n\nPerhaps in Shahin\u2019s imagination, yes. Otherwise you were pretty sure NO ONE ever called Shahin \u2018the Falcon.'\n\nThe name he had come up with for his future (imaginary) collaboration with Lord Sugar was... \u2018Shamstrad.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never actually fired anybody before the process started!\u2019 quipped Lord Sugar, realising later than he should have.\n\nAn even better idea would be if we simply skipped the next twelve weeks/tasks and raised the \u00a3 250, 000 ourselves on a Just Giving page \u2013 to make Lord Sugar go into business with Lottie Lion, the demented librarian.\n\nSurely you\u2019d pay good money to see that.\n\nThese were the best/worst moments from Week One of The Apprentice 2019\n\nCOCKNEY CARICATURE OF THE WEEK\n\n\u2018He Who Dares Wins is what Del Boy says innit?\u2019\n\n- Thomas Skinner. Not as much as the SAS\n\nRAP OF THE WEEK\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had them all in here: chancers, poseurs, brown-nosers/Moaning Minnies/Big-Time Charlies/and Half-Pint Harrys\u2019\n\n- Lord Sugar. No idea what \u2018Half-Pint Harrys\u2019 are though\n\nWEAKEST ANALOGY\n\n\u2018Back then the word \u2018Brexit\u2019 sounded like another Kellogg\u2019s cereal\u2019\n\n- Lord Sugar. No it really didn\u2019t. Not even back then.\n\nSECOND WEAKEST ANALOGY\n\n\u2018You sound about as scary as an indoor firework!\u2019\n\n- Lord Sugar. Wouldn\u2019t that be scarier?\n\nBEST PUT DOWN\n\n\u2018I manufacture and sell pillows believe it or not!\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s so interesting\u2026\u2019\n\n- Mark-Ryan to Thomas Skinner\n\nBIGGEST BOMBSHELL\n\n\u2018I actually worked in the UK\u2019s best wine bar\u2019\n\n- Lottie Lion, although she never really mentioned it\n\nAwkward: Thomas had the boys\u2019 coach party singing possibly the worst song of all time, The Lion Sleeps Tonight from The Lion King\n\nBEST WINE-DRINKING LESSON\n\n\u2018Take your time with the wine. Get to know it. Get to know its personality\u2019\n\n- Lottie Lion (who else?)\n\nPEDANTIC PEASANT OF THE WEEK\n\n\u2018Can you pour wine neatly, nicely?\u2019\n\n\u2018Look it\u2019s pouring liquid into a glass. How difficult can it be?!\u2019\n\n- Lubna has the gall to question Lottie Lion\u2019s authority and experience on the subject of pouring a glass of wine \u2013 which she learnt working in the UK\u2019s best wine bar\n\nMOST ALARMED KARREN BRADY EXPRESSION\n\n\u2018You\u2019re going to meet the Big 5 animals. You\u2019re going to see where they eat, where they drink, where they make babies\u2026\u2019\n\n- Lewis promises the tourists on safari the earth, and that the rhinos and lions etc will make the earth move\n\nMALE TOUR GUIDE FROM HELL (runner-up)\n\n\u2018And if you look to your left now, there\u2019s the elephants\u2019\n\n- Riyann spotting a rare breed of smaller, chunkier, elephants with horns called Rhino Elephants\n\nFEMALE TOUR GUIDE FROM HELL (runner-up)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got some interesting facts for the journey. Did you know that there are 3000 shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa now protected by law? Wow!\u2019\n\n- Pamela providing the girls\u2019 clients with possibly the least interesting fact imaginable\n\nTour entertainment: The girls team\u2019s clients were trapped on the coach listening to Pamela's \u2018interesting facts\u2019 for several hours\n\nFEMALE TOUR GUIDE FROM HELL (runner-up)\n\n\u2018Anton Schmidt is the designer of all the pieces here in the garden. Anton\u2019s main tools were metal and stone. Um\u2026 so yeah!
