While Avast detailed several issues in its report, the biggest was the fact that all user accounts (either from the mobile app or web panel) relied on a user ID and a password that were easy to guess.\n\nThe user IDs were based on the GPS tracker's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) code and was sequantial, while the password was the same for all devices -- 123456.\n\nThis means that a hacker can launch automated attacks against Shenzhen i365-Tech's cloud server by going through all user ID's one by one, and using the same 123456 password, and take over users' accounts.\n\nWhile users can change the default after they log into their account for the first time, Avast said that during a scan of over four million user IDs, it found that more than 600,000 accounts were still using the default password.\n\nPervasive tracking and other attacks\n\nMany customers buy the devices to track pets, elderly family members, kids, cars, or other valuable items. An attacker who gains access to one of these customer accounts can track victims, but they can also spoof the tracker's location to kidnap or steal a valuable product without the owner noticing until it's too late.\n\nIn addition, these devices come with microphones and SIM cards so children or elderly members can place SOS calls to authorities or family members.\n\nAvast says account hackers can abuse this feature to place a phone call to their own number, answer the call, and then quietly spy on the GPS tracker owner.\n\nDefault password also puts vendor's profits in danger\n\nBut these default passwords aren't dangerous just for the owners of these GPS trackers. Avast says the Chinese company itself is in danger.\n\nResearchers explain that accounts on the cloud service are created as soon as the GPS trackers are manufactured. They said that a malicious competitor could hijack these accounts before the devices are sold and chnage their passwords, effectively locking accounts and creating customer support problems for Shenzhen i365-Tech and its resellers later down the road.\n\nSince Avast's research only looked at four million user IDs, the actual number of GPS trackers with default passwords is most likely much higher.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone, the issue persists to this day, as Shenzhen i365-Tech did not respond to Avast's emails when the company tried to warn the vendor. Similar contact attempts made by ZDNet's sister site CNET didn't succeed either.\n\nFor now, users who own one of the 30+ GPS tracker models listed in the Avast report are advised to change their account passwords as soon as possible.", "description": "Default password is a danger for customers, but also for the vendor itself.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/11/607c9a19-baca-40b6-9610-e24abaa6e195/thumbnail/770x578/0b6b654f91aba7218e3ece5793307465/location.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
