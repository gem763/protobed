They're currently filming behind my brother's house on E 9th.'\n\nWhile Hopper's car was spotted, actor David Harbour was not seen on set reprising his character, nor did any of the other cast make an appearance.\n\nCould it be? Hopper's fate was left unclear after Stranger Things' dramatic season three finale in which he 'died' after the gate to the upside down was closed by Joyce Byers\n\nIn another picture obtained by the fan, the crew could be seen preparing to film using a mounted camera that was attached to another car\n\nPreparation: A number of trailers were also seen on set, seemingly ready for the cast's arrival\n\nThis comes after David called the Duffer Brothers in the middle of an interview to demand answers about his character's 'death' in season three.\n\nHopper had broken into a secret Russian base to close the gate to the Upside Down alongside Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), and is unable to leave the room where the portal is based.\n\nDespite his potential demise, the police chief encourages Joyce to go through with their plan to activate the gate machine shutdown, and when she looks back into the room Hopper has disappeared.\n\nSpeaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers earlier this month, the actor said: 'Well, here\u2019s the thing.
