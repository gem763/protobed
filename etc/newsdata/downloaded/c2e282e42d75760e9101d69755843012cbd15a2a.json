Seven Russians died when the missile reactor exploded as it was brought out of the water.\n\nThomas DiNanno, senior official of the State Department Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, first disclosed the Skyfall incident Oct. 10 in a speech to the United Nations, saying Russia has \u201cmuch to answer for.\u201d\n\nU.S. agencies concluded that the explosion was caused by nuclear reaction during the recovery of the nuclear-powered cruise missile, which had been on the seafloor since a failed test, and took place \u201cin close proximity to a major population center,\u201d he said. The information was withheld for at least six weeks prior to the speech.\n\nA State Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nCareer arms control officials within the State Department are quietly opposing President Trump\u2019s harder line on arms control and have been seeking to place an ally in the vacant post of undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. Andrea Thompson, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, stepped down from the post last month.\n\nThe administration has withdrawn from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) over Russia\u2019s development of a ground-launched cruise missile that U.S. officials said violated the accord.\n\nThe next major issue to be discussed is whether to extend the 2010 New START strategic arms treaty, set to expire in 2021.\n\nAdministration officials have said extending New START without major revisions is unlikely, and Moscow so far is refusing to include several new \u201csuperweapons\u201d announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin in an extended New START.\n\nThose weapons include the Skyfall nuclear-powered cruise missile that, when deployed, would provide a very long-range nuclear strike capability. Others include the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-tipped drone submarine, the Avangard hypersonic missile, a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile called the Sarmat and an air-launched ballistic missile called Kinzhal.\n\nThe Trump White House\u2019s new approach to arms control seeks to include China and its large force of nuclear missiles in any future strategic arms accord with Russia. So far, China has rejected U.S. appeals to join arms talks.\n\nThe administration also has upset pro-arms-control officials by considering a withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty over concerns about Russian aerial spying. The 2002 treaty permits 34 signatory nations to carry out short-notice reconnaissance flights to monitor military forces.\n\nOne reason for jettisoning Open Skies, according to U.S. officials, is based on Moscow\u2019s restrictions on overflights of Russia\u2019s European enclave of Kaliningrad. Moscow has deployed advanced missiles in the enclave that threaten NATO allies in the region.\n\nAfter Russia restricted those flights, the administration restricted Russian flights over the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the missile defense interceptor base at Fort Greely, Alaska, Reuters reported.\n\nREAGAN MEMO ON TAIWAN ARMS\n\nU.S. arms sales to Taiwan remain one of the most contentious issues in U.S.-Chinese relations, with each side having differing understandings about the weapons transfers to the island state, which Beijing considers a rogue province. China for decades has insisted that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan must diminish and eventually end and claims that the commitment is implicit in the U.S.-Chinese joint communiques.\n\nBut the White House recently made public a once-secret memorandum from President Reagan making clear that the 1982 joint communique did not end arms sales to Taiwan.\n\nState Department officials at the time sought to codify U.S. policy. John J. Tkacik, a former State Department official involved in the 1982 communique talks, said the department\u2019s China desk at the time attempted to insert language that would have stated it is not long-term U.S. policy to sell arms to Taiwan and that the sales would \u201cgradually diminish and ultimately cease.\u201d\n\nA major bureaucratic policy fight ensued, and after the attempt to insert the language was reported in The Washington Times, Reagan called then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig to explain it.\n\nEleven days after the June 14, 1982, story ran, Haig was forced to resign over what he said later were policy differences with the president, including in regard to China and Russia. Reagan, in his diary, later wrote: \u201cActually, the only disagreement was over whether I made policy or the Sec. of State did.\u201d\n\nThe story that exposed the effort was written by columnist Ralph de Toledano and triggered pressure on the administration from Congress. That ultimately led Reagan to write the Aug. 17, 1982 memo to Secretary of George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, a memo that was declassified last month by recently departed National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nIn the memo, Reagan stated that talks on the communique were premised on a clear understanding that any reduction in arms sales to Taiwan depended on \u201cpeace in the Taiwan Straits\u201d and on China\u2019s declared policy of seeking a peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei, where Nationalist forces fled in 1948.\n\n\u201cIn short, the U.S. willingness to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan is conditioned absolutely upon the continued commitment of China to a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan-PRC difference,\u201d Reagan stated. \u201cIt should be clearly understood that the linkage between these two matters is a permanent imperative of U.S. foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe first sale of F-16 jets to Taiwan took place shortly after that, and the administration announced in August that it will sell $8 billion worth of new F-16s to Taiwan.\n\nPENTAGON: DECOUPLING WITH CHINA NOT POLICY\n\nChad Sbragia, a senior Pentagon official, announced in China this week that the United States is not seeking to \u201cdecouple\u201d from its engagement with all things Chinese, according to a defense official.\n\nChad Sbragia, deputy assistant defense secretary for China, made the remarks at a military forum in Beijing on Monday.\n\nMr. Sbragia said references to U.S. economic and other disengagement from China at the forum were not accurate.\n\nChina has regarded President Trump\u2019s tough policy on trade and other issues as a sign that the United States is sharply shifting its policies toward Beijing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you from personal experience that\u2019s not only not official U.S. policy, that\u2019s not even a policy discussion that I hear in my day-to-day business,\u201d Mr. Sbragia said. \u201cThat\u2019s not even how we think about that.\u201d\n\nThe defense official said that if \u201cdecoupling\u201d were the goal, \u201cwhat you would see on a day-to-day basis would be fundamentally different than what you see.\u201d\n\nMr. Sbragia said the United States is seeking to rebalance the relationship and noted that both Washington and Beijing say they want to improve stability and avoid crises.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite of decoupling. It\u2019s not to pull apart. It\u2019s actually to in some ways deepen those relationships,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sbragia\u2019s remarks were first reported by Reuters and confirmed by the defense official.\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
