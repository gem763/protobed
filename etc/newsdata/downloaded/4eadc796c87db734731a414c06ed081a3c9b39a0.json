I\u2019m just overwhelmed by the opportunity.\n\n\"Yesterday I was at school and now I\u2019m flying! I want to be a pilot when I\u2019m older and this is helping me to achieve my dreams.\"\n\nBritish Airways already ran a trial of the programme earlier this year in partnership with The Air League Trust, where it funded lessons for students at the Booker Aviation Flying School in High Wycombe.\n\n(Image: British Airways)\n\nThe success has now seen the airline committing to fund the further 200 flying lessons.\n\nThe scheme opened earlier this year and BA says it had thousands of applicants, although it chose the final 200 \"based on their passion and enthusiasm for flying\".\n\nAngela Williams, British Airways\u2019 Director of People, said: \"We know the importance of introducing young people, especially young women, to aviation at an early age in order to inspire them to pursue a career in the cockpit and that\u2019s why I\u2019m thrilled we\u2019re extending this ground-breaking flying initiative to youngsters up and down the UK in 2020.\n\n(Image: British Airways)\n\n\"We\u2019re passionate about improving diversity across all areas of our airline and we\u2019re committed to investing in the next generation who will join us in connecting Britain with the world and the world with Britain.\"\n\nThe scheme comes amidst the airline's expansion to include more work experience placements and career opportunities for young people.\n\nIn fact, in 2020 it will become the first and only UK airline to offer a paid summer internship.\n\nYou can find out more about the various schemes and work experience placements/internships on the British Airways careers website .", "description": "British Airways will fund flying lessons for 200 students across the UK in 2020 in the inspiring new scheme", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "British Airways"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707717.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6908JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
