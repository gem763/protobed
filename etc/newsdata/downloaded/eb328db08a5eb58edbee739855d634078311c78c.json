As per information given by police, the suspect would allegedly ambush his victims, drag them to nearby bushes at knife point where he would then carry out the acts, then dump the bodies of his victims on the streets.\n\nThe suspect was recently linked to the murder of Olerato and Nokulunga Nkutha after an extensive forensic investigation by SAPS according to Brigadier Leonard Hlathi.\n\nNews that the alleged killer would remain in custody pending a formal bail hearing came as a relief to the Nkutha family who have experienced a double tragedy having lost two of their family members.\n\nSpeaking to DRUM, Bongani said the last few years have been extremely trying for the family but they will now be able to find closure because the person is allegedly responsible has been brought to book.\n\n\"As a family we're happy we can get closure by knowing who did this to our kids. We didn\"t expect it to be him because he isn\"t someone who lives far but is someone who lives with us in our community. We are happy that now other kids have been saved and we hope he doesn\u2019t get bail.\"\n\nBongani shared that the loss has greatly hurt the family as both his daughter and niece were murdered at the same age, just as the family had started seeing great potential in the both of them.\n\n\"We were greatly hurt as a family by these losses, personally I spent some time taking pills in order to sleep.\"\n\nWhen asked what would constitute as justice to the family, Bongani told DRUM that four life sentences would be the start and for the accused to never return to the community.\n\n\"If the court can just do its job and give him four life sentences for all the murders he is linked with and we never see him again.\"\n\nBongani concluded by thanking the community for their support. He said it's for this reason that they don't want the case to be moved elsewhere.\n\n\"We've submitted a letter today to contest the transfer of this case to the Pretoria high court, we want it to be heard right here in the Gert Sibande District where we have the support of our community.\"\n\nThe suspect was remanded in custody and the case postponed to January 22 for a formal bail application.", "description": "Bongani Nkutha of Embalenhle in Mpumalanga was devastated when he found out his daughter, Nokulunga, had been raped, killed and dumped on a street.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8404/b2fc7c15f4d24e8e82fb48d1176610db.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-22"}
