He was released after posting a $100,000 bond with the court.\n\nGilliam told the judge he stole funds raised from donors in Atlantic City and Philadelphia, using the money for personal expenses from 2013 and 2018. He was elected mayor in 2017 after serving as a City Councilman.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

This defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children.\u201d\n\nGilliam\u2019s lawyer , Harry Rimm, stressed that Gilliam admitted taking private money, not public funds. That sets him somewhat apart from a long line of his corrupt predecessors, dating back to the turn-of-the-century Atlantic City officials whose malfeasance was chronicled in the HBO series \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Gilliam, who is a lifelong resident of Atlantic City, has admitted his wrongful conduct, is accepting responsibility for his actions and is genuinely remorseful,\u201d Rimm said in a statement issued after the court appearance.\n\nU.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said Gilliam solicited donations while a member of the City Council and then as mayor under the false pretense that they were for the youth basketball team or for school supplies for poor children.\n\nIn reality, the prosecutor said, Gilliam used the money for personal expenses including luxury clothing, expensive meals, and trips.\n\nFBI agents carried off numerous cardboard boxes and computer equipment during a raid of the mayor\u2019s home on Dec. 3, but they remained silent about why they were there and what they had taken away.\n\nGilliam, 49, could face 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on Jan. 7. He also agreed to make restitution for the fraud.\n\nThe mayor left his home early Thursday clutching his passport, and declined comment to reporters other than to say, \u201cHave a good day.\u201d Surrendering a passport is commonly done when a defendant faces federal charges to prevent them from leaving the country.\n\nAs recently as 2007, four of the city\u2019s last eight mayors had been arrested on corruption charges and one-third of the nine-member City Council was either in prison or under house arrest.\n\nCity Council President Marty Small was expected to take over as acting mayor, city officials said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "It was revealed in federal court Thursday that money Mayor Frank Gilliam Jr took from the team was recovered during an FBI raid at his home.", "authors": ["Wayne Perry"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mayor-frank-gilliam-jr.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
