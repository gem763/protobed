They say, \u2018In totally unsubstantiated charges\u2019 every time they talk about him, \u2018President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune, now you know that\u2019s a totally unsubstantiated charge.\u2019 Really? It\u2019s not unsubstantiated, it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBy the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he \u2026 Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nSpeaking directly to Hunter Biden, Trump said Biden was only a good Vice President because he sucked up to Obama.\n\n\u201cAnd your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good Senator, he was only a good Vice President because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d Trump said to a roaring crowd.\n\nTrump noted Hunter Biden\u2019s deal with the Bank of China that provided him with a $1.5 billion check for his own private business dealings.\n\n\u201cAnd then they go to China \u2026 and Hunter, who\u2019s not too smart \u2026 he goes in, he has a meeting and walks out with $1.5 billion, billion with a B, $1.5 billion,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cNow think of it, where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\n\u201cHunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything really. Hunter, you\u2019re a loser,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhy did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News\u2019s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president\u2019s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.\n\nBreitbart News\u2019s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
