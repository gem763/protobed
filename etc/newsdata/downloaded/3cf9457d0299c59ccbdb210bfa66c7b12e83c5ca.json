I was watching, going back and forth, that window, then out that door, then back to that window and then back out the door.\n\n'There was one fire on one side, and then there was another fire at the back and I could see my dad. I feel lucky now because we still have our house \u2013\u2013 somewhere to sleep.'\n\nJarrod's dad Kam McInnes should have been at the bank this week, finalising a loan for the new place opposite his and the school, but there's no need for that now.\n\nInstead he spent Thursday keeping a close watch on spot fires that continue to burn around the house he managed to save, first with hoses and then, after the power went, with water he bucketed out of his spa.\n\n'I had to fight for it, that's for sure,' he tells AAP. 'But I'm alive.'", "description": "Jarrod McInnes, eight, was staring out the window of his primary school as he watched his dad attempt to save their house as a ferocious fire made it's way to them.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/19564682-0-image-a-20_1570753476051.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
