Christmas at Chequers is cancelled.'\n\nMr Merton then retorts: 'Well he may not be at Chequers at Christmas, you don't know.'\n\nBoris Johnson's sister quickly responds: 'I hope he is.'\n\nThe Prime Minister today vented fury at a Remainer plot that looks set to snatch away his moment of triumph on a crunch Brexit vote.\n\nMs Johnson appeared on the popular BBC comedy news show on the same team as celebrated comedian Paul Merton\n\nKicking off a 'Super Saturday' showdown in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister complained that there might not be a 'meaningful' decision for days longer.\n\nThe rebuke came as a wrecking amendment tabled by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin is set to prevent the deal being put to a formal vote this afternoon. If passed it will withhold approval of the plan until after legislation has been put on the statute book, and Mr Johnson will be forced by a separate Remainer law to beg the EU for an extension tonight.\n\nMr Johnson said it was 'urgent' for the country to get past the standoff and 'unite', saying his deal can 'heal the rift in British politics'. 'Now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today,' he insisted.\n\nThe House of Commons was absolutely jam packed for the dramatic debate on the Prime Minister's deal today\n\nKicking off a 'Super Saturday' showdown in the House of Commons, Boris Johnson complained that there might not be a 'meaningful' decision for days longer due to the Letwin amendment\n\nMr Johnson warned the 'scope for fruitful negotiation has run its course'. 'It is now my judgement that we have reached the best possible solution,' he said.\n\nSources have revealed that Mr Johnson held crisis talks with Sir Oliver in Downing Street last night as he tried to head off the crisis, but without success. The premier has been frantically trying to win over the last few wavering MPs with the numbers on a knife edge.\n\nIn a previous appearance on Sky News last month, Ms Johnson attacked her brother's attempt to force through Brexit.\n\nShe said: 'I think that what we are seeing is an executive that is so keen to deliver Brexit in any shape or form, to get the country out of the EU, to deliver up on that promised land, that they will do anything to justify that end'\n\nAsked what could be behind the strategy, she said: 'It could be (senior aide) Dominic Cummings advising the Prime Minister to be extremely aggressive and to face down opposition from all sides of the establishment in order to secure his position as the tribune of the people.\n\n'It could be coming from my brother himself, he obviously thoroughly enjoys being Prime Minister.\n\n'It also could be from - who knows - people who have invested billions in shorting the pound or shorting the country in the expectation of a no-deal Brexit. We don't know.'\n\nMs Johnson is not the only family member to turn against the PM after his younger brother Jo revealed he was quitting as a minister and would stand down as the MP for Orpington at the next election.\n\nHe said there had been an 'unresolvable tension' between 'family loyalty and the national interest'.", "description": "Rachel Johnson was spotted cheering enthusiastically from the grandstand as she enjoyed\u00a0the Champions Day stakes at Ascot racecourse with son Oliver Dawnay.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19929380-0-image-a-33_1571499465803.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
