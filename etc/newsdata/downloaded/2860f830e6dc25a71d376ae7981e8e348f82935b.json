Being overweight was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of over 25, and being obese was defined as having a BMI over 30.\n\nOn average, the participants were followed for about 18 years, during which time 27,881 individuals were diagnosed with cancer, of which 9,761 (35 percent) were obesity-related.\n\nThe findings, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, showed that obese participants had the highest risk of developing obesity-related cancer, compared to participants with a normal BMI, with the risk increasing by 64 percent for male participants and 48 percent for females.\n\nBeing overweight before age 40 increased the risk of all obesity-related cancers for both men and women by 15 percent, compared to those who were not overweight. In addition, the risk of endometrial cancer increased by 70 percent, male renal-cell cancer by 58 percent, and male colon cancer by 29 percent.\n\n\"Obesity is an established risk factor for several cancers. In this study, we have focused on the degree, timing and duration of overweight and obesity in relation to cancer risk,\" says first author of the study Professor Tone Bj\u00f8rge.\n\n\"Our key message is that preventing weight gain may be an important public health strategy to reduce the cancer risk,\" she added.", "description": "New European research has found that being overweight before the age of 40 could increase the risk of various cancers in both men and women.
