NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made multiple statements, including one as recently as Tuesday morning. China has responded by canceling G League showcase games in China and refusing to air a pair of NBA preseason games that will be played there this week. In fact, those two games could be canceled altogether.\n\nThe situation is both incredibly complex and nuanced, leaving the league to walk the tightrope of supporting the free speech of those who work within the NBA while also maintaining important and lucrative business relationships in China.\n\nOPINION:Adam Silver at center of China controversy and has no winning play\n\nGreece's Giannis Antetokounmpo tries to block United States' Donovan Mitchell during phase two of the FIBA Basketball World Cup at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center in Shenzhen in southern China's Guangdong province.

Antetokounmpo was also one of three players featured in the NBA's Chinese New Year ad campaign last season. He also has business interests of his own in China considering his endorsement deal with Nike as well as his new, top-selling signature shoe, the Zoom Freak 1, that came out this summer.\n\nOn Tuesday, Antetokounmpo was asked about the current situation between the NBA and China and offered his thoughts.\n\n\u201cI feel like in the NBA they always allow us to express our feelings,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Players come out, GMs come out and express their feelings. At the end of the day, the NBA wants to have a great relationship with China and with the fans.\n\n\"I know this situation, they\u2019re going to solve it in a way. But what can you do? Like, I feel like the NBA gives you a great platform to express your feelings and say what you believe and what you think about situations in the world. But I know that they\u2019re going to find a way to solve this situation. It was just a misunderstanding.\u201d", "description": "The NBA has found itself in the middle of a serious issue\u00a0between China and protesters in Hong Kong after a tweet from Rockets GM Daryl Morey.", "authors": ["Matt Velazquez", "Published P.M.
