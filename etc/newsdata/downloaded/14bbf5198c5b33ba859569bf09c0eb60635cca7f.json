My friends and I began playing it last summer as it exploded in popularity; we saw the game go from its roots as a goofy add on to Epic\u2019s player-versus-environment shooter to its current status as a cross-cultural social space that just so happens to have a battle royale mode. And while I\u2019ve certainly gotten better at playing the game, I\u2019m still bad at it.\n\nWhich is fine! Really. For me, the fun of Fortnite is when I\u2019m playing well with my teammates and suddenly I\u2019m fluent \u2014 suddenly my builds are solid and my aim is true. It\u2019s a joyful thing for me, because it\u2019s in those moments I realize I\u2019ll never be a professional (or anything close). It\u2019s freeing to know that even if I spent all of my time grinding to be better at the game I\u2019d never be good enough to make any cash playing it. I\u2019m just there to hang out with my friends. I get smoked by teens constantly.\n\nThe other week, a friend and Verge colleague invited me to play Fortnite with some of his teenage friends. They were playing a free-for-all mode in the custom map section of the game; you spawn with a random assortment of weapons and items and the point was to be the last person standing. I got owned. Just utterly destroyed. These kids were building like they\u2019d grown up doing it, which they had; I have never felt older in my life than I did seeing myself near the bottom of the rankings. (I did not lose every time. Sometimes I got lucky.) It was humbling. But it was also fun as hell, because, as a rando, I had nothing to lose.\n\nMore often than not, being professionally good at something means that when it\u2019s time to perform \u2014 especially for an audience \u2014 you sometimes enjoy it less than you would in a vacuum; because odds are, the reason you were drawn to the thing in the first place wasn\u2019t the fact that you might be able to make a living off of it. The second Fortnite World Cup is going on all this weekend, and I can\u2019t help but feel a little pity for how much pressure the pros must be under. Obviously it\u2019s exhilarating to play under the lights on the biggest stage in the world, for a chance at a piece of $30 million. But at the same time you do have to perform.\n\nThere\u2019s a real appeal to being an amateur \u2014 at anything, not just Fortnite. If you want to go back to the etymology, \u201camateur\u201d comes from the French for \u201clover of\u201d; pursuing an interest for its own sake is liberating. Amateurs were so highly regarded that the modern Olympic games were explicitly for amateur competitors for most of the 20th century. It wasn\u2019t until the \u201990s that professionals were allowed to compete across every sport. (Aside from wrestling, because professional wrestling is a bit of a misnomer.)\n\nI was playing Fortnite with some friends after work last week; we were playing squads a player down, with three people instead of the usual four, so we decided to fill the spot with a random person. We happened upon this guy who was I think named Jay, who was incredible. The kind of guy who might, on a good day, take out a full 10 percent of people on the island. With us, he had an eight kill game \u2014 which is impressive when you consider that only a hundred people drop onto the island in the first place. I had that realization again; no matter how much I practice, I\u2019ll never be as good as him. But the thing was he was as excited that we had mics and were a decently competent squad as we were when we realized how good he was. We didn\u2019t win any games that day.\n\nAfterward, Jay added us as friends. We\u2019ll play again, and maybe we\u2019ll even get a victory royale. That, however, isn\u2019t the point. Or the fun.", "description": "The fun of the game happens in rare moments of mastery", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVBYFjExwZJ6gJKXrJ5aahZXB18=/0x354:4944x2942/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18340874/1125994978.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-28"}
