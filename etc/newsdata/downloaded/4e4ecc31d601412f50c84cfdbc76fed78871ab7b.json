It\u2019s completely incorrect. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gimmick, but cryptocurrency wasn\u2019t necessary to make that thing work.\u201d\n\nWould Twitter join Libra? \u201cNo. Hell no. Nothing within Libra had to be a cryptocurrency to do what they want to do. They use that label liberally. It\u2019s completely incorrect. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gimmick but cryptocurrency wasn\u2019t necessary to make that thing work.\u201d - @jack \u2014 Kerry Flynn \ud83d\udc36 (@kerrymflynn) October 24, 2019\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee has also exhibited skepticism toward Libra, while Visa VISA, +1.96% , MasterCard MA, +0.96% , PayPal PYPL, +1.57% and eBay EBAY, -0.03% have abandoned the project.\n\nRead more: Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg faces Capitol Hill heat on Libra, elections fraud\n\nDorsey was also asked about Zuckerberg\u2019s recent Georgetown University speech, in which the Facebook CEO said he, in the name of free speech, would allow political ads on the Facebook platform without fact checking them.\n\n\u201dWe talk a lot about speech and expression, and we don\u2019t talk about reach enough, and we don\u2019t talk about amplification. And reach and amplification was not represented in that speech,\u201d said Dorsey, calling that \u201ca major gap and flaw in the substance he was getting across.\u201d\n\nAs for Zuckerberg trying to say Facebook was founded as a reaction to the Iraq war, Dorsey added, \u201cThere\u2019s some amount of revisionist history in all his story telling. It takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nOf course, Twitter has shouldered plenty of its own criticism for not better addressing harassment and hate speech on its own feeds, including complaints that President Trump\u2019s frequently inflammatory tweets violate Twitter\u2019s terms of use.\n\n\u201cI do appreciate the concept of a more direct, real-time democracy. This box is fully open. We\u2019re not going away from it,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the long term, I think there\u2019s a lot to learn from this. Over the short term, we\u2019re challenged.\u201d\n\nHe also discussed the challenges that journalists are facing today, noting that there\u2019s not been \u201cone screw-up\u201d but many.\n\n\u201cThe role of amazing newsrooms is calling out where there were errors and bias. It felt so strong and credible and noble. I feel like we\u2019ve lost some of that maybe. The self-critical nature,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we [Twitter] need to do a whole lot more of it, as well.\u201d", "description": "The Square and Twitter CEO also assails Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent free speech argument", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU028_JackDo_ZG_20191025111129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
