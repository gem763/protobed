Photo: Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour this week, Brad Pitt discussed confronting Harvey Weinstein after the disgraced Hollywood mogul allegedly harassed Pitt\u2019s then-girlfriend, Gwyneth Paltrow, saying, \u201cAt that moment, I was just a boy from the Ozarks on the playground, and that\u2019s \u2026 and that\u2019s how we confronted with things.\u201d\n\nAs Paltrow told the New York Times in 2017, shortly after she landed the lead role in the film adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma when she was 22, Weinstein invited her to his hotel suite, and tried to force a \u201cmassage\u201d on her. Paltrow told Pitt, who she says later went up to Weinstein at a Broadway production of Hamlet, and told the producer, \u201cIf you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he did was he leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn\u2019t have fame or power yet,\u201d Paltrow told the Times. \u201cHe\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously Gwyneth\u2019s story to tell, and the reporters story to tell,\u201d Amanpour said in this week\u2019s interview, referring to Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, who reported extensively on the allegations against Weinstein, including Paltrow\u2019s. \u201cBut I wonder if you can add anything to that, because you do come out as one of the heroes of this story. You confronted a guy that very few people were willing to confront, apparently.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well I think that\u2019s a bit much,\u201d Pitt replied. He explained that, growing up in Missouri, getting in someone\u2019s face was how he learned to deal with things.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure nothing was going to happen further because she was going to do two films [with Weinstein],\u201d he went on. \u201cI think the interesting thing is that we, Hollywood specifically \u2014 but the workplace, men and women\u2019s dynamics \u2014 is being recalibrated, recalibrated in a very good way that is long overdue. And I do think that\u2019s an important story to tell.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
