Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Monday unveiled one of the most aggressive family-leave proposals to date, featuring six months of taxpayer-funded family and medical leave.\n\nHarris, who is floundering in both national and early primary state polls, has switched her campaign strategy on issues that \u201ckeep families up at night,\u201d dubbing it a \u201c3 a.m. agenda.\u201d\n\nUnder Harris\u2019s proposal, every worker that makes less than $75,000 per year would be entitled to full wages during the six-month absence, which is three months longer than proposals pushed by Democrat lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Higher earners would also receive compensation, but less than Americans under the outlined threshold.\n\nThe plan would allow workers to take advantage of the benefit outside of traditional childcare or medical-related issues and could apply to \u201cchosen family.\u201d\n\nPolitico reports:\n\nFor example, Harris\u2019 campaign said that a parent could take leave to care for a child harmed by domestic violence. It wouldn\u2019t be limited to immediate family \u2014 workers could take leave to care for domestic partners, parents-in-law and \u2018chosen family,\u2019 among others.\n\nThe benefits would extend to part-time workers, independent contractors, and self-employed workers as well.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan also calls for the passage of the Child Care for Working Families Act and pledges to \u201ccreate a federal inter-agency working group tasked with cutting child poverty by 50 percent in her first term.\u201d She also calls for the expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, or \u201cfood stamps.\u201d\n\nHarris plans to pay for her massive family leave proposal with \u201cnew payroll taxes on employers and employees in addition to unspecified \u2018general revenues,'\u201d as well as \u201cfines on corporations that fail to narrow their gender-based pay gaps,\u201d Politico reports.\n\nThe proposal comes in the wake of Harris\u2019s continued struggle to gain support in polls. IBD-TIPP\u2019s October poll showed the presidential hopeful dropping to fifth place nationally, with just three percent support:\n\n#National IBD/TIPP Poll (9/26-10/3):\n\nWarren 27%\n\nBiden 26%\n\nSanders 10%\n\nButtigieg 7%\n\nHarris 3%\n\nYang 3%\n\nO'Rourke 2%\n\nKlobuchar 1%\n\nGabbard 1%\n\nCastro 1%\n\nBooker 0%\n\nBullock 0%\n\nSteyer 0%\n\nMessam 0%\n\nRyan 0%\n\nBennet 0%\n\nDelaney 0%\n\nSestak 0%\n\nWilliamson 0%https://t.co/n1jBM69IbI \u2014 Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) October 7, 2019\n\nThe California senator has modified her strategy in recent weeks, spending time in Iowa in hopes of gaining traction in the early caucus state. Harris reportedly aims to focus on families and family-issues during her Iowa blitz, meeting with families in \u201cintimate\u201d settings and helping to prepare dinner in Iowans\u2019 homes.", "description": "Sen.
