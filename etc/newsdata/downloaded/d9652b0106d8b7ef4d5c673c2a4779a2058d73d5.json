The friend revealed: \u201cBecky said, \u2018Have I offended you?\u2019 Coleen swore blind she hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut sources close to Coleen, 33, said she had been privately worried Rebekah was in cahoots with a newspaper.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nA source said: \u201cColeen was convinced Vardy was to blame, but had to get the evidence first. Blocking her wasn\u2019t going to cut the mustard...she needed proof.\u201d\n\nIt was then that she hatched her plan.

Someone on my private Instagram has seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper.\u201d\n\nA source close to Rebekah said they were aware of the story in question but that it had nothing to do with her.\n\nThe pal added: \u201cThey\u2019ve put two and two together and come up with five.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
