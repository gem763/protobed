Whereas the first astronauts in space squeezed their meals from toothpaste-like tubes, today's astronauts chow down on ice cream and fresh fruit, and season their meals with liquid salt and pepper.\n\nBut there are still limits to the types of food that can withstand microgravity. Anything that can produce crumbs, for instance, is considered dangerous, since food particles can clog a spacecraft's electrical systems or air filters. Food also needs to last for an extended period of time, in case resupply missions go awry.\n\nSo tech companies are experimenting with ways to grow food onboard a spacecraft.\n\nIn late September, the Israeli food-tech startup Aleph Farms oversaw the growth of meat in space for the first time, with the help of a 3D printer. The experiment isn't entirely new \u2014 Aleph Farms has been cooking up lab-grown steaks since December 2018 \u2014 but it does suggest that meat could be grown in all kinds of harsh environments.\n\nCosmonauts fed meat cells into a 3D printer\n\nlab grown meat iss International Space Station More\n\n3D Bioprinting Solutions\n\nTo make their lab-grown meat, Aleph Farms starts by extracting cells from a cow through a small biopsy. The cells are then placed in a \"broth\" of nutrients that simulates the environment inside a cow's body. From there, they grow into a thin piece of steak.\n\nThose who've tasted the product say it leaves something to be desired, but it's meant to mimic the texture and flavor of traditional beef.\n\n\"We're the only company that has the capacity to make fully-textured meat that includes muscle fibers and blood vessels \u2014 all the components that provide the necessary structure and connections for the tissue,\" Aleph's CEO and co-founder, Didier Toubia, told Business Insider last year.\n\nBut to grow the meat in space, Aleph Farms had to alter their process slightly.\n\nFirst, they placed the cow cells and nutrient broth in closed vials. Next, they loaded the vials onto the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft in Kazakhstan. On September 25, the spacecraft took off for the Russian segment of the International Space Station, orbiting about 250 miles away from Earth.\n\n3d printer in space.JPG More\n\n3D Bioprinting Solutions\n\nWhen the vials arrived at the station, Russian astronauts \u2014 known as cosmonauts \u2014 inserted them into a magnetic printer from the Russian company 3D Bioprinting Solutions. The printer then replicated those cells to produce muscle tissue (the \"meat\"). The samples returned to Earth on October 3, without being consumed by the cosmonauts.", "description": "A spacecraft with vials of cow cells landed at the International Space Station in September.
