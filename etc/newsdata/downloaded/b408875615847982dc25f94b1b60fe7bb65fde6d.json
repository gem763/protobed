Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts of cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

So far only a seven-page explanatory note has been published.\n\nThe shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said it was important to see the legal detail \u201cbecause we suspect it will confirm that the government\u2019s proposals unavoidably mean the introduction of infrastructure in Northern Ireland, and that this will contradict the assurances that Johnson gave in the house on Thursday [that no new infrastructure would be required]\u201d. Starmer also said the legal text would clarify whether or not workers\u2019 rights were being protected.\n\nOpposition MPs have been able in the past to use the Commons standing order 24 to trigger an emergency debate on a binding \u201chumble address\u201d motion demanding the release of government papers, but such a debate would only go ahead with the approval of the Speaker.\n\nWith just a few days remaining for the UK to backtrack on key aspects of its proposals, officials in Brussels described the talks as a \u201cfarce\u201d.\n\nMichel Barnier: blame Boris Johnson for a no-deal Brexit Read more\n\nThe two sides appear locked in an impasse. Frost told European commission officials on Friday the UK would not move on its negotiating position until Brussels accepted its main proposals as a basis for the talks.\n\nJohnson\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told Conservative aides that the government will not fundamentally change its proposals.\n\nMeanwhile Latvia\u2019s prime minister, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, told the BBC the onus was on Johnson to make a move. He said: \u201cIf the offer from the UK turns out to be a take-it-or-leave-it, it\u2019s going to be very difficult I see in agreeing. It\u2019s fully dependent on the will of Mr Johnson because from the European side, we\u2019re always open and looking towards a deal.\u201d\n\nGiven the gap in positions, senior EU sources said Brussels had all but written off the chance of a deal being struck and that the onus was now on avoiding blame.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly capitals have the impression the legal text was tabled to be rejected and never meant to a basis for discussion,\u201d said one EU diplomat.\n\nDowning Street said that when Johnson spoke to Macron, the prime minister said: \u201cWe have to push forward.\u201d He told the French president that the EU should not be lulled into the mistaken belief that the UK would stay in the EU beyond 31 October in the event of no deal, No 10 said.\n\nStressing that his plan now had more support from MPs than any previous proposal, Johnson told Macron that it was now up to the EU to compromise.\n\nA senior No 10 source said: \u201cThe UK has made a big, important offer but it\u2019s time for the commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not, the UK will leave with no deal.\n\n\u201cIf EU leaders are betting that [the Benn act] will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who also spoke to the Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, at the weekend, is scheduled to have further talks with EU leaders on Monday. Frost is continuing talks with commission officials, and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is visiting EU capitals.\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will host another meeting of opposition party leaders at Westminster on Monday, the first since the PM\u2019s plan was published. \u201cThe cross-party meeting will decide what next steps we can take together to hold the government to account, and to ensure the prime minister adheres to the law in seeking an extension if no deal is reached by 19 October,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nUnder the Benn act, Johnson will have to request an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership by 19 October if a deal has not been agreed.\n\nIn response to claims in the Sunday Telegraph that Johnson would seek to provoke the EU to veto an extension by threatening to be an obstructive member state, one EU official described the government as \u201cbeyond pathetic\u201d.\n\nClaims that the government could veto the EU\u2019s budget or impose Nigel Farage as the British commissioner were said to be \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\nThe budget is unlikely to be finalised and put to a vote until June next year. The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, or the European parliament can reject a member state\u2019s nomination for a commissioner portfolio.", "description": "French president\u2019s insistence that UK should give way raises chances of talks imploding", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Andrew Sparrow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/369f0a7cb1cbac87ff3351b2a1b5a6d81c737f6e/0_197_2011_1207/master/2011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3b8a3a5bb7d60bcc9db770799a2a8e5", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
