The malware crippled some routers during the event, but did not crash the live broadcast, although it was pretty close.\n\nBoth hacks took place after the International Olympic Committee and WADA banned some Russian athletes from participating in the Ryo 2016 Summer Olympics and the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, and many considered the hacks as some sort of revenge on the part of Russian authorities.\n\nSome attacks were successful\n\nWith a new ban on the horizon for Russian athletes -- even more severe than the first two -- many believe APT28 is up to its old tricks, and Microsoft said it has the evidence.\n\nAccording to Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust at Microsoft, \"some of these attacks were successful, but the majority were not.\"\n\nMicrosoft said it notified all customers targeted in these attacks and worked to secure compromised accounts or systems.\n\nIn late 2018, US authorities tracked down some of the APT28 hackers and charged FSB (Russian intelligence) officers who they believed were behind the 2016 WADA hacks. The officers were never arrested, and are still at large.\n\nThis is also not the first time that Microsoft calls out an APT28 hacking campaign.
