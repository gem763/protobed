While the Japanese Nikkei 225 had returned to catch up to the gains, the ASX 200 had been a poignant example of this lack of direction seen flat as a pancake.\n\n\"A packed day lies ahead for Asia markets with something for everyone to watch. Asia markets and currencies will continue the scrutiny on Chinese data with China's September inflation numbers expected to continue showing softness in the economy. The RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) minutes are to be released, while US markets returns on Tuesday with a whole slew of bank earnings, one to watch for risk sentiment.\"", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - SINGAPORE shares edged slightly higher on Tuesday, with the Straits Times Index gaining 0.1 per cent, or 4.19 points to 3,128.64 as at 9.02am.\u00a0 .
