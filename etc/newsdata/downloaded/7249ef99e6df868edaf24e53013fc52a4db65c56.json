It also shows that the number of Americans who say they have no religion \u2014 sometimes called nones \u2014 has risen to 26%, up from 17% a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe rate at which Christians are declining is very striking,\u201d said Greg Smith, associate director of research at Pew. \u201cAnd the share of Americans who have no religion is growing very rapidly, which is just as striking.\u201d\n\nProtestants now make up less than half of all U.S. adults \u2014 or 43% (down from 51% a decade ago) and Catholics make up 20% (down from 23% in 2009).\n\nThose figures are reflected in attendance at religious services as well. For the first time, more Americans say they attend religious services a few times a year or less (54%) than those who attend at least once a month (45%). The study notes that while overall church attendance is down, 62% of Christians say they attend services once a month or more \u2014 about the same as a decade ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite shocking,\u201d said Scott Thumma, a sociologist of religion at Hartford Seminary. \u201cThis rapid shift is about generational replacement. The most religious folks are the ones who are dying and the least religious folks are the ones coming in.\u201d\n\nTo put it most graphically, 84% of the Silent Generation (born between 1928 and 1945) identify as Christian, compared with 49% of the millennial generation (born between 1981 and 1996).\n\nThumma pointed to a number of cultural reasons that may be speeding up the generational shift, including less social pressure to go to church; the clergy sexual abuse scandal, especially in the Catholic Church; and shifting attitudes toward sexuality and gender that clash with traditional Christian teachings.\n\nSmith, the Pew researcher, said a dissatisfaction with conservative political ties to evangelical Christianity may also be fueling the growth of the nones.\n\n\u201cWe know religious nones are among the most strongly and consistently Democratic and politically liberal groups in the population,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that in the 2016 election, 68% of nones voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. We also saw that two-thirds of religiously unaffiliated voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nHemant Mehta, the popular blogger behind the Friendly Atheist, said it\u2019s not that the nones are embracing atheism necessarily. Instead, they may be rebelling against the link between conservative religion and politics.\n\n\u201cThey had plenty of opportunity to take the ethical route: Do the nice, kind, decent thing,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cWhat do the most powerful voices do? They cover up sexual abuse. They became allies with Donald Trump. When you see what they\u2019re doing and who they\u2019re hanging out with, why would anyone want to be part of that club?\u201d\n\nThe report also showed a slower decline among black and Hispanic Americans. Both groups are more likely to describe themselves as Christians and to attend religious services. Among African-Americans, 58% say they attend church more than once a month (compared to 42% of whites) and 51% of Hispanics said the same.\n\nOther trends documented in the new survey:\n\nCatholics are no longer a majority of the U.S. Hispanic population. Only 47% of Hispanics identify as Catholic, down from 57% a decade ago. And more Hispanics are religiously unaffiliated \u2014 about 23%.\n\nWomen are still more religious than men, but less so. The share of women with no religion has risen by 10 percentage points, similar to the increase among men.\n\nNones make up one-third of Democrats. But they are growing in Republican circles as well. About 16% of Republicans identify as nones, up from 10% in 2009.\n\nWhite evangelicals are declining and now constitute about 16% of the U.S. population, down from 19% a decade ago.\n\nThe report is based on annual political surveys taken over the phone with a sample size of 12,000 to 25,000 people each. The margin of error for the full sample was between 0.7 and 1 percentage point.", "description": "", "authors": ["Yonat Shimron"], "top_image": "https://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/thumbRNS-Pew-Survey3-101619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
