Now, the homes of former president Dennis Williams, along with current president Gary Jones, were raided by the FBI as part of a growing corruption scandal that has now reached the very top of the UAW executive ladder.\n\nA year ago, I called for Jones to resign, but his selfishness has now led to an unmitigated disaster for autoworkers as they lose the trust in their officials so necessary for a strong union.\n\nUAW President Gary Jones raises his fist in acknowledgment while being introduced before a ceremonial handshake to mark the beginning of negotiations between the United Auto Workers and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in July.

The corruption by UAW executives has done more to divide the union than anything else imaginable.\n\nThe union is desperate during the current negotiations to show they have strength and value to workers. Unfortunately, their actions have created that most loathsome of situations during any negotiation. They have lost the high ground, and it is the rank and file who will suffer for it.\n\nBut while we wait worriedly for the conclusion of this year\u2019s negotiations, the UAW is missing out on an opportunity to show value to workers. While marching in the Labor Day parade, the union could set aside their outdated partisan politics and publicly back the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nHeavily steeped in President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican Jobs First\u201d policy, the USMCA will be a boon to the American economy, replacing the hated NAFTA, and focusing on the American worker.\n\nUnfortunately, the UAW continues to show their chief priority is not to their own rank and file, but to the leaders of the Democratic Party. If the USMCA had been negotiated by a democrat, union executives would be doing cartwheels in excitement for the agreement. But just because President Trump is a Republican, UAW officials and their democrat bosses in Congress will not endorse the agreement. Afraid to give President Trump a \u201cwin\u201d before an election year, union officials ignore the benefits to their workers and instead place more importance on the democrat party -- a party dedicated to the auto industry destroying Green New Deal.\n\nThe UAW however wants more out of the USMCA, claiming it does not give everything they want. This all-or-nothing strategy would be devastating at the negotiating table yet is somehow justified when the president is not from the party the union gets its marching orders from.\n\nWhile President Trump succeeds by placing American workers first, UAW officials continue to stumble inside their own corruption-filled organization, and by simply missing a chance to endorse the pro-worker USMCA. Autoworkers deserve so much better.\n\nFor all the autoworkers out there worried about the strength of our union, we see real leadership and concern for the American worker coming from the White House. Our union officials claim to march in unity but fail us in every single step they take.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the UAW to take a leap forward and put workers first by endorsing the USMCA.\n\nTerry Bowman is a 23-year Ford-UAW worker and the co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2019/09/03/opinion-united-auto-workers-should-endorse-usmca/2162986001/", "description": "\"The corruption by UAW executives has done more to divide the union than anything else imaginable.\"", "authors": ["Terry Bowman", "Published P.M.
