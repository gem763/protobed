They raise concerns about the global oil supply and likely will further increase tensions across the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between the U.S. and Iran over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nThe attacks resulted in \u201cthe temporary suspension of production operations\u201d at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The fires \u201cwere controlled,\u201d the statement said, and no workers were injured.\n\nOfficials said they hoped to restore production to its regular level of 9.8 million barrels a day by Monday.\n\n\u201cFor now, markets are well supplied with ample commercial stocks,\u201d the International Energy Agency tweeted, according to Reuters, saying it was in contact with Saudi authorities as well as major producer and consumer nations.\n\nThe fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, according to the statement, which said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. The statement said Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, would provide updated information in the next 48 hours.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis, who hold Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, took responsibility for the attacks in the war against a Saudi-led coalition that has fought since 2015 to reinstate the internationally recognized Yemeni government. But the U.S. blamed Iran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting, \u201cThere is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d Pompeo added.\n\nIn a short address aired by the Houthi\u2019s Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones after receiving \u201cintelligence\u201d support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues.\n\n\u201cThe only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us,\u201d Sarie said.\n\nHouthi rebels have been using drones in combat since the start of the Saudi-led war. The first appeared to be off-the-shelf, hobby-kit-style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the U.N., the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.\n\nU.N. investigators said the Houthis\u2019 new UAV-X drone likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). That puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in range.\n\nFirst word of Saturday\u2019s assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day\u2019s first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom\u2019s defense, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is \u201cwilling and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,\u201d according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.\n\nSaudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as \u201cthe largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world.\u201d\n\nThe facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest central processing facilities in the world. The Iran conflict is going to be hitting the world in a new way,\u201d said Kevin Book, managing director, research at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.\n\nThe Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.\n\nThere was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel.\n\nThere was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Analysts warned though that the size of the loss could trigger a sharp rise in oil prices when markets reopen after the weekend, potentially spreading fears to the wider economy.\n\nOn Friday U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, -0.05% fell 24 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $54.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange\u2014for a roughly 3% weekly decline, according to Dow Jones Market Data, tracking the front-active contract. November BRNX19, +0.05% shed 16 cents, or 0.3%, to $60.22 a barrel on the ICE Futures, with prices marking a weekly fall of 2.1%.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has taken steps to protect itself and its oil infrastructure, analysts had warned that Abqaiq remained vulnerable. The Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington-based advisory group, warned in May that \u201ca successful attack could lead to a months long disruption of most Saudi production and nearly all spare production.\u201d It called Abqaiq, close to the eastern Saudi city of Dammam, \u201cthe most important oil facility in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a report published Saturday, Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that although Aramco officials have indicated that exports will resume in the next few days, \u201cthere is nothing to suggest that this is a one-off event and that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels will forgo further strikes on Saudi sites.\u201d\n\nThe war has become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.\n\nThe rebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged. The Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s crucial East-West Pipeline in May. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shaybah oil field.\n\n___", "description": "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR314_saudi__ZG_20190914131508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
