The \u201cJesus Is King\u201d record features a track called \u201cClosed on Sunday,\u201d as inspired by Chick-fil-A\u2019s famous policy of being closed on the weekend day.\n\nThe song sent Twitter users into a frenzy, and even elicited a fiery reply from BK, with a spokesperson joking that their restaurant, in comparison, is always \u201copen on Sunday.\u201d\n\nCHICK-FIL-A GIVING EVERYONE IN UTAH FREE CHICKEN SANDWICHES AS PART OF 'FOWL PLAY' PROMOTION\n\nAfter multiple delays and a promise to fans that his team would not \"sleep until this album is out,\u201d the Grammy winner\u2019s \"Jesus Is King\" album finally dropped at noon on Oct. 25.\n\nThe gospel-rap album has been highly anticipated since West\u2019s wife Kim Kardashian tweeted a tracklist in September, and amid his Sunday Service pop-ups, the celebrity couple previewed several last-minute listening parties in cities across the nation. The album dropped the same day an accompanying documentary hit IMAX theaters.\n\nIn \u201cClosed on Sunday,\u201d West sings \"Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A. Hold the selfies, put the 'gram away. Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray.\u201d\n\nLater, the 42-year-old rapper croons \u201cClosed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A. You're my number one, with the lemonade.\"\n\nTwitter users, meanwhile, reacted to the tune with a range of emotions. One user teased that the song had a greater cultural impact that Mozart\u2019s last symphony, while another predicted that the track would have Chick-fil-A owners dancing with glee.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nSome skeptics, however, were more critical as they voiced feelings of confusion, saying it was the song \u201cno one\u201d asked for.\n\nSeizing the moment, Burger King soon jumped into the fray with a snarky reply of its own.\n\n\u201cOpen on Sunday,\u201d a rep for the chain wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a representative for Chick-fil-A offered Fox News the following statement on West\u2019s new song:\n\n\u201cWe are always grateful to see excitement for the brand,\u201d a Chick-fil-A Inc. spokesperson said on Oct. 26 of the buzz surrounding \u201cClosed on Sunday.\u201d\n\nIn a larger sense, the chicken-centric chain even has a portion of its website dedicated to explaining the restaurant's famous \"Closed on Sunday\" policy.\n\n\u201cAt the end of a busy week, hours after the sun sets on Saturday evening, we turn out the lights and close our doors,\u201d a video explains. \u201cFor one day, our restaurants are still.
