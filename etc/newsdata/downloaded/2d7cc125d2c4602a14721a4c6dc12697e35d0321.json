It comes as the government refuses to carry out a detailed impact assessment of its Brexit deal.\n\nThe decision means the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s official forecaster, will not publish updated growth forecasts and a key health check on the public finances, which was likely to include an assessment of the Brexit plan.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, accused Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, of forcing Javid to shelve the budget because the OBR report would have revealed spiralling levels of public borrowing and a worsening growth outlook.\n\nQ&A What is the Office for Budget Responsibility? Show Hide The Office for Budget Responsibility is the government\u2019s independent forecaster, which gives its verdict on the outlook for growth and the public finances twice a year. The forecasts are published to coincide with the chancellor\u2019s two big set pieces of the year \u2013 the autumn budget and the spring statement \u2013 and takes into account the impact of any tax and spending measures announced in those statements. The OBR also uses its public finances forecasts to judge the Treasury\u2019s performance against the chancellor\u2019s fiscal targets, stating whether or not it has a greater than 50% chance of hitting the targets under current policy. It was established in 2010 by the then chancellor George Osborne with the aim of improving the credibility of the government\u2019s official forecasts for growth. The forecasts were previously produced by the Treasury itself and often criticised for being unrealistic. The OBR is led by three members of the budget responsibility committee, including chairman Robert Chote, a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with support from the OBR\u2019s permanent staff of 27 civil servants.\n\nMcDonnell said: \u201cWe suspect that one of the reasons for Dominic Cummings pulling the budget is that the government has panicked over the publication of accompanying forecasts, which clearly would have exposed the perilous economic situation as a result of its Brexit proposal.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding that the OBR\u2019s report be published and are exploring what parliamentary devices are available to secure this.\u201d\n\nJavid has denied being forced to shelve the budget, despite appearing on TV late on Wednesday to say it was still scheduled. He told the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Friday: \u201cIt was a decision that I\u2019ve made but with the prime minister because we both agree.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe entire cabinet agreed when we had the cabinet meeting [on Thursday]. But the prime minister and I agreed well before that that the most important thing is going to be that we get Brexit done and then we have this general election.\u201d\n\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, said the government would have been embarrassed by an OBR report saying the public finances and the outlook for growth was worsening.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the official view of the public finances and whatever Brexit scenario they would have run alongside it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The OBR has already warned that the government is on-track to overshoot its borrowing target by at least \u00a38bn this year, as the prime minister ramps up spending on the NHS, schools and policing. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\n\u201cIn a world in which we have an election before we have the next OBR forecasts, I suppose the concern is we\u2019ll end up in the bad old days of people either making up their own forecasts or relying on what we know are very out of date numbers from March.\u201d\n\nThe OBR has already warned the government is on-track to overshoot its borrowing target by at least \u00a38bn this year as borrowing levels rise, while the IFS has said the government had effectively abandoned its own tax and spending rules, as the prime minister ramps up spending on the NHS, schools and policing.\n\nEconomists joined the criticism on Friday, warning that the government was neglecting its duty to publish detailed analysis about the state of the economy and the public finances. They also cautioned that Javid could break the government\u2019s own rules for managing the economy.\n\nJagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the UK\u2019s oldest independent economic research organisation, said: \u201cThere is potential for a complete retreat from rules-based monetary and fiscal policy. A botched spending review and a cancelled budget as well as deafening silence on the next governor.\u201d\n\nThe OBR is bound by the charter for budget responsibility, introduced by George Osborne after the financial crisis, to publish two health checks on the economy and public finances in each financial year.\n\nAlthough it must be ordered to publish them by the chancellor, McDonnell suggested Labour could table parliamentary proposals enforcing publication. The OBR is also understood to be considering what it would need to do in the event they are not commissioned.\n\nWes Streeting, a Labour MP on the Commons Treasury committee, said the OBR should still publish its forecast and that the chancellor should appear before the committee.\n\n\u201cThe cancellation of the budget without a proper explanation is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nTorsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said voters would not have enough detailed information about the Conservatives spending plans for an upcoming election without the independent OBR report.\n\nThe OBR last published an assessment of the economy and public finances in March. Since then, Johnson has ramped up public spending while the economy has slumped close to the point of recession, as Brexit uncertainty holds down growth.\n\nGemma Tetlow, chief economist at the Institute for Government thinktank, said: \u201cThe economic and fiscal picture has changed since March. Allowing the OBR to publish its forecast \u2013 even without a budget \u2013 would help ensure election promises are informed by up to date information.\u201d", "description": "Chancellor Sajid Javid accused of trying to hide worsening growth outlook and neglecting duty to publish OBR reports", "authors": ["Richard Partington", "Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d483994821d37e3e24d735a414893ecc1dec6c03/0_199_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=849aaa352569782972751230e5d5f1f4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
