A reading below 1 means the company\u2019s operating profit cannot cover its interest expenses.Those with an interest coverage ratio of less than 1 for three consecutive years are often referred to as marginal or zombie firms.The number of such companies came to 146, or 10.4 percent of the total, last year, up 1.2 percentage points from 9.2 percent a year earlier, the report said. It also cited a slump in the real estate market for the increase.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
