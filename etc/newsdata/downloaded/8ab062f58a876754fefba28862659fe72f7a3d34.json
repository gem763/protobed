Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) refused to say on Wednesday if her running mate would refrain from attending big-money fundraisers.\n\nWarren, who has touted her campaign as 100 percent grassroots-funded, refused to say if she would require that her running mate not attend big-money fundraisers.\n\n\u201cIs your vice presidential pick going to also try and avoid those high-dollar fundraisers as well?\u201d a reporter asked.\n\nWarren refused to answer the question directly, calling it \u201ca little premature\u201d and essentially leaving the door open for her potential running mate to attend high-dollar fundraisers, which she prides herself on avoiding.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We\u2019re still in primary here, and I\u2019m working hard on this,\u201d she said.\n\nBut look, I want a vice presidential partner, someone who\u2019s going to get out there and fight for the same values,\u201d she added:\n\nWarren\u2019s claims of a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign have been called into question, particularly following a report that indicated she used millions in leftover funds \u2013 $10.4 million \u2013 from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her presidential campaign. At the time, Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers, causing some to question her commitment to a true grassroots operation.\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) contributed $4,000 to Warren in 2018 and noted her sudden change of heart.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nRendell cohosted a Biden fundraiser earlier this year. To his surprise, the Warren campaign slammed the event as \u201ca swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that Warren benefitted from similar events in the recent past. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any trouble taking our money the year before,\u201d Rendell said, according to the Times. \u201cAll of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.\u201d\n\nWarren also attended fundraisers hosted by billionaires\u2013 specifically Henry and Marsha Laufer.\n\nAs the New York Times reported:\n\nIn Florida, she was hosted for an event by the billionaires Henry and Marsha Laufer. In New York, Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq, held a reception for her. She was hosted by the \u201cLost\u201d creator Damon Lindelof and his wife, Heidi, in Southern California. The philanthropist Stephen M. Silberstein had Ms. Warren over to his San Francisco-area home. And as late as the fall of 2018, she visited Silicon Valley, where Karla Jurvetson, a multimillion-dollar Democratic contributor, hosted an event for her.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign reported $24.6 million raised in the third quarter, less than $1 million short of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) $25.3 million. Approximately 940,000 contributions comprised the third-quarter haul, having an average donation of $26.", "description": "Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) refused to say on Wednesday if her running mate would refrain from attending big-money fundraisers.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Elizabeth-Warren-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
