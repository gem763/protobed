Alliances are very easy.\u201d It was part of this same answer that the Republican went on to complain about the Kurds not meeting his expectations during World War II.\n\nThe president seemed quite pleased with his ridiculous comments, publishing them to Twitter, and touting how \u201cdifferent\u201d they were.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that the point of the reporter\u2019s question was right and Trump was wrong. As the United States abandons its allies in Syria \u2013 based on a decision the president made on a whim, without any real policymaking process \u2013 the world takes note, and our already damaged credibility suffers further.\n\n\u201cAlliances are very easy\u201d? For countries that honor their commitments, stand by their allies, and demonstrate sound judgment on the international stage, maybe. But the current American president seems wholly oblivious to the challenges of creating and sustaining alliances in a time when our foreign policy is shaped by an erratic amateur who\u2019s too often confused between friend and foe.\n\nSally Canfield, a former aide to George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, wrote on Twitter yesterday, \u201cSo let me get this straight. Basically the President of the United States helped coordinate an attack on an ally.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing that makes cultivating and maintaining alliances less than \u201ceasy.\u201d\n\nIn fact, ideally Trump would remove the word \u201ceasy\u201d from his vocabulary altogether, because it\u2019s arguably the most dangerous he word he knows.\n\nTrade wars, the president assured the public, are \u201ceasy.\u201d So is a military confrontation with Iran. So is getting China to fix North Korea. So is closing the border between the United States and Mexico. So is the Middle East peace process.\n\nTrump never wants to be bothered with pesky details \u2013 reading and attending briefings distracts from his television habits \u2013 which is why he thinks every challenge is \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201cvery simple.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, the result is a president who responds to deeply intricate challenges like he\u2019s the blowhard at the end of the bar who\u2019s convinced he knows the solution to every problem. Opiods? Let\u2019s just execute drug dealers. Immigration? Let\u2019s just built a wall. School shootings? Let\u2019s just arm teachers. Syria? Let\u2019s just get out of the way so Turkey can slaughter our Kurdish allies.\n\nThere\u2019s reason to cringe every time Trump uses the word \u201ceasy\u201d: it\u2019s too often tied to a complex policy dynamic that\u2019s anything but easy.", "description": "The United States can abandon its allies, Trump suggested, because forging alliances is \"easy.\" It's the most dangerous word in his vocabulary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_mj_joe2_micro_191010_1920x1080.jpg?itok=BtRQfKq7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
