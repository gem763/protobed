California governor justified in halting practice: Readers sound off", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nWhile some think execution is effective, others call it \"cruel and unusual punishment\" against minorities and the poor.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced a moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nLetters edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI am not surprised that some people are angry with Newsom for suspending the death penalty. It's vengeful and doesn't do us any good. For years, there has been this idea that we act well only when we live under the threats of severe punishments, like the death penalty. This is an ugly, cynical and cruel philosophy. Instead of being threatened, forced and scared into being good, we need to regain trust in ourselves. Only then will we begin to free the world of anger and violence.\n\nWillis \"Ramakumar Jones\" Lyman; Fairfax, Calif.\n\nCalifornia has 737 people on death row, the largest death row population in the United States. (Photo: California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation/Getty Images)\n\nOn March 1, a Texas inmate was executed after a 30-year wait. Our justice system must change! If a person is sentenced to death, the sentence should be carried out without delay. After what he put his victims through, 30 years were devoted to keeping this man alive. For 30 years this man was fed and maintained in his cell. Taking 30 years for a man to snore his way to death is a crime in itself.\n\nTom Reeves; Auburndale, Ga.\n\nIllinois did away with the death penalty years ago and major crimes are worst. Why should the killer live when the life they took was cut short. Criminals have more rights than the victim. There is no respect for someone\u2019s life by felons anymore. \u2014 Don Wyma (@djwy62) March 19, 2019\n\nWhen DNA has proved guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt it should be applied. Like in the case of Dahmer or Gasey, yes, otherwise no. \u2014 Tracy Galligan, MAEd, NBCT (@tracygalligan) March 18, 2019\n\nFacebook comments edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nToo bad for the victims and their families. Murderers execute the death sentence on innocent folks regularly.\n\n\u2014 Jeff Felix\n\nGood for Newsom. The death penalty in the U.S. is wrong because it is used disproportionately against black, brown and low-income people. In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled on the requirement for consistency in the application of the death penalty and found that the death sentences of three black men consisted of cruel and unusual punishment. It doesn\u2019t save taxpayer money when you consider how expensive court proceedings are in capital cases that result in a death sentence. Moral argument aside, there are no logical reasons to support capital punishment in the U.S.\n\n\u2014 Giacomo Padrino\n\nI am not against the death penalty. I am just against how it's administered in every state where they have it.\n\n\u2014 Hank Chandler\n\nThis country needs a complete rework of its archaic and inefficient legal system. It allows the guilty to walk free as long as they are wealthy enough and condemns the innocent to oppression and death.\n\n\u2014 Mike Martin\n\nWant to sound off about what's happening with justice system?
