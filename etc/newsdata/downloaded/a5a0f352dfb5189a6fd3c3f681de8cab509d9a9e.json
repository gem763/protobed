As long as it is no trend that keeps going throughout the game, and it\u2019s not a system error, then in a way we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d\n\nWhile conceding the Springboks would have to tighten up their handling for Sunday\u2019s match, the forward instead took positives from their defensive performance against a rampant Japanese side in their 26-3 quarter-final win.\n\n\u201cIt was a great performance by the team - not to concede a try, and being down to 14 men for a period,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat was fantastic to see as a team, because we\u2019ve put a lot of work into that.\n\n\u201cBut I think on the other side, on the attacking side, we had a lot of opportunities, we knocked a few balls, and we dropped one or two, but going into a semi-final, you might only get four opportunities or three opportunities.\n\n\u201cAnd then you need to convert that into points, because you never know when you will be back in their points zone where you can score.\u201d\n\nThe pivotal moment in Wales\u2019s 20-19 win over France came when French lock Sebastien Vahaamahina was sent off shortly after half-time for a blatant elbow on flanker Aaron Wainwright. France had been leading 19-10 at the time.\n\nVermeulen said South Africa will need to be disciplined and at full strength as they bid to reach the final.\n\n\u201cWhen we play we try not to get cards, not to get any yellows or reds,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause when you get a card you are under pressure ... we felt that at the weekend against Japan with \u2018beast\u2019 being off for 10 minutes,\u201d he said, referring to prop Tendai Mtawarira\u2019s yellow card for a spear tackle on Keita Inagaki.\n\n\u201cWe had to defend with 14 men, and that makes it difficult. And you can\u2019t have that in knockout games, you lose, you get punished.\n\n\u201cI think that has a massive effect on the game, on the result, so hopefully we can go and play with 15 men all the time.\n\n\u201cIt is not a thing we have discussed yet, but hopefully it is something we will discuss this week.\u201d\n\nThe winner of Sunday\u2019s clash will face either New Zealand or England in the World Cup final on Nov. 2.", "description": "South Africa are not concerned the profligacy that tainted Sunday's victory over Japan will cost them in their upcoming rugby World Cup semi-final against Wales, Duane Vermeulen told reporters on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ossian Shine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443623789&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0H9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
