New Zealand may have finished up with 11 tries and a comfortable-looking victory but the final margin did scant justice to the efforts of a spirited Namibia who, for 35 minutes, proved more than a match for their illustrious opponents.\n\nNew Zealand 71-9 Namibia: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nNamibia\u2019s collection of amateurs and journeymen pros - their line-up included farmers, a bank worker and a dentist - did their nation proud, playing with more pace, intent and accuracy than many of their supposed peers. For three and half minutes early on, the lowest-ranked side in the tournament even led the two-time world champions and were still only 10-9 down heading towards half-time.\n\nThe All Blacks, in addition, had just lost their prop Nepo Laulala to the sin-bin and when a sore-looking Brodie Retallick also departed the fray prematurely, Steve Hansen\u2019s men were looking genuinely under the cosh.\n\nFly-half Helarius Kisting had a fine game and the Namibia scrum-half Damian Stevens, possessor of one of the smoothest passes in the tournament, proved equally impressive off the kicking tee, nailing three penalties as the referee Pascal Gauzere showed New Zealand no mercy at the breakdown.\n\nIt was fun while it lasted but the tide had to turn eventually. Losing Laulala seemed to galvanise his teammates and a try apiece from replacement Angus Ta\u2019avoa and full-back Ben Smith, added to earlier scores from Seru Reece and Anton Lienert-Brown, saw New Zealand go in 24-9 ahead at the interval,\n\nFrance v Tonga: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live! Read more\n\nDespite a second All Blacks yellow card, this time for Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi, it was one-way traffic thereafter. Smith, Reece and Lienert-Brown all ended up with two tries each and there were further five-pointers for Joe Moody, Sam Whitelock, Jordie Barrett and a flying TJ Perenara as the All Black forwards cranked up the pressure.\n\nNamibia, though, never lay down even after the departure of their hard-tackling captain Johan Deysel, known as \u2018Buffy\u2019 to his team-mates because of his reputation for slaying unwary opponents on the field.\n\n\n\nOn paper the final scoreline looks worse than the 58-14 outcome in this corresponding fixture in London\u2019s Olympic Stadium in 2015, but Namibia made more clean breaks than South Africa managed against the same opposition on the opening weekend. On this evidence, they are an improving side who should run Canada close in their final\n\nPool B fixture on Sunday.", "description": "A spirited Namibia proved more than a match for New Zealand early on before the All Blacks scored 47 unanswered points in the second half", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb4de2905e7ca7b05e157a9299ef33dfdbaae11/0_106_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=418c963ce51a3db266532eafcf849c63", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
