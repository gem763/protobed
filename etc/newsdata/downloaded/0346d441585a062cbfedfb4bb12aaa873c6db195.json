Any time you can stop fighting, it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cNow, the question is, what does this look like? I think Erdogan is meeting with Vladimir Putin shortly, like in four days. So, in the midst of a ceasefire, what do they negotiate? We ceded, effectively, Syria over to Russia and Turkey. They are the major players there now, and Iran. So, when they get together, are they going to basically carve out Syria for themselves? That\u2019s a question, and that\u2019s a concern I have.

They have to get out, de facto gives Turkey what they wanted through military objectives. And we still have abandoned our allies. We had to bomb our own military base for God\u2019s sake. It reminds me of Somalia and South Vietnam.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Friday's \"CNN Newsroom,\" Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) stated that the situation in Syria \"reminds me of Somalia and South Vietnam.\" Kinzinger | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Kinzinger-1018-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
