Then they spent three years swerving all over the shop,\" Dominic Cummings told guests at businessman and former Vote Leave donor Stuart Wheeler's book launch, the Telegraph reported.\n\n\"It is not surprising that some people are angry about it.\"\n\nHis words are in line with Johnson's increasingly combative stance against lawmakers.\n\nThe PM faced heavy criticism Wednesday for his dismissal of threats MPs have received from members of the public over Brexit. Labour MPs had asked in the House of Commons that Johnson moderate his language due to concerns that war-like Brexit rhetoric \u2014 words like \"surrender,\" \"traitor\" and \"betrayal\" \u2014 is worsening tensions and fueling violence across the country.\n\nJohnson was also slammed for saying \"the best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox [a Labour MP murdered by a right-wing extremist before the referendum]\" would be to deliver Brexit.\n\nCummings, who led the Vote Leave campaign, said people \"on both sides during the referendum and since the referendum have said things which veer between unwise and very unpleasant, and sometimes criminal.\"\n\nHowever, he said there is a difference between \"robust political discussion and debate and threats of violence.\"\n\n\u201cEveryone should take [threats] extremely seriously \u2014 I know people in both parties and on both sides in Leave and Remain who have had serious threats like that and it is obviously bad.\"\n\nCummings said the only way to resolve the situation is to deliver Brexit, but expressed concerns that those pushing for a second referendum would stand in the way.\n\n\u201cI talked to some Remain MPs in parliament in the last few weeks and either I am completely deluded or they are completely deluded but one of us is completely deluded about the nature of things and we will find out.\u201d\n\nPrompted by Wheeler not to deliver a \"soft\" Brexit due to mounting pressure from the October deadline, Cummings responded: \"We are not under pressure at all.\n\n\"The referendum was pressure, the referendum was difficult,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a walk in the park compared to that. All the Vote Leave team, we are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to leave, don't worry.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser responds to anti-no deal Brexit MPs receiving threats from the public.", "authors": ["Miriam Webber", "Charlie Cooper", "Kate Day"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171922700-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
