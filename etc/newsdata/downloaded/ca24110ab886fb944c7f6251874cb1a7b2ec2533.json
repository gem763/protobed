A call is a type of option that gives the holder the right but not the obligation to own a stock at the current price.\n\nUber shares UBER, +3.55% gained 3.6% Monday, while Lyft\u2019s stock LYFT, +3.67% increased 3.7%. Both stocks have struggled to live up to the prices commanded in their initial public offerings, closing higher than their respective IPO prices twice apiece in their months on the market.\n\nAfter those struggles, Kahn now sees regulatory risks reflected in the stock prices and predicts that the companies will begin focusing on more profitable growth going forward. She projects that the ride-sharing aspect of these businesses has the potential to be \u201cprofitable at scale,\u201d as do Uber\u2019s food-delivery efforts.\n\nOpinion: Lyft and Uber are giving investors what they want, which is bad for the rest of us\n\nShe argues that the ride-haling segments can generate profits if Uber and Lyft cut sales and marketing expenses while leveraging their fixed-cost bases, as both companies appear to be attempting to do. Kahn sees the competitive landscape becoming more rational, which should help the companies pull back on driver and rider incentives.\n\n\u201cLooking globally, we point out that Yandex Taxi is already a profitable ride-hailing business and the largest food delivery company \u2212 China\u2019s Meituan Dianping \u2212 just turned a profit,\u201d Kahn wrote. \u201cBoth sectors are sensitive to marketing spend rationalization and we think peak incentives and losses are now behind Uber and Lyft.\u201d\n\nRead: Uber leaves \u2018tantalizing clues\u2019 about ride-hailing profits\n\nWhile Kahn cut her Uber price target to $44 from $49 in conjunction with the upgrade to buy from hold and decreased her Lyft target to $62 from $67, her new targets still imply more than 25% upside for each stock, even with Monday\u2019s rally.\n\nShe does caution that the coming lockup expiration for Uber shares on Nov. 6 creates an \u201coverhang\u201d for the stock.\n\nUber and Lyft shares are both off 20% over the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX, -0.31% has increased 3.8%.", "description": "Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. received a boost Monday after HSBC analyst Masha Kahn turned bullish on both ride-hailing stocks, writing that...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ083_Uber_0_ZG_20190508081337.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
