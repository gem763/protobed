Me and Maura were in Dubai at the same time, we didn't know each other, we never met,\" she confessed.\n\n(Image: ITV2)\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\n\"But literally we were in the same restaurant at the same time and we never even knew.\n\n\"I said to her when she came into the villa, 'I really recognise you', and it was the biggest coincidence ever.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old added: \"When I was in the villa, I was saying, 'I wonder if they'll pick up on that', because there were posts of me in Dubai.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV/REX)\n\n\"I was always wondering what the press would pick up on and they did and they were like, 'They knew each other, they planned it'.\n\n\"But I just thought what are you talking about? Like how could we do that?\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\n\"I didn't even tell hardly anyone I was going on Love Island, so like I'd tell a random girl in a restaurant in Dubai that I was going on.\n\n\"I just thought it was so funny, and a very, very clever conspiracy theory.\"", "description": "Molly-Mae has hinted that the girls are closer than ever with a cosy night out snap", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Aaron Parfitt", "Splashnews.Com", "Mollymaehague Instagram", "Instagram", "Supplied Wenn", "Itv", "Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20669829.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Molly-Mae-Hague-and-Maura-Higgins.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
