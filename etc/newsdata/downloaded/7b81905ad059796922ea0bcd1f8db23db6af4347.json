Those with vulnerable phones should make sure they download the patch as soon as it\u2019s available sometime in the next few days.\n\nThe bug \u2014 which shows up in the security patch notes as CVE-2019-2215 \u2014 allows a hacker to remotely root and take complete control of a device, though it requires the victim to install an infected app first (or the hacker uses the exploit in conjunction with a Chrome-based loophole to deploy the attack).\n\nThe exploit is present on the following phones, though Google\u2019s Project Zero cautions that other handsets could be affected as well:\n\nGoogle Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 and 2 XL\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7, S8 and S9\n\nHuawei P20\n\nLG models running Android Oreo\n\nMotorola Moto Z3\n\nOppo A3\n\nXiaomi A1, Redmi 5A, and Redmi Note 5\n\nGoogle will start rolling out the October 2019 security patch Tuesday, and other manufacturers will likely have their own version live within the next few days. Keep an eye out for automatic update notifications, or check for the patch yourself by going to your phone\u2019s Settings app and searching for \u201cSystem Update.\u201d (The exact pathway will differ depending on your device and version of Android.)\n\nGoogle Project Zero reports that the bug has been successfully exploited, which raises some big questions regarding who is using it and why. The exploit itself was created by the Israeli online security firm NSO, who denies that it or any of its clients \u2014 which mostly consists of government groups and national security organisations \u2014 are actively using the exploit.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely average Android users will be targeted by whoever is exploiting the bug, it\u2019s severe enough that everyone should install the October 2019 security update once it\u2019s available on their specific device, and those using any of the smartphones listed above should take extra care in the meantime.\n\nThat means resisting the urge to install apps from unknown sources, installing a good anti-virus app, and being smart about your browsing \u2014 maybe even consider using a non-Chrome mobile browser.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in reading more about the bug and how it works, check out Ars Technica\u2019s full report.", "description": "Google\u2019s monthly Android security fixes are normally just for Google devices, but Samsung, Motorola, LG, Oppo, Huawei and Xiaomi are all rolling out their own versions of the October 2019 security update to patch a major zero-day security vulnerability present on several Android smartphones.
