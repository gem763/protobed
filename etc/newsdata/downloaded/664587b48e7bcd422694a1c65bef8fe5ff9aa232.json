Michael A. Taylor, pinch-runner Andrew Stevenson and Anthony Rendon all came home to steal Washington the lead in a flash.\n\nDaniel Hudson forced the final three outs to lock up the win, uncorking celebrations on the field and in the stands.\n\nIt marks the first time in franchise history the Nationals won a winner-take-all postseason game. They visit the Los Angeles Dodgers for Games 1 and 2 in the NLDS Thursday and Friday.\n\n\u201cTo finally break through with this group of guys, it\u2019s special,\u201d Nationals president and general manager Mike Rizzo said as a player poured a beer down his back in the locker room.\n\nDave Martinez, the target of fans\u2019 ire after Washington\u2019s 19-31 start to the season, secured a win in his first playoff game as a manager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to those guys in that clubhouse,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey played hard all year long. We started off horrible, as we all know, and we vowed that we wouldn\u2019t quit. I told the boys, I promise you, stay with it, don\u2019t quit, this will turn around. And it did.\u201d\n\nSoto, a 20-year-old who just completed his second regular season, said he was aware of Washington\u2019s reputation in the postseason.\n\n\u201cI know they always go to the playoffs, they always lose, something like that,\u201d Soto said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re here, we try to fight. We\u2019re gonna see how far we\u2019re gonna get.\u201d\n\nDespite his age, there was no playoff pressure for Soto in his postseason debut.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I like to play. I like to play with a lot of crowd, with a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get a little nervous, but we just try to control the emotions and be focused. It\u2019s just the pitcher and me and the mound right now.\u201d\n\nStarter Max Scherzer gave up two home runs in the first two innings that put Washington in an early 3-0 hole. After Scherzer walked the Brewers\u2018 leadoff batter on a full count, No. 2 batter Yasmani Grandal belted his first pitch into the Nationals\u2019 bullpen for a two-run shot. Eric Thames homered off Scherzer to lead off the second.\n\n\u201cI could tell he was amped up,\u201d Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki said. \u201cThey came out aggressive, swinging early. We changed our approach a little bit after that, but you know, he made his pitches.\u201d\n\nScherzer went on to pitch five innings with six strikeouts and three walks, getting himself out of jams as they arose. Stephen Strasburg replaced him in relief and fared much better, striking out four in the following three innings and scattering two hits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen any emotion out of Stephen, really,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cHe made a little fist pump there when he got a ground ball from Ryan Braun with a runner on second. But this guy is businesslike, goes out and does the job, man.\u201d\n\nTrea Turner, facing two strikes and two outs in the third inning, nailed a solo home run to get Washington on the board, but that was their lone run for most of the night. The offense didn\u2019t look like it would ever ignite, until the eighth inning rolled around.\n\nTaylor reached base on a hit-by-pitch that the Brewers challenged, thinking the ball made contact with Taylor\u2019s bat at some point. The call was upheld, and Ryan Zimmerman followed it up with a pinch-hit single. Rendon drew a walk to load the bases, setting up Soto to be the hero.\n\nAfter Grisham\u2019s error, Soto pushed past second base was caught in a pickle between second and third for the inning\u2019s final out \u2014 but not before three runs had plated, two earned for Hader, one unearned due to the error.\n\n\u201cI saw the ball go around (Grisham) and I\u2019m just thinking, \u2018They gotta send Rendon,\u2019\u201d Soto said, \u201cso I gonna make sure they throw to third baseman. So that\u2019s why I just keep going to third and then do the rundown, make sure he scored.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty good for a 20-year-old to be able to kind of slow the game down and not try and do too much,\u201d Zimmerman said, deadpanning, \u201cHe\u2019s got a chance to be OK.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 playoff bugaboo did not disappear, though. Tuesday\u2019s win advanced them to the divisional series \u2014 the round where Washington lost in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
