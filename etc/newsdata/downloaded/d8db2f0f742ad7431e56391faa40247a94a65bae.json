Until then, all territories of the United States, including Puerto Rico, had been governed by men appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Most governors had been known more for their relationships to the president than, say, for their ability to speak Spanish . But after that 1947 law, Puerto Rican voters elected Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn to begin what would become a transformative governorship.\n\nEven as more recent governors have resigned in disgrace, democratic self-government in Puerto Rico has remained. But that could change. Next week, the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider a case that could radically undermine the ability of over four million American citizens \u2014 in Puerto Rico, other territories and even the District of Columbia \u2014 to elect their own chief executives.\n\nThe court is being asked to decide whether a constitutional provision that ordinarily limits Congress applies when Congress legislates for a territory. That provision, the appointments clause, requires all \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d to be appointed by a specified procedure, typically by the president with Senate confirmation. Because of this clause, it would be unconstitutional for Congress to allow voters to elect the attorney general or secretary of state; those officers must be appointed and confirmed. But on the assumption that the appointments clause doesn\u2019t apply to territories or the District of Columbia, Congress allowed for the election of Puerto Rico\u2019s governor in 1947 and the district\u2019s mayor in 1973.\n\nCongress\u2019s grant of self-determination was, paradoxically, justified by a series of Supreme Court decisions that were grounded in imperialism and white supremacy. Those decisions held that constitutional provisions that normally limit Congress\u2019s powers don\u2019t apply in the capital district or territories. But over the years, those rulings also led to laws that have allowed for the dignity of self-rule in those places.", "description": "The Supreme Court will consider that question next week.", "authors": ["Nikolas Bowie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/09Bowie1/09Bowie1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
