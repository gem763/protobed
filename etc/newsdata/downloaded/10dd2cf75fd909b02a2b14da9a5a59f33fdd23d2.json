But the data doesn\u2019t support this according to a study by Citadel Securities that examined bid-ask spreads in the order books of 13 US exchanges for all SP500 and R2000 stocks since mid-2011. The conclusion is that the bid-ask spreads have declined for small orders but have remained the same for large orders.
