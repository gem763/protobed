Lettuce. Tomato\u201d \u2014 will be available for 12 weeks starting Monday at 28 locations in southwestern Ontario, according a statement. The burger in question is from Beyond Meat, a company whose meat-substitute patties are already being served Carl\u2019s Jr. locations around the United States.\n\nThe alliance of market-dominating McDonald\u2019s and Beyond Meat puts them in competition with the combo of Burger King and Impossible Foods, the provider of the Whopper\u2019s vegetarian patty. Burger King tested its Impossible Whopper in the St. Louis area before expanding it to the chain\u2019s 7,200 locations nationwide. McDonald\u2019s is describing the P.L.T. in similar terms. \u201cThis test allows us to learn more about real-world implications of serving the P.L.T., including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations,\u201d Ann Wahlgren, McDonald\u2019s vice president of global menu strategy, said in the statement.\n\nBeyond Meat, which is also available in grocery stores, reformulated its burger this summer, making it more attractive, with a meatier look and taste. It seems McDonald\u2019s will be customizing the ingredient: The Beyond Meat patty is \u201ccrafted exclusively by McDonald\u2019s, for McDonald\u2019s, to deliver the iconic taste customers know and love,\u201d per the statement.\n\nMeet the P.L.T., a delicious, juicy plant-based burger, that will be available for a limited time as a test at selected restaurants in Southwestern Ontario. pic.twitter.com/0oozPRXGcT \u2014 McDonald's Canada (@McDonaldsCanada) September 26, 2019\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned lettuce and tomato, it also includes a slice of cheese, onion, mustard, ketchup and a \u201cmayo-style sauce,\u201d served on a sesame-topped bun. It clocks in at 460 calories, 25 grams of fat and 920 milligrams of sodium \u2014 all less than those in the company\u2019s Quarter Pounder and Big Mac. The price is $6.49 Canadian, or about $4.89 U.S.\n\n[Perspective: KFC\u2019s new fried chicken and doughnut sandwich is terrifying and delicious]\n\nThe P.L.T\u2019s debut follows another late entry from McDonald\u2019s in the ongoing fast-food wars. Last week, it began serving a spicy chicken sandwich whose entry trailed that of the Popeyes viral version, which lit up social media this summer and resulted in a nationwide shortage. But it\u2019s not the first time Burger King has paved the way for its rival: As my colleague Tim Carman noted when Burger King\u2019s veggie option came out, McDonald\u2019s founder Ray Kroc had acknowledged that the Big Mac was the culinary clapback to the Whopper.\n\nThe news that McDonald\u2019s was getting into the veggie-burger game was met with cheers on social media, with many people lamenting that the small test market meant they wouldn\u2019t be able to get their hands on one anytime soon. Also enthusiastic? Investors. Shares of Beyond Meat rose 12 percent, while McDonald\u2019s stock was up 1 percent, CNBC reported.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is tardy to the chicken-sandwich party with a spicy entry that can\u2019t touch Popeyes\u2019\n\nThe key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world\n\nWe did it, America.
