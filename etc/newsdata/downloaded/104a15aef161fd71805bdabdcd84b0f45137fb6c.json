His interrogation tactic enabled Little to present detailed, vivid memories of each woman he killed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s indications of visualization, of when he\u2019s thinking about a crime scene. He\u2019ll start stroking his face. And as he\u2019s starting to picture a victim, you\u2019ll see him look out and up,\u201d Holland said.\n\n\u201cAnd you can tell he has this revolving carousel of victims, and it\u2019s just spinning, and he\u2019s waiting for it to stop at the one that he wants to talk about,\u201d he added.\n\nLittle also had the ability to sketch out the likenesses of the women he killed, creating a collection which Holland showed in the 60 Minutes interview.\n\nThe FBI released those drawings back in February to get help in identifying some of Little\u2019s victims. Little is currently incarcerated and serving three life sentences, which has led him to be forthcoming with investigators around the country.", "description": "A prolific serial killer confessed to murdering 93 women throughout his lifetime, according to a 60 Minutes special set to air Sunday evening.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/samuel-little-court-AP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
