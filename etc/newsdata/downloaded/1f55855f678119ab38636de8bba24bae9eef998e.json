It doesn\u2019t appear to be all that smooth for Fultz at the moment, but he is at least taking shots outside of the paint in NBA games, and that bodes well for the rest of his career.\n\nOn Saturday night as Orlando took on the Atlanta Hawks, Fultz attempted not one but six 3-pointers that resulted in in two made jumpers from beyond the arc.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nM A R K 3 L L 3 pic.twitter.com/Ppb60jHPzH \u2014 Orlando Magic (@OrlandoMagic) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time Fultz hit a 3-point shot was on Oct. 29, 2018. He has made just six threes during his time in the NBA, so Saturday night\u2019s effort represents more than 30% of his total made jumpers from deep.\n\nWho knows what the future holds for Fultz and his shooting? He still has a wonky jumper, one that looks a bit like Shawn Marion shooting from inside a ball pit.\n\nStill, if he can extend his range and get his career back on track, it\u2019ll be a huge recovery of talent for the Magic, who didn\u2019t give up all that much to get him.", "description": "He has made just six threes during his time in the NBA.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HyeFYYyLNBJR4BOJG6UESQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDMuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n6brKX5QVePP1uls5Ne9Vw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTYzOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/7f2938baf3d61e5be9d0b4f3a81a2f16", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
