Getty\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not actually that old, but I\u2019ve got a few miles in the legs on a cricket field. I feel like an old man trying to run between the wickets!\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a few texts this week saying \u2018if you win the league, is that it?\u2019 But I\u2019ve promised Tendo (Essex captain Ryan Ten Doeschate) I\u2019ll play for another year at least.\u201d\n\nCook\u2019s half-century, his seventh of the summer to add to his one hundred, was crucial as Somerset\u2019s spinners bowled Essex out for 141 \u2013 62 behind on first innings.\n\nEngland spinner Jack Leach took five wickets and threatened again after Somerset forfeited their second innings and had an hour to bowl out Essex.\n\nCook stood firm again, however, as Essex finished on 45 for one to add the County Championship title to the Vitality Blast crown they had won only five days earlier.\n\n\u201cI was nervous all week, there\u2019s always going to be little twists and turns,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou don\u2019t bat on a wicket like that and just cruise, you need a little bit of luck on those wickets.\n\n\u201cI have played in sub-continent conditions quite a lot, and I suppose that\u2019s where my experience comes from with a unique method.\n\n\u201cThis is so special. All that stuff (knighthood) is great, but it\u2019s about the memories you create with this group of guys. There is a lot of home-grown Essex players and that\u2019s great for our success.\n\n\u201cObviously we don\u2019t want to look too far ahead, but next year is the same group of players and it could be quite special.\u201d\n\nThe title decider did mark the end of one former England batsman\u2019s career as Marcus Trescothick bowed out of the game.\n\nTrescothick announced in June that he would retire at the end of the season and bring down the curtain on a first-class career that began in 1993.\n\nThe 43-year-old received a huge ovation as he came on to the field as a substitute for the final few minutes, with Cook saying: \u201cHe was out there sledging me!\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018This will be a story if I catch you right at the end\u2019. Luckily Dominic Bess bowled me one on leg-stump, which I could clip and get away.\n\n\u201cBut what a career \u2018Tres\u2019 has had. To play for 27 years is extraordinary.\u201d", "description": "Sir Alastair Cook has promised title-winning Essex\u00a0at least one more season after admitting his junior colleagues keep him young.
