Either way, the 20-year-old outfielder is having fun at the plate in a series that has turned into a coming-out party for a next-generation Major League Baseball star.\n\nEntering Friday\u2019s Game 3 \u2014 on his 21st birthday, no less \u2014 Soto is hitting .289 in the playoffs, and has been even better against the Astros. In nine plate appearances, Soto recorded four hits, three runs and walked twice. And on Thursday, Soto was nominated for his first-ever Gold Glove nomination for his work in left field.\n\nIn two short seasons, Soto, with his All-Star skills and marquee smile, is well on his way to becoming not just the face of his franchise, but a legitimate MLB star.\n\nHis production helped the Nationals survive Bryce Harper\u2019s departure, and his potential could help the team thrive even is MVP-candidate Anthony Rendon were to leave in free agency this winter.\n\n\u201cFor me, Bryce chose to go elsewhere,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cBut the guys we\u2019ve had, we knew that we had the right guys to be able to step in and do the job, we really did. I mean, a healthy Adam Eaton, as you all know, you can see what he can do. We have a young center fielder in Victor Robles that\u2019s had an opportunity to play every day this year, and has done well.\n\n\u201cAnd a 20-year-old that\u2019s going to be 21 here in a day or two that\u2019s been unbelievable.\u201d\n\nBecause of his age, Soto has been racking up World Series records. He became the third-youngest player ever to hit clean up for a World Series team. He joined just three others \u2014 Mickey Mantle, Andruw Jones and Miguel Cabrera \u2014 as the youngest to hit a home run in the World Series.\n\nStill, the most impressive aspect of Soto\u2019s game is the respect he already commands at the plate.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s 12-3 win, the Astros did something they hadn\u2019t done the entire season: They intentionally walked a batter. By sending Soto to first in the seventh inning \u2014 loading the bases in the process \u2014 the Astros opted not to pitch to someone for the first time since 2018. They were the first team in MLB history to go the entire regular season without using an intentional walk.\n\nThe decision backfired as the Nationals tacked on five additional runs to take an 8-2 lead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched Soto just like you have,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cWe see the downside of [the intentional walk]. Clearly I think there\u2019s a lot of downside given that I haven\u2019t done it all year.\n\n\u201cBut ironically I thought it was our best chance to limit their scoring, and instead it poured gasoline on a fire that was already burning.\u201d\n\nThis season, the Nationals were confident Soto would continue to have success after a stellar rookie campaign. Soto and the team understood pitchers would try to adapt by throwing more off-speed pitches and fewer fastballs \u2014 an approach that proved unsustainable.\n\nIn Year 2, according to Baseball Savant, Soto ended up facing a greater percentage of fastballs (54%) than he did his rookie season (52). It helped that Soto dramatically improved against off-speed pitches, going from a .220 hitter to .315.\n\nSoto consistently works on his approach. After Game 3 of the NLCS, a game in which the Nationals won, Soto went into the batting cages to work with hitting coach Kevin Long.\n\nMired in a mini-slump and determined to break out, Soto did \u2014 coming up with timely hits in Game 1 and 2 in Houston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on that since my first day in the big leagues,\u201d Soto said. \u201cSometimes I just put gum in my mouth, but most of the time just take a deep breath and focus. It\u2019s just the pitcher and me. Everybody around, I forget about everybody around. It\u2019s just you and me and you try to make me out and that\u2019s how everything comes down and try to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
