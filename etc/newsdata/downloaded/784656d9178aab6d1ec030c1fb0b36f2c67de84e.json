Government spending climbed 7%, to $4.1 trillion, outpacing higher federal tax receipts, which grew 3%, to $3.1 trillion.\n\nThat brought the total deficit to $1.07 trillion so far in fiscal 2019, which started Oct. 1, or 4.4% as a share of gross domestic product.\n\nThe last time the U.S. recorded a budget gap of that magnitude in the first 11 months of the fiscal year was in August 2012, when the deficit totaled $1.16 trillion, a period when the U.S. was still climbing out of a deep recession. Deficits began to decline soon after amid concerns about rising red ink, after Republicans and Democrats agreed to cut spending and let certain tax cuts expire.\n\nNo such agreement is on the horizon now, and forecasters project trillion-dollar annual deficits for decades to come.\n\nA strong economy typically leads to narrower deficits, as rising household income and corporate profits help boost tax collections, while spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance tends to decline.\n\nThe U.S. economy has been growing for 10 years as of July, the longest economic expansion on record. Yet annual U.S. deficits are on track to exceed $1 trillion starting this year, due in part to the 2017 tax law, which constrained federal revenue collection last year, and a 2018 budget deal that busted spending caps enacted in 2011.\n\nSenior Treasury officials attributed this year's higher deficit primarily to a surge in government spending, and emphasized that federal revenues have climbed nearly 7% since May, in large part reflecting a robust economy and low unemployment. Corporate tax revenue in particular has rebounded in recent months, after a period when analysts were unsure why it was running below Congressional Budget Office projections.\n\nStill, revenue growth has continued to lag the broader economy, and is below where forecasters projected it would be prior to the 2017 tax cuts.\n\nFederal spending has continued to climb. The Treasury said Thursday spending on the military and interest costs on government debt each rose 9% from October through August, and Medicare expenses increased 10%.\n\nIt's not yet clear whether the deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the full fiscal year, because the government usually collects more revenue in September than it spends, which could bring the overall figure down. The White House Office of Management and Budget in July projected the deficit would hit $1 trillion by the end of September, while the CBO last month said it expected a total deficit of $960 billion in fiscal 2019.\n\nRising deficits have led the Treasury to ramp up borrowing in recent years. The government said it expected to borrow more than $1 trillion for the second year in a row in 2019. Government debt held by the public has risen from $14.4 trillion at the start of the Trump administration, to nearly $17 trillion today, a 19% increase.\n\nMarkets have responded to the increased issuance with a shrug, and interest rates remain at historic lows amid steady demand from investors. Still, a swelling debt load has increased the government's debt-servicing costs, one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the government was considering financing options that could reduce borrowing costs, including introducing a 50-year bond and lengthening the maturity of Treasury borrowing.\n\nPresident Trump, as part of his pressure campaign on Federal Reserve policy makers, argued on Wednesday that further short-term rate cuts would also help lower government borrowing costs.\n\nReacting on Twitter to a rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said of European governments: \"They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\"\n\nSome economists are skeptical that pushing interest rates to zero, as he called for, would lead to lower interest costs on government debt.\n\nMore broadly, annual deficits are projected to more than double as a share of the economy over the coming decades, as a wave of retiring baby boomers pushes up federal spending on retirement and health-care benefits.\n\nCBO last month increased its expectations for deficits over the next decade after Congress and the White House reached a new two-year budget deal that would boost federal spending more than $300 billion above spending caps enacted in 2011.\n\nThe deal will add roughly $1.7 trillion to deficits between 2020 and 2029, assuming federal spending continues to rise by the rate of inflation beyond 2021. Much of that increase will be offset, however, by lower-than-expected interest rates, which will reduce the cost of servicing the government's swelling debt by $1.4 trillion over the next decade, the CBO said.\n\nWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 15:44 ET (19:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
