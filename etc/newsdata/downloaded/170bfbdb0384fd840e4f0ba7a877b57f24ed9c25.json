Schiff (D-Calif.), meanwhile, said that a former deputy national security adviser had \u201cno basis in law\u201d to skip a deposition Monday and that his failure to appear was further evidence of Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct Congress.\n\nAD\n\nCharles Kupperman, who served as a deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, filed a lawsuit Friday seeking guidance from a federal judge about whether he should listen to the executive branch, which has told him not to attend, or to Congress. Since there has not yet been a ruling, he declined to appear.\n\nAD\n\nKupperman listened in to the July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. That call is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which Trump and his Republican allies continued to attack Monday as unfair.\n\n\u25cfWhistleblowers walk among us. Now one has gotten in Trump\u2019s head.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfTrump seizes on Baghdadi raid to paint Democrats as dangerous leakers \u2014 and it\u2019s likely to inflame tensions amid a rancorous impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u25cfJohn Kelly says he warned Trump he\u2019d be impeached if he hired a \u201cyes man\u201d as chief of staff to replace him.\n\n8:00 p.m.: Schiff tells Trump to focus on Islamic State\n\nSchiff responded to Trump\u2019s tweet Monday night, urging the president to focus on the fight against the Islamic State instead of on attacking him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMr. President, I\u2019m grateful to our armed forces and intelligence professionals who did such a brilliant job of eliminating this brutal terrorist from the battlefield, and focused on the continuing fight against ISIS,\u201d Schiff said in a tweet. \u201cI would encourage you to do the same.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n6 p.m.: Trump on not informing Democrats of Baghdadi raid: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that!\u2019\n\nIn an evening tweet, Trump said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if Democrats impeach him over not informing Schiff or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of the raid that targeted Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cCan you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn\u2019t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, Trump told reporters that he did not inform Pelosi of the raid because he \u201cwanted to make sure this kept secret.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nU.S. presidents typically follow the protocol of contacting congressional leaders, regardless of their political party, when a high-level military operation is conducted.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), meanwhile, sought to take credit for Democrats\u2019 decision to schedule a vote on the impeachment inquiry. Graham last week introduced a Senate resolution denouncing the House inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming response House Democrats heard from the American people and Senate Republicans in support of my resolution forced their hand,\u201d Graham said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an acknowledgment of the success of our efforts last week.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n4:50 p.m.: White House says Democrats have been \u2018conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding\u2019\n\nAD\n\nGrisham responded to the news of Thursday\u2019s planned vote by taking a swipe at Pelosi and other House Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to comment fully until we see the actual text, but Speaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\u201d Grisham said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats have likened the early stages of the impeachment inquiry to closed grand-jury proceedings. They say transcripts will be made available later and some witnesses will be recalled to provide public testimony.\n\nAD\n\n4:40 p.m.: McCarthy accuses Democrats of \u2018backtracking\u2019 by scheduling impeachment vote\n\nHouse \u00adMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has long called on Democrats to hold a vote formally opening an impeachment inquiry. But McCarthy did not welcome the news of Thursday\u2019s planned vote. Instead, he accused Pelosi and other Democrats of \u201cbacktracking\u201d on the matter.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 34 days since Nancy Pelosi unilaterally declared her impeachment inquiry,\u201d McCarthy said in a tweet. \u201cToday\u2019s backtracking is an admission that this process has been botched from the start. We will not legitimize the Schiff/Pelosi sham impeachment.\u201d\n\n4:20 p.m.: Some Republicans mock Democrats over plans for impeachment vote; others take credit for move\n\nAD\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) ridiculed House Democrats\u2019 announcement that the House will vote Thursday on an impeachment resolution.\n\nIn a tweet posted shortly after the news broke Monday, Meadows renewed his criticism of the closed-door depositions conducted during the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats now suddenly saying they\u2019ll vote on an impeachment resolution to \u2018ensure transparency\u2019 is rich \u2013 considering they\u2019ve spent weeks conducting interviews in secret, leaking their own talking points while locking down any and all information that benefits the President,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nOthers cast the move as too little, too late.\n\n\u201cThe ship has already sailed on having a fair and transparent process,\u201d Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) said in a tweet. \u201c@RepAdamSchiff poisoned the well on day one. The time for a vote was a MONTH ago! This is like the referee showing up halfway into a football game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.) took credit for the pushing the Democrats to act, calling the Monday announcement \u201cproof that our efforts are working!\u201d\n\n\u201cPelosi is bringing the impeachment inquiry to the floor for a vote after several weeks of my colleagues & I demanding transparency & proprietary in the process,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThis is a necessary step to ensure all our voices are heard.\u201d\n\n3:45 p.m.: Pelosi says House vote will \u2018eliminate any doubt\u2019 about whether Trump administration can withhold documents\n\nAD\n\nIn a letter to Democratic lawmakers, Pelosi explained the reasons behind House leadership\u2019s decision to hold a vote formalizing impeachment procedures.\n\nThe move \u201cestablishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nThe White House has repeatedly balked at providing documents to the House during the impeachment inquiry, arguing that Democrats had not held a vote to formally begin the process.\n\nAD\n\n3:20 p.m.: House will vote on impeachment procedures Thursday to \u2018ensure transparency,\u2019 Democrats say\n\nHouse Democrats said Monday that the House will vote Thursday to formalize procedures for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThe text of the resolution was not immediately available, but House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said it would \u201censure transparency and provide a clear path forward\u201d as the investigation continues. \u201cThis is the right thing to do for the institution and the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rules Committee will meet at 3 p.m. Wednesday to mark up the resolution, McGovern said.\n\n1:50 p.m.: Morrison will appear if subpoenaed, lawyer says\n\nFollowing Kupperman\u2019s failure to appear, a lawyer for another witness scheduled for deposition this week \u2014 Tim Morrison, the National Security Council\u2019s Europe and Eurasia director \u2014 issued a statement saying that he still plans to appear if subpoenaed.\n\n\u201cOur plans have not changed: if subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison will appear,\u201d Morrison\u2019s attorney, Barbara Van Gelder, said in a statement.\n\nMorrison could be a key witness.\n\nActing U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. has told investigators that Morrison was on the July call between Trump and Zelensky. Taylor said he spoke to Morrison several times about his concerns that Trump was using military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\n1:35 p.m.: Trump campaign debuts new \u2018Witch Hunt\u2019 merchandise\n\nThe Trump campaign began selling merchandise Monday riffing off the Disney movie \u201cHocus Pocus,\u201d deriding the impeachment inquiry as a witch hunt.\n\nLimited edition \u201cStop the Witch Hunt\u201d T-shirts and \u201cfine art\u201d posters hit the online campaign store by early afternoon, after first being announced by Breitbart. The items recast Schiff, Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) as the witches. In a crystal ball below them, Trump grips an American flag.\n\n\u201cHOAXUS POCUS!\u201d the description says. \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of the USA continues. The only people scared this Halloween are Shifty Schiff, Nervous Nancy and Democrat Hack Jerry Nadler about their chances in 2020!\u201d\n\n1:30 p.m.: Kupperman issues statement calling for \u2018judicial clarity\u2019\n\nAfter failing to appear before House investigators, Kupperman issued a statement suggesting it would be in the best interest of all parties to have a court ruling on whether he should listen to the White House or Congress.\n\n\u201cGiven the issue of separation of powers in this matter, it would be reasonable and appropriate to expect that all parties would want judicial clarity,\u201d Kupperman said.\n\n12:2o p.m.: Pelosi highlights news story about Republican anxiety\n\nThe office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) highlighted a Washington Post story Monday about concerns of Senate Republicans that the fast-expanding impeachment probe is fraying their party as it becomes more difficult to defend Trump.\n\nThe piece was blasted by email to reporters on Pelosi\u2019s press list.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Starr suggests censure as alternative to impeachment\n\nKenneth W. Starr, who conducted the investigation that led to President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998, said Monday that the House should have spent more time discussing less severe penalties.\n\nOn a podcast hosted by Washington Examiner political correspondent Byron York, Starr said it would have been prudent for Congress to have fully debated remedies other than impeachment. He pointed in particular to a censure of Clinton that was proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cI think the discussion was impoverished by not having a full debate within the House and for that matter within the Senate on whether something short of impeachment would have been appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d Starr said. \u201cSpecifically, a resolution of censure.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the same approach could be contemplated for Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. While Trump\u2019s conduct is \u201cnot the stuff of impeachment,\u201d a censure could be within reason, Starr said.\n\n\u201cIt just seems to me we need to ratchet the conversation down because of the evils of impeachment,\u201d Starr said. \u201cImpeachment has become a terrible, terrible thorn in the side of the American democracy and the conduct of the American government since Watergate.\u201d\n\n11:50 a.m.: Trump compares impeachment to Jussie Smollet case\n\nWhile addressing a gathering of police chiefs in Chicago, Trump compared the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry to allegations that actor Jussie Smollet made in the city earlier this year involving two purported Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scam. Just like the impeachment of your president is a scam,\u201d Trump told the conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n\nIn January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two men in ski masks who called him racial and homophobic slurs, and said, \u201cThis is MAGA country,\u201d referencing Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThe next month, Smollett was charged by a grand jury with a felony for filing a false police report. His defense team reached a deal with prosecutors in March under which charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.\n\n11 a.m.: Pelosi highlights Gowdy\u2019s defense of closed-door hearings\n\nThe political team of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought Monday to highlight a weekend television interview in which former Republican congressman Trey Gowdy voiced support for closed congressional hearings.\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Gowdy was asked whether he still believes what he said in 2018: that public hearings can turn into a \u201ccircus\u201d or \u201cfreak show.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you still believe that?\u201d host Margaret Brennan asked.\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d responded Gowdy, who served as chairman of a House select committee on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly complained about the use of closed-door depositions in Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi\u2019s team tweeted a news story Monday recounting Gowdy\u2019s appearance that included a television clip.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Schiff says Kupperman had no justification to skip deposition\n\nSchiff said that Kupperman\u2019s justification for not appearing Monday has \u201cno basis in law\u201d and could be used against him in a contempt-of-Congress proceeding.\n\nKupperman has indicated that he will not appear until a judge rules on whether he should listen to the White House, which has asked him not to cooperate, or Congress, which issued a subpoena to compel his testimony.\n\n\u201cWe suspect the court will make short shrift of that argument,\u201d Schiff told reporters.\n\nSchiff also said that if the White House continues to instruct witnesses from the administration not to appear, it will be \u201cbuilding a very powerful case\u201d for an article of impeachment against Trump for obstructing Congress.\n\n\u201cThe White House has obstructed the work of a coequal branch of government,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nHe expressed disappointment in Republican colleagues who have supported the White House\u2019s efforts to block witnesses.\n\n\u201cWhere is their duty to this institution? Where is their duty to the Constitution?\u201d Schiff asked.\n\n10 a.m.: Jordan defends Kupperman\u2019s no-show\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) defended Kupperman\u2019s failure to appear for a deposition Monday, telling reporters that the former Bolton deputy would be \u201cmore than willing to come\u201d if a federal judge rules he must.\n\n\u201cIf the court rules against him, then \u2014 well, not really necessarily rules against him \u2014 if the court says he has to come, he\u2019s more than willing to come,\u201d Jordan said, adding that Kupperman \u201chas said several times that he\u2019s willing to come, but obviously he\u2019s not coming today.\u201d\n\nJordan reiterated his criticism of the impeachment inquiry, which he called a \u201ccharade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been nothing there, but Adam Schiff down here in the bunker continues to have these secret depositions and then go out and leak stuff,\u201d Jordan said.\n\n9:40 a.m.: Sondland goes to Capitol Hill to review testimony\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, has appeared on Capitol Hill to review the transcript of his Oct. 17 deposition before House investigators. Reviews are routine for such depositions.\n\nSondland, a Trump campaign donor who has emerged as a central figure in the Ukraine scandal, testified that Trump delegated U.S. foreign policy on Ukraine to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\n9:30 a.m.: Kupperman fails to appear for closed-door deposition\n\nKupperman failed to show for an impeachment inquiry deposition as he sought a court ruling to resolve a dispute over testifying.\n\nThe former Bolton deputy had faced a congressional subpoena and a warning from Democrats that a failure to appear could result in a contempt citation.\n\nKupperman filed a lawsuit Friday asking a federal judge to resolve conflicting orders from Congress and the White House over his testimony. Over the weekend, his attorney Charles Cooper reiterated Kupperman\u2019s desire to have the courts resolve the dispute before he appears.\n\n8:50 a.m.: Trump attacks Schiff, says he committed a \u2018criminal act\u2019\n\nTrump took renewed aim at Schiff on Monday, calling him a \u201ccorrupt politician\u201d and accusing him of having committed a \u201ccriminal act\u201d during a congressional hearing last month.\n\nDuring an Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry, presented an embellished version of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. At the time, Schiff said he was conveying \u201cthe essence\u201d of what Trump had relayed to Zelensky. Schiff later said it was meant as a parody, something that he said should have been apparent to Trump.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff went before Congress and Adam Schiff, what he did will never be forgotten: he made up a conversation,\u201d Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews as he prepared to head to Chicago. \u201cThey say he has immunity because he\u2019s a member of Congress. People shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do that. What he did, that\u2019s a criminal act.\u201d\n\nTrump also defended his decision not to brief Schiff about the military operation targeting Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of the Islamic State, before announcing his death publicly.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about why didn\u2019t I give the information to Adam Schiff and his committee, and the answer is, I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a corrupt politician. He\u2019s a leaker like nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d\n\n8:45 a.m.: Trump praises Giuliani for \u2018looking for corruption\u2019\n\nTrump continued to stand by his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, telling reporters Monday that he considers him a \u201cgood man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the greatest mayor in New York City history,\u201d Trump said before departing for Chicago on Air Force One. \u201cBut he\u2019s been a great crime fighter. He\u2019s always looking for corruption, which is what more people should be doing. He\u2019s a good man.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has become a key figure in the Ukraine scandal because of his repeated efforts to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Two associates of Giuliani, who assisted with him in Ukraine, have also been arrested recently for campaign finance violations.\n\n8:20 a.m.: Trump heads to Chicago for law enforcement event, fundraisers\n\nAs House investigators seek to resume their work on Monday, Trump is heading to Chicago to address a conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and hold fundraisers.\n\nTrump left the White House at 8:17 a.m. and plans to return late in the afternoon. This is his first trip to Chicago since becoming president. He frequently blames the city\u2019s Democratic leadership for its relatively high crime rate.\n\n7:30 a.m.: RNC chairwoman calls impeachment inquiry a \u2018charade\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies resumed their attacks Monday on the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry, with Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel calling it a \u201ccharade\u201d in a morning tweet.\n\nEchoing other Republican attacks from recent weeks, McDaniel took issue with several aspects of the process, including the lack of a vote to launch the inquiry, which is not required by the Constitution.\n\nMcDaniel also accused Democrats of having \u201cno defined scope\u201d and \u201cno specific rules.\u201d\n\n\u201c#StopTheSchiffShow!\u201d she tweeted, referring to Schiff.\n\nStephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist, also attacked Schiff on Monday during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is much ado about nothing,\u201d said Bannon, who has launched a podcast to push back against the inquiry. \u201cThis is Schiff and a radical group of Democrats that are throwing the country into a constitutional crisis over the Christmas holidays. We\u2019re hurtling toward a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\n7 a.m.: Despite subpoena, former White House national security adviser unlikely to testify on Capitol Hill\n\nKupperman, who served as a deputy to Bolton, is not expected to show up on Capitol Hill on Monday, despite a congressional subpoena and a warning from Democrats that a failure to appear could result in a contempt citation.\n\nOn Friday, Kupperman filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to resolve conflicting orders from Congress and the White House over his testimony. Over the weekend, his lawyer Charles Cooper reiterated Kupperman\u2019s desire to have the courts resolve the dispute before he appears.\n\nHouse Democrats pushed back. On Saturday, three committee chairs sent Cooper a letter arguing the lawsuit lacked merit and had been coordinated with the White House. Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and acting Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) called Kupperman\u2019s suit \u201can obvious and desperate tactic by the president to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nCooper responded with a strong letter of his own Saturday night, saying the lawsuit had not been \u201ceven discussed\u201d with anyone at the White House.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Tom Hamburger\n\n6:30 a.m.: Republican senators feel anxious and adrift defending Trump\n\nRepublican senators are lost and adrift as the impeachment inquiry enters its second month, navigating the grave threat to Trump largely in the dark, frustrated by the absence of a credible case to defend his conduct and anxious about the historic reckoning that likely awaits them.\n\nRecent days have delivered the most damaging testimony yet about Trump and his advisers commandeering Ukraine policy for the president\u2019s personal political goals, which his allies on Capitol Hill sought to undermine by storming the deposition room and condemning the inquiry as secretive and corrupt.\n\nThose theatrics belie the deepening unease many Republicans now say they feel \u2014 particularly those in the Senate who are dreading having to weigh their consciences against their political calculations in deciding whether to convict or acquit Trump should the Democratic-controlled House impeach the president.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Robert Costa and Philip Rucker\n\n6 a.m.: Sen. Johnson, ally of Trump and Ukraine, surfaces in crucial episodes in the saga\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) met in July with a former Ukrainian diplomat who has circulated unproven claims that Ukrainian officials assisted Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, a previously unreported contact that underscores the GOP senator\u2019s involvement in the unfolding narrative that triggered the impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nIn an interview this week, Andrii Telizhenko said he met with Johnson for at least 30 minutes on Capitol Hill and with Senate staff for five additional hours. He said discussions focused in part on \u201cthe DNC issue\u201d \u2014 a reference to his unsubstantiated claim that the Democratic National Committee worked with the Ukrainian government in 2016 to gather incriminating information about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Telizhenko said he could not recall the date of the meeting, but a review of his Facebook page revealed a photo of him and Johnson posted on July 11.\n\n\u201cI was in Washington, and Sen. Johnson found out I was in D.C., and staff called me and wanted to do a meeting with me. So I reached out back and said, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll come down the Hill and talk to you,\u2019 \u201d Telizhenko told The Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nAn individual close to Johnson confirmed that staff for one of his committees met with Telizhenko as part of an ongoing investigation into the FBI and its probes of the 2016 election, but declined to say whether the senator was involved.\n\nThe meeting points to Johnson\u2019s emerging role as the member of Congress most heavily involved in the Ukraine saga that has engulfed the White House and has threatened Trump with impeachment.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Elise Viebeck and Dalton Bennett\n\n5 a.m.: Chants of \u2018Lock him up\u2019 and \u2018Impeach Trump\u2019 greet the president at Nationals game\n\nTrump was booed during Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night when he made a rare public appearance in a luxury ballpark suite in \u00adDemocrat-dominated Washington.\n\nWhen the president was announced on the public address system after the third inning as part of a tribute to veterans, the crowd roared into sustained booing \u2014 hitting almost 100 decibels. Chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d and \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d then broke out at Nationals Park, where a sellout crowd was watching the game between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros.\n\nThe president appeared unmoved, waving to fans and soon moving to chat with McCarthy in his luxury box along the third base line.\n\nTrump, who has virtually never been seen in Washington outside the White House, his own hotel and a handful of other highly controlled settings, came with the first lady, a coterie of Republican members of Congress and top aides, who could be seen smiling, chatting and posing for selfies throughout the game. He entered without fanfare about eight minutes before first pitch, only spotted by a few in the crowd.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "Meanwhile, Charles Kupperman, who was deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, is seeking a ruling from a judge about whether he should testify before a House committee.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jrL2eNMW5puTzYv_PAogpHXmkDU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LIRLBJXYZII6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
