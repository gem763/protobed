His death sparked street protests last year, particularly when prosecutors initially opted to bring the lesser charge of manslaughter against Guyger, 31.\n\nThe sentence was less than the 28 years prosecutors had sought. Judge Tammy Kemp said the jury had imposed no fine.\n\nLawyers for the victim\u2019s family said they believed the verdict was the first time a white female police officer had been found guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of an unarmed black man.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic case and history provides us with a teachable moment,\u201d said civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager shot and killed in 2012 by a civilian neighborhood watchman who was later cleared in court.\n\nThis case was unlike other recent high-profile killings, such as those of Michael Brown in Missouri and Philando Castile in Minnesota, since Guyger was not on duty or responding to a reported crime when she fired.\n\nFORGIVENESS WITHIN, ANGER WITHOUT\n\nAfter the sentence was handed down, Jean\u2019s younger brother Brandt offered Guyger his forgiveness.\n\n\u201cI forgive you, and I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you. I\u2019m speaking for myself, not my family, but I love you just like anyone else,\u201d Brandt Jean told Guyger.\n\nBrandt Jean then asked the judge\u2019s permission to hug Guyger, the judge gave it, and he and Guyger ran to one another and embraced in the middle of the courtroom. They hugged, cried and spoke softly to one another for about a minute.\n\nBotham Jean's younger brother Brandt Jean hugs former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger after delivering his impact statement to her following her 10-year prison sentence for murder at the Frank Crowley Courts Building in Dallas, Texas, U.S. October 2, 2019.

Protesters blasted the sentence as too short, shouting, \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d and \u201cThis is so wrong!\u201d\n\nWith protesters at her side, Botham Jean\u2019s mother, Allison, criticized what she called the poor training of police and called on the city to \u201cclean up\u201d its act.\n\n\u201cOur life must move on, but our life must move on with change. There\u2019s gotta be a better day, and that better day starts with each and every one of us.\u201d\n\nGuyger, who had spent four years on the force before the killing, took the rare step of testifying in her own defense during her trial, tearfully expressing regret for shooting Jean but saying she had believed her life was in danger when she pulled the trigger.\n\nProsecutors also argued that Guyger did little to help Jean even after realizing her mistake, calling the 911 emergency phone number for an ambulance but not administering first aid.\n\nThey also showed the jury several text messages that painted Guyger as racist.\n\nGuyger wrote in one January 2018 message that she would like to use pepper spray on the crowd at a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Dallas, while in another she wrote that her black police colleagues \u201cjust have a different way of working and it shows.\u201d\n\nGuyger also shared a post on Pinterest that stated: \u201cI wear all black to remind you not to mess with me, because I\u2019m already dressed for your funeral.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, Guyger\u2019s defense attorney said she was \u201con autopilot\u201d after a long work day, when she mistakenly parked on the wrong floor in the garage and was able to enter Jean\u2019s apartment because he had left the door slightly ajar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. I have to live with this every single day,\u201d Guyger told the jury of eight women and four men.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nIn cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus asked her, \u201cWhen you shot him twice, you intended to kill him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Guyger responded, in a calm voice.", "description": "Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday by a Texas jury that found her guilty of murder for walking into a neighbor's apartment thinking it was her own and shooting him as he ate ice cream.", "authors": ["Brad Brooks", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436426761&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911YJ"}
