The first-year Red Raiders coach didn\u2019t elaborate on the timing or provide more specifics about the injury to the Big 12\u2019s top passer.\n\nAs a true freshman last season, Bowman became the starter in the second game. He threw 2,638 yards with 17 touchdowns in eight games, missing four games over two different stints because of a collapsed lung.\n\nBowman didn\u2019t miss an offensive snap Saturday night, though he left the field for the locker room briefly after a linebacker drove his left shoulder into the turf after an incomplete pass that ended Texas Tech\u2019s first series after halftime. Bowman copleted 30 of 55 passes for 307 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nWells indicated after the game that Bowman was in pain.\n\nBowman leads the Big 12 this season with 1,020 yards passing (340 per game), and is the national leader with 33.7 completions per game.\n\nThe Red Raiders have an open date before playing at fifth-ranked Oklahoma on Sept. 28.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Texas Tech sophomore quarterback Alan Bowman will miss games because of a shoulder injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/texas_tech_arizona_football_12859_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
