Toyota says it hopes the introduction of the AI-agent will create an emotional bond between the car and its driver.\n\nYui's name is derived from the word \"cue\" in that the automaker hopes this will signal the development of more vehicles that will increase the car-and-driver relationship.\n\n\"With the LQ, we are proud to propose a vehicle that can deliver a personalised experience, meet each driver's unique mobility needs, and build an even stronger bond between car and driver,\" Toyota's LQ development leader Daisuke Ido said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe concept car's technological advancement doesn't stop at the inclusion of AI. The automaker, in partnership with Aisin Chemical Company and Cataler Corporation, has also included an \"air purification coating\" in the LQ.\n\nToyota claims \"a newly developed catalyst coating that decomposes ozone into oxygen on the radiator fan, allowing ozone near the ground surface, a cause of photochemical smog, to be decomposed as the vehicle moves,\" according to the release.\n\nThe LQ can fit four passengers and has an electric cruising range of 300 kilometers, about 184 miles. The car is the next generation of the Concept-i, which also uses AI to learn driving patterns and is slated to be used at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nTake a look at the LQ, which took about 400 engineers and over 20,000 parts to develop:\n\nYui changes the car's settings based on its reading of the driver\u2019s physical and emotional state.\n\nIt can engage with drivers through interactive voice communication, in-seat functions, in-vehicle lights, air conditioning, fragrance emitting, and \u201chuman-machine interactions.\u201d\n\nThis includes selecting and playing music based on the driver and the driving environment, setting a seat relaxing function, and changing the interior illuminations.\n\nYui controls seat functions through inflatable \u201cair bladders\u201d and air conditioning systems and that are embedded into the seats. The intention is to either keep drivers awake or relaxed.\n\nFor example, if Yui detects that the driver is tired, it will inflate the seat back to make the driver sit up straighter and pump cool air from the seat\u2019s ventilation system.\n\nThe LQ also includes an automated driving function that allows for a self-driving valet parking system. This means the car can drive itself to an assigned parking space in a parking lot after dropping the driver off.\n\nThe automaker hopes this will increase accessibility for people with \u201cmobility limitations\u201d such as seniors, pregnant women, and those with disabilities.\n\nThe Augmented Reality Head's Up Display uses AR to expand the information display of the HUD. The display projects driving information such as lane warnings and the GPS semi-transparently on the windshield, reducing eye movement.\n\nRoof and floor mats are used as a communication platform between the car and its passengers. Yui can change the colour displays to indicate when it's in automated or manual driving modes and will light up different sections of the foot wells to indicate which passenger Yui is speaking to.\n\nThe headlights come installed with a Digital Micromirror Device that displays road surface conditions to people inside and outside the car.\n\n\u201cThis vision is built on an understanding that mobility goes beyond physical transportation to include the human need to be moved and engaged emotionally,\u201d the automaker said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe car will go on the Toyota Yui Project Tours 2020, which is scheduled to run from June to September 2020 and will include public test-drive events.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Toyota has created the LQ concept car with self-driving capabilities which include \"Yui,\" an artificial intelligence agent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9477/b775f59205a54838b897bfad16d6a376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
