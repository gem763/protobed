She died on impact, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe family got together for what they thought was going to be a happy event with no intent for anyone to get hurt,\u201d Marion County Sheriff Jason Sandholdt said in a statement. \u201cWhat ended up happening was that Pamela Kreimeyer, a wife, mother and grandmother was killed by a piece of metal where a metal stand, gunpowder and colored powder were involved.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGender reveal\u201d parties have become an obsession for people trying find creative ways to tell the world the sex of the baby they are expecting. Often, these grand reveals are made for social media moments that involve displays of pink or blue.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Kreimeyer family had planned for.\n\nThey spent Friday and Saturday preparing for the moment, according to law enforcement. The family had welded a homemade stand, which was filled with gunpowder, to a metal base. They drilled a hole for a fuse and placed a piece of wood on top of the metal stand. Colored powder was then layered on top of the wood.\n\nThen, they put tape on top of the entire assembly, which \u201cinadvertently created a pipe bomb,\u201d authorities said.\n\nAD\n\nAround 4 p.m. Saturday, they lit the fuse.\n\nRather than shooting the colored powder into the air, the contraption exploded outward. A piece of metal struck Pamela Kreimeyer in the head before landing in a nearby field, according to the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nThe explosion remains under investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is a reminder that anytime someone mixes these things there is a high potential for serious injury or death. Please do not take these risks,\u201d Sandholdt said in a statement. \u201cMy condolences go out to the family.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A family \u201cinadvertently created a pipe bomb,\" authorities said.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CHJSEyDlZ2tf-WAkaJDIIsjs9Go=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EF3W6GHZWQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
