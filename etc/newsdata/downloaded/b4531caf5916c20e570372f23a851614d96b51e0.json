In Round 3, Nallo had absorbed too much damage to his leg and was unable to get his footing when he rolled his ankle and stumbled onto his back.\n\nThat was the beginning of the end for Nallo. The kicks were part of the game plan for Mota, a Glover Teixeira protege, and he was able to execute them to perfection.\n\n\u201cHe kicked him in the first round, he saw that he felt it, and when he started kicking it in the third, and he started believing in the kick, he knew the kick was going to finish him,\u201d Teixeira translated for Nallo after the fight at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.\n\n\u201cI watched his last fight. I saw he has good kicks, he has two KOs in Bellator, a lot of kicks, one knee, one head kick \u2013 and my game for this fight was leg kicks and wrestling,\u201d Mota said. \u201cHe has good legs \u2013 he showed me. I believe in my kicks.\u201d\n\nMota suffered his first career blemish when he fell short of capturing the vacant LFA lightweight title against Austin Hubbard in 2018. After a fast start, stumbling Hubbard on numerous occasions, Mota gassed out and Hubbard was able to take control of the fight.\n\nMota was finished with just 15 seconds left in the contest in a fight that many believed should have been stopped long before since he was taking a beating.\n\nBut Mota is past that loss, a fight that taught him some valuable lessons. He was able to rebound with a big win in his Bellator debut on Friday, and already has aspirations of competing against the division\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cI think this is normal,\u201d Mota said of his first career loss. \u201cI love training, I love fighting, I love everything. My last fight didn\u2019t switch anything in my mind, switched nothing in my life. I kept focused, I kept training, and I train with the best guys \u2013 Glover Teixeira, I have a good team. (At) Teixiera MMA, I have everything I need.\u201d\n\nAnd while he thinks Nallo was a formidable opponent, he\u2019s ready for the next level, and wants to take on the top 155-pound contenders.\n\n\u201cMy next goal is the best in the division, (fight) the big names in my division,\u201d Mota said. \u201cI\u2019m the champion \u2013 I\u2019m the next champion, not Nallo. I respect (Patricky) \u2018Pitbull\u2019 (Freire), I respect the guys in my division. I respect, but that\u2019s my dream, man.\u201d", "description": "After taking out Mandel Nallo at Bellator 231, Killys Mota believes he's ready for the big names in the lightweight division.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/killys-mota-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
