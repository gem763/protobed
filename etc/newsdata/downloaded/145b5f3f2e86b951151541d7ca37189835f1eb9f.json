It\u2019s a simple rule that you, me, and everyone who uses the hellish but seemingly indispensable social media platform should follow \u2014 if not exactly by the letter, then certainly in spirit. And there\u2019s perhaps no greater example of that truism than the tweet sent one year ago today by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420,\u201d he tweeted on August 7th, 2018. \u201cFunding secured.\u201d Those few words \u2014 the last two specifically \u2014 created an entirely new fire for Musk to put out at a time when he was already mired in the self-described \u201chell\u201d of Model 3 production. He did not, as it turned out, have any funding secured to do such a thing.\n\nAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018\n\nWithout rehashing the entire experience, which we documented in detail over the last year, here are some of the direct consequences of that decision to answer Twitter\u2019s eternal prompt of \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening?\u201d\n\nForced out as Tesla chairman.\n\nPaid a $20 million fine.\n\nTesla paid a $20 million fine.\n\nMusk bought $20 million in Tesla stock to essentially make up for the fine.\n\nAppointed two new independent directors to the company\u2019s board.\n\nAgreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla\u2019s in-house counsel.\n\nThat last point is especially relevant because, in February, the SEC tried to hold Musk in contempt for violating that part of the settlement. This kicked off another stage of the battle, one that very publicly played out in court over the course of a few months. In the end, the two sides agreed to amend the settlement to be more specific about what Musk can and can\u2019t tweet without approval \u2014 language he might have just violated again.\n\nIn this modern age, bad tweets abound. They\u2019re met with ratios or reported to Twitter itself, and are often, ultimately, deleted. You don\u2019t usually see such concrete evidence of how bad a tweet can break, though. Millions of dollars, months of headaches and distractions, and a proverbial door that the money cops can walk through every time they think Musk might have tweeted something that harms his company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nBad tweets abound\n\nTo be fair (I guess?) to Musk, these are the kinds of consequences he was trying to avoid by taking the company private! And for what it\u2019s worth, the fact that he didn\u2019t have \u201cfunding secured\u201d from Saudi Arabia meant he ultimately avoided what certainly would have been immense scrutiny from... well, everyone, following the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. (Saudi Arabia does still own about 5 percent of Tesla\u2019s stock that it bought on public markets, though it hedged that position earlier this year.) But if you\u2019re going to announce that you have lined up Saudi Arabian cash to take your multibillion-dollar company private in the middle of the trading day, you should probably resist the siren song of tweeting, put down the phone, and wait until that money actually exists.\n\nWhich brings me back to my original point: \u201cnever tweet.\u201d Again, I believe fully in the spirit of this rule as opposed to the letter of it, and often use it as a mantra to back myself off of any Twitter ledge I find myself on. I still tweet (sometimes a lot!). But more often than not, I think of the proverbial bullet Musk took, and do a survey of the resulting damage, tap \u201cCancel\u201d and then \u201cDelete.\u201d As much as I love Twitter, we\u2019d all probably be better off putting a bit of distance between it and our synapses anyway. Or, at the very least, burying it in our drafts while we cool off. We all might not have the fate of a massive company riding on the things that we publish on the platform, but if Musk\u2019s messy year is good for anything, it\u2019s reminding us how quickly things can get out of hand.", "description": "One year after the Tesla CEO announced he wanted to take the company private, the resulting damage is a good reminder that not every thought needs to be posted on Twitter.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GtNo7ovTDytjH7RvnT_BANM7vAw=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13177671/acastro_180928_1777_elon_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
