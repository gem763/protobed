It\u2019s about Trump\u2019s tax returns.", "language": "en", "text": "That\u2019s because this summer an anonymous whistleblower approached the House committee to say its concerns had been justified. The whistleblower offered credible allegations of \u201cevidence of possible misconduct,\u201d specifically \u201cinappropriate efforts to influence\u201d the audit of the president, according to a letter Neal sent to the treasury secretary.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the complaint details, including who allegedly meddled with the audit or how, and whether the IRS complied. The complaint hasn\u2019t been released, and Neal said last week that he\u2019s still consulting with congressional lawyers about whether to make it public.\n\nBut the exact details of the allegations matter less than the fact that they corroborate Democratic lawmakers\u2019 argument that oversight of the IRS\u2019s annual presidential audit is indeed a legitimate reason they \u2014 and hopefully, eventually, the public \u2014 should see Trump\u2019s taxes. It\u2019s hard to imagine how the federal judge in this case could now rule against the committee.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions The-Whistleblower-Complaint-You-Havent-Heard-Of-Relates-To-Trumps-Taxes"], "top_image": ""}
