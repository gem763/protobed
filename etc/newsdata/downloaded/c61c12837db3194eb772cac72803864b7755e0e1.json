Her fellow cheerleaders had decided to hold a memorial for her at Friday\u2019s game; however, the KUSD announced in a statement on Tuesday that they would not sanction the ceremony in an effort to \"remain neutral.\"\n\nAccording to the initial statement, KUSD officials, who sought legal advice regarding the memorial, stated they could not sanction any tribute, as they \"would be legally required to do so for all students involved,\u201d including Fuller \u2014 who also allegedly shot Kaylie\u2019s mother, Stephanie, who survived. Fuller pleaded not guilty on May 24 to the charges associated with the shooting, FOX 6 reported.\n\nCBS58 reports that some wanted to show support for Fuller, and if KUSD would allow a tribute to Kaylie they would, legally, have to extend the same option for Fuller\u2019s friends and family.\n\nIn an interview with WLIP, Nick Juga, Kaylie's father, said that Fuller's family wanted his step-brother to wear Fuller\u2019s football jersey as a tribute, which was ultimately not allowed after Nick complained to the school board. Nick informed the station that after Fuller's family heard of the planned memorial dedicated to his daughter, they emailed KUSD stating that both tributes should be allowed, or neither.\n\nThe school board's initial decision left Kaylie's family and friends feeling \"hurt, angry\" and \u201cdisgusted,\u201d WISN reported, and news quickly spread on social media, causing further outrage throughout the community.\n\n\"Everybody should be entitled to heal,\" Theresa Munns, a family friend, told FOX6. \"Their daughter is gone, and she's never coming back.\"\n\nAccording to Munn, Kaylie's family was looking forward to the game.\n\n\"This game is Friday, and it meant so much to so many people,\" a friend of Kaylie, Makayla Falcone, told FOX6. \"She touched so many people's lives, and it was supposed to finally be a thing where we all come together and... remember her, and they took it all away.\"\n\nKaylie's father Nick, who did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment, voiced his displeasure with the district's decision on Facebook.\n\n\"I have been silent for way [too] long,\" he wrote. \"My daughter was the one murdered! And KUSD will not allow her friends and community a moment of silence, or a 5 minute cheer! Nothing she did was wrong!\"\n\nOn Wednesday, an update was provided to Yahoo Lifestyle from the school district's chief communications officer, Tanya Ruder:\n\n\u201cUpon further consideration, Superintendent Dr. Sue Savaglio-Jarvis and Board President Dan Wade have decided to reverse the decision regarding memorials for Kaylie Juga. Upcoming events will be allowed to occur as planned.\u201d\n\nRuder confirmed to Yahoo Lifestyle that tributes to Fuller will not be permitted.\n\nKaylie's friends on Bradford High School's cheerleading team, of which she was a varsity member, plan to wear blue T-shirts \u2014 Kaylie's favorite color \u2014 perform a short routine, bring her photo onto the field, and hold a moment of silence at Friday\u2019s football game.\n\nHer mother, Stephanie, shared on Facebook, \"[Your] voices were heard!! Thank you and we love you all!!\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "School district officials have reversed their decision to ban cheerleaders' from holding a tribute to their murdered classmate after facing backlash from the community.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hPfnyg0Fcmwrs8j0cSV1ZA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/witi_milwaukee_350/34dc00b5cf0dba1cb79264c2422f45e8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
