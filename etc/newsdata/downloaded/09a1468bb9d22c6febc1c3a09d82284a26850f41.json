The contrast is such that I find myself increasingly wishing the young activists were already in charge.\n\n\u2018I would serve the world with justice.\u2019 This phrase has been playing on my mind all week. These are not the words of a world leader, or a politician, or indeed anyone in any position of power. They are also not the words of climate activists.\n\nSabad would serve the world with justice (Picture: Toby Madden)\n\nThese are the words of a teenage girl in Somaliland, who was asked the simple question: \u2018What would you do if you ruled the world?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer name is Sabad. She is part of CARE International\u2019s project to mark International Day of the Girl. Ahead of the day, she and other young women from a girls\u2019 education project in Burao Somaliland, as well as young women from a girls\u2019 school in London, were asked that question. \u2018What would you do if you ruled the world?\u2019\n\nIn her response, Sabad instinctively equated power with responsibility. She was asked a question about how she would rule, and responded with how she would serve. What\u2019s more, she isn\u2019t atypical. Many of the girls in both parts of the world, responded in a similar way. They examined the ways they could work to improve their communities, their country and their world.\n\nNiobe Szabo would make everyone equal (Picture: Toby Madden)\n\nThe answers from both Somaliland and London included calls to world leaders to do better. Niobe from Hornsey school for girls in North London said: \u2018I think political leaders aren\u2019t really sharing their power and they aren\u2019t really asking other people\u2019s opinions, they are just listening to their own ideas and getting people to follow them.\u2019 Esme called on political leaders \u2018to do a better job, and solve problems, as climate change will end the world soon.\u2019\n\nAround the world historically and still to some extent today, when adults talk to girls it is often to tell them what to do, or not do; how to present themselves or how not to present themselves; what to say or not say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a generalisation, we talk at young women and girls, we either infantilise them or sexualise them. If we do avoid these tropes and engage with them seriously it might be to ask them what they want to do when they grow up, what they want to be.\n\nRarely do we ask young girls their views on what they would do about society, what their views are not about themselves, but about the word. I have found when we do ask them, the answers are inspiring.\n\nWhen they were asked not so much to comment on the current situation, but what they as girls would do differently, almost immediately one of the girls at Hornsey School for Girls pointed out that the question itself was problematic.\n\nIf it was only the girls that ruled, this itself would be a problem, equality was what was needed and step one would have changed the starting point \u2013 so that it wasn\u2019t only the girls ruling the world.\n\nThe world is a poorer place for not giving young women a voice \u2013 for not giving them power. Today, on International Day of the Girl a plea to all of you with a young woman or girl in your life, please ask her the same question: \u2018What would you do if you ruled the world?\u2019 It\u2019s time we asked, it\u2019s time we listened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Forget camping on bridges \u2013 these women are the real climate heroes\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018Two of my friends took their own lives \u2013 now I\u2019m walking 1,300 miles to raise awareness\u2019\n\nMORE: Why do so many men think feminism is a cancer?", "description": "11 October is International Day of the Girl.", "authors": ["Helen Pankhurst", "Women'S Rights Activist"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RS62914_CARE_DayoftheGirl_201-ddad_1570795632.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
