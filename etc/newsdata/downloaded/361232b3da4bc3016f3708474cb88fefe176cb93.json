He had the ability to engage with people from all walks of life.\n\n'It is very difficult to come to terms with how someone can unravel like this.'\n\nThe inquest heard that on the day of his death Dr Christie had planned to go swimming with his brother and left his home in Muswell Hill, north London, with his swimwear in his pocket.\n\nHe was later seen pacing on the bridge at around 3.30pm wearing a blue T-shirt and jeans, before climbing onto the railings and jumping to his death.\n\nThe inquest was told he had struggled with work-life balance while caring for patients at two separate practices, and feeling increasingly anxious about financial pressures.\n\nDr Christie worked day and night at the Burnley Medical Practice NHS surgery in Willesden, north west London, and at the private Knightsbridge Doctors in west London which he planned to move to full-time, the hearing was told.\n\nBut after resigning from his position as an NHS practitioner, he became increasingly anxious and expressed concerns about the contract and overhead costs related to taking over the Knightsbridge practice.\n\nHe began working longer hours and lost just over a stone in weight.\n\nIn the days leading up to his death, he was also sent five invoices mistakenly informing him he owed money to cover a gap in his Medical Protection Society (MPS) membership, totalling around \u00a348,000 - despite only owing \u00a33,000.\n\nThe global organisation offers protection for doctors, dentists and healthcare professionals and helps them to understand and navigate the challenges of modern practice.\n\nA fellow young doctor at the the Knightsbridge practice spoke often with Dr Christie who said he had been suffering from headaches, poor sleep and night sweats which appeared to be due to anxiety.\n\nDr Christie was accompanied by his father Dr Peter Christie, a retired paediatrician, to see a psychiatrist days before his death.\n\nBut he denied having suicidal thoughts because of his two young children, when speaking with a psychiatrist two days prior to his death on May 14.\n\nCoroner Mary Hassell concluded that Dr Christie had taken his own life.\n\nSeveral friends, relatives and colleagues left the inquest in tears.\n\nSumming up, the coroner said: 'He was an excellent doctor. He was very in demand. He had quite obviously a tremendously loving family and everyone wanted to help him out.'\n\nShe said she believed Dr Christie 'could not see the wood for the trees' after becoming so 'poorly' with his mental health.\n\nThe coroner added: 'There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that he did take his own life.\n\n'I don't think that the money worries or the work worries or any of the worries explain why.'\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Dr Christie's brother told of the stigma surrounding doctors and mental health.\n\nPhil Christie, 39, said: 'There is a stigma surrounding doctors and mental health.\n\n'As people become more aware of mental health in society, we have got to become more aware of the people who are taking care of us.\n\n'Who are looking after the people who take care of us? They are working in very tense environments and they are not mental health themselves.'\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Dr Christie's widow, Juliette, says more needs to be done to support medical professionals who are reluctant to seek help for their mental health for fear it could go on their record and prohibit them from practicing.\n\nShe said: 'Suicide is far more prevalent in the medical profession generally.\n\n'We need to understand why this might be and getting them support rather than being concerned with their ability to practice.'\n\nDescribing her husband, she added: 'He was deeply concerned about a mental health diagnosis going on his record and affecting his ability to work.'\n\nPhil added: 'Miles touched the lives of so many people as a beloved husband, father, son, brother, friend and as a caring doctor to the thousands of patients he looked after as a General Practitioner.\n\n'Miles lived a wonderful life, seeking out and soaking up all experiences London and the world had to offer.\n\n'We will remember his beaming smile, infectious charm, his brightest of minds, and especially the sight of him unable to speak or breathe through laughter.\n\n'The outpouring of love since Miles's passing has been incredible, illustrating the joy he brought to so many people's lives.\n\n'He leaves a huge hole and will be dearly missed, but always remembered.'\n\nA Memorial Fund in Dr Christie's name has already raised more than \u00a334,000 to support his widow and their two young children.\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Dr Miles Christie, 43,\u00a0felt he had let his family down before he walked onto a bridge in north London, climbed over the railings and leapt to his death.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19548182-0-image-a-119_1570723561091.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
