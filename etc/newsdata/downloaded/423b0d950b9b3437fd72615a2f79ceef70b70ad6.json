Instead, the more European Union-friendly Five Star-Democratic Party government could be in place by the end of the week.\n\nThe two parties, vicious political sparring partners, have joined hands as a way to avoid elections and head off the rise of nationalist Matteo Salvini.\n\nOnline polls on major political decisions are a core part of the Five Star Movement brand. The party has promoted itself with a radical, populist version of digital direct democracy. Its leaders have spoken about the Internet\u2019s utopian possibilities: allowing maximum transparency, with everybody having a say.\n\nBut dissidents and watchdogs say the party is anything but transparent. Its votes are carried out on an in-house Web platform created by Davide Casaleggio, a media-shy figure and Web entrepreneur who is often described as a the real power broker behind the Five Stars. Even Tuesday, the party needed 80 minutes after the vote ended to disclose the results.\n\nCasaleggio\u2019s platform, named Rousseau in honor of the French philosopher, was fined 50,000 euros earlier this year by a government privacy watchdog because of the way it handles personal information. Critics say the Five Star\u2019s platform is open to manipulation and hacking, and it has only about 100,000 registered members \u2014 compared with 10 million people who voted for the party in March 2018 national elections.\n\nTuesday, among nearly 80,000 votes, 79.3 percent were in favor of the coalition, according to a post on the Five Star Movement\u2019s official blog.\n\n\u201cI think we must be very proud that the whole world has been waiting for the decision of these 80,000 Italian citizens who voted on a platform unique in the world called Rousseau,\u201d the Five Star leader, Luigi Di Maio, said at a news conference Tuesday night.\n\nThe question in the online poll read: \u201cDo you agree with the Five Star Movement launching a government along with the Democratic Party headed by Giuseppe Conte?\u201d\n\nCasaleggio\u2019s Milan-based company controls the Rousseau platform, and Casaleggio, a onetime child chess star, has assumed a larger role since the 2016 death of his father, Gianroberto Casaleggio, who co-founded the Five Stars along with comedian Beppe Grillo. After the Five Stars emerged from 2018 national elections as Italy\u2019s most popular party, Davide Casaleggio wrote in The Washington Post that the movement was an \u201cunstoppable wind\u201d that was \u201caligned to the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cDirect democracy, made possible by the Internet, has given a new centrality to citizens and will ultimately lead to the deconstruction of the current political and social organizations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe movement has long depended on the platform, using it for selecting parliamentary candidates and for affirming policies. In May, after a stinging result in European parliamentary elections, Di Maio put his own leadership to a vote; he survived. And last year, the party voters approved an earlier coalition with Salvini\u2019s far-right League, with 94 percent in favor of the deal.\n\nBut that coalition lasted only 14 months. In early August, Salvini yanked his support for the marriage, hoping to trigger elections and become prime minister. Instead, he watched as the Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement ignored years of insults and tried to find some common ground. Five Star leaders, including Grillo, the often-vulgar comedian who was the public frontman during the party\u2019s rise, have often depicted the Democratic Party as the apotheosis of corruption and backroom deals.\n\nStefano Pitrelli contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nHe was Europe\u2019s fastest rising politician.
