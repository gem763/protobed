Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she doesn't think former Vice President Joe Biden can be the progressive leader she believes the party needs heading into the 2020 presidential election, against President Trump.\n\nILHAN OMAR REFUSES TO BACK BIDEN, SAYS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ISN'T RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD DEMS IN 2020\n\nOmar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new interview with The Guardian, after appearing at the Iowa People\u2019s Presidential Forum on Saturday.
