REUTERS/Vincent West\n\nThe Basque side have been forced to play away in their first three matches of the season while the finishing touches were applied to their ground but on Saturday they will finally be back on home turf when they face early La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to grow as a club and compete in Europe when you have a running track and fans are 42 metres away from the action, it\u2019s very difficult for them to express their passion\u201d, president Jokin Aperribay told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe train our players from the youth academy that they must deserve to win and I think this stadium will help us reinforce that message.\u201d\n\nThe new-look stadium will be known as the Reale Arena after the club secured a six-year, 10 million-euro ($11 million) deal with insurance company Reale Seguros.\n\nWhile actual rebuild costs were not disclosed, local media reported that the club had pledged 33 million euros to the project, with the local government and city hall contributing a further 14 million.\n\nSociedad, from the picturesque northern coastal city of San Sebastian, were once among Spain\u2019s elite clubs, winning back-to-back La Liga titles in the early 1980s at their compact former home Atotxa, which housed 27,000 spectators.\n\nThe club moved into the roomier Anoeta in 1993 but the gain in capacity to 32,000 came at a cost, as the running track that hugged the pitch deprived fans of the intimacy their previous home was renowned for.\n\n\u201cI played at Anoeta with Osasuna and Malaga and as an opponent I did not feel the same pressure as at other stadiums,\u201d defender Nacho Monreal, who recently joined Sociedad from Arsenal, told local newspaper Diario Vasco.\n\n\u201cFans have to be close to the players so they can feel close to the match, because football is all about passion. As a player, you can really feel that.\u201d\n\nUNPOPULAR GROUND\n\nDespite a considerable fan base and exciting sides which came within touching distance of winning La Liga in 2003 and secured Champions League football in 2013, the team rarely managed to fill their unpopular ground.\n\nBut with a refurbished stadium plus a squad containing exciting young players such as Sweden forward Alexander Isak and Norway\u2019s Martin Odegaard, there is a new-found enthusiasm about the club.\n\nOver 32,000 season tickets have been sold for this campaign, while a sellout crowd is expected against Atletico which would see the club smash its previous attendance record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stunning stadium, it\u2019s nothing like the old one, it\u2019s wonderful. There\u2019s no excuses now, we have all the ingredients for fans to come to the game on Saturday,\u201d said Monreal.\n\nPresident Aperribay added: \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful stadium and the best thing about it is the history which we are going to write in it.\u201d", "description": "After revamping their stadium by cutting out a much-maligned running track and elevating its capacity to 40,000, Real Sociedad finally have a home to be proud of and they believe it can help their bid to return to being one of Spain's top clubs.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429220332&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B23B"}
