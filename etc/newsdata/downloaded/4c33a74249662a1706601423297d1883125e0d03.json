Output was reduced by the United Auto Workers strike at General Motors GM, +0.25% .\n\nWall Street economists had expected a 0.2% decline, according to a MarketWatch survey. Output in August was revised higher to a 0.8% gain from the prior estimate of a 0.6% increase.\n\nFor the third quarter, industrial output rose at a 1.2% annual rate, following declines of about 2% in both the first and second quarters.\n\nIndustrial capacity in use slumped to 77.5% in September from 77.9% in the prior month. Economists had expected a reading of 77.7%.\n\nFactory activity has slumped since last year.\n\nWhat happened: Manufacturing production fell 0.5% in September with output reduced by the GM strike. Excluding autos, manufacturing fell 0.2%.\n\nThe decline in output was broad-based, with only utility production rising in the month due to unseasonably warm weather.\n\nOutput at mines and energy firms slumped 1.3%. The index for mining fell at a 4.4% annual rate in the third quarter, the first quarterly decrease in three years.\n\nBig picture: The GM strike that started in the middle of September clouds the data somewhat but it is still clear that the U.S.-China trade war is dampening factory activity. Auto workers and the care company have reached a tentative deal to end the month-long strike.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Beige Book reported Wednesday that some manufacturers are beginning to layoff workers while others are trying to manage by cutting worker hours instead. The Fed is watching carefully to see if the weakness spreads to the services sector or consumer spending.\n\nWhat are they saying? \u201cDepressed by the GM strike, but the underlying picture is grim too, and still deteriorating,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nMarket reaction: Stocks opened higher Thursday on reports of a tentative Brexit deal and better-than-expected U.S. corporate earnings reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% was up 75 points to 27.075 in early trading.", "description": "U.S. industrial output slumped 0.4% in September, as the General Motors strike pushed down manufacturing activity, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT465_indust_ZG_20191016180622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
