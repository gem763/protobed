So did Delta. Mercedes-Benz, too.\n\nThe NBA, embroiled in a rift caused by a tweet expressing support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, has avoided going that route \u2014 for now. But with billions at stake from things like merchandise sales and media rights, some experts are wondering if anything other than an apology from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will mend this fence, especially with the Chinese indicating that is what they want.\n\n\u201cI think that Commissioner Silver might have to do what everyone in our country doesn\u2019t want him to have to do,\u201d said Windy Dees, a sports marketing expert at the University of Miami. \u201cHe may have to say, \u2018I understand that your government, your political system, your culture, your ideologies are different than ours and we shouldn\u2019t push our beliefs on you.'\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what Americans and NBA fans don\u2019t want to see their commissioner say,\u201d Dees added.\n\nSilver has chosen his words carefully to this point, defending the right of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \u2014 who sent the tweet, now deleted yet still causing major problems \u2014 to freedom of expression.\n\nSilver also said the league is apologetic over the disharmony caused by Morey\u2019s tweet but stopped well short of apologizing for the tweet itself.\n\nMorey attempted to clarify his position in subsequent tweets, which some, including Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, the Taiwanese-Canadian co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, considered an apology.\n\nBut the only true apology so far came from Rockets star James Harden, the 2017-18 NBA MVP who tried to fix things by insisting, \u201cWe love China.\u201d\n\nClearly, that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cThe hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair,\u201d Tsai said in an open letter to fans in which he tried to shed light on the Chinese perspective when it comes to Hong Kong.\n\nThe question is, how long?\n\nDean Crutchfield, CEO of the crisis management firm Crutchfield + Partners, said Morey\u2019s tweet, well-intentioned as it was, could cost the NBA billions. He wondered if a parting of the ways between Morey and the Rockets would appease China.\n\n\u201cYou need to fire him and you need to fire him fast,\u201d Crutchfield said. \u201cChina needs a statement, and for him to still be in his job is remarkable. I think Silver did a remarkable job with his statement, but this is a senior official, well aware of the importance of the Chinese market. One man, one tweet.\u201d\n\nLeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are scheduled to play Tsai\u2019s Nets on Thursday in Shanghai, then again Saturday in Shenzhen. For now, those games are expected to be played.\n\nBut China state broadcaster CCTV is not going to air the games as previously planned and said it is examining other aspects of its relationship with the NBA.\n\nTencent, the Chinese conglomerate that has a $1.5 billion streaming deal spanning the next five seasons with the league, has said it will not show Rockets games and pulled some planned preseason coverage from NBA arenas. And Chinese companies like apparel giant Li-Ning and Vivo, a smartphone maker that was going to be a sponsor of the Lakers-Nets games, have suspended their business dealings with the NBA.\n\n\u201cIf you have CCTV and Tencent saying, \u2018We\u2019re not airing the NBA,\u2019 that is a huge red flag,\u201d Dees said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a Chinese lockout. If China does not broadcast games, this is a major financial problem for the NBA. And I\u2019m thinking this is going to go on for a while. This is not getting resolved right away. The one thing that you don\u2019t mess with is Chinese government, and unfortunately not everyone in the U.S. understands the global power that China is.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Silver is \u201cupholding the values of the two countries where the NBA is based,\u201d the U.S. and Canada, said Heather Dichter, a professor of sport management and sport history at De Montfort University in Leicester, England.\n\n\u201cIf he had gone the other way, that to me becomes more damaging for the league financially,\u201d she said. \u201cChina puts in money, but they\u2019re not the core of your business. The teams can survive without their money. They can\u2019t survive if they have no ticketholders.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s ties to China go back at least 30 years, from when then-Commissioner David Stern opened a fledgling office in Hong Kong with a bare-bones staff and struck a deal to show games to Chinese viewers on a tape-delay basis.\n\nThe game\u2019s popularity in China has soared since. Many top NBA players visit every summer to promote footwear and apparel, usually greeted by huge crowds of adoring fans. The typically cited numbers are that 300 million Chinese play basketball and 500 million watch the NBA.\n\nNow those carefully cultivated and highly lucrative ties have been thrown into jeopardy.\n\n\u201cAs to what the NBA should say and do next, I believe it knows better than anyone else,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "When major corporations have done something to anger Chinese authorities in recent years, the playbook has called for one thing: an apology.
