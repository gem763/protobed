Democrats condemned what they saw as a clear effort to damage a political rival, now at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump.\n\nIt was the latest revelation in an escalating controversy that has created a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, which has refused to turn over the formal complaint by a national security official or even describe its contents.\n\nTrump is defending himself against the intelligence official\u2019s complaint, asserting that it comes from a \u201cpartisan whistleblower,\u201d though the president also says he doesn\u2019t know who had made it. The complaint was based on a series of events, one of which was a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a two people familiar with the matter. The people were not authorized to discuss the issue by name and were granted anonymity.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Trump referred to \u201ca perfectly fine and routine conversation I had\u201d with Ukraine\u2019s leader. \u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the people, who was briefed on the call, Trump urged Zelenskiy to probe the activities of potential Democratic rival Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Trump did not raise the issue of U.S. aid to Ukraine, indicating there was not an explicit quid pro quo, according to the person.\n\nBiden told reporters in Iowa on Saturday that \u201cTrump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nHe accused Trump of \u201cdoing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum and he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s intelligence inspector general has described the whistleblower\u2019s Aug. 12 complaint as \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent.\u201d Trump insisted \u201cit\u2019s nothing\u201d and \u201cjust another political hack job.\u201d\n\nThere has yet to be any evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son regarding Ukraine.\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this coming week. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump pressed Zelenskiy about Biden.\n\nThe standoff with Congress raises more questions about the extent to which Trump\u2019s appointees are protecting the Republican president from oversight and, specifically, whether his new acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is working with the Justice Department to shield the president.\n\nDemocrats say the administration is legally required to give Congress access to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has said he will go to court in an effort to get it if necessary.\n\nThe intelligence inspector general said the matter involves the \u201cmost significant\u201d responsibilities of intelligence leadership.\n\nIn the whistleblower case, lawmakers are looking into whether Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to aid Trump\u2019s reelection effort by investigating the activities of Biden\u2019s son.\n\nDemocrats have contended that Trump, in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, may have asked for foreign assistance in his upcoming reelection bid.\n\nDuring an CNN interview Thursday, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. He initially said, \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d but seconds later he said, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nMaguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by Schiff\u2019s committee and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Maguire and the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, also are expected next week at the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n___", "description": "President Donald Trump urged the new leader of Ukraine this summer to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a person familiar with the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR804_biden__ZG_20190921163107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
