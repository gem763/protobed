He becomes the latest in a series of athletes Trump has recognized with the award, following ceremonies for NBA hall-of-famers Jerry West and Bob Cousy and professional golfer Tiger Woods earlier this year.\n\nThe ceremonies have become a way for Trump to celebrate athletic achievement despite reluctance by many championship-winning professional sports teams to appear at White House ceremonies amid controversies over the president\u2019s rhetoric and immigration policies.\n\nTrump and Rivera are longtime friends, with the former Yankees closer serving as a co-chair of the President\u2019s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition. Rivera was introduced with Metallica\u2019s \u201cEnter Sandman,\u201d the song that played when he was called in from the bullpen during his career.\n\n\u201cHe has lived the American dream,\u201d Trump said on Monday.\n\nRivera visited the White House in June for a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, attended a 2018 White House Sports and Fitness Day, and was part of the U.S. delegation to the Special Olympics World Games in Abu Dhabi earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI respect him,\u201d Rivera said of Trump during an interview with Fox News earlier this year. \u201cI respect what he does and I believe he\u2019s doing the best for the United States of America.\u201d\n\nTrump has also showered Rivera -- who notched 652 regular season and 42 postseason saves over his career -- with praise. He tweeted earlier this year that the 13-time All Star was \u201cnot only a great player but a great person\u201d after Hall of Fame voters made him the first player ever unanimously elected.\n\nRivera isn\u2019t the first Yankees great to receive the Medal of Freedom from Trump. Slugger Babe Ruth was among the president\u2019s first batch of announced honorees, alongside the legendary singer and actor Elvis Presley, former Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nThe award was established by President John F. Kennedy to honor those who contributed significantly to American culture or the national interest through public or private actions. President Barack Obama awarded a record 123 medals, including to two Supreme Court justices, numerous athletes, and recording artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder.\n\nOther past honorees include Steven Spielberg, Muhammad Ali, Angela Merkel, Nancy Reagan, Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, Rosa Parks, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n(Updates with Trump comment in fifth paragraph.
