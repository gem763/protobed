This is shameful and cannot stand,\" Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.\n\nThe NBA said it recognised Morey's views have \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\n\"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\" it said.\n\nJosh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, made references to allegations of human rights abuses in China, including the repression of Uighur Muslims.\n\n\"Chinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to \"bridge cultural divides\"? Cultural divides?\"\n\nThe Rockets, playing games in Japan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
