And more serious", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE US President Donald Trump is lashing out at House Democrats amid an impeachment investigation and a whistleblower complaint over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. (Sept. 26) AP Domestic\n\nOpinion: As president, Trump asked a foreign leader to work with his personal lawyer in an investigation of a political rival. That's not right.\n\nDonald Trump does not have the moral bearing to be president of the United States.\n\nThe political complication is that there was ample evidence of this before votes were cast in 2016. And the American people elected him president nevertheless.\n\nIs anyone really surprised that Trump would ask the leader of another country to investigate a political rival?\n\nRepublicans had reasons to defend Trump\n\nUp to this point, congressional Republicans have had reason to defend Trump regarding the many-headed investigations that have been launched against him.\n\nThe Russian collusion investigation was a witch hunt that never should have been launched. The investigation of the investigation by Attorney General William Barr will help determine whether the launch was a result of incompetence or maliciousness.\n\nThe myriad of investigations House Democrats have initiated are thinly disguised opposition research endeavors, to better make the case against Trump in 2020. They aren\u2019t to inform legislation, the passage of which is Congress\u2019 actual constitutional duty. And, until recently, they also weren\u2019t part of a genuine impeachment deliberation.\n\nBut Trump and Ukraine is different\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shake hands during a meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. (Photo: SAUL LOEB/AFP, TNS)\n\nThe Ukraine deal, however, is different. Republican efforts to whitewash Trump\u2019s behavior are pathetic. And they ought to be embarrassing, if anyone in today\u2019s politics has a sufficient sense of probity to be capable of the emotion of embarrassment.\n\nTrump was calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his official capacity as president of the United States. In the call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House, Trump asked Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d allegations of misdeeds by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who received lucrative compensation as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nIn that investigation, Trump urged Zelensky to work with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani, however, doesn\u2019t work for the U.S. government, which Trump was supposedly representing in the call. He is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nThe impropriety of a president asking a foreign leader to work, not with official representatives of the U.S. government, but with an outside wheeler-dealer is stunning in any circumstances. Doing so for an investigation of a political rival is morally obtuse.\n\nThis is the investigation we need\n\nThere are several things regarding this that need additional investigation. And Republicans shouldn\u2019t cavil about it.\n\nThe Trump administration withheld, for a period, military aid to Ukraine that Congress had authorized. The question is whether this was done as leverage regarding the investigation of the Bidens. If so, the impropriety multiplies considerably.\n\nBut, at present, that hasn\u2019t been established. Congress, which authorized the dough, should seek to discover, to the extent discoverable, the basis for the temporary suspension.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, the actual transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky was inappropriately stored in a computer dedicated to classified national security material. That raises the question of whether the rough transcription released by the White House, as damaging as it was, had been sanitized.\n\nFinally, a detailed account of Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian activities should be rendered. Trump, acting in his official capacity as president, urged Zelensky to cooperate with him. That expunges any claim that Giuliani\u2019s activities were private or privileged.\n\nDemocrats are still mostly playing politics\n\nAlthough Republicans should support a congressional investigation into these specifics, Democrats are still more playing politics than truly engaging in an exercise of constitutional checks and balance. That makes Republican cooperation highly unlikely.\n\nBefore the transcript or the whistleblower complaint was made public, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the various House investigations already underway were now impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe speaker has no authority to make such a decision or denomination. In the past, House impeachment proceedings have always been authorized by a full vote of the body.\n\nThe Ukrainian deal is different. But by overplaying investigation and impeachment politics all along, Democrats have made that difficult to discern and communicate.\n\nReach Robb at robert.robb@arizonarepublic.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/robertrobb/2019/09/27/trump-ukraine-call-different-russia-and-more-serious/3778622002/", "description": "As president, Trump asked a foreign leader to work with his personal lawyer in an investigation of a political rival.
