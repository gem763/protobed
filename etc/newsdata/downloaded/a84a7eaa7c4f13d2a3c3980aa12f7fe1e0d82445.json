Eliot Engel. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo congress Democrat subpoenas U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan to appear before panel\n\nThe chairman of a top House committee on Thursday subpoenaed the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan to testify before lawmakers next week after the State Department repeatedly failed to make the diplomat available.\n\nThe subpoena follows a collapse in peace negotiations between the Trump administration and the Afghan Taliban, and after President Donald Trump\u2019s move to scrap a secret meeting with the Islamist militia at Camp David.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad needed to appear before Congress so lawmakers and the American people could\u201cunderstand how this process went off the rails.\u201d\n\nEngel said Khalilzad must appear before the panel on Sept. 19. The subpoena is the first Engel\u2019s committee has issued this Congress, according to a statement from his office.\n\nEngel warned earlier this month that he would subpoena Khalilzad if he did not appear voluntarily. According to Engel\u2019s office, \u201cthe State Department refused requests in February, April , and earlier this month for briefings or testimony from Ambassador Khalilzad on the Afghanistan peace plan.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Neither did a spokesman for Khalilzad.\n\nThe veteran diplomat has spent months engaging in painstaking peace talks with the Afghan Taliban in hopes of securing a multi-part peace agreement that will also include the Afghan government.\n\nAs things got closer to an initial agreement, Trump pushed for a secret meeting with the Taliban and Afghanistan\u2019s president at Camp David, the presidential retreat where past high-profile peace talks involving other parties have taken place.\n\nTrump shocked Washington when he announced via Twitter over the weekend that he had decided to call off the talks, which had still been under wraps, because of a recent Taliban attack in Afghanistan that killed a U.S. soldier.\n\nHe said afterward that, as far as he was concerned, the negotiations were \u201cdead.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision this week to fire his national security adviser, John Bolton, who had opposed the talks with the Afghan militia, is fueling speculation that the president might eventually agree to resume the negotiations.", "description": "The subpoena follows a collapse in peace negotiations between the Trump administration and the Afghan Taliban.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4a/14/1de0b7d840fba60d2ff05cf7671d/19912-eliot-engel-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
