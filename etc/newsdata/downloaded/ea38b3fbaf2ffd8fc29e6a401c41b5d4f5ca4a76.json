REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nIn a filing in New York state court in Manhattan, Uber also sought to void a rule banning the issuance of new licenses to for-hire vehicles through August 2020.\n\nSeth Stein, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, defended the rulemaking by the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission, saying it would protect New Yorkers \u201cagainst a company that seeks to put profit first.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the cap on the issuance of new (for-hire) vehicle licenses for at least the next year in tandem with the cap on cruising is not only legal, it will bring needed relief to congested streets and hardworking drivers,\u201d Stein said.\n\nUber, which is based in San Francisco, has drawn criticism from many cities that its vehicles increase congestion and take away business from taxi and other services.\n\nIn New York City, the value of \u201cmedallions,\u201d or licenses, needed to operate taxis has plunged in recent years as ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft gained popularity.\n\nUber is challenging the city\u2019s \u201ccruising cap\u201d rule that sets a 31% limit on how much time drivers of app-based vehicles may drive without passengers in Manhattan south of 96th Street -meaning they would have to have fares at least 69% of driving time.\n\nNew York\u2019s cruising rate was 41% in 2018. Under the new rule, the maximum would fall to 36% in February 2020 and 31% six months later.\n\n\u201cThe rule would threaten the viability of the ride-sharing model as it currently exists, jeopardizing the benefits this model has created for riders and drivers,\u201d Uber said. It said that while it has \u201cpublicly and vocally supported\u201d reducing congestion in Manhattan, the cruising cap was based on \u201cflawed and arbitrary\u201d economics.\n\nSupporters say cruising and licensing caps could help ease traffic tie-ups and free up streets for cyclists, pedestrians and public transit.\n\nUber shares closed down $1.22, or 3.6%, at $32.60.\n\nThe case is ZEHN-NY LLC et al v New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County.", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc sued New York City on Friday, seeking to void a new rule limiting how much time its drivers can spend cruising streets in busy areas of Manhattan without passengers, saying it threatens to undermine the company's ride-sharing model.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432097273&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J20X", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
