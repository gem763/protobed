You can apply for the role here .\n\nThe bad news for us Brits is that you have to be a US citizen to take part. No fair.\n\nThe site also says you must be over 18 and as swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon to take part.\n\nOne Twitter user summed up what we're all thinking, writing: \"So I'm thinking this job from Reviews.org to watch 30 Disney+ movies/shows in 30 days is something I already plan on doing. Therefore, I should apply.\"\n\nYou know what they say, do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.", "description": "A reviews website wants to pay five of the biggest Disney fans to watch a film or TV show every day for 30 days", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Disney", "Handout"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646147.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FROZEN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
