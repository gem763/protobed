As it turns out, this is another soundbite solution that doesn\u2019t actually solve anything at all. The ordinance requires all gun owners to keep firearms locked at all times that they\u2019re not \u201cin use\u201d or being carried in your home, which not only dances awfully close to the storage law struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Heller decision, but is utterly unenforceable from a proactive standpoint.\n\nThe measure was suggested by San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott in conjunction with the anti-gun group San Diegans for Gun Violence Prevention, and according to Elliott, it\u2019s just \u201ccommon sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cSafe storage is proven to prevent tragedies and save lives by keeping guns out of the hands of minors, unauthorized users, and individuals going through personal crises that could result in them harming themselves or others,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe all are safer when this law is followed.\u201d\n\nUnless of course you need your firearm in self-defense and can\u2019t get to your gun in time to use it. A one-size-fits-all ordinance like this means that if you want to protect yourself in your home, you need to be carrying at all times. Ostensibly this bill would even require you to have your gun on your hip or ankle while you slept, or else keep it locked up in a safe or with a trigger lock.\n\nAnd just how exactly does Elliott propose to enforce the new ordinance?\n\nAccording to Elliott, the San Diego Police Department will enforce the law by finding improperly stored guns in a home during a visit for another reason such as a domestic disturbance.\n\nWhat about police visiting a home because it was broken into? Does Elliott expect police to arrest a homeowner who was the victim of a burglary and happened to have their firearm stored in an unlocked container, for example? Does she expect police to root around through people\u2019s homes to check to see if their firearms are secure when they\u2019re called out for an un-related reason?\n\nI suspect we\u2019ll soon see a court challenge to this new ordinance, at least based on the objections of pro-2A groups in the state.\n\nNot everyone agreed with the new ordinance at the city council meeting Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a home invasion every two minutes in the U.S.,\u201d said Barry Bordack, a local volunteer with the California Rifle and Pistol Association. \u201cBad guys often run away when faced with armed resistance.\u201d Bordack said recently in Carlsbad a man was stabbed during a home invasion until his son shot the intruder. \u201cYou do not have the constitutional right or training to tell a gun owner how to secure the guns in their own home,\u201d said Bordack.\n\nI also suspect you won\u2019t find too many people actually charged with violating this ordinance, not because of massive compliance but because it\u2019s almost impossible to enforce. That\u2019s not to say that you shouldn\u2019t store your gun safety. I believe you absolutely should. I also believe that you\u2019re going to know the best way for you to do that far better than the city council or the city attorney. Someone who has young kids in the home and a retiree who lives alone, for example, are going to have very different concerns and may not choose to store their firearms in exactly the same manner. There should be nothing wrong with that, but in San Diego it\u2019s now a crime.", "description": "San Diego's new \"safe storage\" law is now in effect, but the new ordinance is impossible to broadly enforce, as the city's attorney admits.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52e3d0404f52a814ea89867ac42c3063143ad8ed5059774e7c2f_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
