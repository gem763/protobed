First, he made a widely accepted observation. The current Prime Minister\u2019s Office is the most dominant India has had in decades. This has led to centralisation in decision making. Second, given this context, the leadership has to have a clear economic vision that needs to be articulated as the entire system keeps looking for signals from the PMO. According to Rajan, a coherent vision is not visible. Instead, economic policy consists of a series of programmes which can sometimes be contradictory.\n\nThe critique\u2019s relevance shows up in finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s decisions. In July, a budget was presented ignoring an 18-month long economic slowdown. As sentiments worsened, budget decisions were rolled back or nullified. Also, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate was announced after the budget. However, even as the corporate tax rate was lowered the government introduced more rigidity in the labour market by prescribing a national minimum wage. Therefore, even as corporate tax changes are ushered in to make India more competitive, labour market rules work in the opposite direction.\n\nInstead of engaging the critique, the finance minister went after the messenger with an internally inconsistent argument. She first said that Rajan\u2019s tenure at RBI saw political influence in bank lending. But this was followed by her being \u201cgrateful\u201d to the former governor for beginning the clean-up of the system through an asset quality review.\n\nThe larger problem highlighted by Rajan remains. His critique is pertinent and must be taken on board by the government, not just brushed off.\n\nIndian public sector banks had \u2018worst phase\u2019 under Manmohan, Rajan: Sitharaman", "description": "Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor, recently critiqued the economic approach of the Narendra Modi government.
