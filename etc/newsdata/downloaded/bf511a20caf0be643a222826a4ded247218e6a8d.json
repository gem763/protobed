The drop in yield across the Treasury curve was propelled by global recession fears, concerns about low inflation, and the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nThe [fixed-income] market shifted focus to the Sept. 18 Federal Open Market Committee meeting to see if the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates at a second consecutive meeting and whether the cut would be another 25 basis points [one quarter of a percentage point] or possibly a more aggressive 50 bps.\n\nThe [central bank\u2019s] characterization of inflation was unchanged, and growth continued to be described as \u201cmoderate.\u201d The Fed also continued to emphasize that it will \u201cact appropriately\u201d to sustain the economic expansion, leaving future cuts on the table.\n\nAs the quarter closes, we are maintaining a defensive approach in the face of market uncertainty. As long as the trade war continues to weigh on the global economy, we expect to see volatility, while an agreement would probably send rates higher. In the meantime, we plan to be conservative while looking for opportunities moving forward.\n\n--Daniel Himelberger\n\nThe Utilities Paradox\n\nMorning Briefing\n\nby Yardeni Research\n\nSept. 26: After days like Tuesday, it\u2019s easy to understand why \u201csafety sectors\u201d\u2014perceived as less risky than average\u2014have been in vogue. President Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the United Nations dashed investors\u2019 hopes for a quick trade agreement. He bluntly described how the Chinese steal U.S. technology and benefit from unfair trade practices, and later painted U.S. tech companies as enemies of democracy. The day ended with Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing that the House of Representatives is beginning a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Another banner day in U.S. politics.\n\nSafety sectors ruled the day on Tuesday, continuing the outperformance that has accelerated since late summer.\n\nIronically, the S&P 500 utilities stock price index is at a record high, even though its market-capitalization share of the S&P 500 index is at an all-time low. The industry\u2019s stock performance has been helped by price/earnings multiple expansion. The S&P 500 utilities trade at a forward multiple of 19.8, 3.4 points higher than a year ago . But that\u2019s far below the 55.6 \u201cP/E\u201d of the 10-year Treasury note .\n\nUtilities also offer a nice dividend yield, relative to other S&P 500 sectors\u2019. A sluggish global economy combined with low inflation could make dividend payers attractive for some time. Here\u2019s are the dividend yields offered by the various S&P 500 sectors: energy (3.47%), real estate (3.16), utilities (3.11), consumer staples (2.87), communication services (2.32), financials (2.11), materials (1.98), industrials (1.94), S&P 500 (1.92), health care (1.71), information technology (1.38), and consumer discretionary (1.30).\n\nInvestors\u2019 love affair with utilities has some foundation in fundamentals. Analysts expect the sector to grow earnings moderately, by 4.2%, in 2019. That makes utilities the fourth-fastest-growing among the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors.\n\nHowever, investors buying utilities today may be fighting yesterday\u2019s war. Looking forward to 2020, traditional growth sectors are forecast to have much faster earnings growth than utilities and other safety sectors.\n\nPerhaps that explains why both high-growth and defensive names are having a banner year. Investors willing to look ahead can justify buying S&P 500 tech, communications, and consumer-discretionary sectors because of their faster earnings growth, while defensive investors or those looking for income can turn to utilities, real estate, and staples.\n\n--Ed Yardeni\n\nTune Out the Background Din\n\nCommentary\n\nby Advisors Capital Management\n\nSept. 24: Investors may be pleased to realize that the S&P 500 has risen 19% year to date, even as they lament that the market has slowed down considerably this quarter, having risen just 0.9% thus far. Moreover, the ride has been a bumpy one, and reflects the many news headlines about the economy, monetary policy, and other disruptions, such as the attack on Saudi oil.\n\nWe know that long-term investing requires staying well exposed to the forces driving long-term stock appreciation, while finding defensive positions to cushion the downside. It is our view that the underlying fundamentals supporting the market are solid, so the market should continue its irregular ascent, and investors should take advantage of random setbacks to add to positions.\n\n--JoAnne Feeney\n\nBeware a Weaker Greenback\n\nMomentum Strategies Report\n\nby Clif Droke\n\nSept. 26: Will the U.S. intervene to weaken the dollar? For the first time in years, monetary policy is being coordinated on an international level with the aim of easing monetary conditions and stimulating the global economy. But in spite of the best efforts of bankers, one of the biggest problems facing the world economy is something they\u2019re not prepared for, namely potential turmoil in the currency market.\n\nEarlier this summer, it was reported that the Trump administration was discussing the possibility of intervening in the currency market to weaken the dollar. The last time the U.S. intervened was in 2011, which involved an attempt at weakening the Japanese yen, following a destructive tsunami in March that year. This intervention involved the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada selling yen in exchange for their own currencies, and also involved participation from the Bank of Japan . The intervention proved to be successful in weakening the yen on a short-term basis.\n\nTrump is reportedly concerned that the dollar\u2019s continued strength could undermine the U.S. economy and thereby weaken his chances at re-election next year. Trump also apparently blames the Fed\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d interest rates (relative to low U.S. Treasury yields) for the greenback\u2019s strength. He also blamed the European Central Bank, or ECB, for the dollar\u2019s strength, recently tweeting: \u201cThey [the ECB] are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.\u2026And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d\n\nWhile global investors are still averse to riskier assets like stocks, the U.S. dollar is still very attractive to many as a haven. The dollar has also recently benefited from the sharp decline in the British pound on Brexit-related concerns.\n\nWhile a stronger dollar can be beneficial for U.S. consumers, its continued strength will eventually weaken the economies of countries that are reliant on exports. Emerging nations that depend heavily on agricultural and commodity-based exports are especially vulnerable to dollar strength.\n\n--Clif Droke\n\nTo be considered for this section, material, with the author's name and address, should be sent to MarketWatch@barrons.com.", "description": "Investment newsletters\u2019 opinions on the current markets, the lure of utility stocks, the need to tune out short-term noise, and the possibility of a weaker greenback", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111489/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
