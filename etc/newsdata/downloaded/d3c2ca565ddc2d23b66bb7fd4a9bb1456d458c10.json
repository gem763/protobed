and hurt consumers.\"\n\nThe probe is being backed by 48 states - with only California and Alabama absent - and joined by Puerto Rico and the federal District of Columbia, and officials stopped short of calling for any specific remedies such as a breakup - which some Google critics have called for.\n\n\"It is an investigation to determine the facts,\" Mr Paxton said. \"Right now it is on advertising but the facts will lead where the facts will lead.\n\nThe latest probes come on top of a review launched earlier this year by federal regulators of major online platforms to determine if they have \"stifled\" innovation or reduced competition.\n\nCONSUMER CHOICE?\n\nKent Walker, Google's senior vice-president of global affairs, said in a blog post on Friday that the company would cooperate with regulators while stressing that its services \"help people, create more choice, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the United States.\"\n\nAccording to research firm eMarketer, Google leads the US digital ad market with a 37.2 per cent share worth some US$48 billion this year and is expected to control 20 per cent of all US ad spending, online and offline combined.\n\nGoogle is by far the largest online search engine and captures nearly 75 per cent of search-related online ads in the US, according to eMarketer.\n\nSTATES TAKE UP SLACK\n\nChristopher Sagers, a Cleveland State University professor of antitrust law, said it was potentially \"very significant\" to see the state coalitions working on antitrust.\n\n\"After the past few years, the Trump administration's antitrust program has come to seem pretty inactive, influenced by a lot of politics that have made it hard to interpret,\" Prof Sagers said.\n\nOn Friday, New York state Attorney General Letitia James announced an action on behalf of seven other states and the District of Columbia to probe \"whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk.\"\n\nFacebook offered no immediate comment, but in the past it has claimed it is not a monopoly and that consumers have many choices for how to connect with people online.\n\n'FISHING EXPEDITION'?\n\nThe antitrust actions come against a backdrop of declining public trust in big online firms, and fines levied against Facebook and Google over privacy violations.\n\nYet the legal basis for an antitrust action remains unclear, said Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University.\n\n\"It remains to be seen if the (attorneys general) have any merit to their complaints or if they will be conducting a fishing expedition hoping to find some damning evidence,\" Mr Goldman said.\n\n\"Companies as large as Google or Facebook probably have minor problematic practices the AGs could target, but I'm still waiting for any evidence that would support more structural challenges to the internet giants' practices.\"\n\nCharlotte Slaiman of the consumer group Public Knowledge welcomed the new investigations as \"an important and powerful step\" which \"can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology -
