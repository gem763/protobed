I paid attention when I carried my gun around.", "language": "en", "text": "Carrying that gun was a tremendous blessing for me, because it allowed me to go about my life (almost) just like I had before, with the confidence that I had deadly force at hand if I needed it. And much like at least some of the open (and concealed) carry enthusiasts complaining about Walmart this week, I did my best to be a careful, responsible, well-prepared gun owner, ready to protect others as well as myself.\n\nBut over time, I learned something that I wish more gun owners knew: Carrying a gun isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. I learned that most people I encountered actually didn\u2019t feel better knowing that I had a gun. And, though I tried to keep it concealed in a hip holster under a shirt or jacket, the people who inevitably did glimpse it frequently wondered why I had it and whether my gun or my presence put them in danger \u2014 like the staff and customers who panicked at that Walmart in Missouri. Even the people who knew and trusted me \u2014 knowing that I was a responsible gun owner who had been threatened \u2014 wondered if being near me in public exposed them to the same danger in which I\u2019d found myself.\n\nI also learned that carrying a gun \u2014 even with a license, training and a real need for it \u2014 doesn\u2019t make me as worthy of that responsibility as real cops and soldiers are, and it didn\u2019t make me an action movie hero. Yes, I had a real, articulable need to carry a firearm and I carried one of the best made and engineered handguns available on my hip \u2014 which would have been super cool to 16-year-old me, but I didn\u2019t have the training or responsibility of a real cop and I wasn\u2019t any Jason Bourne.", "description": "", "authors": ["Greg Hunter", "Nbcnews.Com Think Opinion"], "top_image": ""}
