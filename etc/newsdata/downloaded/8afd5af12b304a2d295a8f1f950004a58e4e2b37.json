While 22 days may seem like plenty of time when so many in the House of Representatives on both sides of the aisle have been optimistic about the agreement, one White House insider is not so sure.\n\nAssistant to the President and Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro, said on Tuesday\u2019s edition of \u2018Bulls and Bears\u201d on Fox Business, that there are \u201conly a few more days left in October in the legislative calendar (and) in November.\u201d\n\nNavarro noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the remainder of the House of Representatives are then \u201cback for a few days before Thanksgiving. And this is gonna be a real turkey if Nancy blows this. And I worry about that .\u201d\n\nBut late Tuesday night following Navarro's appearance, Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), the head of the USMCA working group reassured FOX News' Chad Pergram that talks are progressing. \"We hit a couple of bumps.

There are only 14 legislative days between now and Thanksgiving, the date by which several groups from U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) have been pushing as an informal deadline to reach a USMCA agreement. Just last Thursday AEM President Daniel Slater wrote a letter to Rep. Neal, stressing the need for speed. \u201cWhile AEM understands that members of the working group are attempting to tackle outstanding concerns with the agreement, we urge you to move forward quickly,\u201d Slater wrote, \u201cWorking families, farmers and ranchers, businesses including equipment manufacturers, and all Americans are waiting for Congress to approve the agreement so our entire economy can benefit from the USMCA.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Only 22 days in the legislative calendar remain to land a USMCA agreement in 2019", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
