Manchester United, mired in their worst start to a season since 1989-90, were goal-shy; their confidence seemingly in pieces. Liverpool were supposed to roll up to Old Trafford and extend their run of consecutive wins in the Premier League to a record-equalling 18th game.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the eternally optimistic United manager, had claimed that \u201cthis is the perfect game for us\u201d but, to put it bluntly, nobody believed him. Perhaps they should have done.\n\n\u2018This is an issue we have to discuss\u2019: Klopp hits out at VAR after United draw Read more\n\nIt was a wild turnaround from a United point of view, defying the form book, and it said everything that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team, having taken a first-half lead through Marcus Rashford, could finish disappointed at having failed to inflict upon Liverpool a first league defeat since January.\n\nUnited had begun with the bit between their teeth in a new 3-4-1-2 system and they fought as if affronted by all of the recent criticism. It was not a pretty game, United dragged Liverpool down from their lofty recent standards and with five minutes to go, the league leaders looked out of ideas. The story looked set to be coloured by United\u2019s bodies-on-the-line defiance.\n\nBut Liverpool have not remained unbeaten for so long without knowing how to battle until the last and they were rewarded for their persistence, as much as anything else, when Andrew Robertson crossed low from the left. Roberto Firmino\u2019s presence in the middle seemed to distract the United defence and, rather abruptly, there was the substitute, Adam Lallana, all alone in front of goal, to sweep past David de Gea. What a moment it was for Lallana, whose Liverpool career has been blighted by injury. It was his first goal since he scored in a 3-0 Anfield win over Middlesbrough in May 2017 and it was the prompt for United\u2019s nerves to jangle.\n\nPlay Video 1:26 J\u00fcrgen Klopp '100% sure' VAR would overrule Marcus Rashford goal \u2013 video\n\nLiverpool had been poor in the first half and better in the second, but without creating too much of clear-cut note. Now they turned the screw. Another substitute, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fizzed a shot inches past a post and the five minutes of stoppage-time counted down slowly for United. Yet they did enough. For Solskj\u00e6r and his players, the performance as much as the result offered hope.\n\nUnited had started the day in 14th place \u2013 one point above the relegation zone \u2013 and it seemed as if every number, every statistic, was insulting them. Several bookmakers had them as long as 7-2 to beat opponents who Pep Guardiola had described as looking \u201cunstoppable\u201d.\n\nLiverpool had last dropped league points in the 0-0 draw at Everton on 3 March. Desperate times called for radical measures and for the first time this season, Solskj\u00e6r started with a three-man defence, although even that plan needed a late fine-tune after Axel Tuanzebe was ruled out with an injury in the warm-up. In came Marcos Rojo on the left of the back three.\n\nKlopp made no attempt to hide his annoyance at what he felt were United\u2019s safety-first tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact when we come here \u2013 they just defend,\u201d he said afterwards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcus Rashford celebrates after putting Manchester United ahead.

Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s idea was to hit his pacy forwards, Rashford and Daniel James, with balls into the channels but also for them to defend from the front; to set the tone for the team. They did so. This was arguably Rashford\u2019s best performance under Solskj\u00e6r while James\u2019s energy and remorselessness was a positive. United\u2019s collective commitment galvanised the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nIt was a match where the nuances of VAR once again came under scrutiny and Klopp was bitterly unhappy that it did not rule out Rashford\u2019s goal. The flashpoint followed Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s tackle from behind on Divock Origi which set a fast United counterattack in motion and, certainly, it looked like a foul \u2013 even if Solskj\u00e6r disagreed. United still had some way to go but when Scott McTominay released James, there was pace and possibility. The Welshman crossed low and, after deceiving Jo\u00ebl Matip with a clever piece of movement inside the area, Rashford prodded past Alisson.\n\nGlazers have no plans to sell Manchester United, says Ed Woodward Read more\n\nKlopp\u2019s argument was that the referee Martin Atkinson had allowed the play to continue because he knew that VAR would help him after the event. But the problem was, in the Liverpool manager\u2019s view, that the decision was not then clear and obviously wrong enough to merit an overrule.\n\nKlopp\u2019s mood would darken before the interval when his team had an equaliser chalked off by VAR. On viewing the replay, it was plain that Sadio Man\u00e9 had used a hand to control a high ball before wriggling away from Lindel\u00f6f to beat De Gea. The problem with the technology is that it does not warn the supporters of the scoring team quickly enough. The Liverpool fans had erupted in delight then came back down to earth with a bump.\n\nLiverpool, who expect the absent Mohamed Salah to have recovered from his ankle problem for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Genk, had created the best chance of the first half when Man\u00e9 cut back for Firmino and he shot too close to De Gea, but Klopp was forced into changes in the second half.\n\nHe effectively switched to a 4-2-4 in which Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lallana made a difference in wide areas, and the battle lines were drawn. United came to appear the likelier scorers of the next goal on the counter as Liverpool could not make inroads. Rashford fizzed a shot wide and James flickered.
