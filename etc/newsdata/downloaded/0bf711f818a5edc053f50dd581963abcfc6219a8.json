How do I decide how much pain medication to give someone?\" asked Caroline Freiermuth of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.\n\nFreiermuth wants to treat their pain. She doesn't want them to suffer or purchase illicit opioids or heroin on the street. But she doesn't want to contribute to an opioid addiction.\n\nShe's largely left on her own to make that decision. There are few tools or guidelines she can use to guide her path.\n\nWhat if there was a genetic test that could determine whether certain people were more likely to develop opioid use disorder?\n\nThat's the goal of a year-plus study that the University of Cincinnati and Ohio State University will launch in January 2020 \u2013 the most comprehensive look into how our genetic makeup might affect addiction.\n\nPrescriptions: Doctor gets 40 years in opioid prescription case. He gave drugs to every patient, feds say\n\nSackler family donations: Prestigious universities around the world accepted more than $60M from OxyContin family\n\nThe $1.6 million study will recruit up to 1,500 emergency department patients \u2013 some diagnosed with opioid use disorder and others with little experience with opioids \u2013 swab their cheeks and send the genetic information to Michigan-based Genemarkers for testing.\n\nPatients' DNA won't be linked to their names and won't be used by police \u2013 a potential concern if patients are treated for overdoses.\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost's office oversees the project, hoping to use science to inform opioid addiction prevention. That could ease the burden on police and addiction counselors who have become the front lines of Ohio's opioid crisis.\n\nFatal overdoses declined in 2018 for the first year since the opioid epidemic started, according to early data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 68,000 people in the USA died of drug overdoses that year.\n\nYost said he wants to know why he was able to take painkillers after a back surgery without becoming addicted to the drugs, but his friend, a U.S. Marine, had his life upended by opioids.\n\nOpioid production: DEA allowed companies to increase production of opioids as overdose deaths spiked, agency watchdog says\n\nOhio's opioid epidemic: 10 dead in 26 hours: Ohio coroner again raises alarm about drug overdose surge\n\n\"This is not a guy that lacks willpower,\" Yost said. \"Why am I standing here today drug-free and he is struggling to maintain, years later, his sobriety?\"\n\nDr. Jon Sprague, who leads the Attorney General's Future of Forensic Sciences at Bowling Green State University, said Ohio's study will be the most comprehensive. A similar effort in Michigan included about 200 patients.\n\nIf researchers could predict who might be predisposed to opioid addiction, that could be an invaluable tool for doctors, Freiermuth said.\n\nSomeone facing a back surgery with a genetic predisposition toward opioid use disorder might get more counseling or more regular follow-up visits. Someone in the emergency room might receive a different dose.\n\n\"I hope the day comes when you don't have to make that decision anymore without guidance,\" Yost said.\n\nFollow Jessie Balmert on Twitter: @jbalmert\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Opioid epidemic: Study to look at how genetics might affect addiction", "description": "The University of Cincinnati and Ohio State University study will recruit up to 1,500 emergency department patients and swab their cheeks.", "authors": ["Jessie Balmert", "Cincinnati Enquirer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IT8BI5_lIvi6r6.OEaOoMA--~B/aD00MDMyO3c9MzAyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ae6c31492eff0d4932be0adf1bcf173c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
