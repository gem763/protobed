She was just going so crazy. She\u2019s sending me the meanest text messages, you would die,\u201d Kourtney spills to a friend over the phone in the clip. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re the biggest ungrateful bitch.\u2019 So, then I said, \u2018God! You\u2019re such a petty woman.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt least we have Khloe, forever the mediator between the sisters, who jokes, \u201cOh, we\u2019re still fighting? Oh, good!\u201d as she enters the car.\n\nThen the clip cuts to Kim who, like any good sibling, is trying to convince their mom, Kris Jenner, to side with her.\n\n\u201cBasically, I got into the biggest fight with Kourtney today because she just is such a bitch. Like, on another level,\u201d Kim explains. \u201cSo, I called Kourtney and Kourtney like screamed at me on the phone.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to claim that Kourtney said she had the \u201clamest style,\u201d which is basically cause for World War III in any KarJenner\u2019s eyes.\n\nKourtney continues to dig at her younger sister, knocking her for not having the right priorities, given how upset Kim is over a styling dig when she\u2019s focused on becoming a lawyer and prison reform advocate.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re going to school to become a lawyer and help the world and these are the kinds of problems you have?\u2019\u201d Kourtney says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re really a miserable human being and you keep not understanding the issue because you, all of a sudden, turn into such a humanitarian and talk about the world\u2019s issues \u2014 which you\u2019ve not contributed one ounce to the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nJared Siskin/amfAR via Getty Images Kourtney Kardashian and Kim Kardashian attend the amfAR New York Gala.\n\nThat\u2019s when Kim brands Kourtney a \u201cf**kin\u2019 fake humanitarian ho\u201d in what ranks as perhaps the most unintentionally hilarious insult in \u201cKUWTK\u201d history.\n\n\u201cI actually do s**t for the world and you f**king fake it all day long,\u201d she rages against her sister. \u201cAnd act like, \u2018Oh! There\u2019s people dying, Kim.\u2019 And what the f**k are you doing about it? So, shut the f**k up.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, we leave you with this classic Kardashian moment of Kourtney reminding Kim about her first world problems.", "description": "Ah, is anything more soothing than a classic Kim and Kourtney clash?", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bb1cc3b0000039fd26ff8.png?cache=xrseelhcci&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
