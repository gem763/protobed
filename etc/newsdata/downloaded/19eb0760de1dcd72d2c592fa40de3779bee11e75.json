It could also offer services together with the company.In the field of digital content, SK Telecom\u2019s media platform could boost the competitiveness of Kakao\u2019s content production ability, according to the telecommunications operator.Last month, SK Telecom introduced the Wavve over-the-top media service, which merged the mobile carrier\u2019s Oksusu mobile video streaming app and Pooq, a joint video-on-demand platform formed by Korea\u2019s three terrestrial broadcasters.The two firms haven\u2019t developed specific plans on how to work together. To maximize synergy, Kakao said co-CEO Yeo Min-soo and SK Telecom\u2019s Ryu Young-sang, head of the mobile network operations division, will hold regular meetings to discuss possible collaboration.Their partnership is meaningful in that it eliminates unnecessary competition and sets the ground for the two companies to share technologies in various fields, including fintech and mobility, according to a KB Securities report.\u201cWe vow to use this opportunity to raise the overall consumer experience in the domestic ICT industry and to pull up the level of local ICT technology and services,\u201d said Ryu.\u201cThrough the partnership, two representative ICT firms in Korea will acquire the competitiveness to compete on a global scale. We will closely collaborate to revolutionize the Korean ICT ecosystem,\u201d said Yeo.The two companies have been competing across the board, in mobility, navigation, music, voice assistants, international calling and, most recently, messaging.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
