She coped by writing notes to her absent husband and taping them to the bedroom wall.\n\n\u201cI send you a little kiss,\u201d she\u2019d scrawled to the man who had disappeared last year while delivering electricity bills. And: \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNot far from her, a third family endured another Monday without their loved one. The middle-aged man had gone missing on his way home from his plumbing job. Was it already Day 192? They\u2019d searched everywhere. Nothing.\n\nAD\n\nThree decades after a brutal civil war characterized by never-explained, never-resolved disappearances, Salvadorans are again vanishing.\n\nThe phenomenon is resurrecting one of the most chilling elements of Cold War Latin America. Back in the 1970s and \u201980s, tens of thousands of people disappeared as right-wing governments \u2014 many supported by the United States \u2014 fought to extinguish leftist insurgencies.\n\nThese days, countries such as Mexico, Brazil and El Salvador are battered by criminal wars. The governments aren\u2019t fighting Marxist guerrillas, but gangs and drug cartels instead.\n\nAD\n\nIn Mexico, more than 3,000 clandestine gravesites have been unearthed as families search for the 40,000 missing. In El Salvador, few of the burial sites have been found.\n\nWhich is why, when the government discovered one outside the capital last month, TV reporters rushed to the scene \u2014 and dozens of families began to wonder if their mystery would finally end.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s here,\u201d said the mother of a 14-year-old.\n\n\u201cI am always hoping,\u201d Karen said.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t told me anything,\u201d Flores said.\n\nBut for one family, things were about to change.\n\nDisappearances bring back a Cold War nightmare\n\nNo one knows exactly how many people in El Salvador have gone missing. National police say at least 2,457 people were reported disappeared in 2018, the most in a dozen years. The attorney general\u2019s office puts the figure at 3,437 \u2014 more than the total of homicides. Both numbers are widely seen as undercounts.\n\nAD\n\nFor Flores, her son\u2019s disappearance was a new version of an old nightmare. Her two uncles were among the at least 8,000 people who vanished during El Salvador\u2019s 12-year civil war.\n\nThat was another era \u2014 of death squads, the Reagan Doctrine against communism, guerrillas wielding red banners and AK-47s. El Salvador today is a democracy, with free elections and onetime Marxists in congress.\n\nAD\n\nSo why are disappearances back?\n\nOne reason is they make it easier for killers to avoid investigation. That goes both for gang members killing their rivals and for cops secretly executing suspects.\n\n\u201cIf there is no body, there\u2019s no evidence,\u201d said Marvin Reyes, who spent 20 years in the national police.\n\nAD\n\nBut the disappearances also reflect a political strategy. That became evident when El Salvador\u2019s top two gangs reached a government-backed truce in 2012. The homicide rate \u2014 among the highest in the hemisphere \u2014 plunged. But disappearances rose.\n\n\u201cIf violence needed to be carried out [by gangs], it needed to be invisible, to avoid attention from state authorities,\u201d said Ang\u00e9lica Dur\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, who studies Latin American violence at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.\n\nAnalysts suspect the gangs and the government hide corpses to keep the homicide rate down.\n\nAD\n\nFor victims\u2019 families, the uncertainty is cruel: There\u2019s no resolution, no body to bury, no hope of closure. \u201cWe have so much stress,\u201d said Karen, a 39-year-old mother of three.\n\nAD\n\nShe and her kids try to keep their minds on work and school, but their bodies betray them: Karen\u2019s insomnia, her son\u2019s overeating, her daughter\u2019s wildly oscillating periods.\n\nShe believes her husband was abducted because he refused to hide a gang\u2019s weapons in the family\u2019s home. She is so frightened of retaliation that she spoke on the condition that her last name not be used.\n\nDaisy Flores, 47, also suspects her son was hauled away by gang members.\n\nEdwin was perhaps the most affectionate of her seven kids. The kind of boy who would sneak up behind her at the stove and grab her in a bear hug. Who wasn\u2019t embarrassed to accompany his mama to the market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe doesn\u2019t think he was a gang member. But: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what kind of friends he had.\u201d Everyone knew that MS-13 dominated their hamlet, a woodsy patch of small, concrete homes surrounded by fields where campesinos grew corn and raised cows and chickens. Nearby villages were ruled by the rival gang Barrio 18 .\n\nEdwin\u2019s absence is a constant torment. One of his brothers was so terrified that he considered migrating to the United States, like tens of thousands of Salvadorans in recent years.\n\nWhenever Daisy thought of her missing son, she\u2019d lose her appetite.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t live like this, learning nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nBut in recent months, there was a new reason for hope.\n\nAD\n\nNayib Bukele, the charismatic young mayor of San Salvador, was elected president in February on promises of change.\n\n\u201cThey say the president, now, he\u2019s helping people,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cAnd that if you go to the attorney general, he\u2019s helping to find the disappeared.\u201d\n\nA crusading attorney general promises answers\n\nAttorney General Ra\u00fal Melara hopped out of an SUV and strode toward the yellow police tape.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIs it up here?\u201d he asked.\n\nAt 47, Melara was part of El Salvador\u2019s tiny business elite, with a doctorate in law and years of leading the National Association of Private Enterprise. He had swept-back dark hair and wire-framed glasses and favored starched white shirts. But on this afternoon, he had donned jeans, a gray polo shirt and a windbreaker to visit the village outside San Salvador known as El Limon \u2014 notorious territory of Barrio 18.\n\nAD\n\nMelara scrambled up a nearly vertical dirt path alongside a dying cornfield, trampling vines and brushing through shoulder-high grass. A quarter-mile up lay a clearing, with mounds of freshly dug dirt and a body.\n\nIt had been a man in jeans and work boots.\n\nMore bodies would probably be dug up in the coming weeks, Melara told journalists. The new government, he said, was committed to finding the disappeared and punishing the culprits.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a phenomenon that, in past years, was hidden. They didn\u2019t want it to be visible,\u201d he told the TV cameras. \u201cBut we\u2019re all seeing it.\u201d\n\nIn just a few months, Melara had made some aggressive moves. He\u2019d formed a team of prosecutors to focus on the disappeared. He\u2019d promoted tougher penalties for those involved in the crime. He was working with the police to produce more accurate numbers.\n\nSome were skeptical. It wasn\u2019t until 2017 \u2014 a quarter-century after the civil war\u2019s end \u2014 that the government finally created a commission to search for the disappeared from that conflict. And locating the more recent victims could be politically unpalatable in a country obsessed with the murder rate.\n\n\u201cFinding and identifying these bodies will inevitably imply a rise in the homicide index,\u201d said Celia Medrano of the human-rights group Cristosal .\n\nAD\n\nArnau Baulenas, legal coordinator of the Human Rights Institute at the Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as University of Central America, said Melara\u2019s initiatives were positive but insufficient.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general has a very small team,\u201d he noted. There are so few forensic criminologists that one of them \u2014 Israel Ticas \u2014 has become a celebrity for helping mothers find the remains of their children.\n\nMelara knows he lacks money, equipment and expertise. It sometimes seems the only thing that\u2019s not in short supply is fear.\n\n\u201cIn Mexico, the families of the victims are visible,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cThey\u2019ve generated social pressure.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador is different. Indeed, at El Limon, as the investigators shoveled dirt, a mother in blue flip-flops approached. Her son vanished a year ago, at age 14.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find him,\u201d she said, weeping, in a TV interview. \u201cEven if he\u2019s not alive, and it\u2019s just to bury him.\u201d\n\nBut she begged the cameraman not to identify her. He filmed her feet.\n\nThere was no sign of her son. On Day 2 of the dig, though, investigators discovered a tantalizing clue near the body.\n\nIt was a wallet. Inside was an ID card.\n\nA discovery brings new hope, and fear\n\nThe call came that day. It had been six months since the middle-aged plumbing worker vanished. Now his family was being summoned to the Justice Ministry.\n\nMaybe, at last, they\u2019d have an answer. But they couldn\u2019t even grieve in peace. They begged reporters not to release his identity.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make a lot of noise,\u201d said one of the man\u2019s relatives. \u201cThe neighborhood is really dangerous.\u201d\n\nAnother relative was more blunt: \u201cSaying the wrong thing could get you killed.\u201d\n\nThe legacy of fear in El Salvador is profound. Three decades after the war, there are people who are only now revealing the disappearance of a relative in that conflict. Back then the scourge was death squads. Now it\u2019s gangs and rogue police.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s silence \u2014 exactly like during the armed conflict,\u201d said Eduardo Garc\u00eda, who heads Pro-B\u00fasqueda, a group searching for war victims.\n\nTen days after the discovery at El Limon, investigators still were trying to match the corpse with the DNA submitted by the plumbing worker\u2019s relatives.\n\nThe families waited.\n\nFor Karen, the news had generated a brief flicker of possibility. Then authorities told her the corpse wasn\u2019t her husband. \u201cI am not going to stop calling the attorney general\u2019s office,\u201d she said. Maybe they\u2019d discover some sign of him, somewhere.\n\nDaisy hasn\u2019t given up, either. In her son\u2019s bedroom, she unlatched a suitcase stuffed with neatly folded shirts and slacks.\n\n\u201cHere are his clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m keeping them here so they don\u2019t get all dusty.\u201d\n\nShe has vivid dreams of her son. In one, he was trapped in a room. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get him out,\u201d she said. One day she heard her 3-year-old grandson shouting outside the house. \u201cEdwin is coming,\u201d he yelled, pointing at the dirt path. No one was there.\n\nBy Day 145, Daisy was thinking of paying another visit to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cGod willing, they\u2019ll have some news soon.\u201d", "description": "The Central American nation is now a democracy.
