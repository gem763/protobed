Now what?", "language": "en", "text": "This is how Google figures out where a user's \"Home\" and \"Work\" is.\n\nSwitching this off means that Google won't try to guess where a user is going based on previous searches and trips.\n\nBut even with Location History (properly) switched off on Android, data and privacy expert Uri Gal, a professor at The University of Sydney Business School, says there are at least two ways the user's location can be tracked.\n\nThese screenshots show Android users had to turn off two settings to disable location tracking. ACCC\n\nThe first is your phone sending signals to the nearest phone tower, known as triangulation.\n\n\"They can triangulate the signals and know with a fairly good degree of accuracy where you are down to the level of a street or a block.\"\n\nIn this case, it's the user's mobile service provider that has access to the data.\n\nBut a 2017 investigation by US-based business publication Quartz found that Android phones were also collecting the addresses of nearby cell phone towers and sending that data to Google, a practice the company confirmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second way is when your phone sends out a unique identifier called a MAC (media access control) when it connects to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.\n\n\"So, whenever you have your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth on, this address can be picked up by the operators of the network, or anyone who has access to the devices that can read these signals,\" Mr Gal said.\n\nAnyone who has access to that Wi-Fi network has access to that data.\n\nLocation accuracy is really specific here, and can be down to what section of a supermarket aisle the user is in.\n\nBetter data literacy\n\nMr Gal said generally people still had a fairly \"superficial\" understanding of how they are tracked through their phones and what entities have access to that data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs such, he argues that promoting good data literacy is crucial.\n\n\"We have to have the freedom to do what we want to do without being concerned that somebody is observing us,\" he said.\n\nSenior research scientist from CSIRO\u2019s Data 61, Adnene Guabtni agreed that tech companies like Google would use every possible way to track someone's location and it didn't matter if a user's Wi-Fi and GPS settings were off.\n\n\"It is still possible because of what we call Wi-Fi scanning, which also applies to Bluetooth,\" Dr Guabtni explained.\n\n(Stay with us here, because things are about to get a bit technical. But this is exactly the type of data literacy citizens need to understand the state of play, and what is actually at stake.)\n\n\"When your device tries to detect Wi-Fi networks available around you \u2026 it will regularly perform Wi-Fi scans and pick up a list of networks. Each network has a basic server set identifier (BSSID), or a unique ID for that network linked to a router of Wi-Fi hotspot,\" Dr Guabtni said.\n\nThese unique IDs are collected by the device even when Wi-Fi is turned off and can be used by big tech companies like Google to determine where someone is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this data collected by Google is anonymised, it has a big database, or map, of BBSIDs spanning the globe.\n\nDr Guabtni said the vast majority of people had no idea Google could still determine their location when their Wi-Fi and GPS was switched off and did not know they would also need to turn off Wi-Fi scanning \u2013 a setting that is tough to find.\n\nConsumer lawyers are quick to point out that fundamentally, the ACCC's case against Google is about consumer law and Google's alleged inadequacies at informing users about how it collected and used their data. It raises privacy issues, but it is not a privacy law case.\n\nThe power of aggregated data\n\nThe ACCC claims Google was not transparent with Android users that their location data was being shared with advertisers.\n\nGoogle adds location movements to other detailed information it has about users based on their online activities, searches and communications with other people, said Monash University law professor Moira Paterson.\n\nThese profiles were a \"honey pot\" for hackers who want to mine the valuable user information, Ms Paterson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There's a strong financial incentive for people to try and hack into it or bribe people with access,\" Ms Paterson said.\n\nDr Guabtni said big tech companies should take more responsibility to better inform users how their data was being used, however, he was doubtful whether anything would change without legal action.\n\n\"It always starts with lawsuits trying to force them to do things right,\" Dr Guabtni said. \"They don't do it naturally or spontaneously.\"\n\nEventually, Dr Guabtni hopes that consumers will be given back the control over their data.\n\n\"It's becoming more and more difficult to protect your personal data online and particularly location data,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully we get there, but it's probably not going to be with the current big tech companies. Disrupters will have to come into the marketplace to change the equation.\"", "description": "Experts warn that even if Android users turn off both their location history and \"Web and App Activity\", their whereabouts can still be tracked and stored by Google, service providers and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/64a4ee25e4a83f80b7b4b91e33709082ba62dc5e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
