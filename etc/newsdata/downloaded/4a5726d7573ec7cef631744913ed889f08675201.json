The ball started going inside with what looked like the velocity and spin of his roughly 94-mph two-seam fastball until, about halfway to the plate, it bent backward and dived as his 88-mph change-up. The pitch looks to hitters, Patrick Corbin pointed out, like a right-hander\u2019s fastball until it became a left-hander\u2019s slider.\n\nThe change-up is key for Strasburg even though it\u2019s not his most used pitch; that\u2019s the curveball at 30.7 percent. It\u2019s not his most important pitch; that\u2019s the fastball, because it sets everything up. But it his most dominant pitch. When he throws it, hitters\u2019 numbers against him plummet as his strikeout rate spikes. Strasburg got 12 swing-and-misses on the change-up alone, tied for his most with any pitch in any game this season, and the outing \u2014 seven innings, seven hits, no walks, 12 strikeouts, no earned runs \u2014 keyed the Nationals\u2019 8-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe victory seized a commanding 3-0 lead in the National League Championship Series, put the Nationals one victory from team\u2019s first World Series and delivered poetic justice. The Nationals shut down Strasburg out of precaution in 2012 before an ill-fated NL Division Series with the Cardinals, and this long-time-coming performance illustrated how much he\u2019s changed. The 31-year-old baffles now not because of a fiery fastball but because of the way he unbalances hitters \u2014 especially with the change-up. The pitch is dangerous because it sets up off the two-seam fastball, which he throws nearly 20 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cWhat made [the change-up] really good today was his fastball,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201c[He was] utilizing his fastball at the right moment, [and it] made his change-up that much better.\u201d\n\nThe change-up dropped and moved more than usual Monday, catcher Kurt Suzuki noted. He called it more as Strasburg got deeper into the game and, as he did, the relievers noticed. A discussion heated up beyond the right-field fence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Guerra said in answer to Strickland\u2019s question as to how Strasburg threw his change-up. The pitch became the topic conversation, and it turned the right-hander\u2019s teammates into admirers as they used terms like \u201cunbelievable,\u201d \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201cone of the best pitches in baseball.\u201d Sean Doolittle noted there\u2019s not a huge change-of-speed, about six mph, so what made it effective was the late movement.\n\nWhat impressed relievers most was that Strasburg doesn\u2019t visibly \u201cpronate\u201d his wrist, twist it down and away, when he throws the change-up. Many pitchers do that to get the desirable sinking, running action. The relievers argued whether the wicked movement came mostly from arm slot, arm action, extension or grip.\n\nThey decided on grip. Strasburg apparently holds the change-up like a two-seam fastball, except instead of his index and middle fingers on the seams, it\u2019s his middle and ring fingers. This evidently deadens the pitch by about six miles an hour while imbuing it with both a similar spin rate to his fastball (which confuses hitters) and the split action (which devastates them). This also heightens the importance of Strasburg\u2019s two-seam fastball beyond a strategical setup because it ties the two pitches together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMechanically, if you execute your fastball, it's really just a grip change,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cYou're doing the same exact thing.\u201d\n\nMartinez, a lifetime .276 hitter across 16 seasons in MLB, joked that when Strasburg\u2019s change-up is on, he\u2019s glad he\u2019s no longer playing. The manager thought Strasburg is most difficult to hit because he has two different change-ups, one that broke inside to righties and one that went straight down. Strasburg and Suzuki remained coy about whether he had multiple change-ups at all.\n\n\u201cSometimes I throw a good one, and sometimes I don't,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cThat\u2019s two different ones.\u201d\n\nThe change-up, no matter which kind, left the Cardinals dazed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt looks like a fastball until it gets to the cut of the dirt [in front of home plate],\u201d said Kolten Wong, who finished 0-for-4. \u201cThen just starts to either sink or run. It kind of takes on both.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe locates it well, keeps it down,\u201d said Paul Goldschmidt, who struck out twice on the change-up. \u201cEven if you see it, it\u2019s a weak groundball or a swing-and-miss.\u201d\n\nThe most impressive part of Strasburg\u2019s change-up to Doolittle was his ability to execute it in high-leverage situations. Pitchers need to stay calm to execute off-speed pitches in the zone, Doolittle emphasized, because adrenaline might lead to overthrowing a pitch you need to finesse.\n\n\u201cIt's one thing to pick up the ball and throw 97 [mph] 'cause you got adrenaline going,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cBut he was poised enough to really execute that [change-up] all night long.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis was the most important game ever played at Nationals Park, and the crowd\u2019s size and volume reflected that. The Cardinals mounted their biggest rally of the series in the seventh inning with three singles from the first four batters, and they scored on the last one after Juan Soto fell in left field and then made an errant throw back in.\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg clutched his hamstring during the play, and Martinez and trainer Paul Lessard jogged out. Strasburg told the manager he cramped up as he always does; he wanted to stay in.\n\n\u201cYou sure you're all right?\u201d Martinez asked.\n\n\u201cI'm in the game!\u201d he remembered Strasburg replying.\n\nThe manager looked at Suzuki, and the catcher said, \u201cLet him finish.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMartinez departed without his starter. Strasburg then faced Matt Wieters, his catcher for the better part of two seasons, with two on and one out. Strasburg threw his two-seamer far less often when Wieters caught him, and he started the left-handed hitter off with that. Then he threw four straight change-ups and Wieters, despite knowing the pitcher as intimately as a hitter could, waved through it anyway.\n\nStrasburg had one hitter left. Dexter Fowler, struggling hard in this series, stood no chance. Strasburg hit a season high for pitches as, on his 117th, he threw a change-up that bit as hard as any other throughout the night. Fowler swung through the pitch at the bottom of the strike zone and Strasburg marched off the hill, the composure needed to execute those pitches all night finally gone.\n\nAD\n\nAdditional reading about the Nationals:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The veteran right-hander uses his curveball the most, and his fastball is the most important, but the change-up remains his most dominant pitch.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Po6dtPuBD6zfWoF25TlPfquKwXw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AJUFHXO5EI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
