It was the same exact nonsense on the 10th anniversary. Which is par for the course when it comes to MLB looking mighty foolish on this day.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of sad,\u201d Alonso said after the Mets shut out the Arizona Diamondbacks \u2014 fittingly by scoring nine runs on 11 hits. \u201c \u2026 I mean, since that first game back (in 2001), they kind of shut it down every single year since. I think that\u2019s really unfortunate. So a way to kind of get around that was the cleats.\u201d\n\nBaseball didn\u2019t know about the cleats. The Mets players wore them anyway. Kudos to them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really happy that everyone wore the shoes because we could\u2019ve gotten fined for it,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cBut everyone was willing to back up the cause and it\u2019s really awesome. I\u2019m just really happy that everyone was behind me and stuck with this \u2026\u201d\n\nAlonso, who was in first-grade and living in Tampa when the tragedy occurred, said the cleats were a gift to his teammates. He went around and found out their brands and shoe sizes. And thanks to a lot of different people, they got done in time for the game.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been thankful and gracious for this opportunity,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cFor me, this season has been an absolute fantasy. I just want to give back. I want to help. I don\u2019t just want to be known as a good baseball player, I want to be known as a good person, too.\n\n\u201cAnd I just want to really recognize what this day is about. I don\u2019t want it to be a holiday. I want it to be a day of remembrance of everything that happened. It was an awful day.\u201d\n\nAlonso has quickly ingratiated himself with New York fans not only by hitting a lot of homers, but also making an impact off the field. And when the sport\u2019s current home-run leader (47) won the Home Run Derby, he donated 10 percent of the $1 million prize to a pair of charities.\n\nA member of the New York City Fire Department greets New York Mets' Pete Alonso during a Sept. 11, 2001, tribute before the team's baseball game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2019, in New York.

Afterward, there were handshakes and selfies, a wonderful scene unfolding before first pitch.\n\nThe players did get to wear FDNY and NYPD hats, but it was only before the game. And they weren\u2019t the custom ones that Alonso and his teammates desired.\n\nSo they broke MLB\u2019s ridiculous rules, putting cool, commemorative 9/11 cleats on their feet.\n\nBravo.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we just wanted to do,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cI feel like if MLB kind of got their hands on it it may not have been approved. But I\u2019m just really happy that we kind of banded together in the clubhouse and made something cool happen.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Pete Alonso takes matters into his own hands after MLB shots down 9/11 request.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/o_I32qwdDmoE3ORHnlDGnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IhcVGJbExYcqfrVfK5x1pQ--~B/aD0zMTc0O3c9NDc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a1fb56a0-d50f-11e9-bfff-362d59a8007e", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
