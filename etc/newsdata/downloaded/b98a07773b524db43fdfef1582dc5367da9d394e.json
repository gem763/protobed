Graham insists the encounter was consensual and chose to represent himself at trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Graham stood with a yellow legal-pad paper and addressed the jurors during his opening statement. \u201cHow you all doing this morning? This is my first time acting as my own lawyer. But I got this,\u201d Graham told the jury. He said he and the woman met and flirted with each other and then, later that day, \u201cthe magic\u201d happened. \u201cBy magic, I mean sex,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcquaintance sexual assault cases are often the most challenging for prosecutors to prove. Graham and the woman met that July afternoon as she was walking to a bus stop in Northeast Washington on her way to see a friend. They exchanged names and then telephone numbers. The heat index that day was about 106 degrees, prosecutors said. The woman told the jury she had a 30-minute wait for her bus, so Graham, who lived near the bus stop, invited her to wait inside his nearby air-conditioned home. She took him up on his offer.\n\n\u201cShe made a decision to go to his house, and her life would change forever,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenya Davis told the jury during her opening statement. \u201cThe gentleman who offered this woman shelter from the extreme heat turned into a completely different person.\u201d\n\nSuch trials are often emotional, but the tension in the courtroom was heightened when Graham stood to cross-examine his accuser. As he approached the lectern to begin questioning, she leaned forward in her chair on the witness stand, her mouth tightened and narrowed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow you doing?\u201d Graham said.\n\nShe responded, \u201cHow you doing?\u201d\n\nGraham then asked the woman to state her name. Judge Danya Dayson had instructed Graham to refer to himself as \u201cthe defendant\u201d or \u201cMr. Graham.\u201d\n\nGraham was expected to follow the questions written for him by his court-appointed advising attorney, Howard McEachern. But he followed his own script.\n\n\u201cDo you consider yourself an emotional female?\u201d Graham asked.\n\nDavis immediately objected.\n\nGraham threw out another question: \u201cAre you familiar with the movie \u2018Fifty Shades of Grey\u2019?\u201d\n\nDavis again immediately objected. A juror in the front row bowed and shook his head.\n\n\u201cIs it true that you were obsessed with the defendant?\u201d Graham then asked.\n\nAD\n\nDavis objected, but the woman responded anyway. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think the defendant is handsome?\u201d Graham asked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo, honestly no,\u201d the woman responded.\n\nGraham asked the woman why she gave him her phone number if she did not find him attractive. \u201cI gave it to you so I could block you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThen why did you go to the defendant\u2019s home?\u201d Graham asked.\n\n\u201cFor the air conditioning only,\u201d she responded. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe questioning of the woman by Graham lasted most of Wednesday afternoon. By the end of the day, Dayson told the jury she would see them Thursday for the completion of the trial.\n\nBut Thursday morning, the plans had changed. Based on Graham\u2019s performance in court, Dayson excused the jury for the day. Based on a recommendation by McEachern, his attorney, the judge ordered a D.C. psychologist to interview Graham to determine whether he was competent to continue with the trial. That report is expected to be filed Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe judge then ordered a forensic evaluation for Graham based on the recommendation by McEachern. Defendants have the right to represent themselves. But if the jury convicted Graham of sexual assault and it was later determined that he was not competent, his conviction could be overturned.\n\nIn the courtroom Thursday, Graham objected to the forensic evaluation. At one point, he and two U.S. marshals got into a brief verbal altercation as the marshals ordered Graham to sit in his seat.\n\nIt was not the first time Graham was the subject of a mental evaluation. In June, Dayson ordered Graham be examined at St. Elizabeths Hospital, the District\u2019s psychiatric facility. Graham was later found competent to stand trial, although a psychiatrist diagnosed him with an \u201cunspecified bipolar and related disorder.\u201d The psychiatrist also wrote in her seven-page report that Graham was not at the time exhibiting any symptoms of mental illness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDayson is likely to decide Friday whether the trial will continue.\n\nA 7-year-old is the key witness against the man charged in her little brother\u2019s death. The defense argues she may be to blame.\n\nHe had \u2018goals and a vision.\u2019 Jamel Kirkland is D.C.\u2019s eighth victim age 11 to 17 to be fatally shot this year.\n\nOne accused teacher, 8,000 lewd images: A school\u2019s exploitation shows no place is safe from hidden cameras anymore\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Prosecutors say Lorenzo Graham violently assaulted a woman; he says the encounter was consensual.", "authors": ["Keith L.
