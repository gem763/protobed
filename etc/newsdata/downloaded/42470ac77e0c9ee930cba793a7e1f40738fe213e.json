Trump\u2019s repeated requests in the call to Zelensky to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son are now the target of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nDespite his warning about U.S. actions, Peskov also said Moscow would consider exposing the contents of phone calls with Trump on a case-by-case basis, according to Bloomberg. \u201cNo one has turned to us with such requests,\u201d he added.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said Friday that sharing Trump-Putin conversations would be \u201cindecent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for transcripts of phone conversations, my mother when bringing me up said that reading other people\u2019s letters is inappropriate,\u201d Lavrov told reporters at the United Nations, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\u201cIt is indecent,\u201d he said. \u201cFor two people elected by their nations to be at the helm, there are diplomatic manners that suppose a certain level of confidentiality.\u201d\n\nTrump has been accused of being exceptionally secretive about face-to-face conversations with Putin. On at least one occasion in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017, Trump took possession of the notes taken by his own interpreter, whom he instructed not to reveal what was discussed to other administration officials, sources told The Washington Post. By early this year, officials said there was no detailed record of Trump\u2019s face-to-face interactions with Putin at five locations since Trump became president.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Friday that access was also limited to comments Trump made to Kremlin officials in 2017 that Russian interference in U.S. elections didn\u2019t bother him because America did the same elsewhere.", "description": "Russian Foreign Minister\u00a0Sergei Lavrov says his mother taught him that sharing private conversations is \"indecent.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e9f29220000580053ea25.jpeg?cache=swvyzvkzod&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
