Well, you may have your chance sooner than you think. Check out this wild report from Government Executive about some new \u201cbrain-computer interface strips\u201d that can be attached to your skin and transmit your brainwaves into readable data. There\u2019s one catch, though. In order to try it out, you may have to enlist in the military and volunteer to become a supersoldier because the military is investing in the technology.\n\nThe U.S. military has a growing interest in brain-computer interfaces: sensors that pick up brain signals and electronics that convert them to digital information that can be read by computers. But today\u2019s most common way to pick up the brain\u2019s electromagnetic signals via electroencephalography, or EEG, involves sensor-studded caps that are bulky, look ridiculous, need to be connected via wires to other machines, and often require conductive jelly in order to work. Moreover, they work unpredictably depending on individual factors like hair. They\u2019re poorly suited for regular life, much less for soldiers. A group of scientists from several universities has created an unobtrusive brain-computer interface strip that could revolutionize the way humans convert their thoughts into a machine-readable format.\n\nI was already familiar with some of the earlier versions of this gear and was very excited about the uses they were being put to. Scientists had already developed caps studded with sensors that, with practice, could allow people confined to electric wheelchairs the ability to move them around and steer them. (You can watch a video of one model here.)\n\nThe early ones were problematic, however. The performance could be clunky and the helmet had a mass of wires that had to be physically connected to the chair or other devices. These \u201cstrips\u201d look pretty exciting though. The circuitry is taped to your skin and then your brainwaves are picked up and interpreted, translating them into commands sent to the device.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s only if everything goes as planned. And I\u2019m guessing that you have to have pretty solid powers of concentration to focus your thoughts on sending signals that will be useful and understood by the system. With my luck, I\u2019d try one out and it would work for thirty seconds before speeding toward the nearest store that sells bacon.\n\nHaving gotten all the positive news out of the way, it\u2019s time to look at the deeper implications. I\u2019m still excited about the possibilities this technology holds, particularly for people suffering from paralysis. But if the initial attempt at the technology is capable of this much, what will it be able to do in the future? I\u2019m not trying to go all Boris Johnson on you here and start warning of terrifying, limbless chickens, but how closely do we want our technology to be meshing with our actual brainwaves?\n\nIf these sensors can detect and interpret human brainwaves, translating them into useful digital data, it\u2019s not crazy to imagine that the process could flow in the other direction. I\u2019m picturing something where a machine interface can begin injecting thoughts into people\u2019s heads that are not their own. How useful would that be, particularly to intelligence agencies?\n\nSometimes the future sneaks up on you pretty quickly. I think this is another one of those cases.", "description": "Mind control... literally", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BrainWaves.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
