Fog, rain, rockslides and sheer cliffs are main attractions. The road has likely claimed thousands of lives.\n\nBut for 70-year old Bolivian Mirtha Munoz, the oldest ever competitor in Bolivia\u00b4s 60 km (37 mile) Skyrace, an extreme bike racing competition, it was a natural extension of a passion she picked up years ago.\n\nMunoz took up biking on the advice of her family and a psychologist friend after her son died unexpectedly.\n\n\"He told me ... the bike could help me get through my pain, and to rebuild,\" she said.\n\nSaturday\u00b4s race was a pinnacle achievement, no pun intended.\n\n\"It\u00b4s a vertical climb, you go up and up and there\u00b4s no rest,\" she told Reuters upon finishing the race.\n\nMunoz, one of the race\u00b4s founders, says she enjoys more low-key bike-riding with her six grandchildren, though admits she hopes the eldest, now approaching 18, will soon follow in her tracks.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Ramos and Reuters TV, writing by Dave Sherwood, editing by Chris Reese)", "description": "LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia\u00b4s \"Death Road\" might seem an odd place for a septuagenarian grandmother on two wheels.", "authors": ["Daniel Ramos"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
