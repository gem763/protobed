The 31-year-old right-hander otherwise sailed through his outing, and his last start of the regular season ultimately gave the Nationals enough leeway so that when the bullpen later struggled they still emerged with a 6-3 win.\n\nThe victory was the Nationals\u2019 90th of the season, and it finished the first five-game series sweep in team history. It nudged them ahead of the Phillies in the teams\u2019 all-time series, 140-139, and gave them 14 wins in 19 games against Philadelphia this year. Most importantly, it maintained their one-game lead for the top NL wild-card spot over the Milwaukee Brewers, who beat the Cincinnati Reds for their 18th victory in their past 20 games.\n\nThe Brewers\u2019 surge has pulled them to within a game of the idle St. Louis Cardinals for the NL Central lead and has further muddled who the Nationals might face in the wild-card game. Each team has one three-game series left: The Cardinals host the Chicago Cubs, the Brewers visit the Colorado Rockies, and the Nationals host the Cleveland Indians, who are clawing for a spot in the American League wild-card race.\n\n[State of the race: Nationals maintain slim lead to host wild-card game]\n\nStrasburg did his part to keep the Nationals in a favorable spot heading into the final weekend. He shoved this season, bouncing back from a disappointing 2018 to finish with a 3.32 ERA over 209 innings. He punctuated the resurgence by striking out 10 Thursday \u2014 including Bryce Harper three times \u2014 to set a new career high of 251 in a season.\n\nThe argument for starting Strasburg begins with the fact Scherzer hasn\u2019t been the same since he returned from the injured list in late August. He has made four starts at full effort and, though his stuff has looked the part, he has posted a 4.94 ERA. His track record in the postseason, a 3.73 ERA in 16 appearances, pales to Strasburg\u2019s one earned run over 19 innings across three starts.\n\nStrasburg, meanwhile, capped the most dominant and durable season of his career with a 33rd start that could serve as a fine final audition. He mostly cruised, erasing the two singles he allowed by getting the next hitter to bounce into a double play. His only real mistake was a curveball that caught too much of the plate in the fourth that C\u00e9sar Hern\u00e1ndez hooked just fair down the right field line. Strasburg rebounded against the next batter, Harper, showing what he had left in the tank. He reached back for a 96-mph fastball, his hardest pitch of the afternoon, and blew it by Harper for strike three.\n\nThe closest Strasburg came to danger the rest of the afternoon was a leadoff double by Andrew Knapp in the sixth. He pitched around it by striking out the next three hitters, finishing with Harper again. Strasburg could have gone longer, but Manager Dave Martinez lifted him at 92 pitches \u2014 perhaps with a nod to the wild-card game.\n\n[Bryce Harper\u2019s wife says \u2018classless\u2019 Nationals Park fan yelled about newborn son]\n\nStill, Martinez intimated this week he expects Scherzer to start Tuesday. He said, \u201cIf you look at the schedule right now, that\u2019s Max\u2019s day.\u201d But Scherzer is lined up to start Sunday, which still could happen if the Nationals need to win to secure home-field advantage in the wild-card game, and Strasburg would be on regular rest for Tuesday. Martinez couched his comments before Thursday\u2019s game and said he would likely decide Saturday who will get the ball for the one-game playoff.\n\nThe seventh inning arrived Thursday, and Strasburg stayed in the dugout. One of the most successful seasons of his career was over. He was standing in the dugout when teammate Gerardo Parra approached. The outfielder stretched out his arms, and Strasburg, famously withdrawn, didn\u2019t react. Parra advanced anyway, wrapping his arms around the pitcher, and Victor Robles and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez followed. Strasburg couldn\u2019t move in the middle of the group hug, but he did crack a grin.", "description": "Stephen Strasburg strikes out 10 in six strong innings, making his final case for a chance to start the NL wild-card game.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tLN4x10lbEa0D-hht-qYcf5rBG8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZW3LZHAW4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
