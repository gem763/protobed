I thought I was being a pervert.\"\n\nIt wasn't all fun and games though, with one commenter demanding it to be taken off sale after it was shared on a couponing and bargains group.\n\nIt read: \"Disgusting! It should be removed from the shelves. Young kiddies just think its a deep wound but adults know what it looks like.\n\n\"Shop assistants should have reported this to their manager.\"\n\nHome Bargains were approached for a comment, but a spokesperson told Devon Live the company was not able to comment.", "description": "Some saw the funny side but another has demanded the Halloween prop be removed from the shelves", "authors": ["Colleen Smith", "Luke Matthews", "Image", "Extreme Couponing", "Bargains Uk Group"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572297.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Home-Bargains-fake-Halloween-scar-reminds-shoppers-of-something-far-more-explicit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
