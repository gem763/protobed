From there he worked from the back and the front, applying rear-naked chokes and a guillotine choke.\n\nAfter he hopped onto the back for the second time, Chapman (9-4 MMA, 0-1 BMMA) perched up on his hands. Mix grabbed a hold of Chapman\u2019s leg and torqued it back towards his head. The hamstring stretched to a point of no endurance and Chapman tapped.\n\nWith the victory, Mix stays undefeated through his first 12 professional fights. The Buffalo, N.Y. native turned professional after an impressive amateur career where he was undefeated through 10 fights.\n\nThe loss snapped a three-fight win streak for Chapman.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s weigh-in, Chapman weighed a quarter-pound over the bantamweight limit. The commission did not allow him to cut any more weight and he was fined 20 percent of his purse for the miss.\n\nThe bantamweight bout was part of the Bellator 232 main card at Mohegan Sun Arena. The main card streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 232 results include:\n\nPatrick Mix def.
