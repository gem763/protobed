Trump says US \u2018never committed\u2019 to Syrian allies, but SecDef says Washington still committed to oil\n\nWhile Trump has not officially renounced the \u201cAssad must go\u201d policy of his predecessor, the pullout was supposed to be the end of it in practice. The sudden talk about Syrian oil fields, however, suggests that someone from the \u201cswamp\u201d managed to persuade the president to keep one foot in the endless foreign wars he has pledged to end.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep the oil,\u201d Trump said this week, to the confusion of everybody. Attempting to explain on Thursday, he said the oil fields were \u201cheld by [Islamic State] until the United States took them over with the help of the Kurds. We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields!\u201d\n\nExcept there is no sign of IS getting reconstituted or rising from the ashes \u2013 and the Syrians rightly regard any US attempt to seize the oil fields as theft and piracy.\n\nPirate, thief, you @realDonaldTrump\n\nGive Syria its oil back and release your economic sanctions on the women and children of Syria \u2014 Bassem (@BBassem7) October 24, 2019\n\nMuch has been made of Trump\u2019s own comments from 2011 about the US seizing Iraqi oil as \u201creimbursement\u201d for the 2003 invasion, but that does not appear to be the case here. Ironically, Trump has boasted recently about his administration making the US into a net exporter of oil and gas, so it does not need the Syrian oil.\n\nThe oil fields in question were traditionally used to meet domestic demands and are too small to be interesting to Washington in terms of profit, journalist and orientalist Andrey Ontikov told RT.\n\nOne clue might be in the words of US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who said the purpose of keeping the troops in Syria is to \u201cdeny access to [IS] and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nThis phrasing is a dead giveaway that the oil gambit is not about IS, but about blocking the government in Damascus from using its own natural resources to rebuild. Already under a blockade by the US and its EU allies, Syria desperately needs the oil to help its people survive the winter. \"Malign activities\" is a phrase Washington often uses in reference to Iran, a strategic partner and ally of the Syrian government.\n\nA map of #Syria#oil & gas fields. Before the war, Syria made 387K barrels/day & sold 140K, accounting for 25.1% of state income. US/Kurdish areas in east (Omar, al-Shadadi, Suwayda fields) could today make at least 60K bpd.\n\n\n\nUS \"securing the oil\" is abt denying Syria recovery $. pic.twitter.com/g1qWcEqghq \u2014 Morgan Art-boo-khina \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b (@LavenderNRed) October 23, 2019\n\nIf that sounds to you like a policy designed by someone from the Washington establishment, which has dreamed of regime change in Damascus for the past eight years and greeted Trump\u2019s decision with wailing and gnashing of teeth, you are not alone. NBC News has even named a possible culprit \u2013 retired General Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, who they say gave Trump a briefing about the oil fields.\n\nYet Keane has been against any US withdrawal from Syria or the Middle East in general, and Trump has ignored his advice in the past in favor of other Fox personalities \u2013 such as Tucker Carlson and his frequent guest, retired US Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor, who both approved of the Syria pullout.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Taking legal action\u2019: Iraq pleads with UN to kick unauthorized US forces out of country\n\nCritics of the purported plan point out that its illegal. So was the US presence in Syria, mind you \u2013 and their transit through Iraq as well, according to Baghdad, or the 2003 invasion, or\u2026 well a number of other things, too long to get into here. Illegality has never stopped Washington, convinced as it is of American exceptionalism.\n\nYes, the oil gambit would be a crime \u2013 but worse than that, it would be a mistake. By leaving troops in Syria to \u201ckeep the oil,\u201d whether for or from someone, Trump would be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory \u2013 and for what? Appeasing the very same Washington Swamp he literally just denounced as \u201chuman scum\u201d?\n\nThings have had a way of working out in Trump\u2019s favor, and he has described himself as a \u201cstable genius.\u201d Yet there is nothing clever or genial about this, frankly stupid, plan. As he himself would say, let\u2019s see what happens.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT", "description": "US President Donald Trump\u2019s baffling comments about keeping some troops in Syria to \u201csecure the oil\u201d suggest a confused, contradictory \u2013 and ultimately self-defeating \u2013 policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db2101485f5402a6e1ff1a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
