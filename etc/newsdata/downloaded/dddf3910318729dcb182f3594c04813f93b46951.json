Not just in Bulgaria but in England too.\n\nThe reason, I was told, that England supporters sang their own songs over the Bulgarian national anthem in Sofia was because the PA system at the Vasil Levski stadium was so poor that those in the visiting section were unaware it was time to stand quietly for a moment.\n\nThis was strange given that, moments earlier, those same supporters had sung along gustily to their own anthem. Maybe the glitch in the system was selective.\n\nAt the end of a depressing week for our game, denials also were heard in England too\n\nMeanwhile, the England fans clashing with police in Prague before kick-off against the Czech Republic were apparently not football supporters at all, just random English folk who happened to be tanked up in town when there was a game on.\n\nOdd, though, that this doesn\u2019t seem to have happened in Japan while the rugby has been on. Or doesn\u2019t happen in Australia when the Ashes are being played. So either football is just unlucky or we still have a small problem with what happens when the England team travel abroad.\n\nI say small because I think, on the whole, it is and it is diminishing too. That in part is down to the FA, the English police and the attitude of the vast majority of fans who travel. Significant strides have been made.\n\nBut the problem remains and those who say otherwise just aren\u2019t looking properly. The security operation in Sofia was good. Those in the official England Supporters Travel Club told of effective, low-visibility local policing and most responded in kind. In the bars and cafes of the Bulgarian capital, during the long hot hours that led up to a 9.45pm local kick-off, there was no bother at all.\n\nThe problems caused abroad remain and those who say otherwise aren\u2019t looking properly\n\nIt is a shame, then, that some idiots remain. The ones who need weeding out, shaming and for whom excuses should never be made are those who stood in the away end last Monday singing about \u2018Ten German Bombers\u2019. And those behaving so unpleasantly in a hotel bar the night before that one former England international \u2014 working in the media \u2014 changed his plans for a nightcap and headed straight to bed.\n\nThese are not things that make the news and in isolation may not appear significant.\n\nBut they form part of the general aura of occasional unpleasantness that continues to attach itself to the coat-tails of the national team.\n\nAnd why is this important now?\n\nWhen the spotlight shines on someone else's flaws it is very easy to forget about your own\n\nWhy raise this when Gareth Southgate\u2019s team and most who travelled east to watch represented their country so well?\n\nI raise it precisely because it is when the spotlight is shining so brightly on someone else\u2019s flaws and problems that it is so very easy to forget about your own.\n\nAnd, in terms of England and its minority of rogue football fans, this must not happen. Not until the day they decide to stay at home, anyway.\n\nBielsa needs to get smart\n\nMarcelo Bielsa has brought much to Leeds United and if the Argentinian coach leads them back to the Premier League at the second attempt it will be a notable achievement.\n\nBut the 64-year-old made a significant misstep when he turned up for an official black-tie event to celebrate his club\u2019s centenary wearing a tracksuit on Thursday night.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa made a misstep when he turned up to a black tie event wearing his tracksuit\n\nWe have seen things like this before. Jose Mourinho wore a knitted hoodie beneath his club blazer at a Munich memorial at Old Trafford while Pep Guardiola has been known to attend formal functions following his own \u2018smart casual\u2019 style book.\n\nNone of this makes these men \u2018unique\u2019 or \u2018quirky\u2019. It merely suggests they think different rules apply to them because of who they are.\n\nThey are, of course, very wrong. If a suit and tie was not too much trouble for Norman Hunter, Allan Clarke and Trevor Cherry at Elland Road last Thursday, it certainly should not have been for a man who will always exist in their shadow.\n\nGOOD WEEK\n\nRoss Barkley\n\nThe Chelsea player\u2019s excellent England performance against Bulgaria was lost amid the night\u2019s off-field issues but Gareth Southgate will have noticed. It was the perfect time to make a statement and we hope the ankle injury Barkley suffered on Saturday is not serious.\n\nBAD WEEK\n\nMichael O'Neill\n\nAn unlucky defeat by Holland has put Northern Ireland\u2019s Euro 2020 qualification hopes in doubt. May we finally get to see O\u2019Neill in club management soon? Part of me hopes so.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN: At the end of a depressing week for our game, denials were still being heard.
