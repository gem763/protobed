My father was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in January and passed away from a chemo-related blood infection in March. My mother, who has Alzheimer's, is coping with the loss of her husband, her home, and a new living situation in an Assisted -Living community (she cannot live on her own - my father did everything for her). My brother and I are also coping with our loss and our mother's resentment over her new place. My aunt, who was my dad's sister, passed away over the weekend. His brother is ill and in the hospital. We are a close family and every one of these events is heartbreaking. And I miss my dad so much. He was my guy. I've been divorced once and widowed once, and he was my rock. His unconditional support never wavered. His absence from my life feels like a gaping wound that refuses to heal. My son is in college and my daughter started her freshman year of college this fall. Aside from my pets, I am alone in my home. I have stopped caring about my house, my appearance, my finances, my friendships. I go to work, come home, and go to bed. On weekends I sleep in, play a specific computer game that I like for 12 hours, then go to bed or sleep in my armchair. I order takeout, or get my groceries delivered. I've been calling in sick to work. I take meds for PTSD and major depressive disorder. I am numb and am just getting through the day so I can go home and just be. I was in therapy for almost 5 years - began after my husband's death from suicide by overdose - but quit after my dad died because I had just had enough. I want to go back to see my therapist, but I just stopped going to see her. She sent me a letter that I didn't acknowledge, saying she would accept me back if I responded two weeks after her letter, but if she didn't hear from me she would close my file. I'm afraid to call her office and ask to come back. I don't want to start over with another therapist. But I also don't want to talk to her about everything. And explain. I have a difficult time with people's facial expressions/reactions, specifically expressions of pity, empathy, or sadness toward me. It give me anxiety just thinking about it. So...now what? I feel stuck. I can't go back and I don't see a way forward anymore. I just want my life how it was.", "description": "Send in your questions to Dr. Andrea Bonior about relationships, mental health, work-life balance, family drama and more.", "authors": ["Dr. Andrea Bonior", "Dr. Andrea Bonior Is A Licensed Clinical Psychologist", "The Voice Behind Baggage Check Since Its Start In She Serves On The Faculty Of Georgetown University", "Is The Author Of The Publisher'S Weekly Best-Seller", "Psychology", "Essential Thinkers", "Classic Theories", "How They Inform Your World", "The Friendship Fix.", "Susan Cain"], "top_image": "https://vforum-images.washingtonpost.com/2017_12/livechat_text_20171210030842.jpg"}
