They described Google searches for CBD as now reaching the numbers for yoga and e-cigarettes.\n\nBut what is CBD, and is the hype actually real? Let\u2019s have a look.\n\nWhat is a Cannabinoid?\n\nThere are three types of cannabinoids. Endocannabinoids, which are produced naturally in the body; man-made cannabinoids, which can be really dangerous; and the most popular, cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, which come from the marijuana plant.\n\nAll three kinds of cannabinoids bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body. CB1 receptors, located primarily in the brain, are believed to control mood, memory, sleep, appetite and pain. CB2 receptors are located in parts of the body that produce blood cells, such as the spleen, and are believed to affect inflammation.\n\nWhat is CBD?\n\nCBD is short for cannabidiol, and it\u2019s one chemical compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant \u2014 in both marijuana and hemp. CBD differs from THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) because it doesn\u2019t cause the intoxicating, euphoric \u201chigh\u201d associated with marijuana.\n\nWhat are the health benefits?\n\nThough there are claims of health benefits wherever you go, the science isn\u2019t quite there yet \u2014 most of the research that has found benefits was done on animals. That\u2019s because researching marijuana legally is difficult. Marijuana is a schedule I controlled substance, defined as having \u201cno accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s a lot of anecdotal evidence. One case: Charlotte Figi.\n\nA robust and active toddler, Charlotte began having seizures early in life \u2014 up to 50 per day. She was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a seizure disorder that can be uncontrollable with typical medications. After exhaustive research, Charlotte\u2019s mother found that the best treatment was a combination of CBD extract with Charlotte\u2019s normal antiepileptic drug regimen. This cut the seizures down to two to three per month, allowing her to live a normal childhood.\n\nIn June 2018, the FDA approved a CBD-containing seizure medication called Epidiolex, which can be used for the uncontrollable seizures caused by diseases such as Dravet Syndrome.\n\nCBD is also widely used to treat pain and anxiety. Scientists are quick to say they are still unsure of the way this works, but they believe it may be due to CBD altering some brain pathways linked to these symptoms.\n\nIn skin care, CBD has been reported to treat itchiness, acne and allergic dermatitis \u2014 a skin reaction to allergies. While the mechanisms here are also unknown, scientists think it may be due to cannabinoid receptors in the skin which, when activated, work to reduce inflammation.\n\nAs states move to legalize these compounds to the public, all of these claims will need to be studied.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nHow do people use CBD?\n\nMany CBD products are sold as oils or balms, but they are also available in lotions, facial serums, lozenges or as part of cocktails. Although manufacturers claim there is an appropriate dose for the products they make, that is up for debate. The nutrition and supplement business, in general, is highly unregulated and this includes CBD products, even in states with legal marijuana.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nBoth the benefits and risks of CBD lack substantiated research. As with any supplement, there is always a risk for unintended drug interaction. A small number of studies on animals indicate that CBD could potentially affect cell health and the breakdown of drugs in the liver. In humans, a study that investigated CBD\u2019s effect on seizures noted side effects including diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and increased sleepiness.\n\nWhy is it popular now?\n\nIn a word: marketing.\n\nSimilar to vitamin C and kale, CBD is undergoing a rise to fame just similar to the way that kale has been labeled a \u201csuperfood,\u201d which is a non-medical buzzword. And with celebrities publicizing anecdotal benefits, there\u2019s been easing tension surrounding CBD\u2019s stigma.\n\nBut most importantly, as mentioned, it\u2019s being marketed as a fix for various ailments.\n\nIs it legal to use CBD?\n\nNot Exactly. As mentioned, marijuana is still a schedule I substance, and that includes CBD.\n\nThe issue of legality comes down to how the CBD is obtained. The THC portions of the cannabis plant include the flowering tops (buds), the leaves and the resin of the plant. The remainder \u2014 the stalks and sterilized seeds \u2014 is where most CBD comes from. However, producers can also obtain it from the THC portions in which case it might yield a mixture of THC and CBD.\n\nAccording to Katherine Pfaff, a spokesperson for the DEA, \u201cIf the product does cause THC to enter the human body and/or contains greater than 0.3 percent of THC, it is an illegal substance that may not be manufactured, sold or consumed in the United States. If, however, the product does not cause THC to enter the human body and contains less than 0.3 percent THC, it is a non-controlled substance that may lawfully be sold.\u201d\n\nThe National Institutes of Health lists over 150 studies involving CBD as a treatment for various diseases. The World Health Organization concluded in a press release that CBD is not harmful. And in the sports world, the World Anti-Doping Agency removed it from its prohibited substances list.\n\nTo top this off, CBD is widely available online as well as in countless bars and coffee shops nationwide. This legal ambiguity undoubtedly confuses consumers, and it won\u2019t change until further research trickles in.\n\nThe bottom line is there are countless claims regarding CBD\u2019s ability to cure common ailments and there are also many places to buy CBD over the counter. But while there are many people willing to answer for CBD, the reality is there are still many questions that the industry itself needs to answer.\n\nDr. Sumir Shah is an emergency medicine physician in New York City and former member of the ABC News Medical Unit.
