This is the first time that earnings for full-time women have not peaked at ages 30 to 39 https://t.co/rnoOInsbE6 pic.twitter.com/DHNrGUrU8w \u2014 Office for National Statistics (@ONS) October 29, 2019\n\nTUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady told the Guardian: \u2018Our economy is still stacked against working women. At this rate, it will take decades to close the gender pay gap.\n\n\u2018Government must pick up the pace. It\u2019s clear that publishing gender pay gaps isn\u2019t enough on its own. Companies must also be legally required to explain how they\u2019ll close them.\n\n\u2018And bosses who don\u2019t pay women fairly should be fined.\u2019\n\nLast week, a different ONS report suggested the gender pay gap is widest for women in their 50s.\n\nYesterday, BBC presenter Samira Ahmed claimed at a tribunal that she faced a 600% pay gap compared to Jeremy Vine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddressing the generational divide in the latest figures, Women\u2019s Equality Party spokesperson Harini Iyangar added: \u2018These figures show what an enormous impact the responsibility of unpaid caring has on women\u2019s career progression and wages.\n\n\u2018As women get older they are more likely than men to take on care for both children and elderly, sick or disabled relatives. This means that women are also more likely to work part time, more likely to work in lower paid occupations and less likely to occupy senior positions.\u2019\n\nAdding that the party wanted \u2018comprehensive action\u2019, she said her party wanted greater transparency from businesses and more opportunities for flexible working and shared parental leave.\n\nShe added that universal free childcare and proper investment in social care should be \u2018at the top of the political agenda\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, median weekly earnings for full-time employees has increased by 2.9% to \u00a3585 from last year, but after inflation, the increase is just 0.9%, according to the report.\n\nHowever, median weekly earnings in real terms are still 2.9% lower than the peak in 2008, which was \u00a3603 in 2019 prices.\n\nFull-time weekly earnings were the highest in the City of London at \u00a31,052 and lowest in Newark and Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, at \u00a3431.\n\nThe number of full-time employees who experienced a real-term pay decrease fell from 43.3% in 2018 to 35.7% in 2019, the ONS said.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
