Salt it lightly then, as it comes to the boil, add 300g of frozen peas and cook for 3 minutes. Get a bowl of ice and water. Drain the peas and plunge immediately into the iced water.\n\nRemove the stems from 20g of parsley and drop the leaves into a blender. Do the same with 20g of coriander then add them, with 20 mint leaves, to the parsley. Pour in 75ml of olive oil and 25ml of white-wine vinegar. Drain the peas and tip into the blender then process to a rough, vivid green paste.\n\nTrim and lightly season 2 pieces of hake fillet weighing approximately 250g each. Warm 45g of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan that doesn\u2019t stick, then slide in the fish and cook for 3 or 4 minutes on each side until pearlescent and tinged with gold. Serve the fish immediately with the pea salsa. Enough for 2.\n\nThe trick\n\nMonitor the consistency of the pea pur\u00e9e carefully, adding more olive oil and white-wine vinegar as you wish. The texture should be somewhere between dressing and sauce. You may prefer it thicker, like a mash, in which case you should go carefully with the quantity of olive oil.\n\nThe twist\n\nUse frozen broad beans in place of the peas, cooking them in boiling water for 4 or 5 minutes, then popping them out of their skins before adding them to the processor. Keep the texture of the sauce rough by crushing it with a potato masher instead of turning it into a smooth pur\u00e9e.", "description": "Fried fish with a delicious and piquant herb-rich pea pur\u00e9e", "authors": ["Nigel Slater"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40fc4ac6d4f1b492f1210fcad1f90295b2761f72/0_1486_4968_2979/master/4968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af66f80d0b62e1d92915818a1298b32a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
