She says he is really supportive of her and the pain she has to go through, but it doesn't stop her from worrying.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hysterectomies remove all the organs affected by endometriosis\n\n\"It makes me feel like I'm a failure and not a good girlfriend,\" she says, adding that the anxiety she suffers as a result of her condition is \"debilitating\".\n\nAnother problem some women with endometriosis experience is difficulty getting pregnant.\n\nThe reasons for this are not fully understood, but is thought to be because of damage to the fallopian tubes or ovaries.\n\nSurgery to remove visible patches of endometriosis tissue can sometimes help, but there are no guarantees and it comes with the risk of complications which can include bruising around the womb and in less common, but more serious, cases organ damage.\n\nHollie really wants to have another child, but believes her chances are slim.\n\n\"We both think in our hearts it's not going to happen - we don't really talk about it because I get sad.\"\n\nImage caption Flare-ups of the condition can cause sufferers extreme pain\n\nLike Hollie, Sophie (not her real name) suffered such extreme pain she found herself unable to have sex with her partner.\n\n\"Endometriosis ruined my relationship,\" she says.\n\n\"In the bedroom, I just couldn't do it. I didn't know what the pain was and I felt like I wasn't being taken seriously.\"\n\n\"It was excruciating and he just didn't understand it.\"\n\n\"In the end, he slept with other people.\"\n\n\"Now, I'm not actively seeking a relationship because I'm worried about sex and not being able to do it.\"\n\nFor Sophie, sex can trigger a flare-up of her symptoms which she describes as \"unbearable for me and the people around me - when I'm in pain, I'm angry\".\n\nAccording to the NHS, there is currently no cure for endometriosis but a number of treatments can help with symptoms.\n\nThese include painkillers and hormone medicines, with more extreme treatments like surgery to cut away patches of endometriosis tissue or surgery to remove the womb, known as a hysterectomy.\n\nSome women choose hysterectomies as a solution to the extreme pain of endometriosis, but this means they no longer can have children.\n\nSophie suffered over a decade of pain before her endometriosis diagnosis - she's now 26.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A laparoscopy is when a surgeon passes a tube through the stomach to see if there is any endometriosis tissue\n\nThese days, the pain is so bad she thinks a hysterectomy might be her only option, although she is aware it would take away her chance to have kids of her own.\n\n\"Endometriosis could also ruin my chances of having a baby,\" she says.\n\n\"I spoke to my doctor a couple of weeks ago and he was like 'I'm going to be honest with you, you've probably got about another year to have a child'.\"\n\nIf you need help and support with endometriosis you can contact your doctor or Endometriosis UK, who are able to offer advice over the phone and online.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Young women share the impact of the condition on their relationships and fertility.", "authors": ["Annabel Rackham", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16134/production/_109102409_whatsappimage2019-10-03at17.29.54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
