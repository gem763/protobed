The firms have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and administration officials say it is time to return them to the private sector.\n\nThe plan, expected shortly after Labor Day, will outline how the administration hopes to put the companies on more-solid financial footing and return them to private-shareholder ownership. Making those changes remains politically, technically and legally difficult, and prior efforts have all sputtered.\n\nJust who are Fannie and Freddie?\n\nThe two companies, based in Washington, D.C., and McLean, Va., are government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, in government lingo. Their function is critical to U.S. housing and mortgage markets. Fannie and Freddie don\u2019t make loans, but instead buy them from banks and other lenders. They package them into securities that are sold to other investors and provide guarantees to make those investors whole should loans default.\n\nInvestor demand for the securities is strong because the companies are currently backstopped by the U.S. government. They are required to send most of their profits to the Treasury in exchange for that support.\n\nThe companies are central to the popular 30-year mortgage, which locks in steady payments for buyers.\n\nWhy do Trump officials think the firms need fixing?\n\nThe Trump administration and lawmakers in both parties generally don\u2019t believe the government should be running in effect two enormous financial companies. Administration officials want to shrink the government\u2019s involvement and return housing finance to a privately run system. Requiring the companies to have a much larger capital cushion to absorb losses would reduce taxpayer risk.\n\nWhat does it mean for your mortgage?\n\nRequiring Fannie and Freddie to hold bank-like levels of capital could force the companies to raise the fees they charge to guarantee loans, possibly leading to higher mortgage costs. Additional limitations on the types of loans they can purchase\u2014for second homes or cash-out refinancings, potentially\u2014 would push some borrowers into the private market. Private lenders may be pickier about whom they lend to and sell loans that are more expensive than those that meet Fannie and Freddie standards.\n\nAs with any government plan, much will depend on how it is implemented. Taking the lead will be Mark Calabria, Fannie and Freddie\u2019s new federal regulator, in consultation with Treasury. Mr. Calabria\u2019s term lasts until 2024, so he will be heading the overhaul even if power changes hands in early 2021.\n\nWho are the likely winners?\n\nPrivatizing the firms could be a victory for hedge funds and other investors that bet years ago on Fannie and Freddie\u2019s return to the private sector. Depending on how the government recapitalizes the companies, these investors\u2014including mutual-fund giant Capital Group Cos. and hedge funds Blackstone Group \u2019s GSO Capital Partners LP and Paulson & Co.\u2014could see windfall profits. The U.S. also could get a windfall if it elects to sell its large stake in the companies, as some investors are urging the government to do. Details for how shareholders would be treated in any privatization would likely be settled over the coming years, not necessarily in the coming Treasury report.\n\nWhose action is required?\n\nCongress would need to act on an overhaul that opens the system to new competitors and create a federal guarantee for securities issued by Fannie and Freddie\u2014as well as those issued by any new housing-finance companies. But the chances of lawmakers acting are slim. Mr. Calabria and other administration officials have the authority to act on their own to end the conservatorship, but that means working within the existing system\u2014that is, they would be stuck with Fannie and Freddie.\n\nWhat does Congress think?\n\nLawmakers in both parties may object to the administration sidestepping Congress to end the conservatorship. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) has warned the administration\u2019s forthcoming plan \u201ccould risk destabilizing the economy.\u201d Republican critics won\u2019t like that the firms\u2019 effective duopoly will remain intact if the companies are privatized administratively. \u201cIt\u2019s far preferable to do something legislatively,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum.\n\nWhat about the housing and mortgage industries?\n\nBankers, realtors and investors that purchase the companies\u2019 mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, may be reluctant to embrace any plan that ends the conservatorship without congressional involvement. They say efforts to privatize the firms administratively increases uncertainty over how the companies will be backstopped, which could ultimately raise mortgage costs.\n\n\u201cThe report is likely going to have a lot of language about embracing congressional reform and reducing the GSE footprint, which most market participants support. But if the real intent is to end conservatorship administratively, then the MBS market will react very negatively,\u201d said Michael Bright, chief executive of the Structured Finance Association.\n\nWill a full overhaul happen?\n\nIt is too soon to say. The plan is being introduced as the 2020 presidential election cycle gets under way, rarely a window for sweeping bipartisan change in Washington. Several past efforts have failed to get off the ground. While they prefer that Congress acts, Trump administration officials say they are serious about ending the conservatorship even absent congressional action. Privately they have said they would like to reduce Fannie and Freddie\u2019s loan footprint to between 30% and 40% of the market, according to people familiar with their discussions.\n\nWrite to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration is close to releasing a blueprint for overhauling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
