India's telecom industry is already struggling, so to ally with Huawei - which could provide the service at the lowest rate - is very attractive,\" he said.\n\nIndia does not have a homegrown alternative to Huawei's technology - and the company is well aware of this.\n\nMr Chen told the Economic Times newspaper that Huawei was now a vital part of India's digital ecosystem and that to exclude it at this stage would risk \"breaking\" it entirely.\n\n\"I think the loss will not only be financial but also about losing technology development,\" the newspaper quoted him as saying.", "description": "India's massive wireless market could make it critical for the future of the Chinese tech giant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11722/production/_105385417_huawei976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
