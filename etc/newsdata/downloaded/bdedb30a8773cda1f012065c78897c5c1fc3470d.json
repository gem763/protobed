It is a company with a British phone number. We will review that, but we have no reason to think that there is anything untoward in this particular matter.\u201d\n\nFacing Johnson later on in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn demanded to know whether the prime minister had initiated the review of the award, whether he would co-operate with it and whether he would refer himself to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, for investigation.\n\n\n\nJohnson did not address the Labour leader\u2019s questions, and replied: \u201cI am very proud of everything I did as mayor.\u201d\n\nWhen the Guardian called Hacker House\u2019s UK number it got through to a recorded message with a US accent that said: \u201cThank you for calling Hacker House, the receptionist will be right with you.\u201d\n\nA woman with a US accent then answered the call, but would not give her location other than saying that it was somewhere in the US. She added: \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific location information to provide. I\u2019m in an offsite location. I\u2019m not allowed to release that type of information. I\u2019m in the United States.\u201d\n\nIt has also emerged that in 2016 Arcuri admitted that Hacker House employed the hacker Lauri Love, who is wanted by the US authorities for breaking into US websites.\n\nShe told Love\u2019s extradition hearing in 2016 that she met him the previous year and at the time he worked for Hacker House from Thursday to Monday.\n\nArcuri\u2019s husband, Matthew Hickey, claimed on Twitter that the company employed several \u201cseveral British people\u201d.\n\nHacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) It was awarded for development of our portal (which is up and running, maybe that should be news?). We employe several British people who work on it. There's nothing improper about it and we have been regularly updating DCMS and working with UK government on its needs.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn, only four of the 11 employees recorded on the site are located in the UK, and one of them is Arcuri, who moved to the US last year.\n\nIn the House of Commons, Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cThe truth is our prime minister does reckless things. He is a man whose character renders him unfit for the office he holds.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson and the tech boss who called him 'Alex the Great' Read more\n\nJohnson is under increasing pressure to explain his friendship with Arcuri, whose east London flat was reportedly visited frequently by the prime minister while he was in City Hall. She also attended three overseas trade missions led by Johnson and was given tens of thousands of pounds in City Hall funds during his time as mayor.\n\nThe Sunday Times, which broke the story, said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her.\n\nThe Lib Dem MP Layla Moran tabled an urgent question asking why Hacker House received the grant this year and whether Johnson was involved in the award of the grant.\n\nReferring to his proroguing of parliament having been found to be unlawful, she said: \u201cThe fact that we are back in the Commons today is because the prime minister has been shown to ride roughshod over the laws of this land. It would indeed be disappointing if we were to find that the prime minister has form in bending the rules for personal or political gain.\u201d\n\nShe also pointed out that the \u00a3100,000 grant exceeded 50% of the company\u2019s income and thus broke one of the criteria for the scheme. She asked: \u201cWhy did officials waive the rule that the grant could not exceed 50% of the company\u2019s collective income?\u201d\n\nWarman said neither the prime minister nor any MP had lobbied for the money, but that the department had launched a review of the process.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister and his staff had no role in the awarding of this grant,\u201d he said.\n\nArcuri\u2019s company Innotech was given \u00a310,000 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation in 2013, the Sunday Times reported. Johnson was also the guest speaker at several of its events, and appeared in a Google hangout alongside Arcuri.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always happy to hang out at Innotech,\u201d the then mayor told Arcuri in 2014.\n\nA year later Arcuri won a \u00a315,000 grant under a government programme to encourage foreign entrepreneurs in the UK, the Sunday Times report alleged.\n\nThe newspaper suggested that Arcuri was initially refused permission to attend two of the trade trips because her business did not meet the eligibility criteria. But after an intervention by Johnson, she was allowed on to the missions, according to an email seen by the paper.\n\nThe Guardian disclosed that in 2014 Arcuri\u2019s company hosted a \u201ctech v brains\u201d summit in parliament that was booked by the Tory MP George Freeman, who backed Johnson in the Conservative leadership race and serves as a minister in his government.\n\nFreeman and Arcuri took part in a panel discussion at the event with entrepreneurs and policymakers about \u201cthe digital revolution\u201d. Pictures show guests enjoying drinks and pat\u00e9, tofu and mini chicken poppadom canap\u00e9s at the event. Commercial rates for a half-day event in the terrace pavilion are \u00a33,000.\n\nLen Duvall, the chair of the Greater London assembly oversight committee, has written to Johnson requesting details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri during his time in office, demanding a response within a fortnight.\n\nJohnson\u2019s successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, has ordered an inquiry into the alleged conflict of interest, asking the London fire brigade general counsel, Kathryn Robinson, to report back on the issue.", "description": "Government\u2019s claim that it verified Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s firm appears to be unravelling", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Rajeev Syal", "Simon Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4f2287aeff29be676612caa5f6b5563717b46b/405_45_855_513/master/855.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=228bee6c953c95fc1bfffaa79fd72e8e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
