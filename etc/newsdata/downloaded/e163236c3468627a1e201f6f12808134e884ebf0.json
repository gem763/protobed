Turner believes it's important that the Australian market demonstrates its own maturity through self-consolidation, rather than having all of the country's best and brightest picked off by multinationals.\n\n\"Predictably, each of the businesses that are involved in this conglomerate will retain most of their own clients, and as time passes there will be more opportunities for client sharing,\" Turner added.\n\n\"That's great for the group.\"\n\nTurner said that in the short to medium term, each of the partner firms will continue to operate as their own entity under the CyberCX banner.\n\n\"I think that's a very astute approach because it can be a nightmare trying to smash organisations together in a hurry looking for backend synergies,\" he continued.\n\n\"The capability that CyberCX brings, on paper, will be a dream come true for a huge range of mid-tier and even 'large but local' organisations, especially government.\n\n\"CyberCX has the potential to quickly establish itself as the one-stop shop that, perhaps most importantly, isn't one of the others competing in this field.\"\n\nTurner shared his views on a previous amalgamation undertaken by Australian firms and suggested a key factor for CyberCX's success will be the relationships between the founders of the firms.\n\n\"Keeping the founders all happy, all working together, and all on the same page will be absolutely critical,\" he said.\n\n\"This is where I think Alastair MacGibbon will be pivotal. Almac is an industry figurehead and has a track record of bringing almost superhuman energy to the mission.\"\n\nMacGibbon tendered his resignation from the ACSC in May, ahead of the 2019 federal election. At the time he said his plan was to return to the private sector.\n\nMacGibbon led the ACSC since January 2018, when it first became part of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), where he oversaw the transition of other parts of government into the newly-independent ASD as it became a statutory authority\n\nIn addition to being hand-picked by Turnbull to provide guidance on all things cyber, he also held the title of National Cyber Security Adviser at the Department of Home Affairs, where he was charged with the implementation of government's Cyber Security Strategy.\n\nMacGibbon also oversaw the completion of the network of Joint Cyber Security Centres (JCSC) for coordination with the private sector, a reshaping of the government's Information Security Manual (ISM), and a tightening of access controls for government systems as part of a new Essential Eight Maturity Model.\n\nPaitaridis, meanwhile, left Optus in March. Prior to Optus, he spent 13 years with Telstra and is still chairman of the Australian Information Industry Association.\n\nMORE SECURITY NEWS FROM AUSTRALIA", "description": "Former Optus Business MD John Paitaridis and government cyber veteran Alastair MacGibbon join the new company backed by private equity firm BGH Capital.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/20/9e3c2cae-0b0b-4851-a636-a7d404e49af5/thumbnail/770x578/4fb9856f26103cfcedf6ccf401636467/alastair-macgibbon-acsc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
