REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British online recipe box company Gousto will add more than 700 jobs over the next three years, it said on Tuesday, underscoring growing demand for food services that send precise ingredients for recipes directly to customers\u2019 homes.\n\nGousto said the jobs will be split between its headquarters in London and its distribution centre in Spalding, eastern central England. Hundreds of roles will be created in its technology team in data science, analytics and software engineering.\n\nThe firm\u2019s recruitment drive contrasts with major job losses in Britain\u2019s traditional retail sector over the last year, including 4,500 announced by supermarket group Tesco (TSCO.L), Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, in August.\n\nThe value of online sales in Britain\u2019s grocery industry is forecast to grow 44% to 16.7 billion pounds in the five years to 2024, according to market researcher IGD, partly driven by newer entrants to the space, such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and meal box operators such as Gousto, HelloFresh and Mindful Chef.\n\nLaunched in 2012 with four people, Gousto now has more than 500 employees. The hiring announcement follows a 30 million pound funding round in July, which took total funds raised to over 100 million pounds.\n\nGousto investors include Hargreave Hale, MMC Ventures, Unilever Ventures, Perwyn and health and cooking author Joe Wicks.", "description": "British online recipe box company Gousto will add more than 700 jobs over the next three years, it said on Tuesday, underscoring growing demand for food services that send precise ingredients for recipes directly to customers' homes.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435682390&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1K8", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
