In a lengthy interview Cuban said he owns \u201cclose to a billion dollars\u201d in Amazon shares.\n\n\u201cTo me, Amazon\u2019s the best startup in the world,\u201d Cuban said.\n\nCuban has previously said Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) have been top holdings of his for years, but the two FANG stocks have been struggling of late. Amazon shares are down 13.4% in the past year, while Netflix stock is down 28.9% in that time.\n\nFollowing a disappointing earnings report, Cuban told Benzinga in July 2016 he doesn\u2019t put too much weight on quarterly results for companies like Netflix and Amazon.\n\n\u201cI'm not worried about quarter to quarter fluctuations,\" Cuban said at the time. \"[Netflix continues] to dominate the content and consumer delivery for over the top.\"\n\nE-Commerce Can\u2019t Be Denied\n\nOn Monday, Cuban said the fact that brick-and-mortar retail bankruptcies have accelerated in 2019 is further confirmation that Amazon\u2019s e-commerce sales model is just as important as many investors had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI think traditional retailers, brick-and-mortar retailers, had hoped there would be ways to work around it, and some have found some solutions. But it\u2019s not business as usual anymore, and if you opened up a store 10 years ago when rents were significantly higher and your rents escalate, you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Cuban said on Fox Business.\n\nIn August 2018, Cuban said he owned just a handful of stocks, including Netflix, Amazon, \u201cmaybe four\u201d dividend stocks and two short positions.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nAfter more than a decade of leading the bull market higher, it\u2019s reassuring to Netflix and Amazon investors that Cuban still sees upside in both Netflix and Amazon, especially after the two stocks have performed so poorly in the past year.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
