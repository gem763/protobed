Mature, well-maintained gardens surround the home, and there\u2019s also an outdoor pool.\n\n\n\nThe home itself is one of the \u201cgrand old ladies of Darien,\u201d Mr. Milne said, adding that the family owned it for more than 70 years. Mr. Milne would often see Sulzberger Heiskell looking out onto the water from its windows. In March she died at the age of 100.\n\n\n\nSulzberger Heiskell spent a lifetime doing good works in and around New York City, according to her obituary in The New York Times. She was also a member of the Sulzberger family, which controls the Times. During her life, she led efforts to restore the city\u2019s theaters on 42nd Street, and was an advocate for local, state and national parks, among other projects.\n\n\n\nShe married Heiskell in 1965. He was chairman of Time Inc. from 1960 to 1980. During his time there, Sulzberger Heiskell came up with the idea for People magazine, according to People.com. She thought the one-page \u201cPeople\u201d segment in Time could be a standalone magazine.\n\n\n\nMore: Al Capone\u2019s New Jersey Hideaway Listed for $1.75 Million\n\nAfter Heiskell retired from Time in 1980, he lent his time and effort to projects like preserving the New York Public Library and Bryant Park.\n\n\n\nThe home was originally used in the summer by the Heiskells, and later as a more permanent residence. In fact, Heiskell died there in 2003, according to his New York Times obituary. At the time of his death, he had already transferred ownership to the president and fellows of Harvard College. The college has owned it since 1994, according to property records.\n\n\n\nMr. Heiskell was not an alum, but was elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers and, later, spent 10 years on the Harvard Corporation, one of the university's governing boards, according to his obit. Representatives from the college were not immediately available for comment.\n\n\n\nThe house has had few updates since the 1990s, but has many of the features one would expect in a home dating from 1915, including a grand entrance hall, formal living room and spacious dining room. The living space covers three floors, with smaller rooms on the top floor that was once occupied by staff.\n\n\n\nThe house also has an elevator, \u201cwhich is quite unusual,\u201d according to Mr. Milne.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Good Company: Tupperware Goes After Plastic and Food Waste\n\nMr. Milne explained the sellers are \u201cnot emotional\u201d about the deal. To that end, it\u2019s \u201cvery attractively priced.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom a discerning buyer\u2019s point of view, who is looking for location, and either wants to custom-design their own compound...or restore one of the grand old ladies, it\u2019s affordable to do either one,\u201d Mr. Milne said. \u201cAnd people that know Darien will definitely like this address.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
