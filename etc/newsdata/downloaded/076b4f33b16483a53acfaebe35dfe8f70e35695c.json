Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe prime minister rolled his eyes, and contorted his face into a rictus grin, the same final defiant act of every other humiliated little schoolboy that has ever gone before.\n\nJohnson\u2019s first parliamentary week as prime minister has had a depressing air of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. For years now, the world has had to become accustomed to an American President who governs in lies. It has had no choice but to be dragged down to his level.\n\nThat is what is now happening here. Proper politicians, proper people, must be reduced to Johnson\u2019s level. This pathetic notion, that negotiations that are not even taking place are somehow being undermined, that the threat of no deal is frightening the EU, yet is simultaneously nothing for British people to be frightened of, must actually be engaged with.\n\nClarke, predictably, was having none of it. He spelled out, in 90 electrifying seconds, why the whole thing was a sham. That Johnson seeks an election before 31 October, in which he can say has been \u201cthwarted in achieving a fantastic, beneficial Brexit deal\u201d and that only he can get one.\n\nBut nobody is falling for it. Not even Jeremy Corbyn, who by Johnson\u2019s mere presence, has been converted to a great statesman overnight.\n\nAnd Johnson is being outsmarted, at least for now. In two votes on Wednesday evening, the House of Commons stopped him taking the UK out of the EU without a deal, and they also declined to give him the election he wanted, on 15 October.\n\nAll the usual Tories could do was do what usual Tories do. They cried \u201cfrit\u201d at the Labour benches, a word of Thatcher coinage and so the gold standard round here.\n\nBut they are not frightened in the slightest. They are just not giving Boris Johnson the Brexit heist he wants, which is to say, crashing out of the EU on 31 October, without the voters being able to do a thing about it.\n\nBrexit: The Movie has been becoming an inviolable proposition for a while now, in the traditional three act structure. We have been stuck in the conflict phase for too long, with no twist coming to lead us to resolution.\n\nBut the Tory Party opting to eat itself alive might just change that.", "description": "It is well known that the Conservative Party is ruthless and vicious, with a lust for getting its own way and a sociopathic disdain for what must be crushed to get it.
