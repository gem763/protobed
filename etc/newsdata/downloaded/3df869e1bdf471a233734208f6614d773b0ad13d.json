And the fact they are dying off in droves as waters warm off the coast of Uruguay is one of the most vivid displays of the impacts of climate change.\n\nOver the past century, a mysterious blob of warm water extending from the Uruguayan coast far into the South Atlantic has heated extremely rapidly \u2014 by more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, as The Post's Chris Mooney and John Muyskens write in a must-read report.\n\nThe blob, warming at double the global average, is having serious impacts for Uruguay, a tiny South American country of fewer than 4 million people whose economy depends on the ocean to draw in tourists. The hot zone has \"driven mass die-offs of clams, dangerous ocean heat waves and algal blooms, and wide-ranging shifts in Uruguay\u2019s fish catch,\" Mooney and Muyskens write in the latest installment of The Post\u2019s series places that have warmed more than 2 degrees over preindustrial levels across the globe.\n\nThe \u201c2C\u201d regions include many already hot places, such as the Middle East, as well as large swaths of frigid Siberia and Canada.\n\nBut in the ocean off of Uruguay, the decline of yellow clams is causing upheaval for clammers who have worked the beaches there for generations.\n\n\u201cMass mortalities destroyed the populations of yellow clam\u201d over the past 10 years or so, according to marine biologist Omar Defeo, a professor at the University of the Republic in Uruguay.\n\nThat has made it harder for clammers such as Jose Rocha, whose family has harvested clams for four generations, to find many anymore.\n\n\u201cWe are in a time \u2014 I do not know what\u2019s happening \u2014 where the climate is not the same,\u201d Rocha said one April day after he and four of his family members shoveled up only four pounds of clams along the beaches at Barra del Chuy in the southeastern corner of the country.\n\nRocha is not alone in observing this trend. The world\u2019s top climate scientists, who sit on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in a recent report that bivalve species \u2014 clams, oysters, mussels and their relatives \u2014 face \u201cvery high risks\u201d of population decline if not extinction as average temperatures climb above 1.8 degrees Celsius or so of warming.\n\nBut in Uruguay, it is not all bad news \u2014 at least economically. The rarer clams are selling for nearly double what they were just six years ago.\n\nThat\u2019s because restaurants catering to tourists have begun marketing the mollusks as an authentic, high-end delicacy.\n\n\u201cPeople have discovered this,\u201d restaurateur Eduardo Marfet\u00e1n said. \u201cAnd they are addicted.\u201d\n\nStill, experts warn clammers not to go overboard in their harvesting.\n\n\u201cThe resource is in a delicate situation,\u201d Defeo said. \u201cThe stock has not been recovered, and we need to monitor the fishery constantly just to provide early warnings.\u201d\n\nRead more here:\n\nDangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world Major parts of the globe have already passed 2 degrees Celsius of warming, a Post investigation has found.

Grijalva (@RepRaulGrijalva) September 10, 2019\n\n\u2014 Congressional Democrats grill Trump officials over BLM relocation: House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) cast the the agency\u2019s controversial decision to move its Washington headquarters to Grand Junction, Colo. as an effort to hamstring government work. \"Given the lack of transparency, analysis and consultation, this appears to be nothing more than a poorly veiled attempt to dismantle a federal agency,\u201d Grijalva said.\n\nThe response: The acting director of the Bureau of Land Management defended the agency\u2019s decision. William Perry Pendley, the bureau\u2019s deputy director for policy and programs, argued the move will \u201cbetter serve the American people\u201d by shifting BLM leadership to be closer to the land that they manage.\u201d \u201cNearly every Western state will realize significant benefits from this reorganization,\u201d he said.\n\nGrijalva also asked Pendley whether the agency had looked into how many staff would quit because of the move. He responded it had not.\n\nThere's also the issue of cost: \"The costly space in Washington is $50 per square foot, compared to $32.35 in Grand Junction,\" The Post's Joe Davidson writes in a column on the reorganization. \"There also would be lower travel expenses and personnel costs.\"\n\nRepublican members of the committee also backed Pendley\u2019s remarks: Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) said he and other Republican members of the panel \u201chave long contended that the best land management decisions are made by those who live, work and raise families closest to the areas impacted. I believe this move of the Bureau of Land Management headquarters out West is long overdue and will yield tremendous results for land management.\u201d\n\nPendley also grilled on past remarks about Native Americans: Rep. Deb. Haaland (D-N.M.) also questioned Pendley about a 2009 event at which Pendley was \u201cquoted mocking American Indian religious practitioners' increasing insistence that federal lands and private property be off-limits because it's holy to them, using air quotes to punctuate 'holy.' \" Pendley responded: \u201cI was not speaking as a member of the BLM, I was speaking as a private attorney representing private clients.\u201d\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\n\u2014 EPA calls for significantly reducing animal testing: The Environmental Protection Agency announced a directive to reduce animal testing, decreasing requests and funding of mammal studies by the agency by 30 percent by 2025 and after 2035, requiring that such tests get the administrator\u2019s approval. The agency also said it would pledge $4.25 million in grants to five universities that will develop alternative experiments in the effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate animal testing, The Post\u2019s Karin Brulliard reports.\n\nThe reaction: Animal welfare groups applauded the directive, though some environmental and public health groups say animal testing is still key in determining the risk of chemicals. The Natural Resources Defense Council, for example, called the move an \u201cirresponsible plan\u201d that will depend on testing methods that \u201cmay not be sufficient for testing all chemicals.\u201d\n\nWheeler said the issue had personal significance: In 1987, he wrote a column for his college newspaper calling for the reduction of animal testing.\n\nAn electric power pole leans over the road in the Piedra Blanca area of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.

The pair had a \u201cclose personal relationship,\u201d the New York Times reports, citing prosecutors, and gifts were doled out in exchange for the FEMA official\u2019s influence to give the company an advantage. \u201cFederal authorities arrested Ahsha Tribble, FEMA\u2019s former deputy administrator for the region that includes Puerto Rico, and Donald Keith Ellison, the former president of Cobra Acquisitions, prosecutors in Puerto Rico announced,\u201d per the Times. \u201cThey were accused of conspiring to defraud the federal government, among other charges. A second FEMA employee, Jovanda R. Patterson, who worked as a deputy chief of staff in Puerto Rico under Ms. Tribble and was later hired by Cobra, was also arrested.\u201d\n\n\u2014 AGs from 10 states oppose Trump administration's proposed rule on furnaces and heaters: A group of 10 attorneys general led by New York's Letitia James submitted comments in opposition to a proposed Energy Department rule that would roll back Obama-era efficiency standards for residential gas furnaces and commercial gas water heaters. In the comments, the AGs point to the department\u2019s estimates that the 2016 standards would \u201csave commercial consumers up to $6.8 billion, and reduce CO2 emissions by 98 million metric tons over 30 years of sales.\u201d \u201cIf DOE grants the petition, the resulting delay in adopting updated standards will create missed opportunities for consumers, businesses and governments to conserve energy and reduce the economic and environmental costs of energy production and use,\u201d the comments read.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. (Nick Stoico/Concord Monitor/AP)\n\n\u2014 GOP governor bans offshore drilling: New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed a ban on oil and gas drilling off the state\u2019s coast, the latest governor to do so in a push against the Trump administration\u2019s moves to expand offshore oil drilling. \u201cNew Hampshire has a long and proud tradition of environmental stewardship, and today's action to ban oil and gas drilling off of our pristine coastline is another step in the right direction,\u201d Sununu said in a statement. \u201cWhile Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said the Trump administration has assured him that drilling would not occur off New Hampshire's 18-mile-long (30-kilometer-long) coast, he said the legislation was important to protect the waters for future generations,\u201d per the Associated Press.\n\nDAYBOOK\n\nToday\n\nThe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee holds a nomination hearing.\n\nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy holds a hearing on various legislation.\n\nThe House Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy holds a hearing on the economic impacts of climate change.\n\nEXTRA MILEAGE\n\n\u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely this was an accident\u201d: A sea turtle named Splinter was saved after he was discovered off the coast of Key Largo, Fla. impaled with a 3-foot metal rod, The Post's Kayla Epstein reports.", "description": "A mysterious ocean hot spot off the coast is warming rapidly.", "authors": ["Dino Grandoni", "Reporter Covering Energy", "Environmental Policy", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/894121b66e669be80e0cbd60c13542c1-1800-1200-70-8-3KBVXVVSLEI6TLGIDWCHXLGKOM.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
