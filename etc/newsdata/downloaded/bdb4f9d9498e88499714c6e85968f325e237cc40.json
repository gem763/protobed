Its latest attempt to galvanise the public (or 'Great Black Hope', if you will) is a bespoke dark mode built directly into Android 10. Here's how to get it on your phone.\n\nWith Android 10 rolling out to smartphones around the world, it's only a matter of time before you get the update yourself. (Er, unless you're rocking a Nokia 3310 of course. In which case, upgrade your damn phone!)\n\nThe update boasts several fun and innovate new features, including a 'Smart Reply' tool, a focus mode, gesture navigation and all new emojis including a sloth chilling in a tree. But the addition we're most keen on is Dark Theme - AKA Android's inbuilt dark mode.\n\nWhile some apps already allow you to enable this feature, Android 10 is bringing it device-wide while still leaving room for customisation. You can either tailor it to only appear on specific apps or go for a blanket, uniform look.\n\nThere are compelling reasons to enable Dark Theme that go beyond the moody name and aesthetic. As Google notes on its developer blog, the interface is easier on your eyes - especially in low light - and also helps to conserve your phone's battery life.\n\nIn the video below, Android group product manager Shenaz Zack explains how \"going dark\" benefits users.\n\nHow to enable Android 10 Dark Theme\n\nNaturally, you're going to need the latest version of Android first. If you own a Pixel device you're already sorted but other flagship Android phones should be receiving the update in due course. According to Google, most third-party flagships should have Android 10 by the end of the year.\n\nTo enable Dark Theme in Android 10, simply open Settings tap on Display and select Dark Theme. You can also swipe down to access it from the Quick Settings menu. Too easy!\n\nTo paraphrase Spinal Tap guitarist Nigel Tufnel: \"It's like, how much more dark could this be? And the answer is none. None more dark.\"\n\nIf you're still waiting on Android 10, have no fear - you can turn most of your favourite apps dark by following the steps in our guide below.", "description": "Google wants to make OS updates sexy again.
