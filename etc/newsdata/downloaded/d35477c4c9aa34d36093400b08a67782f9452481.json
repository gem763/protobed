Apple Inc. was just the latest company to come under pressure to take Beijing's side against anti-government protesters when the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Wednesday the HKmap.live app \"facilitates illegal behavior.\"\n\nThe newspaper asked, \"Is Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?\"\n\nApple said in a statement that HKmap.live was removed because it \"has been used to target and ambush police\" and \"threaten public safety.\" It said that violated local law and Apple guidelines.\n\nHong Kong soldiers issue warning to protesters\n\nHKmap.live allows users to report police locations, use of tear gas and other details that are added to a regularly updated map. Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.\n\n\"We have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\" said the Apple statement. \"This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\"\n\nA display of the app \"HKmap.live,\" designed by an outside supplier, that had been available on Apple Inc.'s online store until October 10, 2019, is seen in Hong Kong, Oct. 9, 2019.
