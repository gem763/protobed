I was one of the first passengers to start protesting because by that point I'd had just about enough.\n\n'My child had been sick for three days, the ship had poor sanitation, we spent half the time at sea and we missed a lot of what we wanted to see.\n\nJeff and Marla Sarkozi from Orange County, California, spent $20,000 on flying to the UK for the cruise, where they had booked a suite.\n\nMarla said: 'Our daughter is an attorney at a big law firm in the States and we will be discussing this issue with her.\n\n'We are communicating with other passengers via email and they are also talking about bringing a possible lawsuit against Norwegian Cruise Lines.'\n\nOne tourist claimed the crew turned off the ship's internet to stop footage of the 'near rioting' going online. Passengers later held up placards saying 'shame on you' and 'we want refunds'\n\nPassengers are seen being addressed by crew on the Norwegian Spirit. Tourists say the ship \u2013 which set off from Southampton on September 27 \u2013 failed to dock in Le Havre or Amsterdam, apparently because of high winds\n\nCindi and Tony Agelastos, who had travelled with their family from Phoenix, Arizona is also considering legal action.\n\nCindi said: 'We have over 1800 signatures from passengers with emails and phone numbers. I believe there was a maritime lawyer on board who has told my son-in-law to send him the names.'\n\nCaroline and Carlos Barbosa had spent thousands of pounds flying to Britain for the cruise from their home in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\nShaking her head, Caroline said: 'I am very disappointed, it was not good.'\n\nGary Waldron had made an even longer trip from Brisbane in Australia and as he got into a taxi said: 'I've been on cruises since I was 18-years-old and that was the worst one I've been on. I won't go back.'\n\nAnother seasoned traveller, Leo Poscablo, 68, from New York, agreed and added: 'This was my 22nd cruise and it was the absolute worst.\n\n'In that time, I've been on previous cruises in rough seas where the waves have been crashing against windows on the seventh and eighth floors sometimes breaking the glass but even then the ship has managed to dock.\n\n'Why couldn't this ship have done the same? It was big enough and I don't think the sea was that rough at all, it was really only the first few days and things settled after that.\n\nBlue shows where it travelled, red is where it should have gone via Iceland and green shows stages left to complete. It failed to dock at La Havre, Amsterdam, Reykjavik and Glasgow\n\n'Most people, certainly from the US wanted to see Amsterdam and the Icelandic fjords and we didn't see any of them.'\n\nIn what became a farcical situation, the cancelled stop in Reykjavik was replaced with a trip to Greenock, near Glasgow but the ship was refused permission to dock there, forcing the captain to head for Belfast instead.\n\nThe same had happened earlier in Amsterdam and at Le Havre in France where permission to dock was also denied.\n\nIt was as the ship was heading to Belfast earlier this week that passengers began to revolt.\n\nInfuriated by US-based operator Norwegian Cruise Line's decision to decline full refunds and offer passengers only a quarter off a future cruise, hundreds gathered in the ship's atrium.\n\nLorraine Tunzi from Anaheim in California said: 'There was a crowd of about 500 people, you couldn't move in the atrium, and many were annoyed and some demanding to speak to the captain.\n\n'Captain Teo came down and tried at least three times to speak to them, to explain to them that he had no choice as the weather was too bad.\n\n'He and his officers stood on the stairs trying to address the crowd below but each time he was completely drowned out by shouts of 'refund' and 'bull****' and other strong language.\n\nCruise passengers trudged off the ship this morning and onto a coach as some of them said that they would be consulting lawyers to try and get some of their money back over the trip\n\nPeople travelled from all over the world to take the fjords cruise. Juliana Oswald (above) came from New York with husband Jared and two-year-old son Jehu for the voyage on September 27\n\n'In the end he threw up his arms in frustration as there was nothing he could do as nobody was listening.\n\n'People stayed put for hours on end chanting 'refund' over and over in what became a kind of sit-in protest.\n\n'To be honest, I found it quite shameful as it was not the fault of the staff, who were all lovely. Weather is weather, you just have to roll with it.\n\n'Personally I had a wonderful time. Others are doing back to back cruises and are staying on board to go to the Mediterranean.'\n\nHowever Michael and Veronica Tranchina from Jupiter, Florida, say they may seek legal action against Norwegian Cruise Lines.\n\nMichael said: 'We'll have to see how things go, I'm hoping we don't get to that point and I think they'll do the right thing with giving us a refund.'\n\nVeronica added: 'I had my heart set on seeing Iceland and the fjords and was also really looking forward to Amsterdam but we ended up spending half the trip at sea.\n\n'For me, the worst part of it all was the lack of communication. We were not kept well informed at all which added to people's anger and frustration.'\n\nThe Norwegian Spirt, which launched in 1998, offers guests 17 dining options, including a steakhouse and Japanese restaurant, 12 bars and lounges, a casino, spa, theatre, fitness centre and aqua park for children.\n\nLuxury suites cost up to \u00a35,300 per person and feature a living room, dining room and separate bedroom, as well as a 24-hour butler and concierge service. Prices for cabins start at \u00a31,799 for 'inside' rooms, rising to more than \u00a32,000 for rooms with an ocean view and balcony.\n\nA spokesman for Norwegian Cruise Line said: 'Norwegian Spirit was forced to cancel her call to Greenock due to weather conditions as well as a delay caused by a departing Navy vessel that experienced a technical malfunction.'", "description": "Around 2,000 disappointed Norwegian Spirit holiday-makers arrived back in Southampton today from their two-week tour of the fjords after stopovers to Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Le Harve were cancelled.", "authors": ["James Fielding For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19583186-0-image-a-27_1570790307908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
