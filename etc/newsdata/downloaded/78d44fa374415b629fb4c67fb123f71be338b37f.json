He also said during the meeting that firing FBI Director James B. Comey the previous day had relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him.\n\nA memorandum summarizing the meeting was limited to a few officials with the highest security clearances in an attempt to keep the president\u2019s comments from being disclosed publicly, according to the former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters\u2026\n\n[T]he three former officials with knowledge of the remarks said some memos of the president\u2019s communications were kept from people who might ordinarily have access to them. The Lavrov memo fit that description, they said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security"], "top_image": ""}
