The Liberal Democrats whose conference opens this weekend in Bournemouth are on 16% (down one), and the Brexit party is also unchanged on 13%.\n\nThe polling \u2013 conducted after Johnson shut down parliament for five weeks last Tuesday, and Scottish judges subsequently ruled his action to have been unlawful \u2013 shows the Conservatives are continuing to consolidate their support among leave voters.\n\nAmong this group, 55% said they would now vote Conservative in a general election, the highest figure since February. Almost a fifth (19%) of Labour leave voters are now intending to vote Conservative, suggesting views on Brexit are determining voters\u2019 choice more than traditional party loyalties.\n\nThe poll suggests many voters are unclear about Labour\u2019s Brexit stance while the Liberal Democrats are seen as having an unambiguous policy.\n\nDespite losing six consecutive votes in the Commons in the past fortnight Johnson has a far higher net approval rating for his handling of Brexit than Jeremy Corbyn. While 37% approve of the prime minister\u2019s handling of Brexit against 43% who disapprove, only 17% approve of Corbyn\u2019s handling of the issue, against 60% who disapprove.\n\nAsked for their view about whether Johnson had been right to suspend parliament for five weeks, voters were split. Some 34% said they supported the prime minister\u2019s move, while 35% opposed it.\n\nAdam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said despite the judgement from Scottish judges which suggested Boris Johnson had misled the Queen over prorogation, the effect on his reputation among voters appeared to have been minimal.\n\n\u201cThe Tories\u2019 mission to mop up the leave vote at a faster rate than they lose liberal remain-leaning voters is continuing to show dividends with the largest lead over Labour since the 2017 election,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong Brexit party voters, he said approval of Boris Johnson was far higher than Jeremy Corbyn at 71% compared with 2%. While among Liberal Democrat voters, approval of the Labour leader was only marginally better than the prime minister at 13% compared with 6%.", "description": "Boris Johnson also has a far higher net approval rating for his handling of Brexit than Jeremy Corbyn", "authors": ["Tali Fraser"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fac8ad4c34c160ef37348bead0595c7d41046b/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fa7954f3d68f463b56f5bb034b57e20", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
