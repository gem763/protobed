They think so | CBC News", "language": "en", "text": "A group of about two dozen high school students from Sunchild First Nation along with their industrious social studies teacher have been sending videos to Ellen DeGeneres trying to convince her to send her easily-spooked executive producer, Andy Lassner, to visit their homemade haunted house \u2014 after being inspired by the show's annual tradition.\n\nEllen has been sending Lassner to haunted houses for several years during the Halloween season \u2014 often with a Hollywood star sidekick. Lassner's heart-stopping and often curse-filled reactions are filmed and then posted on YouTube.\n\nKjeryn Bateman, a senior high social studies teacher for the Sunchild First Nation School, said she started watching Lassner's videos in university when she needed a good laugh.\n\nWhen she started working on the First Nation, located near Rocky Mountain House, in 2016, she decided to use the videos to inspire her students to work together to make their own haunted house and spook community members.\n\nTeacher Kjeryn Bateman tries to show her students what they are capable of \u2014including asking Ellen DeGeneres to visit their haunted house on the Sunchild First Nation. (Colleen Underwood/CBC)\n\n\"I've had students that previously didn't talk so much in class or you know weren't really involved as much and to see them like bond with other students make new friendships and then just to see them take charge in different events is just amazing,\" said Bateman.\n\nThree years later the First Nation's haunted houses have become more elaborate, the crowds and the number of students involved have grown, and what once was just a Halloween event has evolved into year-round community building.\n\nSo, Bateman urged the students to invite Lassner this year on Twitter \u2014 by producing more than 30 videos that showcase the First Nation and their haunted house with several Ellen-related hashtags, so they could thank him.\n\nAnd spook him, of course.\n\n\"It would be cool if he came here because normally he goes like these huge Hollywood ones and they've got professional actors and makeup and like huge amazing sets and they look awesome,\" said Bateman, where admittedly she said their house is homemade, with a lot of dollar-store purchases.\n\nLillie Makinaw, 16, likes to scare the little kids in the school's haunted house. She hopes to scare Andy Lassner, too. (Colleen Underwood/CBC)\n\nHaunting success\n\nUnder Bateman's guidance, an ever-larger group of Grade 10 to 12 students belong to a leadership council who meet twice a week.\n\nThey come up with a theme for the haunted house, design it, make the props and costumes, act in it and tour other students and community members through the dark maze.\n\nThis year's theme is Hollywood Horror which includes elements from a variety of horror movies including Scream, Saw, The Ring and American Horror Story.\n\nDusteen Bigchild says being part of the school's leadership council, that designs the school's annual Haunted House, teaches her to be kind and a role model. (Colleen Underwoood/CBC)\n\n\"Most of my friends are in leadership so it's always fun to scare little kids with them,\" said Lillie Makinaw, 16.\n\nAfter the success of their first haunted house, which had a clown theme, the teens began to host more events such as a Thanksgiving dinner, a Valentine's dance, and an Easter egg hunt.\n\nThey also run the canteen at community bingos and special after school events where the entire K-12 school is split up into different teams with Cree animal names.\n\nBateman said the school spirit is needed for the community that usually attracts media attention for more traumatic and disturbing events.\n\nGrade 12 student Dusteen Bigchild has been with the leadership council since it started.\n\n\"I love everything about leadership [council],\" said Bigchild.\n\n\"We wouldn't be who we are today and we wouldn't know anything about being a role model, a leader and kind to one another.\"\n\nBateman said it's been a joy watching her students come out of their shell and spread their new-found joy around the greater community.\n\nEven if Lassner doesn't show up, students say it's been a lot of fun rallying together, making and posting videos to try to get him to come.\n\n\"Everything we've done because of this so far, like building a bigger haunted house than ever, and making all these videos going to all these things and even having CBC News come, this is such an opportunity for all of us that even if Ellen doesn't even notice us we've had a blast \u2026 if she does come it will be the cherry on the cake,\" said Trinity Hoover, Grade 11 student.\n\nThe Hollywood Horror haunted house is open to the public.", "description": "Students at the Sunchild First Nation are hoping to see The Ellen DeGeneres Show's executive producer Andy Lassner on Oct. 30 when they open their Hollywood Horror themed haunted house to the public. They've produced more than 30 videos inviting Lassner in the hopes he'll say yes.
