Adam Schiff, liberals have prepared a charade that will only delegitimize the process.\n\nFirst, to dispense with a recurring liberal myth: While dramatic, Team Trump\u2019s action is hardly \u00adunprecedented. In 2012, the Obama White House \u00adrejected congressional subpoenas related to the investigation into the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal.\n\nUnlike the scandal surrounding President Trump\u2019s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, whose potential consequences are wholly political, the Fast and Furious program led to the deaths of American law enforcement officers and dozens of Mexican nationals.\n\nYet Team Obama called the probe \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed that the White House didn\u2019t have to cooperate with GOP demands. When the \u00adRepublican majority voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failure to cooperate, Pelosi walked off the House floor in protest.\n\nNow Pelosi would have you believe the impeachment attempt she is pursuing isn\u2019t political theater, and the White House is acting lawless by not participating.\n\nWhat\u2019s really unprecedented is this: House Democrats are pursuing impeachment without holding a vote to authorize an official impeachment inquiry. Impeachment is a political, not legal, process, and Democrats can rewrite the rules if they like. But the more political impeachment becomes, the more it justifies a political response from the White House, and the less credibility impeachment will have with the public.\n\nThe reasons for not holding a vote on opening an impeachment inquiry appear to be self-interested and craven, which only underscores the White House\u2019s point. Authorizing an impeachment inquiry would give the Republican minority the right to call its own witnesses and otherwise participate in the investigation. And it would impose political accountability on House Democrats in swing districts that went for Trump in 2016.\n\nHouse Democrats are also floating the idea of keeping the whistleblower\u2019s identity a secret, even though the Intelligence Community inspector general has noted that the whistleblower has \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival political candidate\u201d to Trump. A more recent report by The Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York quotes sources saying the whistleblower has a \u201cworking relationship\u201d with a current 2020 Democratic candidate.\n\nTelling the president he can\u2019t face his accuser is unlikely to convince the public that this process is in any way fair.\n\nThen there is Schiff, whom Pelosi has put in charge of the \u00adimpeachment efforts. The integrity of the man leading this process isn\u2019t a trivial matter, and Schiff has distinguished himself for untrustworthiness.\n\nSchiff has already been caught lying on TV about staffers on his own intelligence committee being in contact with the Ukraine-call whistleblower before the formal complaint that led to the current impeachment efforts was filed.\n\nSchiff\u2019s conduct during the Russia investigation was also unbecoming of a member of Congress. He acquired a deserved reputation for saying outrageous, unsupportable things about the investigation on cable news. During Trump\u2019s first year in office, a GOP news release noted Schiff spent 20 hours, 44 minutes and 49 seconds on television.\n\nSchiff\u2019s office has also been \u00adnotorious for leaking. In 2017, CNN, NBC and CBS all erroneously \u00adreported that Donald Trump Jr. had been sent the hacked DNC Wikileaks emails in advance, potential proof of \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia. It turned out the date on the email was wrongly reported. Trump Jr. got the emails after they were already public and had done nothing wrong.\n\nWhen asked about the source of this leak, a spokesman for Adam Schiff offered a non-denial denial, telling Politico \u201cthat neither he nor his staff leaked any \u2018non-public information\u2019 \u201d about Trump Jr.\n\nGiven the bad faith and lack of transparency and due process that have characterized this impeachment drive, opponents of the president will once more end up violating more important norms than Trump stands accused of disregarding.\n\nImpeachment is a gravely serious step to take, as it threatens to overturn the will of voters. So far, Democrats aren\u2019t taking the impeachment process seriously. So they should not be surprised that Trump isn\u2019t taking it seriously, either.\n\nMark Hemingway is a senior writer at RealClearInvestigations.
