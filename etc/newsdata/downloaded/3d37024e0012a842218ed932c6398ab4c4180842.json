That leaves just 5 percent of the games going to mobile as \u201cpremium\u201d titles, the word used to describe often big-budget games that sell for a single set price upfront. That\u2019s down from 25 percent just five years ago, Nelson added.\n\nAD\n\nThat fundamental shift from releasing mostly single-price games back at the inception of the App store to today\u2019s model of releasing mostly games that make money off purchases in a free game or through advertising, was driven by pure economics, both Nelson and Ghodrati said.\n\n\u201cPublishers have found that free-to-play has ended up providing the largest return on their investment,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThat shift away from premium has been a boon to publishers, enabling a majority of them to grow their profit from their mobile division tremendously.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut, the result hasn\u2019t always been received well by those playing those games. While clearly, a vast majority of mobile players are willing to spend the money, it still can be seen as something bad for fans of deeper, more involved games.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle for those sorts of games to monetize effectively in stores,\u201d Ghodrati said. \u201cBut with this new type of gaming ecosystem, there\u2019s a chance to expand that pie and drawn in more people willing to develop those sorts of games.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because under the services, Apple and Google are divvying up some of the money they bring in through the subscription to the game developers. By bundling games together, it\u2019s possible to entice players in a way that hasn\u2019t really been tried before on mobile.\n\nApple Arcade\u2019s current offering is about 85 games \u2014 with the promise of more than 100 within the month \u2014 for that one monthly fee. Anyone in the family has access to those games, which can also be downloaded and played offline. Google has more than 350 apps, about two-thirds of which are games. All of those apps can be downloaded and are available to the entire family, as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAustin Shoemaker, group product manager for Google Play Pass, said that the company believes the pass will empower developers to create great experiences.\n\n\u201cOur biggest focus is making sure the developer is successful,\u201d he added.\n\nHeikki Repo, creative director on the Zelda-like \u201cOceanhorn 2\u201d \u2014 which hit the Apple Arcade at launch, sees the Apple Arcade as a chance to stop what he describes as an eight-year erosion of premium games on mobile.\n\n\u201cWe think that Apple Arcade is a great way to reach out to developers who are willing to create meaningful, classic video games and support them,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe many Apple Arcade titles are games you would see on consoles.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile it\u2019s still too early to tell how both mobile gaming subscription services will do, analysts believe that the subscription model is likely here to stay and perhaps to grow on mobile.\n\nAD\n\nDan Sherman, co-founder and CEO of GameClub, is betting on that too. GameClub, which is set to launch on Apple\u2019s App Store on Oct. 24 for $4.99 a month and later this fall on Google Play, is a third subscription service coming to phones.\n\nWhere Google and Apple\u2019s subscriptions focus on current or new games, GameClub is a service set to deliver \u201cclassic\u201d mobile games, updated to run on current phones for its monthly fee.\n\n\u201cWhat we are offering is a greatest hits catalogue of mobile games from over the past decade,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cGameClub is bringing those games back to life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs with Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass, GameClub will strip out all ads and in-app purchases, instead making all of its money off that monthly charge.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great what Apple and Google are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we all acknowledge that this is the future of premium games. That upfront cost before you download the game has become an impenetrable block to buying a game. Those single-cost games have gone the way of the .99-cent song.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSubscription is a better fit for premium game content. All three of us acknowledge that the world of games needs an alternative to freemium and its manipulative purchases and aggressive ads.\u201d\n\nBrian Crecente is a freelance writer who has written for The Guardian, Paste Magazine, Wired Magazine, and elsewhere.
