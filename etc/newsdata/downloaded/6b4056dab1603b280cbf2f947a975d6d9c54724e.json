For \u201cdelay\u201d read \u201cend\u201d. The cabinet had made it clear that it could not support this device for asking parliament to vote for a fourth time on her Brexit deal.\n\nThus she has evacuated the last ditch defending her leadership from the oncoming hordes. The only matter to be decided now is the timetable for replacing her.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

More likely, she will try to put it off until next week, when the results of today\u2019s elections are known, or to the week after, when parliament returns to Westminster. She will welcome Donald Trump on his state visit that week, and she will probably represent the UK at the G20 in Japan at the end of June. But it seems that the Conservative Party is determined to have a new prime minister in 10 Downing Street by the time parliament rises for the summer recess in about the third week of July.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader? 1/9 Boris Johnson Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously stood in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal. He remains a darling of the party's right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory voters but his leadership bid would be fiercely opposed by many MPs PA 2/9 Michael Gove Environment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He has lately been known for rousing his party in the commons, his recent speeches on the Brexit deal and Labour's no confidence motion have overshadowed the Prime Minister's. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister, partly to shed his reputation as a backstabber who abandoned Boris Johnson to stand against him in the 2016 leadership election Getty 3/9 Dominic Raab Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. He displayed a grip on detail in his role as Brexit secretary. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied \"never say never\" Getty 4/9 Rory Stewart International development secretary Rory Stewart is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, promising to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He was only recently promoted to the cabinet, previously serving as prisons minister, where he caught headlines with a pledge to resign if he could not reduce levels of violence within a year PA 5/9 Esther McVey The former work and pensions secretary announced that she will be standing for the leadership when May leaves. McVey is the first to explicitly state that she intends to stand. She resigned from the cabinet in protest over May's Brexit deal AFP/Getty 6/9 Sajid Javid Home secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a \"major incident\" and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. Son of a bus driver, he wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobility PA 7/9 Jeremy Hunt Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race as he could sell himself as the man to unite the party. Critics worry that his long stint as health secretary could return to haunt him at a general election. He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadership PA 8/9 Andrea Leadsom Following the Prime Minister's second defeat over her Brexit deal, Leader of the house Andrea Leadsom hosted a dinner party at which \"leadership was the only topic of conversation\", The Times heard. Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime Minister AFP/Getty 9/9 Priti Patel Former international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender.

Any candidate to replace Ms May would presumably declare their willingness to leave the EU without a deal.\n\nBut this \u2013 apart from being unwise \u2013 would be opposed by a majority of the House of Commons. Would Boris Johnson, say, seek office on a pledge to try to defy parliament?\n\nWe think not. That means a new prime minister would have to find another way. A general election is not an attractive option for the Conservative Party. It would be a delusion too far to imagine that it would produce a clear majority in the Commons for a no-deal exit.\n\nIn the end, the only way out of the impasse is another referendum \u2013 and we expect that whoever succeeded Ms May would be driven inexorably in this direction. There is a paradox in this, in that it was her plan to allow the Commons to vote on a referendum that helped finally to kill her withdrawal agreement bill.\n\nBut it may be, as Nixon went to China, that only a new prime minister who actually voted Leave three years ago could legislate for a new referendum. This is not without risk for those who want the UK to stay in the EU. In order to be respected as legitimate, a referendum would have to include a no-deal exit as one of the options, as even Tony Blair accepted this week.\n\nWhether the House of Commons would allow that is an open question, but it may be that the risk that the country might vote for such an outcome is the price that has to be paid for the chance of cancelling Brexit.", "description": "As the nation voted in the European elections, the Conservative Party turned to the question in which it is most deeply interested: who will be the next prime minister and when?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/22/23/theresa-may.jpg"}
