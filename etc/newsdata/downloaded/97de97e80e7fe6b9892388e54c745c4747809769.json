They think they can do whatever they want because they\u2019re travelling but it\u2019s an insult to the country they\u2019re visiting,\u201d one user replied.\n\nLoud disturbances are relatively rare on Japanese public transport, where people avoid taking or making phone calls, keep their music quiet, and carry on conversations discreetly.\n\nThere are exceptions, including late-night trains where drunken salarymen can sometimes be seen yelling at passengers or each other.\n\nBut even the morning commuter crush, when millions find themselves squished together on packed trains, sometimes throwing elbows to grab a spot, tends to be conducted silently, albeit through gritted teeth.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t do this. You\u2019re in Japan\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe human pyramid is not the only instance attracting attention, with other viral videos showing French fans seated on a carriage floor passing a crowd-surfing friend overhead, or supporters singing loudly.\n\nAnd one widely viewed video shows a group of fans, some in Scotland and England shirts, playing rugby on a train, passing around a yellow ball and mock-tackling each other.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this. You\u2019re in Japan,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\n\u201cYou should visit a foreign country only after studying about it,\u201d added another.\n\nBut others have brushed off the incidents, with one saying the mock rugby match \u201clooks fun\u201d.\n\nDomestic media have picked up on the controversy, with one even airing a segment entitled: \u201cTrains are dangerous with rugby fans!\u201d\n\nJapanese officials stress that rules in place against disturbing other passengers are intended to keep everyone safe and comfortable.\n\n\u201cWe hope that many foreigners take part in the sporting festivities during the Rugby World Cup this year and the Olympics next year, but for us the most important thing is to ensure their safety,\u201d Mineo Matsui, director for community safety at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe understand that they are excited and they want to show it, but they need to know how to control themselves.\u201d\n\nBy and large, any criticism has been vastly outweighed by positive coverage and sentiment towards the tournament, the hosts and the visiting teams and fans.\n\nVenues have been packed out, even for fixtures with bottom-ranked teams, and Japan\u2019s shock victory over Ireland has sent excitement soaring.\n\nMeanwhile, foreign teams have won plaudits for adopting Japanese customs, including bowing to fans after games and tidying their changing rooms.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Crowd-surfing, human pyramids and rugby practice \u2014 boisterous behaviour by fans on Japanese trains has stirred some criticism as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/136f4b_is-annoying-boisterous-rugby-fans-test-patience-in-japan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
