They couldn\u2019t get Trump on collusion. I mean we all knew that, though the media peddled this myth for two years. The report from Robert Mueller totally debunked the unverified and politically biased Steele dossier, aka Trump dossier, which was used by the FBI to secure spy warrants on Trump officials. There was no evidence for their biggest case for impeaching this president solely for the reason that he won the 2016 election. So, they had to wait. Alas, the Trump-Ukraine call this summer. The president allegedly coerced the Ukrainian leadership into opening a corruption probe into Hunter Biden and threatened to withhold military aid. Gasp! Some anonymous whistleblower who is reportedly a CIA agent came forward with this complaint. He didn\u2019t listen in on the call but got it from second and third-hand accounts. So, when the Trump White House released the transcript, it shouldn\u2019t shock us that all of the major allegations were debunked. There was no quid pro quo. There couldn\u2019t have been since the Ukrainians weren\u2019t even aware that aid was being reviewed until a month after the call.\n\nThe point is there\u2019s no quid. The Ukrainians were the ones who brought up the Biden tie-in and the \u201cfavor\u201d that Trump was asking related to assistance in the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation into the origins of the Russia collusion probe. That\u2019s not illegal.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Kenneth Vogel made this point\u2014and it pretty much exposes the whole Trump-Ukraine circus as a nothing burger, just like the collusion nonsense. And shocker\u2014no one is really highlighting that point, as The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kimberley Strassel noted:\n\nThe Ukrainians weren't made aware that the assistance was being delayed/reviewed until more than one month after the call. https://t.co/qDJ3FT261a \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 25, 2019\n\nThis sort of seems like a really big deal--and from a few days ago. And yet, funny, nobody is highlighting it..... https://t.co/mUJuyCbbH5 \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 27, 2019\n\nIf true and confirmed, a quid pro quo is literally impossible. There\u2019s no quid. https://t.co/hfU2yg26xX \u2014 Luke Thompson (@ltthompso) September 27, 2019\n\nThe Democrats needed to get the impeachment nonsense going. It was a 2018 campaign promise. The Democratic base wants this\u2014and time was running out. With this narrative more gutted that the collusion myth, this impeachment push isn\u2019t going anywhere in the GOP Senate. There will be no conviction. The GOP base will be animated. Independent voters will shy away. And Democrats will have nothing to show for their two-year House majority other than political games while blasting a booming economy that they\u2019re trying to destroy with far-left economic policies from their favorite mixologist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.", "description": ".09/27/2019 20:55:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ae45da6a-b461-4e5b-a13e-6ed2ef1761a4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
