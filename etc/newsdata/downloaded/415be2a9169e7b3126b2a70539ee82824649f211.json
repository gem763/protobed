The process had been expected to produce a single motion for approval by the party at a vote on Monday, but there was not a consensus and two motions were proposed instead.\n\nThey will both be put to a vote on Monday, and it is possible both could be approved, adding uncertainty to a Brexit stance that polling shows many voters already find confusing.", "description": "Britain's Labour Party will on Monday decide between two possible Brexit policies: to campaign to remain in the European Union at a second referendum or defer a decision on what stance to take until after an election, a Labour source said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
