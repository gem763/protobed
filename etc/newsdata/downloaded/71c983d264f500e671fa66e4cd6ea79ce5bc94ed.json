If the nation does not care for my security then why should I care for national security?'\n\nUnder the 1989 Act, a disclosure is considered damaging if it 'damages the capability' of the Armed Forces, leads to loss of life or injury to its personnel, or endangers UK interests abroad.\n\nAn investigation by the Met's Counter Terrorism Command was launched after the alleged offence 'on or around October 28 last year'.\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We are aware of proceedings involving an individual who has been charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act.\n\n'This is a police matter and questions should be addressed to them.'\n\nFinch has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court tomorrow, October 9.", "description": "Simon Finch (pictured), 49, of Swansea, South Wales, is accused of a 'damaging disclosure' of defence information in October last year, Scotland Yard said.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19463442-0-image-a-17_1570570348269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
