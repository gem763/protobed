REUTERS\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick-off is at 8pm.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, and can be streamed online via the BT app.\n\nTeam news\n\nInitial fears of an injury to Son Heung-min, after the forward was withdrawn early during Spurs\u2019 win over Southampton, have been dampened meaning new signings Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon remain the only two players unavailable to Pochettino.\n\nBayern are missing both leon Goretzka and Jann-Fiete Arp through injury, while Ivan Perisic is also a doubt after missing Bayern\u2019s victory at Paderborn through illness. David Alaba has completed his injury recovery and could return to the starting eleven.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nTottenham: Lloris; Sanchez, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies; Ndombele, Winks, Sissoko; Eriksen; Son, Kane\n\nBayern: Neuer; Pavard, Sule, Boateng, Alaba; Kimmich, Thiago; Gnabry, Coutinho, Coman; Lewandowski\n\nPrediction\n\nTottenham 1-3 Bayern Munich\n\nDespite a number of iffy performances to start the season, Spurs will raise their level against Bayern and have shown on numerous occasions that they are capable of holding their own against such opposition. However, with the added threat of Coutinho, and Lewandowski in such spectacular form, Bayern should come out on top in a wide-open attacking game.", "description": "Last year\u2019s beaten Champions League finalists, Tottenham Hotspur, welcome Bayern Munich to north London on Tuesday evening knowing the result could have a huge implication on who takes top-billing in group B.
