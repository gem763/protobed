I have just got back from holiday and it looks worse now as the skin around it is darker.\u2019\n\nPeereboom left the stranger with a permanent scar and needed three months of Tetanus injections (Picture: Hyde News & Pictures).\n\nThe court heard that as well as the difficulties with the lawyer, Peereboom\u2019s living situation would make it hard to complete unpaid work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dutch-born woman ordinarily stays in Harlesden, north-west London, but is currently living in Amsterdam with friends, meaning she would have to return to the UK every weekend.\n\nMr Quinton said: \u2018The defendant\u2019s understanding of an overnight coach to the UK every weekend to do the hours was that she does not need to spend any money other than the \u00a38 coach fare \u2013 there seems to be a lack of understanding of the practicalities.\n\n\u2018The court needs to understand that it is dealing with somebody with a traumatic brain injury.\u2019\n\nReading Crown Court heard how Peereboom refused to talk with her lawyer (Picture: Google)\n\nAdjourning sentence, Judge Sarah Campbell told Peereboom: \u2018I feel I am left with not many options.\n\n\u2018You are 23 years of age and you were found guilty of assault by beating and causing actual bodily harm while on a busy train, which in my view, was deeply unpleasant and animalistic.\n\n\u2018Your sarcastic demeanour could be seen on the CCTV footage as you pulled a victim\u2019s hair hard and removed it from her head in clumps.\n\n\u2018What ensued can only be described as a scrum and you lost control of yourself.\n\n\u2018Ms Marabet was trying to get past you when her leg was bitten causing a permanent scar and needing tetanus jabs.\u2019\n\nThe judge said she would consider a previous warning to Peereboom in 2011 for biting a police officer when she was 15, and her difficult upbringing, having been put in care at the age of 14.\n\nJudge Campbell also said there could be exceptional circumstances to defer sentencing for two months to allow Peereboom to either to find a place to live in the UK or get a job to pay compensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeereboom listed as an actress, model, dancer and choreographer on online talent agency platform StarNow, where she states she is an \u2018outgoing person who loves fashion, keeping fit and doing her makeup\u2019.\n\nThe Internet Movie Database carries no listing for Peereboom.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
