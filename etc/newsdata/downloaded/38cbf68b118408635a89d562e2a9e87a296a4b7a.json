The Straits Times\n\nThe Government is building new cycling paths in the Changi district.\n\nThey will let pedestrians, cyclists and PMD users reach Changi Airport Terminal 5 from as far as Tampines and East Coast.\n\nNew and widened roads will also help ease congestion and give drivers more ways to reach the airport.\n\nThese measures will complement 4 upcoming stations on the Cross Island Line.\n\nPreviously accessible by only car, train or bus due to the expressways surrounding it, Changi Airport will soon be reachable on foot or bike from as far as East Coast and Tampines, the Land Transport Agency (LTA) announced on Wednesday (Sept 18).\n\nIn addition, drivers will have new ways to reach the airport via the ECP or Tanah Merah Coast Road.\n\nLTA said it aims to build and widen roads and paths in the Changi district from next year onward, to complement four upcoming stations on the new Cross Island Line.\n\nIt is looking to create two corridors in Changi, named the Northern and Southern Corridor, the majority of which will be completed by 2026.\n\nThe remainder will be completed by 2029, it added.\n\nThe Northern Corridor will include a viaduct between Tampines Expressway and Loyang Way \u2013 which will ease traffic on congested roads like Loyang Avenue \u2013 bus lanes in both directions, and 3 kilometres of cycling paths along Loyang Avenue, Telok Paku Road, Nicoll Drive, Changi Coast Road and Aviation Park Road.\n\nThe Southern Corridor will have new roads linking the airport to the ECP and Tanah Merah Coast Road, a reconfigured Changi Flyover and Tanah Merah Flyover, and wider PIE, ECP and Xilin Avenue roads.\n\nIn addition, 3.5 kilometres of new cycling paths will let pedestrians, cyclists and personal mobility device users reach Changi Airport\u2019s Terminal 5 building from Tampines and East Coast via Park Connectors.\n\nTo do so, LTA is acquiring land in the area owned by Laguna National Golf and Country Club and JTC Corporation. No main building structures sit on this land, it added.\n\nThe agency said it will call tenders by the end of this year for both corridors.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - These developments will complement 4 upcoming stations on the Cross Island Line..
