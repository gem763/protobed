In his two prior speeches on the topic after news broke Sept. 20 that Trump may have improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, Biden was more circumspect and mentioned impeachment but didn\u2019t directly say Trump should be impeached.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump responded quickly on Twitter to Biden.\n\n\u201cSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment \u2014 and I did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cJoe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d\n\nTrump also tweeted a video of a new attack ad against Biden that\u2019s less misleading than a prior TV spot that some cable news companies refused to air as a result.\n\nThe new ad points out that Biden, as vice president, withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine in 2014 in accordance with U.S. policy as long as the nation did not fire its prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin recently signed an affidavit claiming he was fired because he was leading a corruption probe into a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, that had hired Hunter Biden.\n\nUnmentioned by the ad: Shokin was widely viewed as corrupt by multiple governments \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 and his investigation into Burisma company had, according to other Ukrainian officials, stalled long before the gas company hired Biden\u2019s son. Also, Shokin\u2019s affidavit was filed in an unrelated court case brought by lawyers supporting Trump in a case involving his convicted former campaign manager.\n\nBiden didn\u2019t get into all of those details in his Wednesday speech as he laid out a case asserting that Trump is a well-known liar. He then turned to the president\u2019s accusations against himself and his son Hunter, saying Trump had asked the president of Ukraine to probe his son\u2019s business dealings in the country because he badly feared facing Biden in a general election. Biden defended his son, saying news reports had independently knocked down allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no truth in his charges against me or my son \u2014 zero,\u201d the former vice president said.\n\nBiden also defended his own role in the firing of the former Ukraine prosecutor, saying he did it with the backing of the United States and its allies.\n\nBiden laid out a case that Trump\u2019s actions were unprecedented for a U.S. president, including calling for \u201ccivil war,\u201d suggesting that a whistleblower had committed treason, and for obstructing the House\u2019s impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cHe believes the entire U.S. government can be corrupted to further his personal, political needs,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden received a measure of unexpected cover Wednesday from the conservative journalist who laid the foundations for the attack against Hunter Biden for his Ukrainian and Chinese contracts wrote a New York Times op-ed that indicated no laws were broken.\n\n\u201cWhat Hunter Biden Did Was Legal \u2014 And That\u2019s the Problem,\u201d read the headline of the op-ed written by Pete Schweizer.\n\nDemocrats pushed back against the piece by pointing out Schweizer failed to mention how President Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, received trademark approvals from China at the same time her father was negotiating trade deals with the country.\n\nInitially, Biden met Trump\u2019s attacks on his son with a measured response in two speeches.\n\nIn his first speech days after the Ukraine news broke, Biden on Sept. 24 only said the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d once and said it should be used if the president obstructs an investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment,\u201d Biden said in his second speech on the topic Oct. 2 . \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Biden\u2019s campaign made sure to stay focused on policy initiatives, releasing proposals concerning gun control and education, without focusing too much on impeachment.\n\nBut the drumbeat within the Democratic Party for impeachment has grown louder in recent weeks as more details surrounding the president\u2019s calls for several foreign nations to investigate a potential rival have emerged.\n\nOn Wednesday, the crowd of about 100 people was subdued when Biden first took the stage. But it livened up at Biden\u2019s mocking of Trump as a well-known liar and Biden\u2019s jeers at Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney who has given rambling and conspiratorial interviews that have even embarrassed some of Trump\u2019s closest supporters.\n\nWhen Biden snidely remarked that Giuliani was a man of great \u201cintegrity,\u201d people in the room loudly laughed and cheered. Biden again had the room laughing when he poked at Trump for refusing to release his taxes. Biden then turned more serious.\n\n\u201cWhere are his taxes?\u201d Biden said again to big applause, noting he had released 21 years of his taxes. \u201cWhat\u2019s he hiding? What\u2019s he afraid of? What\u2019s buried in those returns?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/583/1155968404_6093507521001_6093506906001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
