I live alone and own 12 of them in various sizes. Why does one person need a family\u2019s worth of mugs? That\u2019s for me and my therapist to figure out!\n\nOpen up your cabinet and you may find a hodgepodge of faded and chipped mugs you\u2019ve acquired over the years from airport souvenir stands and well-meaning friends who needed a last-minute gift. Imagine opening up that same cabinet and seeing the beautiful twinkle of clear, crisp glass! This could be your life! Skeptical? Don\u2019t worry, there are sizes, styles and shapes for everyone.\n\nCantina Glass Mug, $5 at CB2: I love these mugs so much. They look delicate but are very sturdy. These are not double insulated though, so if you need your coffee or tea to stay extremely hot for a long time, this is not the mug for you. You can buy these individually or as a set of 8 for $35.\n\nCantina Espresso Cup, $4 at CB2: A couple of years ago, my mom gave me a mini Nespresso machine for my birthday. It\u2019s the best gift anyone has ever given me. I use it every single day! You know what made it even better? These clear espresso cups!\n\nParkBrew Double Walled Glass Mugs, $24 on Amazon: These double-walled mugs have the clean shape of the CB2 ones above, but with the added insulation. They have excellent reviews and would make a great gift.\n\nOlsen Double Wall Glass Mug, $7 at CB2: If you want to get fancy, this handle-free mug (does it count as a mug if it doesn\u2019t have a handle?) is double-walled so that your drinks stay the right temperature and you won\u2019t burn (or freeze) your hand. Imagine sitting by the fire, or a Netflix yule log, with one of these babies in your hand. Luxurious!!\n\nBT\u00e4T Coffee Mug, $34 on Amazon: If you want to be EXTRA fancy, this one\u2019s on a pedestal. These scream \u201chot cider\u201d to me. Best part: the base is flat so it won\u2019t collect little pools of water in the dishwasher.\n\nSun's Tea Crystal Clear Glass Coffee, $13 on Amazon: Look at this little round guy! I love him! Borosilicate glass means he\u2019s dishwasher and microwave-safe so he can be your companion no matter what.\n\nKeepCup Cork Edition 12 Oz Reusable Cup, $26 at Anthropologie: You don\u2019t have to limit the clear mug life to your home, there are great travel options too! These Keepcups are great gifts (for others, and yourself!) and are great for taking your coffee or tea on the go. They are sadly not dishwasher safe, but will handwashing one thing kill you? I think not!\n\nScouted selects products independently and prices reflect what was available at the time of publish. Sign up for our newsletter for more recommendations and deals.
