Join the conversation below.\n\nThe attack sent Brent crude, the international benchmark for crude prices, soaring 15% to $69.02 a barrel on Monday, the largest gain recorded in over three decades. Higher fuel prices pose another threat to the world economy amid a U.S.-China trade dispute, although Saudi and U.S. officials said they would ensure that the oil market remains well supplied.\n\nU.S. officials shared with Saudi Arabia the intelligence reports and their assessment that Iran launched more than 20 drones and at least a dozen ballistic missiles at the Saudi oil facilities on Saturday, the people familiar said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been in touch with leaders in the Middle East to discuss the situation.

U.S. officials said they planned to share more information with the Saudis in the coming days.\n\nUnless the kingdom makes the same determination, the U.S. would have trouble galvanizing regional support for a unified response, Western officials and analysts in the region said.\n\nIn Riyadh, the Saudi military offered its first assessment on Monday, which stopped far short of accusing Iran of orchestrating the strikes.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition fighting a war in Yemen against Iran-allied Houthi rebels said that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian made and it dismissed claims of responsibility by the Houthis.\n\nIn Washington, Mr. Trump offered a more conciliatory message toward Iran. After a weekend warning that the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d the Republican president said Monday that he wanted to avoid a war with Iran.\n\n\u201cDo I want war?\u201d he said to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody.\u201d\n\nDiplomacy, he said, is \u201cnever exhausted until the final 12 seconds.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other administration officials would soon travel to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter weighing the Trump administration information, Saudi Arabia said it was going to invite U.N. experts to investigate and would wait for the results before deciding how to respond. U.S. officials asked members of the U.N. Panel of Experts on Yemen, which investigates the origins of weapons used in the conflict, to fly to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible.\n\nAt the U.N., U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the Security Council that \u201cemerging information indicates that responsibility lies with Iran.\u201d The U.K., a key U.S. ally, didn\u2019t immediately assign blame for the attacks, saying it is assessing what happened and who was responsible.\n\nRelated Video The strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure have led to a production shutdown on a scale the world hasn\u2019t seen for decades. It could have long-lasting consequences for global markets and politics. Photo: Reuters\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials were split over how to respond. Some want to strike Iran militarily, while others worry an attack could trigger a wider regional fight, officials in both countries said.\n\nThe Saturday attack hit the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry with a series of drone and missile strikes that left Riyadh reeling. The country is struggling to repair the damage and limit the fallout to the energy industry.\n\nSaudi Arabia is now considering whether to delay plans by Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil-and-gas company, for an initial public offering, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe developments have already undermined efforts to broker a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran next week at the United Nations General Assembly. Iran said on Monday that its president wouldn\u2019t meet Mr. Trump after the U.S. said it was open to such a meeting.\n\nMr. Rouhani said on Monday that the attack was an act of self-defense by Yemeni Houthi rebels. \u201cEvery day, Yemen is being bombed and peaceful civilians are dying,\u201d he said during a trilateral summit with Russian and Turkish counterparts in Ankara. \u201cWhen security is restored in Yemen, then it will be possible again to produce oil safely in [Saudi Arabia].\u201d\n\nThe latest attacks pose a critical test for the U.S.-Saudi relationship, especially for Mr. Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s de facto ruler. They have both shifted their country\u2019s foreign policies toward confrontation with Iran.\n\nMr. Trump met Monday with his national security team to discuss the attacks on Saudi Arabia and escalating tensions in the Middle East, a person familiar with the meetings said.\n\nMr. Trump and his team, which included Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and acting national security adviser Charles Kupperman, discussed possible military action against Iran, but made no decisions, a second person familiar with the discussions said.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said he is not yet considering military options and that he expects Saudi Arabia to play a central role in any response.\n\n\u201cThe fact is the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this, if we decide to do something,\u201d he said.\n\nRobert Malley, president of International Crisis Group and former White House Middle East coordinator under President Obama, said, \u201cBoth President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman feel the need to respond but neither wants war. The question is how they achieve the former without provoking the latter.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has taken the lead in providing security for the Persian Gulf monarchies for decades in part out of a strategy of protecting the world\u2019s oil supply. As a result, observers of the region expect Saudi Arabia might defer any military action to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, conventional military action is a last resort for any state, and it is something that would be done in coordination with regional and international stakeholders,\u201d said Mohamed Alyahya, a Saudi political analyst and editor of the English website of Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television.\n\n\u201cAny reaction whatsoever, or lack thereof, will have significant consequences on the future of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted a reminder of Iran\u2019s behavior when it shot down a U.S. drone in June, a strike that led the U.S. to prepare a military strike against Iran. Mr. Trump called off the strike after having second thoughts.\n\n\u201cRemember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their \u2018airspace\u2019 when, in fact, it was nowhere close,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nThe weekend strikes marked the most significant attack in a simmering conflict pitting the U.S. and its Middle East allies against Iran and its proxies around the region.\n\nMr. Trump imposed crippling sanctions on Iran that have delivered a blow to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIran\u2019s crude oil production capacity was nearly 4 million barrels a day before the revival of U.S. sanctions, making it a leading oil supplier. The country\u2019s refining capacity now is about half that amount.\n\nIn recent months, the U.S. has accused Iran of carrying out a series of attacks in the region, including blasts that crippled several tankers in the Persian Gulf.\n\nAmid the heightened tensions, the U.S. sent warships, jet fighters, bombers and troops to the Middle East, including more than 500 military personnel and a squadron of fighters to the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. Much of that buildup remains in place, officials said.\n\nThe prospect of U.S. military action drew divergent reactions from lawmakers. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) called over the weekend for the U.S. to put an attack on Iranian oil refineries \u201con the table.\u201d\n\nOthers cautioned against military action. Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) warned on Twitter Monday that any \u201cdirect engagement by U.S. military in response to Iran\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) was more blunt: \u201cThe U.S. should never go to war to protect Saudi oil,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday.\n\nSaturday\u2019s strikes demonstrated how a war with Iran could be devastating for Saudi Arabia, with the lifeblood of the kingdom\u2019s economy vulnerable to attack despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on its military.\n\nThe attacks have amplified the pressure on the Saudi government to respond. Its air defenses have failed to stop the attacks on Saturday and other incidents involving the Houthis in the months before, despite the kingdom having the world\u2019s third-largest military budget.\n\nAmong other weapons, the kingdom has both American-made Patriot and Hawk missile systems, both of which have failed to stop a series of drone and missile attacks since May. The Saudi government says it has shot down several drones in the past.\n\n\u2014Isabel Coles, Vivian Salama, Lindsay Wise, David Gauthier-Villars and Ian Talley contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com", "description": "American officials say intelligence indicates that Iran was the staging ground for a debilitating attack on the Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry.", "authors": ["Dion Nissenbaum In Beirut", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Jared Malsin In Tunis", "Dion Nissenbaum", "Summer Said", "Jared Malsin", "Dion.Nissenbaum Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Jared.Malsin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107395/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
