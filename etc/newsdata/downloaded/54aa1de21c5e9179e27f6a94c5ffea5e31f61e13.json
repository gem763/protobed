But in its four-year journey, its ambition has significantly grown beyond that. Today, it serves as a digital wallet app that helps users pay their mobile and electricity bills, and offer credit to customers so that they can pay later for their digital purchases.\n\nThe startup says it has amassed over 60 million registered users in India, most of whom live in small cities and towns \u2014 or dubbed India 2 and India 3. Most of these users are coming online for the first time and True Balance says it has an army of local agents \u2014 who get certain incentives \u2014 to help first time internet users understand the benefit of online transactions and start using the app.\n\nTrue Balance says it clocks more than 300,000 digital transactions on its app each day. The startup, which recently introduced e-commerce shopping service on its app to sell products like smartphones, has clocked $100 million in GMV sales in the country to date.\n\nCharlie Lee, founder of True Balance, said the startup will use the fresh capital to bulk up the offerings on the app. Some of the features that True Balance intends to add before the end of this fiscal year include the ability to purchase bus and train tickets, digital gold, and book cooking gas cylinders.\n\nTrue Balance will also expand its lending and e-commerce services, Lee said. Its lending feature was used 1 million times in three months when it was introduced earlier this year. \u201cWe aim to strengthen our data and alternative credit scoring strategy to provide better financial services to our target \u2014 the next billion Indian users. Our goal is to reach 100 million digital touch points and become one of the top fin-tech companies in India by 2022,\u201d he added in a statement.\n\nEven as more than 600 million users in India are online today, just about as many remain offline. In recent years, many major companies in India have started to customize their services to appeal to users in India 2 and India 3 \u2014 who also have limited financial power.", "description": "South Korean startup True Balance, which operates an eponymous financial services app aimed at tens of millions of users in small cities and towns in India, has closed a new financing round as it looks to court more first time users in the world\u2019s second largest internet market.
