(AP) - Authors of the \u201cPorter the Hoarder\u201d children\u2019s book series engage kids and encourage families to read together.\n\nEarlier this month at the Yankton Community Library, Sean Covel, a children\u2019s book author and movie producer, and Rebecca Swift - illustrator, makeup artist and Yankton native - made an appearance at the Yankton Community Library to introduce a children\u2019s book series they are creating.\n\nThe books are based on the character Porter the Hoarder, a little girl who stashes all manner of things in her room, from toys to rotting banana peels and chewed-up bubble gum, the Yankton Daily Press & Dakotan reported .\n\n\u201cWhat I love about Porter the Hoarder is that Rebecca\u2019s taken such a simple drawing and pulled so much emotion out of this character,\u201d Covel said. \u201cThis is great for a few reasons. One, because it\u2019s fun to use a simple design and get big, big emotion, but secondly, because kids can draw this, and as part of the presentations that we do in class, Rebecca stands up and says, \u2018Here\u2019s how you do this: here\u2019s a cookie for a head and bananas for hair and here\u2019s how you do the McDonald\u2019s arches for bows.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe children pick it up quickly and can begin to start drawing Porter - an emotional character - in ways that express their own emotions, he said.\n\n\u201cRemove her eyebrows and flip her mouth upside down and it\u2019s a completely different emotion,\u201d Covel said. \u201cKids have a blast.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the idea for the character is based on a real child.\n\n\u201cMy daughter, Logan, is 14 now, and when she was a little girl, I was helping her tidy up her room and I opened a drawer and I found a mountain of candy and garbage and just weird stuff,\u201d Swift said. \u201cI said, \u2018My daughter\u2019s a hoarder,\u2019 drew up the picture, and told Sean about Porter the Hoarder.\u201d\n\nThat was about nine years ago.\n\nCovel, an Edgemont native, produced the movie \u201cNapoleon Dynamite\u201d and has been working in film for the last 15 years. He met Swift when they were both working on a movie in the Black Hills.\n\n\u201cLast year was the first time that we actually put something together,\u201d Covel said. \u201cOriginally, this was a counting book. What happens is you\u2019ve got the main character, Porter, and as you flip through, the reader - the adult - is reading with the child in the first 10 pages, let\u2019s say, and they are laying out the way the story works.\u201d\n\nCovel and Swift made a visit to the second-grade class his sister teaches in Sturgis and read the book to her students.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was, \u2018Count the number of snotty handkerchiefs,\u2019 but then, when we got the feedback from the kids, they were like, \u2018This should be harder to find,\u2019\u201d Covel said. \u201cSuddenly, it became a look-and-find book, and the second that happened, this could be her messy room, but we could have a new character that is Porter on a hike, or a new character that is Porter making pizza or a new character that\u2019s Porter trick-or-treating in the monster neighborhood. That\u2019s where we came up with the idea for these 64 books.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reader gets to help Porter decide what stays and what goes,\u201d Swift added. \u201cSome things are absolutely disgusting and some things are toys and trinkets she can keep.\u201d\n\nAs of this month, there are four complete \u201cPorter the Hoarder\u201d books available on Amazon.com. There are two more \u201cPorter\u201d books written and illustrated and Covel recently finished writing his seventh book.\n\nThough Swift had the idea and drew the basic character, it was Covel who ultimately gave Porter a voice, not just through his dialog on paper, but through the presentations that he and Swift give around the state, a voice that, according to Swift, makes their young fans explode with laughter.\n\n\u201cIn January, we did a project with a United Way of the Black Hill\u2019s initiative called Black Hills Reads,\u201d Covel said. \u201cIn that project, we gave away 2,400 copies of the book to every first grader in the Black Hills from as far north as Belle Fourche to as far south as Edgemont.\u201d\n\nAfter the Black Hills pilot, S.D. Statewide Family Engagement Center (SDSFEC) got involved. SDSFEC is one of 13 state family engagement organizations funded through a grant from the U.S Department of Education. Black Hills Special Services Cooperative and South Dakota Parent Connection applied for the grant in partnership with the South Dakota Department of Education, according to S.D. Statewide Family Engagement Project Director Morgan VonHaden.\n\nSDSFEC\u2019s goal is to ensure that all learners have the support they need to achieve academic, career and life goals, according to the group\u2019s website.\n\nThe grant to promote family engagement in literacy and education was awarded last October and is for $4.8 million for five years, VonHaden said.\n\n\u201cWe really were excited to partner with Sean and Rebecca with \u2018Porter the Hoarder\u2019 to get kids excited about literacy and reading and to have parents and kids read together, but also, on a side note, having their book at all these schools has opened the doors of more schools to learn about family engagement,\u201d VonHaden said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing partnership.\u201d\n\nCovel and Swift will continue to work with SDSFEC promoting \u201cPorter the Hoarder\u201d and family literacy for the next four years.\n\nAs a reading activity, \u201cPorter the Hoarder\u201d was ideal for family engagement because it was written to be read to a child by an adult. When the book is presented in a classroom, the teacher reads as the students follow along on the large classroom display.\n\n\u201cOnce the class has read it, they say, \u2018Did you like the book?\u2019\u201d Covel said. \u201cThen, suddenly, because of Family Engagement Center, because of United Way, because of Black Hills Reads, the teacher can say, \u2018Guess what? You get your own copy right now for free.\u2019\u201d\n\nStudents are sent home with a special \u201chomework\u201d assignment for their parents. It explains the idea behind the book and asks that they read it with their child.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Education is one of our biggest partners, and they have written lesson plans to go along with \u2018Porter the Hoarder,\u2019\u201d VonHaden said. \u201cSo we have STEM lessons and a social/emotional learning plan that is coming from the Department of Education.\u201d\n\nThrough the grant, SDSFEC will continue to purchase the books to give away to young readers.\n\n\u201cThis week, we\u2019ve given away 5,000 books. So far we\u2019ve read to probably 1,500 kids; we will have read to another 1,000 by the end of tomorrow,\u201d Covel said. \u201cThis is a five-year initiative where every first grader in South Dakota will get (his or her) own book every year for the next five years.\u201d\n\nDuring that time, Covel and Swift hope to continue to present \u201cPorter\u201d to schools and communities to bolster literacy across the state, but also to stay in touch with their core fan base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool what the kids have to say,\u201d Swift said. \u201cThey are our audience and that makes a difference for us. It\u2019s really important to see what the kids have to say, because we want them to be happy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Yankton Press and Dakotan, http://www.yankton.net/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Authors of the \"Porter the Hoarder\" children's book series engage kids and encourage families to read together.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cora Van Olson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
