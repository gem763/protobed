But at the same time, you don\u2019t want to miss trading opportunities because you can\u2019t monitor the markets.\n\nSo the question is\u2026\n\nHow can you profit from the markets without being glued to the screen?\n\nIntroducing the WOFT method, here\u2019s how it works\u2026\n\n1. What to look for:\n\nHere\u2019s the deal:\n\nThere are many different trading strategies out there. Trend continuation, reversal, Support & Resistance, etc. So before you can even \u201chunt\u201d for trading opportunities, you must first know what to look for.\n\nKind of looking for a partner in a marriage.\n\nYou must know whether you want a Blonde, Asian, or Brunette? How tall does she need to be? How does she have to look like?\n\nYou get my point and it\u2019s the same for trading.\n\n2. Own it:\n\nHere\u2019s the deal:\n\nYou must own your trading setup. This means you\u2019ll stick with it come high or low (like how you\u2019re faithful to your partner). Because if you\u2019re inconsistent with your actions, guess what?\n\nYou get inconsistent results.\n\nSo, be committed to your trading strategy and own it.\n\nThis means taking a minimum of 100 trades of the same setup before you decide to \u201cthrow it away\u201d.\n\n3. Find it\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you want to trade trend continuation setups on the Daily timeframe. So, what you\u2019ll do is find markets which are trending on the Daily timeframe. Once you\u2019ve done it, write down:\n\n- The setup\n\n- The market\n\n- The timeframe\n\nThis is important because when the trading week opens, you won\u2019t be like a headless chicken looking for something to trade. You\u2019re prepared like a Spartan and you know what to hunt for.\n\n4. Trade it\n\nSo you\u2019ve done your \u201chomework\u201d. All that\u2019s left to do is wait for your trading setup.\n\nI repeat.\n\n- You wait for your trading setup\n\n- This means no\u2026 \u201cChasing\u201d the markets\n\n- Entering trades out of boredom\n\n- Taking trades outside of your trading plan\n\nYou only take trades according to your trading plan (which is what you\u2019ve prepared for) and when the opportunity presents itself, you execute it without hesitation.\n\nSo remember the WOFT method:\n\n- What to look for\n\n- Own it\n\n- Find it\n\n- Trade it\n\nYour trading might never be the same again\u2026\n\nRemember these trading lessons:\n\n# Potential loss is more important than how much you can make.\n\n# No matter how sure you are, things can go wrong.\n\n# Good outcome doesn't mean it's the right choice.\n\n# Bad outcome doesn't mean it's a wrong choice.# If you risk small, nothing can destroy you.\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: The contents produced here are purely for educational purpose.
