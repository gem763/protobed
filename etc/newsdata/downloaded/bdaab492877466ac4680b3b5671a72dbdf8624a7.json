Effective corporate tax rate after surcharge will be 25.17%. The tax sops announced for new manufacturing companies is even sweeter as they will have to pay a corporate tax rate of just 15%.\n\nThe \u201cbold move\u201d tax rate cut bodes well for the Indian economy as it will encourage companies to invest more in capex. India needs investments from the private and public sector to boost economic growth which has slowed down to its six-year low of 5%. It will also encourage higher foreign direct investment in the Indian corporate sector.\n\nThe tax rate cuts will have a straight positive impact on the Earnings per share (EPS) of the companies. Increase in EPS will mean that companies\u2019 stocks will trade at a cheaper Price as PE ratios will decline. ROE (Return on Equity) will also change, which means that brokerages will re-rate these stocks. No wonder the stock market today is up by more than 5%. is up by 565 points at the time of this writing, while is up by more than 1900 points in today\u2019s trade. Today\u2019s jump is comparable to the leap that the markets experienced on 18th May 2009 and 16th May 2014 when the markets rallied due to election-related news. However, this time the rally is different as it is based on the reforms announced by the government.\n\nIndia desperately needed this fiscal stimulus, as monetary stimulus provided by RBI through interest rate cuts has its limitations. Although RBI has cut to the tune of 110 bps this year, the effective reduction in interest rates is much lower as banks have been reluctant to pass on these rate cuts. With fiscal and monetary stimulus, both working in tandem, it will help India take closer to its dream of becoming the $5 trillion economy by 2025.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Nifty 50, BSE Sensex 30.
