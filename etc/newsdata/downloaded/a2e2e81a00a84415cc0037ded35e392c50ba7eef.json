The network will enhance a field of science born just four years ago, when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) solved a 100-year-old mystery posed by Albert Einstein.\n\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted that accelerating massive objects, like neutron stars or black holes, would create ripples or \"waves\" in the fabric of space and time. However, he didn't think these gravitational waves would ever be detected \u2014 they seemed too weak to pick up amid all the noise and vibrations on Earth. For 100 years, it seemed Einstein was right.\n\nIn the late 1990s, LIGO's machines in Washington and Louisiana were built as an attempt to pick up the signals Einstein thought we'd never detect.\n\nFinally, after 13 years of silence, LIGO detected its first gravitational waves in September 2015: signals from the merger of two black holes some 1.3 billion light-years away. The discovery opened an entirely new field of gravitational-wave astronomy and earned a Nobel Prize in Physics for three researchers who helped conceive of LIGO.\n\nSince then, LIGO and its Italian companion Virgo have detected two other catastrophic collisions. After the black-hole merger, the observatories detected the merging of two neutron stars in October 2017, followed by what they believe was a black hole swallowing a neutron star in August. Altogether, the observatories have detected likely gravitational waves more than 30 times.\n\nRead more: An experiment that solved a 100-year-old mystery posed by Einstein is about to turn back on \u2014 and it's more powerful than ever\n\nNow LIGO and Virgo are getting another partner: the Kamioka Gravitational-wave Detector (KAGRA) in Japan.\n\nWith the help of KAGRA, scientists expect to narrow down the location of massive collisions with three times more accuracy. That would make it much easier for telescopes on Earth to confirm the collision responsible for the waves the network picks up. Representatives from each observatory signed an agreement on Friday.\n\nThe KAGRA system is housed in a giant L-shaped tunnel located 200 meters underground, November 6, 2015 in Hida, Gifu, Japan.

The animation below, created by LIGO researchers, explains how that works.\n\nEach L-shaped gravitational-wave detector consists of two 2.5-mile-long arms. The detector shoots out a laser beam and splits it in two. One of those split beams is sent down a 2.5-mile long tube while the other goes down an identical, perpendicular tube.\n\nThe beams bounce off mirrors and converge back near the beam splitter. The light waves return at equal length and line up in such a way that they cancel each other out to the detector.\n\nBut when a gravitational wave comes through, it warps spacetime \u2014 briefly making one tube longer and the other shorter. This rhythmic stretching-and-squeezing distortion continues until the wave passes. When that happens, the two waves of light don't wind up converging at equal lengths, so they don't neutralize each other. That leads the detector to record some flashes of light.\n\nMeasuring those changes in brightness thus allows physicists to measure and observe gravitational waves that pass through Earth.\n\nThen once a signal is detected, astronomers alert telescopes around the globe to zero in on the cosmic event that likely triggered the waves.\n\n\"This has opened a new window to what we can detect in the universe,\" Imre Bartos, a physicist at Columbia University and LIGO, previously told Business Insider. \"We can detect this \u2014 we can now see gravitational waves. But the real exciting things are what we discover with these gravitational waves.\"\n\nKAGRA brings new approaches to noise problems\n\nAn illustration of the underground KAGRA gravitational-wave detector in Japan. ICRR, Univ. of Tokyo/LIGO Lab/Caltech/MIT/Virgo Collaboration\n\nKAGRA is expected to come online in December. It will start out slow, operating at levels not sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves. After scientists fine-tune its instruments, they expect it to fully join the hunt sometime in 2020.\n\nBy making the global gravitational-wave detection network more robust, KAGRA will improve its accuracy.\n\nIn the 2017 merger of two neutron stars, scientists traced the event's location to a patch of sky 30 square degrees in size \u2014 that's less than 0.1 percent of the sky. But with KAGRA's help, researchers expect to narrow that kind of estimate down even more, to just 10 square degrees. That will give telescopes a much more specific location in which to search for the wave-triggering event.\n\nThe observatory will also use new approaches to make it less prone to false detections.\n\nBecause LIGO and Virgo are extraordinarily sensitive \u2014 when a wave passes by, the arms' length changes by less than 1/10,000th of the width of a proton particle \u2014 they can easily be disturbed by the vibration of trucks driving on nearby roads or a slight breeze. Even the microscopic movements of atoms in the detector's mirrors can mimic the signal of a gravitational wave.\n\nA LIGO mirror in Livingston, Louisiana. LIGO/MIT\n\nThat's why LIGO has two locations and works with Virgo: If they all detect a signal at exactly the same time, that's likely a gravitational wave passing through Earth.\n\nKAGRA will lend yet another instrument to help verify those detections, and it will operate underground to be better insulated from the interference of wind, Earth's rumbles, and passing trucks.\n\nIt will also be the first detector to cryogenically chill its mirrors \u2014 the practice of using liquefied gas to achieve temperatures below minus 150 degrees Celsius ( minus 238 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 to reduce noise from the mirrors' own atoms. (Atoms are always vibrating \u2014 the energy of that vibration is what we call heat. So cryogenics will cool the material enough that the molecules almost stop vibrating.)\n\n\"These features could supply a very important direction for the future of gravitational-wave detectors with much higher sensitivities,\" Takaaki Kajita, a principal investigator with the KAGRA project who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize, said in the release.\n\nYet another observatory, LIGO India, is expected to join the global gravitational-wave network in 2025.", "description": "A Japanese observatory is joining Earth's most powerful experiment to detect ripples in spacetime, helping make more detections with greater accuracy.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher", "Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d978c9f754caa10370b4d61?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
