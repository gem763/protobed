It said its investment in AT&T (NYSE: ) was its largest ever.\n\nIn response to Elliott's letter, AT&T said it would engage with Elliott and review the shareholder's views.\n\nElliott did not offer details on any missteps it saw in the deal, but said it remained cautious about the benefits of the combination that also brought TBS and TNT networks as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the \"Batman\" and \"Harry Potter\" films, under AT&T.\n\nThe deal was seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) (O:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers without a cable subscription.\n\nThe hedge fund listed businesses including home security, DirecTV, regional sports networks, CME, Sky Mexico, its Latin American pay TV business (Vrio), Puerto Rican operations and other units as possible sale candidates.\n\nIt said AT&T should also appoint third-party advisers to evaluate its operations and organizational structure, with a focus on eliminating inefficiency and creating a faster-moving organization.\n\nAT&T has missed revenue expectations five times in the past eight quarters, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nElliott said a strategic review will help AT&T to rapidly pay down debt through divestment and increase its financial profile.", "description": "Activist investor questions AT&T's Time Warner purchase, calls for asset sales", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE3C038_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
