I normally stick with black or muted colors but the royal blue color called to me. I\u2019m so glad I went with that one. It fits great and I love the pockets! I\u2019m 5\u2019 6\u2033 and about 170lbs, so I wasn\u2019t sure how a dress like this would fit on me, but the fabric hit at all of the right places and with the help of some Spanx, it worked really well.\n\nShe said the dress was for her father\u2019s funeral (Picture: Amazon)\n\n\u2018I actually wore it to my father\u2019s funeral and many people commented on how it was the perfect color on me. Would definitely buy again. (I ordered a large!)\u2019\n\nAlthough commenters on Reddit agreed it\u2019s a nice dress, they just wanted to know why she had decided to add that picture.\n\nOne person said: \u2018You would think shed have snapped a pic in the mirror at home. What do I know!?\u2019\n\nAnother said she was a bit confused about \u2018Amazon review etiquette.\u2019\n\nBut a funeral director stepped in to defend her.\n\nTheir post said: \u2018It\u2019s not really considered trashy for a person to grieve in their own way. Most funerals are treated as celebrations of life anyway, as that\u2019s what many people ask for when they die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like she\u2019s twerking on the casket. It\u2019s a tasteful picture but it\u2019s seen as \u201csuper trashy\u201d just because people don\u2019t like to be reminded of death. IMHO.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re just impressed the dress has pockets.\n\nMORE: Could you give a forever home to Stumpy, the \u2018ugly ducking\u2019 bearded dragon?\n\nMORE: Cat lover spends thousands and travels miles to keep a rare breed alive\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Woman posted picture of herself at her fathers funeral in a review for a long blue maxi dress from Amazon.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91401678_1571811641.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
