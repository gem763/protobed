It trails only ride-hailing giant Uber.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev raised $5 billion through a listing of its Asia business unit on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company priced 1.45 billion shares at HK$27, or the equivalent of $3.44. That values the Asia unit at around $45 billion.\n\nBudweiser Brewing Company APAC's final listing price fell under its marketed range of $3.45 to $3.83.\n\nThe successful listing follows AB InBev's failed attempt to raise close to $10 billion in July through a public offering of its Asia-Pacific business.\n\nAt the time, the company said it called off the listing due to \"prevailing market conditions.\" Investors also reportedly pushed back against the $64 billion valuation the company was seeking.\n\nAB InBev sold off its Australia business unit to Japan's Asahi Group Holdings for $11 billion in late July following the failed IPO, which reduced the value of its Asia-Pacific unit. That likely helped ease investors previous concerns about the listing's valuation.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.
