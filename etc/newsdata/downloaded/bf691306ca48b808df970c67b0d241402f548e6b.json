In fact, one might as well gobble macarons, \u00e9clairs and opera cake slices morning, noon and night. The country's pastry chefs are arguably the world's best, and they've been whipping up treats and teaching their techniques across the globe for centuries.\n\nIf you're visiting Paris , you'll find no shortage of pastry shops, and the city has some of the oldest shops in the world.\n\nWhy are all those croissants, tarts, souffl\u00e9s and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es so darn good? Pastry chef Nina Metayer says it has something to do with an utter devotion to the craft.\n\n\"All the pastry chefs I know ... they are totally passionate,\" said Metayer.\n\nRelated content 50 of the world's best desserts\n\nMetayer includes herself in that category.\n\nShe started making treats as a child to make her family happy, often feasting on the raw dough and batter in the process.\n\nAs an adult, she first started her career in breadmaking before moving over to pastry. She worked her way up through jobs at Hotel Raphael and Le Grand Restaurant, and was named Pastry Chef of the Year by \"Le Chef\" magazine in 2016. She also placed third in the French TV competition show, \"Qui sera le meilleur p\u00e2tissier?\" (Who's the best pastry chef?)\n\nShe likes to keep her desserts light and fruity, paying attention to whatever's in season. She most recently worked for Caf\u00e9 Pouchkine but is now following personal pursuits.\n\nRelated content Domaine de Chantilly: The Paris alternative to Versailles\n\nIf you're lucky enough to visit Paris, Metayer has a few suggestions on how to pick the best shops from among the dozens open in the city. She says shops will either have good bread or good pastry, but rarely both at the same time. Get your bread from one place, but your croissants somewhere else, as the two techniques are difficult to master at the same time.\n\nShe also encourages an attention to fine detail. A smooth, shiny finish on the chocolate, for example, is an indication that the pastry will taste as good as it looks.\n\n\"It's a good way to know they made it with love,\" said Metayer.\n\nMetayer's recommendations for treats in Paris:\n\nLa P\u00e2tisserie Cyril Lignac -- Try the baba, a large brioche with syrup inside and topped with chantilly cream. 16th Arrondissment\n\nJacques Genin -- The caramels melt perfectly in the mouth at this famous chocolaterie. 3rd Arrondissment", "description": "Nina Metayer was named Pastry Chef of the Year in 2016 and offers her suggestions on finding the best pastry shops in Paris.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190709160710-paris-pastry-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-14"}
