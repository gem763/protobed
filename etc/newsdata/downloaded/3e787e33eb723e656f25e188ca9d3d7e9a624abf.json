It is the seventh dead boar confirmed to have the virus since the outbreak of ASF began last month.\n\nThe Environment Ministry said that the infected carcass was found just 1.4 km from a site in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province where two other dead boars with the virus were found last Saturday.\n\nIn a bid to contain the disease, which is deadly to swine, fences were set up near the DMZ to prevent wild boars moving to other areas.\n\nSoldiers have been sent since Tuesday to cull all wild boars around the DMZ and killed 57 in a day.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the number of confirmed ASF cases at pig farms stands at 14. No new cases have been reported since the last one was confirmed on Oct. 9.\n\n", "description": "7th Wild Boar Carcass Found with African Swine Fever Near DMZ", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
