This essential piece of kit has an important job, after all. On every car journey \u2013 from the first daunting drive home from hospital to sleep-persuading loops around the block \u2013 your baby\u2019s in-car throne serves to keep them safe, secure and ever-so snug.\n\nWhen it comes to safety testing, car seats in the UK have to conform to one of two standards: ECE R129 is the newest European-wide regulation, known as i-Size. This runs alongside the existing ECE R44 regulation, and parents can choose either seat type to use.\n\nRegulation ECE R44 seats are split into groups based on your baby\u2019s weight: group 0 seats are suitable from birth up to 10kg (approximately nine months) and group 0+ for newborns to 13kg (approximately 12-15 months).\n\nAll babies must be rear-facing until they are 15-months-old, as before this their necks are not strong enough to withstand the pressure of a head-on collision in the forward-facing position. In these weight-based car seats, your baby needs to stay rear-facing until they weigh at least 9kg.\n\ni-Size seats use a child\u2019s height for fitting, keeping babies rearward-facing until they are 15-months-old. They have also had side-impact testing. Always make sure your car seat fits your child and your car, their head should not go beyond the seat.\n\nSo, what\u2019s Isofix? Isofix is an internationally recognised car seat fitting system, meaning seats aren\u2019t installed with the car\u2019s three-point seat belt, but instead provide a more secure fit by slotting into Isofix anchorage points built into all new cars \u2013 so you need to check a seat is compatible with your vehicle before you buy.\n\nA car seat can have an Isofix fitting whether it\u2019s an i-Size or ECE R44-approved model. For more information on how to choose the best seat for your baby, read our buying guide.\n\nWe road-tested these first car seats on both long journeys and quick trips. Each seat in our shortlist has, of course, been extensively safety tested to meet regulation standards, so our deep-dive is based on ease of use, comfort factor and the bonus extras that make a parent\u2019s life a little easier. It\u2019s then for you to decide what features matter the most when transporting your bundle from A to B.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nBritax R\u00f6mer baby-safe i-Size: \u00a3190, Britax\n\nThe Britax baby-safe2 is a sturdy, affordable seat that conforms to i-Size standards, so is fitted in the rearward facing position and can be used until your baby reaches 13kg or 83cm. Peace of mind safety elements such as \u201csuperior side-impact protection\u201d, plus an easy installation, see the baby-safe carrier as a popular pick among new parents \u2013 in fact, this was the seat the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose to take their three little bundles home from the hospital.\n\nDeep padding makes for a comfy ride and a removable newborn insert means babies are secure from birth. The headrest height can be adjusted with one hand, and we were impressed by the seat\u2019s integral recline: as you alter the headrest, the lying position changes automatically. The seat can be secured by a car\u2019s three-point seat belt but to have the Isofix fitting, you\u2019ll need to buy either of the two compatible bases. We rate the Britax flex base (\u00a3175), as with four adjustable angles it allows the seat into an even flatter recline, offering the most ergonomic travel position for a new baby. Buy the extra adaptors and the baby-safe2 will work with many of the big-brand pushchairs too.\n\nBuy now\n\nMaxi-Cosi Jade car cot: \u00a3199, Maxi-Cosi\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that newborns are in a car seat for no longer than 30 minutes, with two hours being the maximum time for older babies. So what to do on that epic road trip? The Maxi-Cosi Jade is an i-Size seat offering a safe solution for long-distance journeys. The carrycot design means a baby can sleep fully flat from birth, and stay in the seat for longer periods of time. You\u2019ll find a soft mattress, three-point safety harness, sun canopy and a newborn inlay to use until your baby is 60cm.\n\nWe found fitting the additional 3wayFix Isofix base (\u00a3199) a fuss-free experience \u2013 there\u2019s light and sound feedback to let you know that you\u2019ve secured it correctly. The Jade then slides on and off the base so you can take it into the house, or attach it to a Maxi-Cosi pushchair, all while baby sleeps. The seat takes a maximum weight of 9kg, 70cm \u2013 making it suitable from birth to approximately six months \u2013 so it does have a shorter lifespan than the pick of group 0 + seats that\u2019ll last you well over 12 months. Saying that, once you\u2019ve purchased the 3wayFix base, it can be used with a next stage Maxi-Cosi seat, such as the Pearl Pro i-Size, for tots aged up to four-years-old.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoie i-spin 360: \u00a3280, Mothercare\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever struggled to get a small child in and out of a car, then you\u2019ll know that the 360-degree rotation on the Joie i-spin is a highly covetable seat feature. With one hand you can swivel the seat to face you at the car door without the back-breaking work of bending right in. This newborn-suitable car seat also impresses on the longevity front. The rotation element, six-height headrest and harness system that adjusts simultaneously mean the Joie i-Spin can be used all the way up to 18kg \u2013 around four-years-old.\n\nYou can keep it rearward-facing for this entire time, or rotate to the forward-facing position when it\u2019s safe for older tots. We liked the clever safety feature that keeps the seat rearward until a child is the right size to turn, taking away any guesswork.\n\nBuy now\n\nCosatto Port car seat: \u00a3174.95, Mothercare\n\nThis British brand has long been a parent-pleaser, offering well-designed baby kit adorned in quirky, statement-making prints. The port is Cosatto\u2019s group 0+ seat that\u2019s suitable for babies up to 13kg, and is fitted in the rearward-facing position. Although it\u2019s not i-Size compliant, the seat is compatible with Cosatto\u2019s port base (\u00a3124.95) if you\u2019re wanting the extra security and click-and-go ease of Isofix.\n\nAfter a once-over of the manual, we secured the port with our car\u2019s standard three-point seat belt and found it straightforward to install and a stable ride for baby. There are 12 distinctive patterns to choose from including a bold spot and stripe, a Nordic woodland scene or a leopard print fabric designed by Paloma Faith. The seat can also be used as a travel system with Cosatto\u2019s Giggle and Wow pram/pushchair.\n\nBuy now\n\nJane Koos i-Size: From \u00a3149, Jane\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a light, reliable car seat to lug around, the Koos from Jane fits the bill. When fitted with the base (\u00a3160), the Koos is an i-Size compliant seat that has reassuring features, including side-impact protection, a five-position adjustable headrest and inserts to use with a newborn from 40-60cm.\n\nThis car seat will last until your baby is around 15-months-old (or 83cm), and we found the fabrics soft and cosy \u2013 they come off easily for washing too. An adjustable carrying handle makes lifting the seat a doddle and it really comes into its own when used as part of a travel system with the Jane range of pushchairs \u2013 a one-click system takes the seat from car to pavement.\n\nBuy now\n\nDoona infant car seat: \u00a3299.99, Doona\n\nIs it a car seat? Is it a pushchair? Actually, it\u2019s both. The USP of the Doona is its integrated set of wheels that can be released in seconds \u2013 turning the seat into a stroller when out of the car. The seat conforms to ECE R44, rather than i-Size regulations, but it meets the testing standards for pushchairs and reclined cradles too. We installed the Doona using the car\u2019s three-point car seat belt, although if you\u2019d prefer an Isofix fitting, there is an additional base to buy (\u00a3129.99).\n\nWhile the Doona isn\u2019t designed to be used all day, we found it a great way to make short A to B trips, to have when travelling, or to keep at the grandparents\u2019 house \u2013 negating the need for two sets of baby kit. The Doona is safe on an aeroplane and there\u2019s eight on-trend fabric colours to choose from, which adds to the appeal.\n\nBuy now\n\nCybex Aton M i-Size: \u00a3128.99, Uber Kids\n\nThe Aton M i-Size is a birth to 13kg seat from Cybex \u2013 a brand known for its premium baby hardware with super-sleek styling. The seat is ideal for newborns and babies up to 87cm, which is a slightly longer height capacity than some other infant seats in the group 0+ category.\n\nYou have to buy the compatible Cybex base M separately for i-Size safety (\u00a3136.95), or secure the seat with the car\u2019s three-point seatbelt. We were won over by the simple installation and standout newborn-friendly features \u2013 there\u2019s a removable insert for good positioning and Cybex\u2019s SensorSafe clip tracks temperature and length of journey on your smartphone.\n\nA stylish design completes the package: the Aton\u2019s fabrics look high-end and come in a choice of eye-catching colours or fashion prints. Team the seat with the Cybex pushchair and you have an ultra-attractive travel system that will protect your baby on-the-go.\n\nBuy now\n\nGraco Milestone all-in-one car seat: \u00a3193.80, Amazon\n\nFor parents seeking a super-versatile car seat, The Graco milestone is a one-stop-shop. Impressively, this seat is suitable for newborns and 12-year-olds, and every age in between. With a similar price tag to car seats that last only a year, it\u2019s undoubtedly a money-saver. The seat sits in the rearward-position for a baby, with two recline modes, and switches to forward-facing for a toddler. Machine washable covers can be whipped off easily and there\u2019s a cup holder for bigger kids too.\n\nWhat you gain in value though, you do lose in portability as and it\u2019s certainly not light at 8.9kg. All in all, this is a simple, durable seat that we found easy to install with the car\u2019s three-point seat belt.\n\nBuy now\n\nNuna Pipa Lite LX: \u00a3250, John Lewis & Partners\n\nWeighing in at just 2.5kg, the Nuna Pipa Lite LX is a lightweight car seat that\u2019s suitable for a little one from birth to 13kg. We loved how the Isofix base comes with the seat so you\u2019re good-to-go with one purchase. If your car doesn\u2019t have Isofix anchorage, it can also be secured with a three-point seatbelt. This flexibility, along with the seat\u2019s featherweight carry, makes it a good option when regularly switching between cars.\n\nOur mini passenger slept snuggly thanks to the padded headrests and inserts that you can take out as they grow. A \u201cdream drape\u201d cover pulls down fully and secures with magnets \u2013 creating the perfect napping pod and protecting against the elements when carrying out of the car or using it on a pushchair. The merino wool and technical fabrics are naturally fire-resistant so the seat is free from fire retardant chemicals. A shock-absorbing shell and side-impact protection give you all the necessary safety reassurances as you drive.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: car seats\n\nWith its reassuringly rigorous safety standards, plus plenty of first-rate features, the sturdy Britax baby-safe2 i-Size is our best buy. Cybex\u2019s stylish Aton M also picks up points for being a dependable i-Size seat that\u2019s easy on the eye. When it comes to value for money, the Joie i-spin 360 deserves a mention for its clever design and long lifespan.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
