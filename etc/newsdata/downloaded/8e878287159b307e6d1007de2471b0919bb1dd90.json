Netflix has the answer.\n\nThe US streaming service is trialling a feature in which users can watch programmes or films at up to 1.5 times the normal speed.\n\nIt is being tested for mobile phones and tablets, favouring those who want to squeeze a show into their commute. Those who would like to binge-watch a box set but worry that they don\u2019t have enough hours in the day might find it a tempting proposition.\n\nShows can also be slowed down to half the intended speed for anyone struggling to keep up with the dialogue, or who wish to watch a scene in slow-motion.\n\nNetflix said it was responding to customer demand. But the trial has provoked an angry backlash from Hollywood film-makers including Judd Apatow, Peter Ramsey, Peyton Reed and Brad Bird.", "description": "Fancy watching a two hour film but only have 90 minutes to spare?", "authors": ["Anita Singh", "Arts", "Entertainment Editor", "Philip Johnston", "Matthew Goodwin", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Michael Deacon", "Olivia Utley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000129779535-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqxb5dtL_ELTE6B8DtWJJotCrQYo3SkySopgii1ZeDLdo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
