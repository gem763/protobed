That is why the Northern Ireland backstop is flawed.\n\n\"During today's meeting, the prime minister confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit: What happened on Monday?\n\nThe Irish border has proved a key sticking point in attempts to agree a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe government has indicated it could support harmonised rules for the agriculture and food sector to prevent the need for any sanitary and other health checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nBut it has distanced itself from reports that plans for a single EU-UK customs territory in the current withdrawal agreement - rejected three times by MPs - could be replaced with a specific Northern Ireland only \"backstop\" arrangement.\n\nAlthough official negotiations with the EU have yet to restart, the bloc's new trade commissioner said it was positive the UK seemed prepared to \"accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK\".\n\n\"I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions that can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage - albeit at the 11th hour - that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK,\" Ireland's Phil Hogan told the Irish Times\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The prime minister urges a group of primary school pupils \"not to get drunk\" at university\n\nParliament was suspended - or prorogued - at just before 02:00 BST on Tuesday amid noisy protests from opposition MPs.\n\nDuring the five-week suspension, parties will hold their annual conferences but no debates, votes or committee scrutiny sessions will take place.\n\nBoris Johnson will not face Prime Minister's Questions until the period is over and his scheduled questioning by the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday has been cancelled.\n\nSarah Wollaston, the Lib Dem chair of the committee, said the PM had gone back on earlier \"reassurances\" that he would appear, telling BBC's Newsnight she was \"appalled\" that he was \"running away from scrutiny\".\n\nParliament's suspension means MPs will not get a third chance to vote for an early election until they return, meaning a poll would not be possible until November at the earliest.\n\nIn Monday's latest vote, 293 MPs backed the prime minister's motion for an early election, far short of the two thirds needed.\n\nNew legislation, which was granted royal assent on Monday, will force the prime minister to seek a delay until 31 January 2020 unless a deal - or a no-deal exit - is approved by MPs by 19 October.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to a primary school in London, Mr Johnson said getting ready to leave the EU on Halloween was among the \"priorities of the people\".\n\nHe said there \"were loads of people around the place\", including in Brussels, who wanted to nail down an agreement but he was willing to leave without a deal \"if absolutely necessary\".\n\n\"There is a way of getting a deal but it will take a lot of hard work - but we must be prepared to come out without a deal.\"\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this interactive Did your MP vote in favour of allowing the government to suspend Parliament in order to secure Brexit on 30 October? Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP Seat vacant\n\nLabour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, the Independent Group for Change and Plaid Cymru have refused to agree to an election on what they say are \"Boris Johnson's terms\".\n\nSpeaking at the TUC Congress on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn said \"our priority is to stop no deal - and then have a general election\".\n\nThe Lib Dems, meanwhile, are seeking to put distance between themselves and Labour by saying that if they win power at the next election they will have an \"unequivocal\" mandate to cancel Brexit entirely.\n\nAt their conference on Sunday, members will debate a motion reaffirming their support for a referendum, but also urging the revocation of Article 50 - the legal process for leaving the EU - a week before the Brexit deadline if no deal has been agreed.\n\nThe prime minister's self-imposed Halloween Brexit deadline looks further out of reach than a few short days ago.\n\nIs it impossible? Absolutely not.\n\nThere is the possibility, still, of a deal, with Number 10 today stressing it is still their primary aim.\n\nWhispers again about a Northern Ireland-only backstop, and a bigger role for the Stormont assembly, if it ever gets up and running, are doing the rounds.\n\nSome MPs and some diplomats are more cheerful about the possibilities of it working out.\n\nIf you squint, you can see the chance of an agreement being wrapped up at pace, although it seems the chances range somewhere between slim and negligible.\n\nRead more from Laura.", "description": "Boris Johnson also rebuffs criticism of Parliament's five-week shutdown as a \"load of nonsense\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07myrwh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
