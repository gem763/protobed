It\u2019s good to win and bad to lose, and whatever strategy most consistently gets you that win is good in itself, too.\n\nKnights know that\u2019s not the case\u2014that there are both honourable and undignified ways to win \u2014 which is a little ironic, because ever since Magic: The Gathering introduced its new, Arthurian-themed set Throne of Eldraine, a strategy I just can\u2019t abide by has become very, very popular: milling.\n\nWinning a game of Magic: The Gathering typically means knocking an opponent\u2019s health to or below zero. Players will use a variety of strategies, including throwing big monsters on the field, denying opponents\u2019 plays or gaining life, to keep their health up and push opponents\u2019 health down.\n\nThere\u2019s another, less common win condition for Magic: The Gathering that in reality is better described as more of a loss condition for your opponent: attempting to draw a card from an empty deck. The corresponding strategy to get you there is called \u201cmilling,\u201d when you force your opponent to discard as many cards as possible into their graveyard.\n\nOutside a Magic: The Gathering prerelease draft in Flushing, Queens, earlier this year, I attempted to explain to a man with a very large vape why mill decks are dishonourable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the game,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re playing your life total game and your opponent is playing their mill game \u2014 it\u2019s hard to interact with, plus, they\u2019re barely interacting with my play strategy!\u201d He took a deep rip off that big boy and explained how it\u2019s exactly the game. And the way you counter it is to win faster or add more cards to your deck. Bystanders agreed; milling is a legit strategy if it gets you that win.\n\nI didn\u2019t encounter a lot of mill decks out in the wild of Magic: The Gathering\u2019s online iteration, Magic Arena, until publisher Wizards of the Coast released Throne of Eldraine last week. Now, they\u2019re everywhere.\n\nIn games with pre-made decks, the mill strategy abounds, as players build decks around the very many new cards that transfer opponents\u2019 libraries to their graveyards: \u201cMerfolk Secretkeeper,\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t Say Please,\u201d \u201cFolio of Fancies,\u201d \u201cSyr Konrad, the Grim,\u201d etc. The Magic subreddits and blogs are full of advice on how to build optimal Throne of Eldraine mill decks on the cheap.\n\nIn my online draft games, where players construct decks using a set of cards limited by what CPUs pick, I\u2019ve had my entire library milled just after taking my enemy down to one or two health \u2014 twice in one day. (Some Magic Arena players suspect that the mill strategy is so common in these online Throne of Eldraine drafts because of the way CPUs select cards.)\n\nAs long as there have been Magic: The Gathering forums, there have been Magic players who complain that mill decks are exclusively for newbies, that they\u2019re not competitive, that it\u2019s insulting to lose to and can make the loser too tilted to shake hands after a match.\n\nThese complaints hinge on winning and losing. For me, after spending an hour, a day, weeks, or months building a deck with interlocking mechanics, delightful synergy, and satisfying traps, it wholly and completely sucks for an opponent to circumvent it and toss all your cards in the garbage.\n\nWith the limited resources of a card draft, it always makes sense to grab onto the best win strategy, and milling, for better or worse, seems to be a popular one. Yet milling is one of those things that calls into question whether winning is the most important thing of all.\n\nIt\u2019s not dishonourable for a knight to stab their opponent, but it is dishonourable for them to dig a ditch on the opponent\u2019s side of the battlefield and fill it with quicksand before the swords are out. And is winning really more important than honour?\n\nSpoiler: It is. Sorry, knights. But I\u2019d argue that the biggest flex of all is to win the game head-to-head with all the back-and-forth drama that makes a good game of Magic so addictive.", "description": "\u201cDishonourable\u201d isn\u2019t a word you hear a lot in Magic: The Gathering.
