And he\u2019s all out of bubblegum. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation into one of his own political rivals, despite the fact that there was no evidentiary basis for such a probe. This fact is established in both the recently released phone records of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and a U.S. government whistle-blower\u2019s complaint. But you don\u2019t need to consult such documents to know that this happened \u2060\u2014 you can actually take our president\u2019s word for it: Trump has repeatedly admitted that he used the power of his office to pressure a foreign government into launching a baseless probe into one of his adversaries. Faced with the opportunity to use America\u2019s limited diplomatic leverage to advance our nation\u2019s interests, Trump opted to advance his own \u2060\u2014 in a manner that is actively harmful to American democracy. (Incumbent officials using the power of their offices to orchestrate legal troubles for their political opponents is not healthy for a republic.)\n\nIn a country where acknowledging objective reality and protecting one\u2019s political interests were compatible activities for members of Congress, Trump\u2019s own account of his actions would be sufficient to establish his unfitness for high office.\n\nBut since we do not live in such a country, Washington must pretend that there is some ambiguity about the propriety of Trump\u2019s actions. Specifically, congressional Democrats are currently focused on the question of whether Trump withheld duly appropriated aid to Ukraine so as to coerce its government to target Joe and Hunter Biden. Trump officially denies this particular act of heinous corruption. But that pro forma denial notwithstanding, there isn\u2019t much ambiguity about whether the president is guilty of the charge. In his phone calls with Zelensky, Trump heavily implies that the release of the aid is contingent on Ukrainian cooperation on corruption. And we know that Trump ordered military aid to Ukraine to be frozen earlier this year, then had his White House supply Congress with ever-changing rationalizations for why that aid had not yet gone through. Finally, this week, Trump implicitly admitted that there had been a quid pro quo, saying of his conversations with the Ukrainian president \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nThese are not the makings of a satisfying \u201cwhodunit?\u201d Some of the precise details of what transpired are unknown and should be uncovered. But there is no question that Trump abused the powers of his office in this instance \u2014 as he has manifestly done in many, many other instances.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 decision to formally begin actively considering whether they might be willing to acknowledge this reality (a.k.a. \u201claunch an impeachment inquiry\u201d), combined with Thursday\u2019s release of the whistle-blower report, has rendered Trump\u2019s corruption more conspicuous than usual. And Republicans are divided about how to respond.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of their positions, from left to right.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions warrant an impeachment inquiry, but it\u2019s still anybody\u2019s guess whether Donald Trump has ever committed a high crime or misdemeanor.\n\nThe RINO governor of Vermont, Phil Scott, has endorsed the official Democratic position.\n\nESSEX JUNCTION, Vt. (AP) \u2014 Vermont's governor has become the first Republican chief executive to support impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump but cautions that he wants to know more before any further actions are taken. \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 26, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s actions warrant an investigation, but not an impeachment investigation.\n\nRetiring moderate Republican representative Will Hurd implicitly took this position Thursday.\n\nThere is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning. We need to fully investigate all of the allegations addressed in the letter, and the first step is to talk to the whistleblower. \u2014 Rep. Will Hurd (@HurdOnTheHill) September 26, 2019\n\nMitt Romney also appears to be in this camp, telling reporters Wednesday that Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Ukraine is \u201ctroubling in the extreme \u2026 Everybody has their own perspective. I indicated \u2026 over the weekend what I thought troubling behavior would be. And asking a leader of a foreign government to investigate a political opponent is, in my opinion, a troubling matter.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s actions warrant an investigation, but not an impeachment investigation \u2014 and shame on Democrats for saying otherwise.\n\nNebraska senator Ben Sasse laid claim to this subtly distinctive pseudo-high-minded territory. \u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there\u2019s no there there when there\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling there,\u201d Sasse told NBC News after reviewing the complaint. \u201cBut there are also Democrats who had already decided they were going to impeach the president yesterday before they had any actual facts in front of them, and I think that\u2019s disastrous for the public health.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that the actual facts of the Trump presidency established a persuasive case for impeachment shortly after he took office \u2014 and that this is why some Democrats favored removing Trump from office, even before seeing these new documents \u2014 apparently did not occur to the Senate\u2019s \u201cvanishing American adult.\u201d\n\nI am not going to say anything that could be misinterpreted as a position.\n\nMaine\u2019s increasingly vulnerable Republican senator Susan Collins said that the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukranian president \u201craises a number of important questions\u201d but \u201cI\u2019m not going to be prejudging the evidence and I\u2019m not going to be commenting on the House\u2019s proceedings.\u201d\n\nLook, if Trump didn\u2019t say, verbatim, \u201cIf you don\u2019t launch a sham investigation into my potential 2020 opponent, I will withhold the aid that Congress appropriated for your country because I am a lawless baddie,\u201d then he did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find it concerning,\u201d Iowa senator Chuck Grassley said of the transcript Wednesday. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo, you\u2019d have to have that if there was going to be anything wrong.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not mad at the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 we actually think it\u2019s funny.\n\nThis mode of response substitutes self-confident horserace nihilism for any engagement with the substance of the scandal:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go and say there\u2019s almost, since yesterday, a kind of giddy atmosphere, because you always have to be careful what you wish for,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the GOP conference. \u201cBut at the same point, if Democrats continue to play the same card, \u2018attack attack attack\u2019, the Republican base isn\u2019t going to bite anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d added Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.). \u201cThis is a sham process.\u201d\n\nTrump never corruptly intervened in Ukrainian politics. You are thinking of Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cBiden is the one who threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid, not Trump, and that has to be investigated,\u201d Kentucky senator Rand Paul told the Washington Post.\n\nThe whistle-blower is a key figure in the \u201cClintons-Obama-Biden collusion debacle\u201d and his report is just a craven attempt to deflect from the real scandal.\n\nConservative commentator Hugh Hewitt floated this theory Thursday.\n\nHot take from a smart guy: \u201cJust read whistleblowers complaint. Theory, this is a cover up, not just of Biden, but the whole Clintons obama Biden collusion debacle riff with illegality. The complaint is someone in that mix trying to cover their ass.\u201d \u2014 Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) September 26, 2019\n\nWon\u2019t somebody please think of Hunter Biden\u2019s illegitimate children?\n\nFrom @SenTomCotton this AM: \u201cThere is a young women in her 20s in Arkansas who has filed a paternity suit in Arkansas state court against Hunter Biden. And he is dodging process, and has done so for months. \u2014 Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) September 26, 2019\n\nDemocrats just want those sweet, sweet Trump nudies.\n\nHere's Devin Nunes accusing Democrats of trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump pic.twitter.com/pRF7UHijpq \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 26, 2019", "description": "A whistleblower complaint credibly accuses Donald Trump of pressuring the Ukrainian government into investigating Joe Biden.
