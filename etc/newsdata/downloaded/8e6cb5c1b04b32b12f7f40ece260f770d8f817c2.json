The pre-Christmas vote will be the first December poll since 1923.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party abstained, after their preferred day for it to be held \u2013 9 December \u2013 was rejected. Almost half of all Labour MPs were absent or voted against the legislation in a sign of unhappiness about a snap election, although some blamed a mix-up by the whips for their failure to attend.\n\nParliament will dissolve next Wednesday for a short campaign of five weeks, so long as the House of Lords passes Johnson\u2019s legislation as expected in the coming days.\n\nCorbyn set the stage for his campaign by calling on voters to kick out Johnson\u2019s Conservatives who think they are \u201cborn to rule\u201d, while Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said it was \u201cour best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit\u201d.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the House of Commons, Johnson argued that a \u201cnew and revitalised\u201d parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union. \u201cWe are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse,\u201d he told MPs.\n\nBut he later struck a cautious note, telling a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be \u201ca tough election but we will do the best we can\u201d. He told them he had not wanted an election but was forced to seek one because Labour would have \u201csliced and diced\u201d his Brexit legislation beyond recognition.\n\nIn a move to unite his party, the prime minister decided to readmit 10 of the 21 MPs he expelled last month for defying his Brexit plan.\n\nThe major battle lines of the campaign will be drawn along on the subject of Brexit, after Johnson failed to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d as he had promised.\n\nElection officials want right to delay count in event of severe weather Read more\n\nThe Conservatives will campaign to get Brexit done by pushing through Johnson\u2019s deal, while Labour is promising a second referendum to let the people resolve the EU question.\n\nThe Brexit party will try to outgun the Tories by arguing for a no-deal Brexit, while the Lib Dems will seek to attract remain voters from Labour by pledging to revoke article 50.\n\nAlthough parliament voted decisively for an election, many backbenchers in the two biggest parties are extremely nervous about going to the polls at such a politically volatile time and an unusual time of year.\n\nThe Tories under Johnson are about 10 points ahead of Labour in the average polls, roughly half the lead that Theresa May had before she led her party to a disastrous result that saw her lose her majority.\n\nLabour has been deeply split for months about whether to back an election or a second referendum first. In a sign of reluctance on the backbenches, more than 100 Labour MPs abstained and 11 voted against the motion. Those rejecting an election included strongly pro-remain campaigners such as Margaret Beckett, Peter Kyle, David Lammy and Owen Smith, who later said he would be standing down.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the Commons, Corbyn confirmed that the party would back a poll after rejecting one on three previous occasions, after getting confirmation that the EU had granted an extension to article 50.\n\nTories restore party whip to 10 MPs who sought to block no-deal Brexit Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for it, we\u2019re ready for it,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cBecause we want to be able to say to the people of this country there is an alternative to austerity. There is an alternative to inequality. There is an alternative to sweetheart trade deals with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nPolling experts have said the result is likely to be hard to gauge, with the British Election Survey suggesting a third of voters have switched parties in the last two elections.\n\n\n\nThe Tories will be targeting leave-voting Labour marginal constituencies in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, while defending areas of the south-west against the Lib Dems and its seats in Scotland against the SNP.\n\n\n\nLabour will be hoping to build on its successes in 2017 at picking up marginal seats from the Tories, especially in remain-voting urban areas. Corbyn\u2019s campaign will also be bolstered by the leftwing activists in Momentum, who are planning to mobilise tens of thousands of people to knock on doors in marginal seats and launch a \u201cviral video response unit\u201d to reach millions online.\n\nThe Lib Dems have been speaking to the Greens and Plaid Cymru about maximising the chances of pro-remain parties, by standing single \u201cStop Brexit\u201d candidates in certain seats. However, the number of these is likely to be limited.\n\nPaula Surridge, a political sociologist at the University of Bristol, said the 12 December election was \u201clikely to pose key challenges to both the Labour and Conservative parties, both of whom need to improve on their performance in terms of seats, while simultaneously unlikely to match their 2017 vote share\u201d.\n\nDid your MP vote for the 12 December general election? Read more\n\n\u201cWho manages to hold on to the larger part of the 2017 votes is likely to form the next government. Will this be the Brexit election 2017 never quite managed to be? The Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party will be pushing hard to make it so, while Labour are likely to want to talk about almost anything else,\u201d she said.\n\nIn its remaining days of business, the government is planning to hold a debate on the Grenfell Tower fire report and rush through legislation relating to Northern Ireland\u2019s budget. However, it is still unclear whether a vote on the new Commons Speaker will be able to take place on Monday, as many MPs will be heading back to campaign immediately and are likely to be reluctant to return.\n\nThe candidates for the job are split as to whether to press ahead, with Lindsay Hoyle, the favourite, and Meg Hillier, pushing for it to happen, while Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Rosie Winterton and Eleanor Laing, would prefer a new parliament to decide. John Bercow, the outgoing Speaker, could decide to defer his decision to stand down and allow the new parliament to elect his successor.", "description": "Boris Johnson wins vote to secure snap poll at fourth time of asking", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7938781c558f20447f8c70b5f2c41c3f41624134/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=617ae46917fcf762d119cb894954adfd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
