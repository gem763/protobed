She brought to life Vermeer\u2019s anonymous girl in Girl with a Pearl Earring. She made readers fall in love with the young fossil hunter Mary Anning in Remarkable Creatures. This time, she turns her attention to the women who embroidered \u201ckneelers\u201d in Winchester Cathedral so that a century or so of worshippers could pray in comfort. The real-life head-broderer Louisa Pesel plays a part, but it is the fictional character of Violet Speedwell whose thread we follow through the intricate tapestry of this novel.\n\nIt is 1932, and Violet is one of the \u201csurplus women\u201d, left behind after losing her brother and her fiance in the first world war. This was a unique generation of women, \u201cconsidered a tragedy, and a threat\u201d, but their stories feel familiar nearly a century on: their struggles to pay the rent; the pity and suspicion of married peers; the craving for independence tempered by the fear of judgment and harm from men. Violet\u2019s life in Winchester has come at a cost, after she left her overbearing mother to be cared for by her brother\u2019s family: \u201cThe price of her happiness \u2013 no, not happiness; the price of her freedom \u2013 was the misery of at least four people. It was a very high price indeed, and Violet resented having to calculate it in this way. A man never did.\u201d\n\nViolet befriends the broderers, as many of them are forced to rebel against society\u2019s rules in order to enjoy any kind of life or love at all. She bravely helps her friends, Dorothy and Gilda, as they fall in love with each other. She also develops dangerous feelings for Arthur the bellringer, whose wife has never recovered from the death of their son in the trenches. Meanwhile, the wireless reports the rise of the Nazi party in Europe.\n\nThere are times when the stiff fabric of Chevalier\u2019s research shows through the delicate stitches of plot and character, but she creates a convincing picture of the period. Most impressive are the portraits of individual women like Violet\u2019s mother, made bitter and furious by grief, who either pursue their freedom in small acts of disobedience, or quietly stitch their loss into comfort and beauty for generations to come, leaving no mark or memorial other than a neat set of initials sewn into a cushion.\n\n\u2022 A Single Thread is published by Borough (\u00a314.99).
