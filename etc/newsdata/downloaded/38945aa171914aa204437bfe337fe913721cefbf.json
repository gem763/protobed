The war has killed tens of thousands and left millions on the brink of famine in what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. All parties involved have been accused of possible war crimes.\n\nThe UAE, which has a population of one million but sits on the world's seventh-largest oil reserve, has also been criticised by rights groups for cracking down on freedom of speech, arbitrarily detaining its citizens and imprisoning Western academics.\n\nWide-ranging 'political activities'\n\nThe CIP report analysed documents filed under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), a US law that requires agents representing the interests of foreign governments or groups to disclose their relationships and financial arrangements.\n\n\"Though the Emirati's influence operation differs notably from the Saudi's in many ways, both rely heavily on their FARA registered lobbying and public relations firms to brandish their image in the US, and to keep their transgressions out of the public consciousness as much as possible,\" the report's authors wrote.\n\nIn particular, the analysis found that the 20 firms working with the UAE reported carrying out 3,168 \"political activities\" on the Gulf nation's behalf. Such activities are widely defined in the FARA statute and must be reported.\n\nAccording to the report, half of the reported UAE-motivated political actions in 2018 were explicitly related to Yemen, as criticism of US involvement in the years-long conflict grew. The actions included direct contacts with 200 Congressional offices, 18 think-tanks and most mainstream media outlets.\n\nThe report detailed an influence campaign varied in its reach and scope.\n\n190902180555350\n\nIn some instances, agents sent mass-email blasts to legislators containing \"unabashedly\" pro-UAE articles and op-eds. In pushing pro-UAE narratives, other agents regularly contacted, and in some cases met, congress members, reporters at major outlets, representatives of museums and cultural institutions, as well as members of \"prominent and influential\" think-tanks, some of which receive money from the UAE, the report said.\n\nThe analysis also revealed what report authors described as \"the widely divergent levels of transparency amongst FARA registrants\". The FARA statute requires reported political actions to include a \"degree of specificity necessary to permit meaningful public evaluation\" of the steps taken by an agent or firm to achieve a foreign power's objectives.\n\n\"Our analysis revealed that many firms failed to meet this threshold, significantly impairing our ability to evaluate the work they did on behalf of their UAE client,\" the report's authors wrote.\n\nThe influence campaign detailed in the report is only \"the tip of the iceberg\", they noted, adding that they do not address oil and business interests between the UAE and the US, the considerable sums of money Emiratis spend on think-tanks and US universities, or the influence UAE officials have within the inner circle of US President Donald Trump.", "description": "CIP study says the UAE influence operation targeted legislators, non-profits, media outlets and think-tanks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/dbc06be82a574a98b66e025598b21506_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
