Doctors told him his liver, kidney and other organs were shutting down.\n\nAt 25 years old, Fajgenbaum was diagnosed with Castleman disease, a condition that acts like a cross between cancer and an autoimmune disorder. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) there are about 5,000 people diagnosed with Castleman disease in the U.S. each year, making it roughly as common as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, also known as ALS.\n\nPeople who have Castleman disease can experience such things as flu-like symptoms and abdominal pain to the complete failure of multiple organ systems.\n\n\u201cThe diagnosis took about 11 weeks, and most of that time I was in the intensive care unit,\u201d Fajgenbaum told Fox News. \u201cI had a retinal hemorrhage and went blind in my left eye. I gained about 70 pounds of fluid and I was so sick that I had my last rites read to me right around the time the diagnosis was made.\u201d\n\nTEXAS GIRL WHO CONTRACTED BRAIN-EATING AMOEBA DIES, FAMILY SAYS\n\nHaving a rare disease often means limited information and few if any treatment options.\n\nWhen Fajgenbaum was diagnosed with Castleman disease there was only one drug currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but that he relapsed on, leaving him with no other therapy choices.\n\nI promised my dad, my sisters, and my now wife that I would dedicate the rest of my life, however long that may be, to trying to cure this disease \u2014 Dr. David Fajgenbaum\n\n\u201cWhen I relapsed on the only drug in development and my doctor told me that there was nothing coming down the pipeline and there were no promising leads, that's when I promised my dad, my sisters, and my now wife that I would dedicate the rest of my life, however long that may be, to trying to cure this disease,\u201d Fajgenbaum said.\n\nIn a little more than three years, Fajgenbaum relapsed four times, nearly missing death each time.\n\nYet with the help of chemotherapy keeping his disease at bay, Fajgenbaum was able to finish medical school and propose to his college sweetheart. But instead of starting a residency, he founded the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN), to \u201cdrive forward research internationally but also to begin conducting laboratory work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've made a lot of progress in the last seven years since I started the CDCN and we've invested about $1 million into research, which has led to an additional $7 million in external funding from the government and from non-profits,\u201d Fajgenbaum said.\n\nWith experts collaborating together from around the globe and a \u201crelatively limited amount of funding\u201d Fajgenbaum and his organization identified the first novel drug target in 25 years.\n\n\u201cThat drug target that we identified, I actually identified it in my lab using my own samples,\u201d said Fajgenbaum, who is also an assistant professor of medicine in the division of Translational Medicine & Human Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cI started myself on this drug Sirolimus about five and a half years ago and I've been in remission ever since.\u201d\n\nFajgenbaum was the first patient to try Sirolimus as a treatment for Castleman disease, but he and his team will test the treatment in a clinical trial scheduled to begin at the University of Pennsylvania later this year.\n\nFajgenbaum, now 34 years old, with a wife and 1-year-old daughter, chronicled his journey to a cure in a new book, \u201cChasing My Cure: A Doctor\u2019s Race to Turn Hope into Action.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI wrote this book because there's lessons that I've learned about life, lessons about living from nearly dying five times, lessons that hopefully will inspire people to turn their hopes into action and create silver linings in the midst of tough times,\u201d Fajgenbaum said.", "description": "Dr. David Fajgenbaum was a third-year medical student when he suddenly fell ill and was diagnosed with Castleman disease.
