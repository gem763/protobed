And they should be bold enough to pick someone who\u2019s worked to defend civil rights, worker\u2019s rights or reproductive rights,\u201d tweeted Mr. Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice.\n\nDemand Justice, in a statement, noted none of the individuals it\u2019s promoting are corporate lawyers.\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network that backs President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, slammed the liberal group\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cThese people are radicals. This list is a dream come true for far-left activists who seek to turn the courts into a political super-legislature,\u201d Ms. Severino said.\n\nIn its statement touting the list, Demand Justice noted the success Mr. Trump had during his 2016 campaign in releasing a short-list of judicial nominees he would use to fill high court vacancies. The group wants the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee to emulate Mr. Trump\u2019s past strategy.\n\n\u201cDoing so would show their commitment to the Supreme Court as an issue and draw a clear line in the sand about what is at stake in the coming election,\u201d the group\u2019s statement read.\n\nThus far, none of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have provided a list of names they\u2019e considering for federal bench appointments.\n\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg have all suggested they are open to expanding the number of justices on the high court to counterbalance the conservative 5-4 majority on the court.\n\nThat idea was dismissed by liberal-icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in July, who told NPR court packing would make the tribunal look \u201cpartisan.\u201d\n\n\u201cNine seems to be a good number. It\u2019s been that way for a long time,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said.\n\nSCOTUSBlog, a private website created by Washington attorney Tom Goldstein that tracks the Supreme Court, described Demand Justice\u2019s list as diverse, and added it\u2019s an ideal guide for progressives.\n\n\u201cIdeologically, the list is a liberal parallel to the conservative list used by President Trump. The critical difference is that progressives have far less influence in Democratic SCOTUS appointments than conservatives have in Republican appointments,\u201d SCOTUSBlog tweeted.\n\nIn a 2016 exit poll conducted by CNN, 56 percent of voters that backed Mr. Trump said Supreme Court appointments were the \u201cmost important\u201d factor in their vote. Only 41 percent of those who backed Mrs. Clinton said the same.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
