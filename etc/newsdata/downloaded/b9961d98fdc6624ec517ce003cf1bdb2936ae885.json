That\u2019s because Taylor alludes twice to a direct quid pro quo, in which hundreds of millions in military aid to Ukraine are directly conditioned on carrying out Trump\u2019s political bidding.\n\nLet\u2019s first state that you don\u2019t need a direct quid pro quo for Trump\u2019s corrupt conduct to be impeachable. We already know from the rough White House transcript of Trump\u2019s call that he pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cinvestigate\u201d potential political opponent Joe Biden, based on an entirely fabricated narrative, and to substantiate a fringe conspiracy theory undercutting the fact of Russian interference in our election on his behalf.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat we now know, thanks to the full batch of texts, is much worse. Here are three key revelations:\n\nFirst, the texts show that State Department officials, taking direction from the White House, explicitly conditioned a meeting with Trump \u2014 which Zelensky badly wanted \u2014 on Ukraine helping to rig the next U.S. election on Trump\u2019s behalf, by carrying out the investigations Trump wanted.\n\nJust before the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker texted a Zelensky aide to say that he had \u201cheard from White House\u201d that \u201cassuming\u201d Zelensky were to persuade Trump that he will do the investigations, \u201cwe will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSubsequent to this, on the July 25 call, Trump directly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden. This text shows that Volker understood directly from the White House that this was the condition that must be met by Zelensky in order to secure that meeting.\n\nAD\n\nSecond, and importantly, the texts also show that Ukraine understood that the fate of its country\u2019s relations with the United States rested on whether it carried out Trump\u2019s political marching orders to interfere in a U.S. election and investigate Trump\u2019s political opponent.\n\nDuring Ukraine\u2019s efforts to get that meeting with Trump, a top aide to Zelensky texted Volker on Aug. 10 that \u201conce we have a date\u201d for the meeting, Ukraine will outline a \u201cvision for the reboot\u201d of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, \u201cincluding among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s striking. It shows that Zelensky\u2019s aide believed that Ukraine\u2019s relations with the United States \u2014 something that obviously has great significance for that country \u2014 turned on doing the \u201cinvestigations\u201d Trump wanted, both to smear a political opponent and to discredit our own intelligence services\u2019 conclusion about the Russian attack on our political system.\n\nAD\n\nThird, the texts set up a clear line for further inquiry that will likely produce even more damning revelations. They strongly suggest that Trump made hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine directly contingent on that country doing his political bidding.\n\nOn Sept. 1, as Ukraine was still trying to get that meeting with Trump, there was this exchange between Taylor and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union:\n\nAD\n\nTaylor: Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations? Sondland: Call me\n\nNote that Taylor says the security assistance is also conditioned on doing Trump\u2019s bidding. And then, on Sept. 9, Taylor again raises this concern, texting Sondland that he worried that holding up the security assistance was sending a terrible \u201cmessage\u201d about the steadfastness of U.S. support to Ukraine, and, crucially, to Russia as well. After this, Taylor texted:\n\nAD\n\nAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\n\nSondland flatly rejected this categorization, saying there was no quid pro quo on Trump\u2019s part, then signed off.\n\nBut the key here is that Taylor had a reason for saying these things. Something he witnessed, heard, or knows made him think there was such a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cTaylor articulates his overwhelming sense that there is a shakedown and a quid pro quo in the making,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, told me. \u201cAnd he clearly protests to try to stop the sellout of U.S. foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRaskin added that Taylor was basically a direct witness to \u201cthe president\u2019s attempt to turn U.S. foreign policy into an instrument of his reelection campaign.\u201d\n\nThis would seem to suggest that Democrats can learn a lot more from Tayor, if they can question him directly. \u201cI hope that Congress and the American people get a further chance to hear from Mr. Taylor,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nAD\n\nAgain, you don\u2019t need the quid pro quo for all this to be impeachable. But these texts are clearly a signal that there is still a lot more to learn \u2014 and that it could be still worse than we know.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s telephone conversation on July 25 was the culmination of a whole process by which Trump and [Rudy] Giuliani tried to coerce the Ukrainian government to do their political bidding,\" Raskin told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the shakedown in plain view. But all of the telltale signs of a quid pro quo are all over this operation.\"\n\nAD\n\nAnd to think that the impeachment inquiry is only just beginning.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump is now publicly abusing his oath of office\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Not too fast, not too slow. Democrats have to get impeachment just right.\n\nKathleen Parker: Nearly everything Trump does is close to illegal.
