Give me a break!", "language": "en", "text": "Mainstream media are outraged over a meme video depicting President Donald Trump shooting his critics \u2013 but they absolutely loved the movie it was based on, and think nothing of actual violence committed against Trump supporters.\n\nAll of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again, as the media mob pursues rage clickbait. This time, the hand-wringing and pearl-clutching is over a meme \u2013 excuse me, \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cdoctored\u201d \u2013 video shown during the American Priority Conference at Trump Doral in Florida this weekend.\n\nAlso on rt.com Media uproar as VIDEO depicting Trump massacring news orgs shown at conservative event\n\nReactions to the video go way beyond what cartoonist Scott Adams has described as seeing \u201ctwo movies on the same screen.\u201d One liberal comedian \u2013 entirely seriously \u2013 zeroed in on Trump \u201ckilling powerful black people\u201d to lament the \u201ccancer that is Trumpism.\u201d\n\nActress Kathy Griffin \u2013 who once thought it was a great idea to do a photoshoot with a fake severed head of Trump \u2013 now claimed she was the real victim, as the video shows her \u201cbeing murdered\u201d by the president.\n\n\u201cWaiting for Donald Trump to condemn the video of him committing mass murder that was shown at his resort to his supporters, and to apologize to the families of those targeted,\u201d anti-gun crusader Shannon Watts tweeted unironically.\n\nWaiting for Donald Trump to condemn the video of him committing mass murder that was shown at his resort to his supporters, and to apologize to the families of those targeted. #trumpvideohttps://t.co/U4M2ukY5sE \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 14, 2019\n\nOne possible explanation is that none of the people getting worked up over the video have ever watched \u2018Kingsman:The Secret Service,\u2019 that the meme was based on. The 2015 \u201caction spy comedy\u201d revolves entirely around over-the-top cartoonish violence juxtaposed with English gentility \u2013 such as the protagonist of that specific scene going berserk inside a church, along with everyone else, due to the effects of an electronic weapon.\n\nI've learned a few things today\n\n\n\n1. Journalists have never seen the movie Kingsman\n\n\n\n2. Journalists are just now learning of a video that is over a year old\n\n\n\n3. It's a Youtube video, the story is that at a resort Trump supporters were watching Youtube videos satirizing Kingsman https://t.co/KQqYQwzJPY \u2014 Tim Pool (@Timcast) October 14, 2019\n\nMovie critics and audiences alike \u2013 74 percent and 84 percent, respectively \u2013 loved the movie and had no problem with American churchgoers getting massacred in that scene, as journalist Lee Stranahan pointed out.\n\nWorth pointing out that the media didn't seem to have a problem with the original cut of the film where the people being killed were stereotype redneck white Christians.\n\n\n\nOr am I missing something? https://t.co/b4SYB8andu \u2014 \ud835\ude7b\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude82\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude97 \u23f3 (@stranahan) October 14, 2019\n\nMore to the point, the same people shrieking now have not bothered to notice the video since it came out in July 2018. So why now? Was there nothing else at the conference they could object to, so some outrage had to be manufactured, and memes were it?\n\nPatrician media et al. are raging over the stupid parody video at Trump Miami only because they can use it to attack him. It was part of a \"meme exhibit\" in a room next to the back kitchen that was entirely empty. It had nothing to do w/his campaign. pic.twitter.com/k00MNx99WK \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) October 14, 2019\n\nBefore long, Twitter was suspending Carpe Donktum, the pro-Trump memesmith who did not even make the video, but defended its display as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kingsman video is CLEARLY satirical and the violence depicted is metaphoric. No reasonable person would believe that this video was a call to action, or an endorsement of violence towards the media,\u201d he said in a statement on Monday.\n\nExcept that people who consider themselves special and above reproach or critique have stopped being reasonable long ago.\n\nThe original Kingsman scene didn\u2019t make waves because it\u2019s ok for aristocrats to joke about killing peasants\n\n\n\nThe #TrumpVideo is beyond the pale because it\u2019s not ok for peasants to joke about killing aristocrats \u2014 Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) October 14, 2019\n\nOne does not have to be a conservative pundit to point out the obvious hypocrisy. The New York Times sponsoring a theatrical production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u2018Julius Caesar\u2019 depicting Trump getting assassinated; Griffin\u2019s ISIS stunt; music videos depicting Trump getting murdered \u2013 all fine in the media playbook, because free speech, First Amendment, and so on. But when some anonymous \u201cpeasant\u201d in \u201cflyover country\u201d dares meme a video turning the tables? Red alert!\n\nRemember when the same people furious about the #TrumpVideo, that President @RealDonaldTrump had nothing to do with, were also furious at this video by Snoop Dogg? Me either. pic.twitter.com/v7PbslvoBZ \u2014 Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) October 14, 2019\n\nHere's how Marylin Manson depicted President Trump in the teaser for his \"Say10\" (Satan) music video. No outrage by the liberal media then. pic.twitter.com/5dMEJOw0SL \u2014 Mark Dice (@MarkDice) October 14, 2019\n\nFor all the media rhetoric about Trump \u201cinciting violence\u201d against journalists, actual political violence in the US has overwhelmingly consisted of Trump critics targeting his supporters \u2013 with the June 2017 shooting of Republicans training for the congressional baseball charity game being the deadliest example.\n\nThroughout, the same media now shrieking about incitement have peddled conspiracy theories about Trump\u2019s \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cRussian collusion\u201d and imminent threat to \u201cour democracy\u201d that have actually done more to sow discontent and division among Americans than anything they\u2019ve blamed alleged \u201cRussian trolls\u201d for.\n\nNot to mention that they were perfectly fine smearing and demonizing American citizens, living and working in the US, as \u201cRussian agents\u201d just because they worked at outlets like RT or Sputnik. Wasn\u2019t that an attack on journalists, or is it different when they do it?\n\nTaibbi again focusing on the deeper regime dynamics: \u201cAmericans [aren\u2019t] used to waking up in a country where you\u2019re not sure who the president will be by nightfall. They don\u2019t understand that this predicament is worse than having a bad president.\u201d https://t.co/V3jTRuo0IZ \u2014 Patrick Deneen (@PatrickDeneen) October 13, 2019\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve had enough of this stone-throwing by inhabitants of glass houses \u2013 and I get a feeling a lot of my fellow Americans have as well. As Matt Taibbi observed just the other day, this country has been dragged into a state of perpetual coup, courtesy of the political establishment in Washington and their media enablers, out to get Bad Orange Man at any cost \u2013 even if it means destroying the country.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand memes, maybe journalism is not for you, and it\u2019s time to find honest work.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT", "description": "Mainstream media are outraged over a meme video depicting President Donald Trump shooting his critics \u2013 but they absolutely loved the movie it was based on, and think nothing of actual violence committed against Trump supporters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da4cc1785f5400ca544bb41.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
