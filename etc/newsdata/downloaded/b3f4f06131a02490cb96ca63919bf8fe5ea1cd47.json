They targeted the Turkish Ministry of National Defence and Ministry of Energy and National Resources, as well as the leaders of those two agencies and the head of the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria White House officials stand by Syria withdrawal, sanctions delay amid bipartisan pushback Trump: Treasury 'ready to go' on sanctions against Turkey: 'Stay tuned' MORE told reporters at the White House that the U.S. was prepared to issue licenses so that the sanctions do not deprive the Turkish people of their energy needs.\n\n\"As we've warned all along, our desire is not to shut down the Turkish economy. Our desire is to see an appropriate response,\" Mnuchin said. \"These sanctions will be very severe on the Turkish economy. We can continue to ramp up these sanctions.\"\n\nBut withdrawal still a go: Trump made clear in his statement and tweets that preceded it that he was committed to withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria, a decision that set the stage for Turkey's offensive and one that has drawn sustained criticism from Republicans in Congress.\n\nMoments before announcing the sanctions, Trump tweeted that the U.S. should not be responsible for defending the Syrian border or protecting the Kurds. He suggested that Syrian President Bashar Assad, China or Russia could be responsible for those roles instead.\n\nIn the sanctions announcement, Trump said a \"small footprint\" of U.S. forces will remain at the Tanf garrison in southern Syria \"to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.\"\n\nAt the Pentagon: In a statement shortly after Trump's statement, Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Army officer calls Syria pullback 'a stain on the American conscience' MORE released his own statement on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\n\"Due to Turkey's irresponsible actions, the risk to U.S. forces in northeast Syria has reached an unacceptable level. We are also at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict,\" Esper said. \"Therefore, at the president's direction, the Department of Defense is executing a deliberate withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from northeast Syria.\"\n\nEsper had announced Sunday the withdrawal would be expanded to nearly all 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria, up from the 50 U.S. originally said would be relocating from two outposts to elsewhere in Syria.\n\nIn his Monday statement, Esper also said he will be visiting NATO next week in Brussels, where he plans \"to press our other NATO allies to take collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions.\"\n\nIn Congress: Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden on impeachment: 'I'm the only reason' it's happening Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Rand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter MORE (D-Calif.) said on Monday that she and Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Army officer calls Syria pullback 'a stain on the American conscience' MORE (R-S.C.) agreed on the need for a resolution overturning Trump's decision on Syria, as well as additional sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\"Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President's dangerous decision in Syria immediately,\" Pelosi said in a string of tweets about the phone call.\n\nReadouts from both Pelosi and Graham did not mention a deal on specific legislation but centered on a broader agreement that additional sanctions were needed.\n\nGraham, in a separate tweet, said that Pelosi supports \"bipartisan sanctions against Turkey's outrages in Syria. She also believes we should show support for Kurdish allies and is concerned about the reemergence of ISIS.\"\n\n\"I will be working across party lines in a bicameral fashion to draft sanctions and move quickly, appreciating President Trump's willingness to work with the Congress. The Speaker indicated to me that time was of the essence,\" he continued.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Republicans wrestle with impeachment strategy Mattis warns 'ISIS will resurge' without U.S. pressure on Syria MORE (R-Ky.) said he is \"gravely concerned\" about the U.S. strategy in Syria and warned that the withdrawal of U.S. troops would create a \"power vacuum\" in the region.\n\n\"I am gravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation's apparent response thus far,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\n\"Withdrawing American leadership from this pivotal region would not serve our nation's short-, medium-, or long-term interests. It would only make a troubling situation much worse, not only for regional partners such as Israel and Jordan but for the United States as well,\" he continued.\n\nAt State: The State Department has begun pulling some U.S. diplomats from northern Syria amid the Turkish military offensive, a State Department official confirmed to The Hill on Monday.\n\nThe official said personnel on the department's Syria Transition Assistance Response Team had moved out of Syria on Sunday to other offices in the region \"where they will continue to monitor programming remotely.\"\n\n\"The situation on the ground is very fluid and at this time, our stabilization implementing partners are reviewing their security postures and adjusting or suspending their activities as they deem appropriate,\" the official said.\n\nThe department's Syria Transition Assistance Response Team operates in Syria and Turkey and is responsible for implementing U.S. assistance efforts to Syrians.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that the U.S. government had begun evacuating a small number of diplomats from the region amid the Turkish onslaught.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT - BOEING\n\nNext-gen technology for missions of the future:\n\nSupporting the H-47 Chinook Block II enhancements will lift the nation above any challenge for decades to come.

She declined reporters' requests for comment.\n\nHill's attorney, Lee Wolosky, confirmed that his client had received a subpoena and intended to answer questioning from members. She is the first former White House official to agree to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nHill was expected to detail a \"shadow foreign policy\" pursued by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiRand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter Sunday shows \u2014 Officials rush to Trump's defense on Syria, sanctions Cruz: 'Of course' it's not appropriate to ask China to investigate Bidens MORE and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nGaetz tries to crash: Rep.

And at that time, I had to depart.\"\n\nGaetz said he left voluntarily.\n\nWhile the House Judiciary Committee had led the charge in the Democrats' investigation of Russian election interference, three different committees -- Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs -- have taken the baton since the focus has shifted to questions surrounding Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nGaetz, a Judiciary Committee member, argued that not being on the panels leading the inquiry should not preclude him from sitting in on Hill's testimony.\n\nUp next: Sondland is set to testify Thursday in compliance with a congressional subpoena.\n\nSondland plans to tell Congress that a text he sent denying a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call was dictated by Trump himself, the Washington Post reported Saturday.\n\nThe Post reported that a source familiar with the ambassador's planned testimony told the newspaper that Sondland plans to testify that Trump told him in a phone conversation to tell the acting ambassador to Ukraine that he didn't \"want a quid pro quo ... didn't want anything from Ukraine\" in exchange for military aid.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT - BOEING\n\nH-47 Chinook Block II \u2014 Supporting the soldiers:\n\nThe enhanced capabilities and performance of Chinook Block II will prepare troops of today for missions of the future.
