The hosts pressed intelligently, staying compact and moving as a unit.\n\nThe first-half ended level, leaving the league's bottom side still without a first-half goal this season. Those early positives spilled into the second period, though, and Sampdoria continued to contain the visitors.\n\nRanieri's side surrendered control of the match to the visitors but matched them for half-chances on the break, as both sides struggled to connect the final ball.\n\nA late red card for Justin Kluivert after a poor tackle left Roma to survive with 10-men for the final minutes. Samp pushed forward but their heavy legs let them down after a battling, hard-working performance.\n\nMatch facts Sampdoria (4-4-2): Audero, Bereszynski, Murillo, Colley, Murro, Rigoni (Depaoli), Viera, Bertolacci (Ekdal), Jankto, Gabbiadini (Bonazzoli), Quagliarella Substitutes not used: Augello, Chabot, Barreto, Ramirez, Caprari, Maroni, Ferrari, Leris, Flacone.
