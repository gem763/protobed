Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who suggested the move would have dire consequences for the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster,\u201d Romney tweeted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary Pompeo. If press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making,\u201d said Graham.\n\nNonetheless, President Trump dismissed critics of his decision, stating it is time for the U.S. to halt fighting \u201cridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN,\u201d he vowed.", "description": "President Donald Trump warned Turkey that he will \"totally destroy and obliterate\" if it engages in activities deemed \"off limits\" in Syria.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-996241728-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
