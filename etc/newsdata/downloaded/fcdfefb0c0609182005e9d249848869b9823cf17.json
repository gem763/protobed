Yep. It looks like it\u2019s actually happening.\n\nREAD MORE IT BEGINS: A Dutch YouTuber Has Been Arrested Near Area 51 After Trying To See Them Aliens\n\nNope, it\u2019s not just an internet meme, people are legitimately preparing to storm the top secret US military base. Terrifying, I know.\n\nThe original Facebook event was deleted back on August 3 after a whopping 2 million people clicked attending, but a number of subsequent event pages have been set up to remind us all to save the date.\n\nThe town of Rachel, which is home to 50 people and not even a grocery store, has been filled with weirdo internet people that are adamant that the government \u201ccant stop all of them\u201d if they storm the top secret military base tomorrow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening. We already have people from all over the world,\u201d owner of Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, Rachel\u2019s only business, said.\n\nYes, that is Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn. Little Alien. Hilarious. Love it.\n\nThe Alien Research Center has a new sign up greeting visitors and one that reads \u2018I stormed Area 51\u2019 ahead of Friday\u2019s Area 51 Basecamp kickoff. #stormarea51 #area51 pic.twitter.com/uar7I84Zqf \u2014 Mick Akers (@mickakers) September 18, 2019\n\nWell, folks. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the US military absolutely can and will stop all of you, likely with guns.\n\nDumb internet trends often spill over into real life, but usually it\u2019s not quite as dangerous as an undisclosed number of people trying to trespass on one of the most highly guarded properties in America and probably the whole world.\n\nBut the danger and completely rational fear of being shot by a security guard isn\u2019t enough to stop these meme-lovers from Naruto-running their way to an early grave.\n\nOver two million people have clicked \u201cattending\u201d for the obviously satirical Facebook event, but not everyone understands the joke.\n\nPeople are already flocking to the area, likely will full intentions of storming. Stupid, I know. Potentially lethal even. But they\u2019re doing it. And there are a lot of them.\n\nDespite numerous warnings, a small percentage of the people who clicked attending are actually camping out and preparing to, you guessed it, storm Area 51.\n\nJust when you thought the internet could produce anything more ridiculous, this shit happens.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Nevada, or planning on attending the events, please do not storm the place. They have guns. BIG ONES. And they\u2019re not afraid to use them. For your own safety, please don\u2019t Naruto run, storm or attempt to enter Area 51.\n\nthe day had finally come, storm area 51 is happeningggg! ctto. pic.twitter.com/rfGRPcprHI \u2014 name cannot be blank (@crljshcabs) September 20, 2019\n\nA group of people and law enforcement at the back gate of Area 51 near 3 am. #area51 #StormArea51 pic.twitter.com/pMz90zRtyJ \u2014 Mick Akers (@mickakers) September 20, 2019\n\nHere because a 21-year-old college student made an online joke at 2 a.m. over the summer. #StormArea51 pic.twitter.com/EtiST3uqkL \u2014 David Montero (@DaveMontero) September 19, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s that epic naruto runner on loop#StormArea51 #LiveFromTheArea51Raid pic.twitter.com/595YvnGUqq \u2014 Area 51 is a decoy to a bigger secret (@gingerbreadheau) September 20, 2019\n\nBut if the thought of people risking their lives for a stupid internet meme has you feeling down in the dumps, here are some more humorous memes to take your mind off it.\n\n#Area51 guards when they realize all us crackheads and naruto runners werent joking and are assembling #StormArea51 pic.twitter.com/sN2NCyOI3f \u2014 ???????? ???????????????? ????????????
