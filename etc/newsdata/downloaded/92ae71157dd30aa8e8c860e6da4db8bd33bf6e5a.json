Chandrayaan-2 is the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) second lunar probe. It is comprised of three modules, an Orbiter, a Lander called Vikram, and a Rover called Pragyan. The Orbiter has a terrain mapping camera to help prepare 3D maps of the moon's surface, an X-ray spectrometer looking for major elements including titanium and sodium, and another high resolution camera to help the other modules land safely. Vikram has an instrument to detect seismic activity on the moon, and a thermal probe that will examine the thermal conductivity of the lunar surface. Pragyan has an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer that examines the elemental composition of the surface and a laser induced breakdown spectroscope which looks at the abundance of various elements nearby. The entire mission has cost around 10 billion rupees (\u00a3120million).\n\nNASA said in a tweet: 'Our @LRO_NASA mission imaged the targeted landing site of India\u2019s Chandrayaan-2 lander, Vikram.\n\n'The images were taken at dusk, and the team was not able to locate the lander.\n\n'More images will be taken in October during a flyby in favorable lighting.'\n\nOn September 8, the Press Trust of India reported that the ISRO had located the lander but is yet to see direct visual evidence of its position.\n\nNASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter scanned more than 92 miles of the area where Vikram was supposed to touch down, in hope of spotting the lander.\n\nHowever, NASA did caveat its sombre announcement by saying that it was dusk when it took the photos on September 17 and Vikram could be hidden in shadow.\n\nThe orbiter is due to pass over the site again in October, when the space agency expects more favourable lighting might reveal Vikram's resting place.\n\nThe Indian mission was an attempt to look at permanently shadowed moon craters for signs of water, following its Chandrayaan-1 launch in 2008.\n\nOfficials previously confirmed it is still in one piece and is currently lying on the lunar surface in a tilted position but communication had not been reestablished.\n\nThe $140 million mission's lander failed in its attempt to reach the surface of the moon just 2.1km (1.3 miles) from the ground.\n\nAn official told the Press Trust of India today: 'It had a hard-landing very close to the planned (touch-down) site as per the images sent by the on-board camera of the orbiter. The lander is there as a single piece, not broken into pieces. It's in a tilted position.\n\n'We are making all-out efforts to see whether communication can be re-established with the lander.'\n\nVikram was supposed to land on a high plain between two craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N, which are around 70\u00b0 south.\n\nChandrayan-2 (pictured) successfully released its rover, Vikram, from the orbiter and sent it towards the moon earlier this month\n\nStudent walk past a screen during a live streaming of Chandrayaan-2 landing at an educational institute in Mumbai, India, September 7, 2019 before it crashes\n\nNASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (pictured) scanned the intended landing site Looked at more than 92 miles of the area where Vikram was supposed to be\n\nAn official statement from ISRO earlier in the week of the attempted landing said all the systems controlling the Vikram lander and its rover, Pragyan, were 'healthy'\n\nFrom there, the six-wheeled rover Pragyan would spend two weeks exploring an uncharted region and carrying out topographical studies, mineralogical analyses and other experiments in a bid to help the world gain a better understanding of the moon's origins.\n\nChandrayaan-2, was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that contain water deposits, which was confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008.\n\nThe latest mission lifted off on July 22 from the Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, an island off the coast of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nAfter its launch, Chandrayaan-2 spent several weeks making its way towards the moon, ultimately entering lunar orbit on August 20.\n\nThe Vikram lander separated from the mission's orbiter on September 2 and began a series of braking manoeuvres to lower its orbit and ready itself for landing.\n\nThere's now much uncertainty as to what actually happened as Vikram got closer to the surface.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was filmed consoling visibly distraught ISRO staff after they lost contact with the lander on Friday night.\n\nIn a subsequent formal address to the scientists and the nation, he hinted that the lander might have travelled at a higher-than-expected speed and crash landed on the moon.\n\nIndia's Moon mission: Chandrayaan-2 was intended to be a ground-breaking mission to the south pole of the moon and hoped to land on a high plain between two craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N, which are around 70\u00b0 south\n\nIsrael attempted to land on the moon earlier this year but the mission ended in disaster when the Beresheet spacecraft fell into an uncontrolled descent\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) says it plans to analyse the data to find out what went wrong.\n\nPrime Minister Modi, who was present at the ISRO centre, told scientists : 'There are ups and downs in life ... What you have accomplished is no small achievement.'\n\nHe added: 'If historians some day write about today's incident, they will certainly say that inspired by our romantic description of the moon throughout life, Chandrayaan, in the last leg of the journey, rushed to embrace the moon.'\n\nModi said that though India 'came very close' it needs to 'cover more ground' in the times to come. 'I can proudly say that the effort was worth it and so was the journey.'\n\n'We are full of confidence that when it comes to our space program, the best is yet to come,' Modi said.\n\nSivan had earlier described the final moments of the landing mission as '15 minutes of terror,' due to the complexities involved with lunar gravity, terrain and dust.\n\nISRO also sent an orbiter to space with the mission, which will continue to make observations around the moon.\n\nThey hoped to release a rover after the landing, which would then spend a fortnight \u2013 a single day in moon time \u2013 exploring.\n\nThe lander was named Vikram after the father of India's space program, Vikram Sarabhai.", "description": "It was part of India's Chandrayaan-2 mission which had hoped to make history and turn the country into just the fourth nation to successfully land on the moon.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/11/19005148-0-image-a-16_1569579066022.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
