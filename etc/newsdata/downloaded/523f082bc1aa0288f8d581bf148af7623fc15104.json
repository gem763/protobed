Some reach out into the distance, waiting for an arm to hold on to.\n\nDwayne, the M.C., has been the voice of these skate nights since the \u201980s; he runs around with fluorescent sunglasses bouncing on his forehead, greeting everyone he sees as if they\u2019re family.\n\n\u201cA lot of us learned to skate here,\u201d says Chris Douglas, an organizer, as people file onto the rink. \u201cThis is our home. I\u2019ve been in this skating rink for over 20 years. It has kept me and my friends off the streets and out of trouble.\u201d\n\nTonight is the start of Snap City, an annual event that draws skaters from all over the region. This is its eighth year, and the first back at Shake and Bake since it closed for renovations in 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s 1 a.m. at Shake and Bake Family Fun Center, a recreational facility with a skating rink and a bowling alley, and none of the skates have been rented. Everyone here tonight brought their own, which they wear like natural extensions of their bodies.\n\nHe gestures at a building to our left and says he\u2019s aiming to buy it. Its windows are worn-down boards, and the door is nailed shut. Mr. Watkins wants to make it what it once was: a community center. Something for the kids in the neighborhood to have to themselves.\n\nWhile lining up for an elbow jumper, Mr. Watkins points at my shoes and tells a short story of how Baltimore\u2019s voracious appetite for the Nike Air Force One saved the silhouette from extinction in the \u201970s. He talks about buying back parts of his old neighborhood so that it can be saved by the specter of gentrification.\n\nMr. Watkins walks with a slow but easy gait. He shoots on an empty hoop opposite the game, which has begun to resemble two bodies leaning into each other for the sake of some rest. His shooting form is that of someone who once played well. He did, in high school, before giving up the game.\n\nThis is his neighborhood, down the hill. The former N.B.A. All-Star Sam Cassell used to play here, Mr. Watkins says. All of the Baltimore basketball legends came through this park. In the grass beyond the basketball hoops, a youth football team prepares for the first game of the season. The pop of small helmets colliding blends with the percussion of the rattling orange halo when met with another wayward jump shot.\n\nOn the basketball court at Frank C. Bocek Park in East Baltimore, a haphazard game of one-on-one unfolds. After a long, high arching jump shot, the ball careens off the rim and spins to a corner of the court. One of the players lazily sighs before jogging after it, and the scene repeats itself. The writer D. Watkins watches from a bench, rolling a basketball back and forth with his designer sneakers, at one point shouting, \u201cAll y\u2019all gonna do is shoot jump shots?\u201d then throwing his head back and laughing.\n\nPeople endure, Mr. Pinkett says, children sprinting through the grass around us. He isn\u2019t too focused on the rhetoric beyond the city limits. He sighs when even considering it. \u201cYou know, my mother used to teach me this scripture: What our adversaries mean for evil, God will turn around for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problems we\u2019re facing here aren\u2019t just law-enforcement issues,\u201d he says, speaking of Baltimore broadly. \u201cYou can\u2019t arrest your way out of these. You\u2019ve got to give people jobs. You\u2019ve got to make sure kids are getting educated.\u201d\n\nAdults stroll by, dabbing the sweat from their foreheads and occasionally bobbing along to the music. Leon F. Pinkett III serves this district \u2014 the seventh \u2014 and is present today in an oversized blue T-shirt and a baseball hat, its bent brim hanging over his eyes.\n\nSandtown-Winchester Achievement Academy opened this year, after two of the district\u2019s schools merged. The hope is that, as one institution, the students will benefit from better funding.\n\nPizza boxes are emptied almost as quickly as they are introduced to the eager hands holding empty plates. It\u2019s all part of a school-supplies drive organized by Elev8 Baltimore, a nonprofit that offers educational resources for children in grades five through eight and their families.\n\nStudents spill out of the opening of a slide, their laughter reverberating off the plastic. Some get their faces painted, roses blooming out of the corners of their eyes. Backpacks are piled up near the D.J. booth, where 2000s-era rap hits play.\n\nIn the early Friday evening hours teeming with possibility, the humidity spills slow and thick over West Baltimore. So heavy that even moving through the air calls for purposeful steps. But on the playground at Sandtown-Winchester Achievement Academy, the mood is light.\n\nWe traveled from Baltimore to Hilton Head, S.C., talking to local leaders, educators and small-business owners about the importance of community, especially among black Americans.\n\nUnity Days, a weeklong event that is part of a push for education about racial and economic injustice in Charlottesville, draws members of the community seeking conversation and entertainment.\n\nWhen she arrives at the front, in the center of the pews, she begins to move with the music and take the flag along with her, its gold streaking through the sunlight clawing its way in through the stained glass. This unfolding of the body\u2019s freedom, in time with a holy song, sends the congregation to its feet, clapping and singing along. A small child sneaks some pens out of his mother\u2019s purse while she is enraptured by the scene and begins drawing on church fliers, seemingly oblivious to the floor trembling beneath him.\n\nInside, the service is about to begin. Mr. Bowmaster helps the older members of the choir onstage before they break into song. The pews fill with late arrivals who fall directly into the tune\u2019s embrace before even putting their items down. If you were to fall too deep into the song or the movements of the choir, you might find yourself unlucky enough to miss the young black woman strolling slowly down the center of the aisle with a gold flag swinging at her back.\n\nA woman in a coat and winter hat bounds happily up the church steps, yelling a greeting and \u201cgood luck on the race!\u201d to Deacon Gathers over her shoulder. When I ask him if he\u2019s running a race, he shrugs and tells me he isn\u2019t before a small grin emerges from the corner of his face. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier to just smile and say \u2018O.K.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe congregation is mighty and the church is doing fine, but there are concerns about attendance. A large portion of this, Deacon Gathers says, comes down to a single issue: parking. The church doesn\u2019t have its own lot, but it has an agreement with the train station for now. Members can park there on Sundays and Wednesdays. But it\u2019s a bit of a walk from the lot to the church steps, and for the aging members of the congregation, making that walk can be difficult, especially when there's weather. Also, the lot is for sale.\n\nOutside his work at the church, Deacon Gathers is a Black Lives Matter activist. Not far from where we stand, talking and wiping off our sweat on the church steps, there is the newly named Heather Heyer Way. The alley\u2019s brick walls are decorated with chalk spelling out broad and optimistic messages about hope and love. Deacon Gathers held a sunrise worship service on the morning of the protest two years ago. \u201cWe had 300 to 400 people packed in here at 6 in the morning on a Saturday,\u201d he says. \u201cJust to worship and prepare ourselves to look the devil in the eye.\u201d\n\nComfort with the unfamiliar isn\u2019t a luxury in black churches anymore, not after 2015, not after 2017, not even if the unfamiliar faces are also black ones. Still, people are quick to open their arms wide for hugs, letting their hands linger afterward to say God bless you.\n\nThis is an old black church; its congregation first organized in 1864. Worshipers have gathered in this building on West Main Street since 1831. Originally it was put up with mud walls, Deacon Gathers says.\n\nDeacon Donald Gathers wants to talk outside, even with the sun here climbing to its most ferocious peak. Some of it has to do with noise. But it must also be said that the members of the congregation oscillate between unencumbered warmth and a type of skepticism or concern.\n\nHe is one of the congregation\u2019s few white members present today, and the only white member of the choir. When asked about his vocal skill, he replies modestly. \u201cI\u2019m just showing up every week and trying to do my best,\u201d he says.\n\nPeople come in and shout with the familiarity of family members. A woman walks in to order wings, and Mr. Walker playfully laughs \u2014 \u201cyou again?\u201d \u2014 while scribbling her order down on a notepad. Danny Glover has been in here, he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t really care none about who people call celebrities. I treat everyone the same.\u201d\n\nMel\u2019s Caf\u00e9 has been in this same location for 35 years. Mel Walker, the owner, still shows up for 14-hour workdays and cooks in the kitchen. But now there\u2019s a sprawl of fancy brick establishments in the neighborhood: vintage shops, fancy restaurants and hotels. Mr. Walker shrugs. \u201cIt happens everywhere, I guess.\u201d\n\nWhen gentrification is talked about, it is most often in relation to material loss \u2014 the things that people can see and attach themselves to. A building was here, and now it is not, or a home has become something different. What weighs heavier among displaced people is a severing of lineage and community.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Vinegar Hill\u2019s land became valuable to Charlottesville, given its proximity to both downtown and the University of Virginia\u2019s campus. The city took a vote on whether to demolish and rebuild the area; many of its residents couldn\u2019t pay the poll tax, so they couldn\u2019t vote. In 1964, it was decided that the neighborhood would be bulldozed. The following year, the entire neighborhood was reduced to a pile of rubble. Black families were assigned to various public housing complexes by the city.\n\nMel\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is just west of what was once called Vinegar Hill, the oldest black neighborhood in Charlottesville, Va. Former slaves set down roots in the area after the Civil War; Vinegar Hill began to blossom during Jim Crow, when businesses elsewhere in the city wouldn\u2019t serve black customers. The area became a center of black social life, with its music venues and barber shops and markets.\n\nFor Dr. O\u2019Neal and Dr. Scarlett, closing Bennett isn\u2019t on the table. The college has had its feet to the fire before. But the bonds are too strong. Dr. Scarlett still talks to her old college roommate, after 65 years. Women still pack the perfectly manicured lawns of Bennett during anniversaries or commencement events. As the Bennett motto goes: \u201cEducation for the future, sisterhood for life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have made some key assumptions that have led to some real struggles at registration time,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Neal says, assumptions about technological and financial literacy. \u201cFinally I said in leadership meeting, \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019re making the assumption that these people have computers. We\u2019re making the assumption that they know how to get on a computer and fill out these forms. We\u2019re making the assumption that parents know how to fill out the form for the Parents Plus Loan,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had issues with homeless students, who come here and then don\u2019t have anywhere to go at the end of the spring semester. But we\u2019re not going to decide to not take these students.\u201d\n\nNow Bennett\u2019s student body is mostly made up of what Dr. O\u2019Neal calls \u201cemerging scholars\u201d \u2014 people who struggled academically in high school and could use a fresh start. Ninety-eight percent of them are on financial aid to cover its $28,000-per-year tuition costs. Many of Bennett\u2019s students and alumnae have been the first in their family to go to college. The college can\u2019t afford to lose any of them.\n\nIn the \u201970s, when predominantly white institutions, or PW.I.s, began integrating, they took only \u201cthe cream of the crop,\u201d Dr. Scarlett says, and gave them full scholarships. By the end of that decade, enrollment had dipped at historically black colleges and universities, including at Bennett; the resources P.W.I.s could offer, in comparison, were hard to pass up.\n\n\u201cMay I remind you, women weren\u2019t generally being educated when Bennett started, not to mention black women,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were coming out of Jim Crow, moving into a period of desegregation, Bennett knew that we had to produce women leaders. What they were instilling in us, as ladies, as Bennett women, was that something that said there are boundaries here, you owned my parents and my grandparents, but you can\u2019t own me. We are ladies. At minimum, we had to be bicultural, at that time. We had to know how to negotiate a segregated society, and we had to know how to do it with grace, dignity, authority, but also expertise.\u201d\n\nBennett has a new president, Suzanne Walsh, who is tasked with seeing the college through this latest difficult stretch. She is traveling today; Gwendolyn Sneed O\u2019Neal, who served as interim president, joins us in her place. She is now the chief operating officer at the university. She points out that the struggles of Bennett, in some ways, are rooted in its history, and the place it started from.\n\nWhen the news of the college\u2019s fight to stay accredited broke, a fund-raising effort took off; through local donations and a wide-reaching social media campaign, the school raised $8.2 million, exceeding its $5 million goal. Bennett then filed a lawsuit against S.A.C.S.; a judge allowed its accreditation to stay in place while the legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe current state of Bennett College is dire. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed Bennett on probation in 2016. In December of 2018, S.A.C.S. voted to withdraw Bennett\u2019s accreditation, based on its declining enrollment (about 300 students, compared to 700 in 2010) and consistent financial hardship.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat unclear what her role is now. (\u201cI do a PowerPoint,\u201d she says, for new student orientation. \u201cThough I have to change it from time to time.\u201d)\n\nAll of this is told to me by Mary Anne Scarlett. She is 87 years old and wears a hat with a brim wide enough to cradle all of the sunlight that might otherwise spill onto her face. She has been a fixture of Bennett\u2019s campus since 1929, when she was 9 months old and her father was hired as the first superintendent of buildings and grounds.\n\nFive years later, Lyman Bennett, a businessman living in Troy, N.Y., who\u2019d made his money as a manufacturer of high quality collars, got word of the upstart college in Greensboro, and went to visit it. He donated $10,000, which allowed the school to purchase land and erect its first building. Shortly after his donation, Bennett died of pneumonia, the school carrying his legacy and his name.\n\nBennett began as a school for freed slaves. In 1873, a man named Matthew Austin placed an ad in the Greensboro paper, calling for black people to meet about the establishment of a school. The people came, so the school was established.\n\nThe women at Bennett don\u2019t walk on the grass. They stick to the concrete paths that make a grid around the Greensboro, N.C., campus. It\u2019s so they don\u2019t get used to taking shortcuts, says Ebony Duell, a journalism student entering her senior year.\n\nSetting foot on Bennett College\u2019s campus, one might first notice the immaculately manicured grass that stretches in front of all the old brick buildings.\n\nCharlotte, NC\n\nThe sound of a motorcycle\u2019s engine drowns out the quiet noises of meandering families and couples walking in and out of restaurants in a shopping center near the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\n\nChris London III of the Silverback Kings motorcycle club.\n\nAs the engine\u2019s sound dissipates, slightly, the sound of Ren\u00e9 & Angela\u2019s 1985 hit \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d emerge from the motorcycle\u2019s speakers. Atop the ride is Chris London III, who \u2014 with his helmet low and large, dark sunglasses covering his eyes \u2014 casts a briefly intimidating energy that dissolves the minute he hops off his bike and smiles wide, shouting loud greetings over the music pouring out of his speakers. Mr. London, 40, is tall and broad-armed, his muscles pulling the fabric on the sleeves of his black T-shirt. He is the founder of the Silverback Kings; the club\u2019s patch adorns the back of his sleeveless leather jacket, and his nickname (\u201cBreeze\u201d) is stitched on the front. Mr. London is a transplant, celebrating his fifth year in Charlotte. He\u2019s originally from Youngstown, Ohio, and played defensive back at Ohio University in the late \u201990s and early 2000s. He has the warmth and joyful patience of a Midwesterner. A man strolls up to us and asks if any of us watch the N.F.L., before attempting to sell us some of his handmade key chains. Mr. London inspects his wares eagerly, before a small bit of concern spreads across his face. \u201cWell I\u2019m a Browns fan,\u201d he says, rubbing the side of his face. And then, earnestly, \u201cIf you come back with a Browns one, I\u2019ll support you. Come back to this lot and find me. I\u2019m around.\u201d Mr. London started riding about a decade ago, on his 30th birthday. He purchased himself a bike as a gift, despite some initial anxieties. His father was a rider but wasn\u2019t in his life, he says. The bike was a way to feel closer to him.\n\nRage, a member of the Silverback Kings motorcycle club.\n\nThe Silverback Kings are an all-black motorcycle club, though Mr. London is quick to mention that they don\u2019t discriminate. \u201cWe\u2019d take a member of any racial background if they were a good fit,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut so far, only black men have been interested in joining up with us.\u201d They have seven members in total, and as we\u2019re joined by Rage, the club\u2019s vice president, they both say that they simply find themselves very selective. They\u2019ve both been in motorcycle clubs that have crumbled from infighting and mismanagement. \u201cI\u2019m big on quality over quantity,\u201d says Rage, who is 49 and has been riding for nearly 20 years. \u201cYou got some of these groups out here bringing in members who don\u2019t even have bikes!\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get our numbers up like that. First rule is, you gotta have a bike. You gotta have a sense of commitment. You gotta treat your friends, family, and loved ones right. We can work with you from there.\u201d Asked about misconceptions that the group gets saddled with locally and abroad, the two men look at each other knowingly. Mr. London pauses contemplatively before responding. \u201cLook, I mean we all \u2026\u201d he begins. \u201cWe all give back to the community. We all do Christmas toy drives, and we just did a back to school drive. We all shave and try to look approachable. But still, the first question we get is about whether or not we\u2019re a gang. We still see people trying to keep their kids away from us when we pull up to a place.\u201d He sighs, before smiling a bit and tugging at his jacket. \u201cBut I guess there\u2019s some stuff we\u2019ll never be able to change on our own. We just gotta keep doing our best.\u201d\n\nOutside of Blue Blaze Brewing on the west side of Charlotte, the rain is picking up. It\u2019s the kind you wait out, in a car or under some awning. As the water cascades down our rental car\u2019s windshield, a man across the street from where we\u2019re parked stands under his roof as shelter, with his hands on his hips, cursing his newly soaked land.\n\nPouring rain in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nMalcolm Graham is inside the brewery, holding a small meet-and-greet for his City Council campaign. Mr. Graham represented District 40 in the State Senate from 2004 to 2015. In 2016, he sought election to the House to represent the 12th congressional district, but lost to the incumbent, Alma Adams.\n\nWhen Justin Harlow, District 2\u2019s current council member, announced that he would not be seeking re-election, Mr. Graham saw an opening. More than 60 percent of the district\u2019s voters are black, and more than half are registered Democrats. The district begins in Charlotte\u2019s Center City and extends west. It is home to more than 100,000 people who are experiencing the rapid gentrification of Charlotte, especially those living in the historically black neighborhoods of the west side.\n\nAmazon has been growing its footprint in Charlotte since its first facility in the region opened in 2014. By the end of this year, an 855,000-square-foot robotics distribution center will open on the west side. Rent has risen along with the commercial and residential redevelopment; people who have lived in the neighborhood for years simply cannot afford to stay any longer.\n\nMr. Graham is 56, and has lived in Charlotte for the past 38 years, most of them in this district. We talk outside, with the rain slowed to a gentle tremor along the brewery\u2019s metal roof. He embodies the passionate speak of a politician, but also the exhaustion of someone who has seen a city change at the expense of his neighbors. \u201cThe city can\u2019t grow out anymore,\u201d he tells me, gesturing toward the gleaming, rain-slick streets.\n\nMalcolm Graham, a Democrat running to represent District 2 on Charlotte\u2019s City Council.", "description": "A year before the election, we drove through the South, meeting with religious leaders, small-business owners, educators, farmers and local representatives to talk about what brings us together.", "authors": ["Photographs Andre Wagner", "Text Hanif Abdurraqib"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/fashion/ROADTRIP-RACE-KINGSTREE-NEW/ROADTRIP-RACE-KINGSTREE-NEW-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
