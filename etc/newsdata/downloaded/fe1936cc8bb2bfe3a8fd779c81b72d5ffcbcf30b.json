Its share price has lost 9% since the strike began, slicing more than $4 billion from the automaker's market value.\n\nThe stoppage has also led to $155 million in lost federal income and payroll tax revenue and $9.1 million in lost Michigan income tax revenue.\n\nTalks for a new four-year labor contract took a \"turn for the worse\" on Sunday after the UAW rejected GM's latest offer but the two sides were still talking.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Dominic Roshan K.L. in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Tom Brown)", "description": "The strike at the No. 1 U.S. carmaker began on Sept. 16, with its 48,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker's profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
