The youth shakes his head, unable to speak because he has been gagged.\n\nEven by Brazilian standards of racism and cruelty, the whipping of the boy after he was caught stealing four bars of chocolate from a S\u00e3o Paulo supermarket has caused deep shock.\n\nCellphone footage of the boy\u2019s ordeal has been widely shared, and many \u2013 including the detective investigating the case \u2013 have drawn comparisons with the country\u2019s treatment of black people during three centuries of slavery.\n\n\u201cIt is like a scene from centuries ago,\u201d said detective Pedro Luis de Souza, describing the victim as \u201ca defenceless, homeless black man ... A victim of society, I would say.\u201d\n\nBrazil grapples with lynch mob epidemic: 'A good criminal is a dead criminal' Read more\n\nScenes of thieves \u2013 often young black men and teenagers \u2013 being tied up, tortured and even murdered are common in Brazil.\n\nEven so, de Souza said he was \u201cextremely shocked\u201d when a journalist sent him the video on Monday afternoon. He began an inquiry, interviewed the victim and identified the two security guards.\n\nThe youth said he was stopped after leaving the supermarket by guards who found he had stolen chocolate. \u201cThey tied him up and whipped him until he promised to not do it again,\u201d de Souza said, adding that the crime of torture carries a prison sentence of up to eight years.\n\nThe youth, who has not been named, told TV Globo the guards threatened him.\n\n\u201cThey said if I spoke to anyone, they would kill me,\u201d he said, adding it was the third time he had been assaulted by the same two security guards after stealing from the supermarket.\n\nIn a statement, Ricoy said the two security guards from a subcontracted company were no longer working at the supermarket. \u201cWe were shocked by the gratuitous and meaningless torture on a teenage victim,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will give all the support needed.\u201d\n\nBlack Brazilians said the scene in the video demonstrated how deeply rooted racism is in Brazil, where more than half of the population identify as black or mixed race.\n\nIt was \u201clike the gates of hell had been opened and the demons of Hades come to parade in public. It\u2019s not an isolated incident. But it was filmed,\u201d said Humberto Adami, a black lawyer from Rio de Janeiro and president of the Brazilian bar association\u2019s Black Slavery Truth Commission.\n\nThat guards filmed the torture showed how sure they were they would not get caught, Adami said: \u201cAll this is connected to the slavery past in Brazil where blacks were whipped night and day.\u201d\n\nDjamila Ribeiro, a black writer, philosopher and television presenter, said the video showed how institutionally racist Brazil was. In 2017, 75% of Brazil\u2019s 65,000 homicide victims were black or mixed race.\n\n\u201cBrazil is still a country with slavery mentality, a colonial country. We need to debate colonialism in Brazil,\u201d she said. \u201cBrazil is in reality an extremely violent country for the black population.\u201d", "description": "Footage of gagged child prompts comparisons to treatment of black people during three centuries of slavery", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/998b8fe6c7f6f0de140bb3632dc7e637d7395f33/749_263_2071_1243/master/2071.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd70464a21c595e54c8fd221b71aa133"}
