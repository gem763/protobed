All of these features are seen as assertive and markers of virility\n\nFirst author Dr DongWon Oh, from Princeton University, said: 'Our research sheds light on the pernicious gender bias in how we perceive others.\n\n'We judge masculine looking people as competent - a judgement that can affect our leadership choices.'\n\nHigh levels of testosterone lead to the ultra-masculine look of George Clooney or Idris Elba, whereas less of the hormone produces the softer features of Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt.\n\nIncreased testosterone levels was found to be directly correlated with perceived competence in men.\n\nHowever, the same trait in women created a view that they were 'inefficient'.\n\nDr Oh said this is important as it affects who we choose to lead us and how we see them.\n\nFor example, previous studies have shown individuals with rugged jawlines are more likely to become high-ranking politicians or heads of large companies.\n\nBut Dr Oh said: 'Problematically, how competent someone appears does not guarantee their actual competence.\n\n'Needless to say these gender biases pose a threat to social justice - creating unfair environments for everyone.'\n\nMembers of the general public were asked to rate images of people based on competence and found that people rated someone as more competent if they were male and less competent ones as female\n\nWHAT IS TESTOSTERONE? Testosterone is the male sex hormone and is mostly made in the testicles, but also in adrenal glands, which are near the kidneys. It causes the voice to deepen, body hair to grow and the genitals to become larger during puberty. As well as affecting sex drive and sperm production, it also plays a role in developing strong bones and muscles, and how the body distributes fat. Women also create small amounts of the hormone in the ovaries and adrenal glands, and it affects their fertility and bones and muscles. Testosterone levels which are too high or too low can cause various problems. Low testosterone in men can cause erection problems, low sex drive, infertility, weakened muscles and bones, body fat gain and hair loss. Too much testosterone, however, can trigger puberty in boys under the age of nine, is linked to aggression, and can increase the risk of prostate problems, including cancer. Male testosterone levels tend to be highest when he is around 20 years old, and decline naturally with age.

Researchers say the study also highlights the prejudice ingrained in society that women face on a daily basis\n\nHigh levels of testosterone lead to the ultra-masculine look of George Clooney or Idris Elba (pictured) and less produces the softer look of Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt\n\nAnother online test revealed a clear gender bias. When asked to identify the gender of faces participants tended to rate more competent looking ones as male.\n\nFinally the researchers manipulated 'photo-realistic' images of male and female faces so they varied in masculinity and got 250 participants to rate their competence online.\n\nAgain, the data suggested a gender bias in first impressions. As male faces increased in masculinity, so did their perceived competence.\n\nFor female faces this relationship only held up to a point - after which more masculine female faces were actually perceived as less competent.\n\nDr Oh and colleagues hope to expand on the study published in Psychological Science by exploring the origins of this gender bias and how it could be combated.\n\nThey are also investigating whether there are systematic differences in the impressions we have of male and female faces.", "description": "A researcher from Princeton University in New Jersey has found that testosterone levels and masculine features are directly related to the perception of a man's talent.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/10/13/7238492-0-image-a-36_1544450188389.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-10"}
