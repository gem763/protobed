Trump has helped rehabilitate him on the world stage.", "language": "en", "text": "The world leaders\u2019 embrace of Mohammed was a clear signal that the young prince, who the CIA, U.S. allies and a United Nations investigator say is responsible for the savage killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was being welcomed back, if reluctantly, into the community of nations. And it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the support of Trump and his secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.\n\nCIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassination\n\nWednesday will mark one year since Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist, was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents in that country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. Mohammed, who rose to power promising transformational social and economic change in one of the world\u2019s most strategically important countries, and who was praised by prominent writers and American executives as heralding a bright future for Saudi Arabia, quickly became a pariah.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump and Pompeo, however, never distanced themselves. They emphasized the kingdom\u2019s strategic importance.\n\nFor Trump, the value of that relationship boiled down to dollars. He has never sugarcoated the grisly nature of the slain columnist\u2019s death. But he has repeatedly described the Middle East as a \u201cvicious\u201d place, excusing Khashoggi\u2019s death as an unfortunate event not worth the cost of abandoning a lucrative market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not like a fool that says, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do business with them,\u2019 \u201d Trump told NBC News in July. \u201cAnd by the way, if they don\u2019t do business with us, you know what they do? They\u2019ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPompeo, who has not been so blunt, has made public promises that the United States would investigate Khashoggi\u2019s death and hold all responsible parties accountable. After a meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince in January, Pompeo said they \u201creiterated their commitment to achieve the objective, the expectations we set for them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThose promises remain unfulfilled.\n\n\u201cTo all appearances, Pompeo\u2019s strategy right from the beginning has been to salvage the U.S.-Saudi relationship and rehabilitate Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s reputation in Washington as a valuable ally against Iran,\u201d said David Ottaway, a Gulf expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cU.S. and Saudi officials have been playing the same game of hoping the controversy over Jamal\u2019s murder will die with time or be overtaken by other more immediate events, like the brazen Iranian drone-and-missile attack on Saudi oil facilities\u201d this month, Ottaway said. In response to those attacks, which U.S. officials say emanated from Iran, Trump ordered U.S. troops to defend Saudi oil fields.\n\nPompeo has arguably succeeded in his goal of stabilizing the U.S.-Saudi relationship and bringing Mohammed back into the fold. Headlines about Khashoggi\u2019s killing have faded. A trial of Saudi officials, called a mockery of justice by observers, carries on behind closed doors.\n\nAD\n\nMohammed has been on his own public relations tour. In a recent interview with PBS, he took responsibility for the killing as the leader of his country but made no admission about his suspected role.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,\u201d Mohammed said, according to a preview of the interview, which has not been broadcast yet. On Sunday night, an interview with Mohammed is set to air on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nState Department officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, defended Pompeo by pointing to the visa restrictions he ordered last year on 21 individuals connected to Khashoggi\u2019s slaying and, as one official said, the secretary\u2019s push for \u201ca fair and transparent judicial process without undue delay.\u201d\n\nThe visa restrictions ensure that the 21 individuals may not travel to the United States, a punishment lampooned by critics as pointless given the unlikelihood that any of the suspects would risk doing so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNeither the Saudi government nor the White House responded to requests for comment.\n\nA Saudi dissident living in the United States who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a fear of retaliation, said the Saudi government weathered the furor over Khashoggi\u2019s killing because the Trump administration stood by Mohammed.\n\n\u201cI think they got away with murder,\u201d the dissident said.\n\nA trial held in secret\n\nThe Trump administration has done little to shed light on Saudi Arabia\u2019s opaque system of justice. One year after Khashoggi\u2019s death, not a single Saudi official has been found guilty or punished.\n\nA trial of 11 Saudi officials, which began in early January, drags on. Journalists and the public have been barred. Foreign diplomats have been allowed to attend, on the condition they do not disclose details from the proceedings. They include representatives from the United States and other U.N. Security Council members, along with Turkey, according to Saudi officials.\n\nThe Saudi government has not named the defendants. Agnes Callamard, a human rights expert at the United Nations, obtained a list from government sources that included Maher Mutreb, a Saudi intelligence officer, Salah al-Tubaigy, an autopsy specialist who is accused of dismembering Khashoggi\u2019s body, and Ahmed al-Assiri, the former deputy chief of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intelligence agency. Five of the defendants, including Mutreb and Tubaigy, are said to be facing the death penalty, according to Callamard\u2019s report on Khashoggi\u2019s killing, which was released in June.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to Mohammed who is accused of having helped plan the operation that led to Khashoggi\u2019s killing and assuring the plot\u2019s participants that the journalist was a great threat to the kingdom\u2019s national security, is not a defendant in the trial, according to Callamard and other people familiar with the proceedings. The Saudi government has refused to answer questions about his status or whereabouts since announcing he had been fired from his job as the crown prince\u2019s media adviser.\n\nHis exclusion has led to accusations that the Saudi government is prosecuting lower-level enforcers to placate the kingdom\u2019s international detractors. \u201cThe trial underway in Saudi Arabia will not deliver credible accountability,\u201d Callamard wrote in her report.\n\nFears fulfilled\n\nThe Trump administration portrays Khashoggi\u2019s killing as a crime that hasn\u2019t been solved.\n\n\u201cWe continue the search for every fact and detail we can that might broaden our knowledge of those involved and their role in this brutal act,\u201d the State Department official said.\n\nBut the CIA has not changed its assessment from November that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing, according to two U.S. officials. That assessment, first reported by The Washington Post, is the U.S. government\u2019s most definitive link between Mohammed and the murder. At the time the assessment was completed, Trump said erroneously that the CIA had not reached that conclusion, and he implied that the matter was still under investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLong before Khashoggi\u2019s death, intelligence officials had been worried about Mohammed\u2019s rapid ascent in Saudi leadership. Before he became the crown prince and heir to the throne, they saw him as a direct threat to Mohammed bin Nayef, who ran the Saudi interior ministry and was an exceptionally close partner to the CIA and U.S. counterterrorism officials.\n\nIn the aftermath of Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Saudi influence machine whirs on in Washington\n\nSome intelligence officials judged Mohammed bin Salman as threat to their connections to the Saudi power structure and doubted he would act in accordance with U.S. interests. They saw Mohammed as undisciplined and tempestuous, and they believed he had an overly simplistic view of power dynamics in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cHe has an elevator speech, and it all comes down to Iran as the source of all problems,\u201d one U.S. intelligence official said before Mohammed became the crown prince. This official, echoing the concern of other observers of Saudi-U.S. relations, worried Mohammed would lead astray Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who was put in charge of devising a Middle East peace strategy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMohammed and Kushner have had private meetings that alarmed U.S. officials. There is no known record of their discussions, which diminished the U.S. side\u2019s understanding of whether Mohammed may have tried to influence Kushner and U.S. policy, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nSince then, some officials believe their fears have been proved well-founded. The United States is locked in a precariously tense standoff with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main enemy, and Mohammed continues a bloody war in Yemen that has caused humanitarian suffering of historic proportions.\n\nTrump's support comes at a price\n\nThe Trump administration has helped rehabilitate Mohammed on the world stage. But that support has come with a political price.\n\nFollowing Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Republicans in Congress broke with the administration over U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen.\n\nAD\n\nIn April, Trump was forced to veto a bipartisan resolution to force an end to U.S. military involvement. It was a rare rebuke from Republicans who have stood by Trump through a seemingly endless stream of controversies.\n\n\u201cThe backlash [against Saudi Arabia] was well underway,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official and longtime observer of U.S.-Saudi relations. Lawmakers already had misgivings about the war in Yemen and recoiled at some of Mohammed\u2019s other strong-arm campaigns, including a blockade of Qatar, a key U.S. ally, and a shakedown of his political rivals in Riyadh under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSenate rebukes Trump with vote ordering U.S. military to end support for Saudi-led war in Yemen\n\nBut Khashoggi\u2019s killing broke the dam. \u201cI think [Trump] wouldn\u2019t be facing this strong opposition on the Hill without the Khashoggi affair,\u201d Riedel said. A massive defense spending bill pending in Congress would restrict U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and require the administration to make a public report about Khashoggi\u2019s death. If those provisions remain, Trump could be faced with having to veto military spending, one of his key policy priorities, to stand with Mohammed.\n\nWhile in the short-term Mohammed appears ready to reemerge, the long-term prospects for the kingdom are shaky, and his opponents may be looking forward to that day. \u201cSaudi Arabia is no longer an American national cause for all parties, but is now linked with Trump\u2019s support only,\u201d the Saudi dissident said. \u201cSo as soon as Trump loses or his time ends, it seems that the pressure on Saudi will be severe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the memory of Khashoggi has not faded. His killing remains a rallying cry for human rights activists. His story is the subject of continuing fascination by journalists and filmmakers. Trump may want to forget about Khashoggi, but the world has not.\n\n\u201cHis ghost,\u201d Riedel said, \u201chaunts Saudi Arabia to this day.\u201d\n\nKareem Fahim in Istanbul and Sarah Dadouch in Beirut contributed to this report.", "description": "One year after Khashoggi\u2019s killing, not a single Saudi official has been found guilty.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XE0IU5O4w7blKszQgxtgJ6o0i3U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/URTIMWXU6MI6RLXKXBP5IRCJ6U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
