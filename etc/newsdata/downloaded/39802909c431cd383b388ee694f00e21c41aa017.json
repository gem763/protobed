I think Pete might know it,\" she replied before pausing to think what the answer could be.\n\nShe finally added: \"I don't think this is right, but I'm gonna go for it because I think Pete knows it anyway. I'm gonna go with Anne Frank.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBut the teacher looked confused and clearly had no confidence in her answer.\n\nFans of the show were quick to point out that they were \"appalled\" by Steph's answer and she should have known better with her profession.\n\nOne furious viewer tweeted: \"So Steph is a teacher and she thinks Anne Frank is a made-up character in a book. Says a lot about the state of the education system in this country\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnother was left puzzled: \"She was a teacher?! I didn't see the intro. I was absolutely appalled by the Anne Frank answer. Shameful for anyone over the age of about ten never mind a teacher.\"\n\nA third piped in: \"Steph might be put before those governors tomorrow\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnd a fourth added: \"She was a Teacher?? You're having a laugh?\"\n\nBut contestant Pete jumped in and guessed the correct answer, as he said: \"I can think of Heidi,\" as Ben came to him for a response.\n\nSteph didn't win the question and confessed: \"I knew that was wrong, I couldn't think of anybody else.\"", "description": "Tipping Point fans were left speechless by the teacher's ludicrous answer", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700764.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tipping-Point-contestant-thinks-Anne-Frank-is-made-up-character.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
