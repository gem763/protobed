DeAndre Hopkins hauled in nine passes for 55 yards.\n\nNone was bigger than his last, when the Texans star made a sliding grab on fourth-and-3 from the Kansas City 27 with just under two minutes to go. That allowed Houston to run out the clock and deal the Chiefs (4-2) their second consecutive loss \u2013 both at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nMahomes, who was selected two spots ahead of Watson in the 2017 draft, finished with 273 yards passing and three touchdowns, though he also threw his first interception of the season.\n\nStar wide receiver Tyreek Hill returned to action for the first time since Week 1, when he broke his collarbone, to catch five passes for 80 yards and two of the Chiefs\u2019 scores.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a pretty game for either side. The teams combined for 21 penalties totaling nearly 150 yards, and that didn\u2019t include close to a dozen flags that were offsetting, overruled or declined.\n\nIt was Kansas City that started hot, engineering drives of at least 90 yards twice in the first quarter. Hill finished the first with a 46-yard reception \u2013 the first TD throw in a first quarter by Mahomes since Week 1 \u2013 while Damien Williams finished the second with a 14-yard TD catch.\n\nIn between, Hyde coughed up the ball on Houston\u2019s first offensive play.\n\nBut the big running back soon atoned for his mistake. Hyde battered the Chiefs\u2019 porous run defense the rest of the game, punctuating a big first half with a short touchdown run.\n\nThe Texans then took the lead into the locker room after Mahomes was strip-sacked with 20 seconds left and Houston recovered, and Watson waltzed into the end zone on the very next play.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the last time he reached pay dirt.\n\nMahomes hit Hill again in the third quarter to give the Chiefs the lead back , but the Houston quarterback answered with a 12-play, 93-yard drive consuming more than 8 1/2 minutes. By the time he spun into the end zone and converted the 2-point try, the Texans had a 31-24 lead with 6:17 to go.\n\nKansas City went three-and-out on its next possession, and a defense that has been maligned for most of Andy Reid\u2019s tenure with the Chiefs failed to make a stop once again.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles 20-38 Minnesota Vikings\n\nKirk Cousins threw to Stefon Diggs for three of his four touchdowns, racking up a season-high 333 passing yards as the Minnesota Vikings ravaged the Philadelphia Eagles secondary in a 38-20 victory Sunday.\n\nDiggs scored on plays in the first half that covered 51 and 62 yards, becoming the first player since Randy Moss in 2000 to post two touchdown receptions of 50-plus yards in one game for the Vikings (4-2).\n\nHis most important catch came late in the third quarter, a double toe tap in the back of the end zone from 11 yards out that pushed the lead to 11 points after Carson Wentz and the Eagles (3-3) had pulled within 24-20 with 17 straight points.\n\nCousins went 22 for 29 with one sack and one interception that was, oddly enough, Diggs\u2019 fault when a sideline throw hit him in the hands, bounced off his helmet and into the air behind him for former Vikings safety Andrew Sendejo to pick off late in the second quarter.\n\nThe sure sign that this was not the Eagles\u2019 day came right after that, when coach Doug Pederson called a fake field goal from the 21 with 20 seconds left in the half. The snap to Jake Elliott left the kicker with only one receiver, well-covered tight end Dallas Goedert, and the desperation throw was tipped by Anthony Harris and intercepted by Everson Griffen.\n\nThe Eagles have been badly missing starting cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Avonte Maddox, and Cousins took full advantage with a first half that looked at times like passing drills against the scout team.\n\nAdam Thielen made a slick double move to beat Sidney Jones for a textbook fade throw by Cousins for a seven-yard touchdown to cap the opening drive. After Diggs blew by Rasul Douglas on a post route in the second quarter to put the Vikings up 17-3, he gave Cousins a hearty hug on an all-smiles sideline.\n\nSeattle Seahawks 32-28 Cleveland Browns\n\nChris Carson scored on a one-yard touchdown run with 3:30 left, Russell Wilson threw two TD passes and ran for one and the Seattle Seahawks rallied for a 32-28 win Sunday over the mistake-prone Cleveland Browns and improved to 3-0 on the road for the first time in 39 years.\n\nThe Seahawks (5-1) gave up touchdowns on Cleveland\u2019s first three possessions before storming back.\n\nWilson connected with Jaron Brown for two scores, and Seattle\u2019s cool quarterback scampered 16 yards for a TD. The Seahawks last won their first three road games in 1980, when they went 4-12.\n\nThe Browns (2-4) were hurt by their own miscues. They couldn\u2019t overcome four turnovers, a blocked punt or quarterback Baker Mayfield\u2019s hip injury and fell to 0-3 at FirstEnergy Stadium.\n\nMayfield threw three interceptions, raising his NFL-leading total to 11. Trying to bring the Browns back late, Mayfield, who went to the locker room in the third quarter to be evaluated, was picked off by Seattle\u2019s KJ Weight with 2:41 remaining.\n\nThe Seahawks defenders celebrated the game-clinching turnover in front of Cleveland\u2019s Dawg Pound section and were pelted with cans and other debris.\n\nWilson then ran out the clock as the Seahawks moved to 5-1 for the third time.\n\nCarson\u2019s short TD burst capped an efficient 79-yard drive by Wilson, who showed his usual poise and precision after the Browns had taken a 28-55 lead on Nick Chubb\u2019s three-yard TD run.\n\nWilson finished 23 of 33 for 299 yards and stayed error-free. He has yet to throw an interception this season, and to this point, the eight-year veteran is outplaying every other QB in the league.\n\nMayfield, on the other hand, is struggling. He completed 22 of 37 passes for 249 yards, but he forced several throws and made a deliberate attempt to get the ball to Odell Beckham, who finished with six catches for 101 yards.\n\nCarson gained 124 yards on 24 carries for the Seahawks, who lost tight end Will Dissly in the first half with an Achilles injury.\n\nChubb had 122 yards on 20 attempts.\n\nEven after the Browns scored on their first three drives and opened a 20-6 lead, Wilson wasn\u2019t rattled.\n\nHe hung in the pocket and took a big hit from linebacker Joe Schobert while completing a 17-yard TD pass with 22 seconds left in the half to pull the Seahawks within 20-18. Seattle\u2019s 2-point conversion failed, but the Seahawks were back in it after the Browns got greedy moments earlier.\n\nInstead of running the ball, first-year coach Freddie Kitchens called a pass play and Mayfield forced one into the end zone that was behind Jarvis Landry, tipped and intercepted by safety Tedric Thompson.\n\nMayfield\u2019s first career TD run put the Browns up 14-6 in the first quarter. With no receivers open, Mayfield, who hasn\u2019t been running as much as he did as a rookie, took off and scored without the Seahawks laying a hand on him.\n\nThe TD scamper came just two plays after Mayfield converted on fourth-and-7 with a 27-yard pass to Landry.\n\nCincinnati Bengals 17-13 Baltimore Ravens\n\nLamar Jackson rambled, shimmied and passed his way through the winless Bengals, who were rendered powerless against the versatile and seemingly indestructible Baltimore quarterback.\n\nJackson ran for a career-high 152 yards and a touchdown, threw for 236 yards and guided the Ravens past hapless Cincinnati 23-17 on Sunday.\n\nAlternatingly jutting left and right, up the middle and occasionally toward the sideline, Jackson carried 19 times (including three kneel-downs at the end). Tapering off his forays downfield at the end, Jackson finished tantalizingly short of Michael Vick\u2019s single-game record of 173 yards rushing by a quarterback.\n\nJackson now has three career 100-yard rushing games, tied with Billy Kilmer for most by a quarterback in his first two seasons since 1950. Jackson\u2019s first 100-yard game came last November, in his first NFL start against the Bengals.\n\nIn this one, Jackson avoided trouble when possible but also took a few hard hits when forced to stay between the hash marks. Each time, he popped up with enthusiasm, ready to do it again.\n\nRegardless of where Jackson went, the Bengals (0-6) were usually a step behind.\n\nJackson was also adept when throwing, going 21 for 33 without an interception.\n\nCincinnati jumped on top when Brandon Wilson took the opening kickoff 92 yards for a score, but Jackson responded quickly. Baltimore (4-2) finished with 497 yards of offense, and the Ravens retained sole possession of first place in the AFC North.\n\nThe Bengals, meanwhile, remain in search of their first win under first-year coach Zac Taylor.\n\nAndy Dalton went 21 for 39 for 235 yards and scored on a 2-yard run with 1:28 left. But Cincinnati failed to a produce an offensive touchdown over the first three quarters in a third straight game.\n\nBaltimore compiled a 212-6 advantage in yardage and an 11-0 margin in first downs during the first quarter. Jackson led the way with 106 yards through the air and 85 on the ground.\n\nThe Ravens scored touchdowns on each of their first two possessions, a 21-yard run by Jackson and a one-yard plunge by Mark Ingram. The quarter ended just before Justin Tucker kicked a 40-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead.\n\nLate in the half, the Bengals moved to the Baltimore 21 before Marlon Humphrey intercepted a deflected pass. The Ravens gave it back when tight end Mark Andrews fumbled while trying to hurdle a defender, and Cincinnati cashed in with a field goal.\n\nNew Orleans Saints 13-6 Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nTeddy Bridgewater found Jared Cook for a four-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and the New Orleans Saints held on to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 13-6 on Sunday and improve to 4-0 without injured starter Drew Brees.\n\nComing off a 300-yard, four-touchdown performance against Tampa Bay, Bridgewater was less effective against the Jaguars (2-4). But he did enough for New Orleans\u2019 defense, which turned Minshew Mania into Minshew Mayhem.\n\nMinshew was sacked twice, hurried often and threw his first interception as a starter. The rookie sensation completed 14 of 29 passes for 163 yards and was held without a touchdown for the first time this season. His worst outing came on the same day the team, in conjunction with the NFL, handed out 30,000 \u201cMinshew mustaches\u201d as fans entered the gates.\n\nBridgewater was 24 of 36 passing for 240 yards for the Saints (5-1). He picked up a first down on a quarterback sneak in the closing minutes to seal the victory.\n\nMichael Thomas had eight receptions for 89 yards, and Alvin Kamara finished with 31 yards rushing while playing through an ankle injury.\n\nLeonard Fournette ran for 72 yards, ending a two-game streak of reaching the century mark on the ground.\n\nJacksonville finished with a season-low 226 yards. The Jaguars had a chance late, but Minshew threw incomplete on a fourth-and-2 play from the New Orleans 40-yard line.\n\nWashington 17-16 Miami Dolphins\n\nRookie Terry McLaurin caught two touchdown passes and Washington stopped Miami\u2019s two-point conversion attempt with six seconds left for a 17-16 victory Sunday in a matchup between winless teams.\n\nAdrian Peterson more than doubled his season rushing total with 118 for Bill Callahan in his first game as interim coach. Washington intercepted Josh Rosen twice and sacked him five times before he was benched at the start of the fourth quarter with the Dolphins trailing 17-3.\n\nRosen\u2019s replacement, Ryan Fitzpatrick, sparked a rally and led two touchdown drives, including a 75-yard march that began with 2:02 left. But after Fitzpatrick hit DeVante Parker for an 11-yard score to cut the deficit to one point, rookie coach Brian Flores decided to go for two.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake dropped Fitzpatrick\u2019s quick pass with several defenders between him and the goal line.\n\nWashington (1-5) looked like a different team after firing coach Jay Gruden, but the caliber of the opposition had something to do with that. The Dolphins (0-5) remained winless under Flores but helped their chances of securing the No 1 draft pick in April.\n\nAlthough Miami\u2019s defense had its best effort of the season, McLaurin slipped behind the secondary to catch scoring passes of 25 and 33 yards from Case Keenum, who returned after missing one game because of a foot injury.\n\nMcLaurin, a third-round draft pick who has been one of Washington\u2019s few bright spots this year, totaled four receptions for 100 yards.\n\nCallahan gave Peterson a significant workload as expected, and the four-time All-Pro running back carried 23 times to reach the 100-yard rushing mark for the 56th time.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami\u2019s offense generated few cheers from the half-empty stadium and remained on pace for the lowest-scoring 16-game season in NFL history.\n\nThe Dolphins used six offensive linemen at times and converted two fourth downs, one with special teams trickery. They attempted an onside kick, which was foiled by a penalty.\n\nNothing could reverse their fortunes. Rosen went 15 for 25 for only 85 yards. Fitzpatrick went 12 for 18 for 132, and helped the Dolphins score their first second-half points all year.\n\nBut they never led and have been ahead for only three minutes, 49 seconds this season.\n\nCarolina Panthers 37-26 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nJameis Winston started the day with an interception on Tampa Bay\u2019s first play from scrimmage. He ended it staring into space following his sixth giveaway of the day.\n\nA 400-yard passing day and his 100th career TD pass were overshadowed by the kind of sloppy performance from the No 1 overall pick in the 2015 draft that has become all too commonplace in his five seasons in Tampa Bay.\n\nWinston committed six of Tampa Bay\u2019s seven turnovers on the day and the Buccaneers had another rough stay in London, losing 37-26 to the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSometimes I do want to do great things,\u201d Winston said. \u201cBut you can do great things but protect the team at the same time.\u201d\n\nWinton failed to do that on a day when he was under heavy pressure behind a makeshift offensive line that had backups Josh Wells and Earl Watford starting on the right side. He was sacked seven times, hit on two of his career-worst five interceptions, and lost the ball on one of his two strip-sacks on back-to-back plays.\n\nBut the tone was set on the opening snap when Winston tried to fit in a pass to Mike Evans only to see James Bradberry step in for the interception that set up a field goal for Carolina.\n\n\u201cOne play can\u2019t be the outcome of the whole game,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI have to do a better job of snap and clearing and playing better.\u201d\n\nBut he was unable to do that even after the Bucs got back into the game with a touchdown run by Ronald Jones II in the second quarter following a Carolina turnover.\n\nWinston then was hit on an interception on Tampa Bay\u2019s next drive, setting up a Panthers touchdown that made it 17-7 and the deficit never got into single digits the rest of the way. Then with Tampa Bay driving late in the first half, Winston was strip-sacked on successive plays when he held onto the ball too long, leading to yet another turnover.\n\n\u201cThrow the damn ball away,\u201d coach Bruce Arians said. \u201cHe has a habit of trying to be Superman. That\u2019s been a problem in the past. The fumbles haven\u2019t occurred this year until today. But again, trying to make something out of nothing. It\u2019s just a matter of knowing when to quit on a play.\u201d\n\nAn interception in the third quarter set up another Panthers touchdown that made it 27-7 and the Bucs were unable to overcome that.\n\nWinston started putting up some big numbers late with a pair of TD drives in the fourth quarter and finished with his second career 400-yard game, along with TD pass No 100 to Cameron Brate.\n\nBut he also threw two more interceptions on the final two drives, giving him six giveaways for the game and an NFL-worst 86 since entering the league in 2015. He has five games with at least four turnovers while no other player in that span has more than two.\n\n\u201cI see the preparation, I see what he\u2019s trying to do,\u201d Arians said. \u201cThe fumbles, we have to get rid of those. We have to start throwing balls away. And we don\u2019t have to take those sacks, you don\u2019t take those hits either. The interceptions, I have to go back and look at the film where the ball was going and how it got there. I know that on one his arm was hit, the last one was just a prayer.\u201d\n\nWinston\u2019s struggles weren\u2019t the only problems for the Bucs, who fell to 0-3 all-time in London. Bobo Wilson muffed two punts, losing one of them, for Tampa Bay\u2019s other turnover.\n\nThe defense got burned by Christian McCaffrey on a dazzling 25-yard touchdown catch and run and Carolina drove 99 yards for another score in the first half to take a 10-0 lead.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves in tough positions,\u201d defensive lineman Ndamukomng Suh said. \u201cFrom a defensive perspective, we\u2019ve got to get off the field no matter what situation we are in. We didn\u2019t hold up our end of the bargain.\u201d", "description": "Deshaun Watson accounted for scores with his arm and his legs, outdueling Chiefs counterpart Patrick Mahomes in a matchup of former first-round picks", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8779110375fc6ecf3dfa9bad99b7f022abaf6d4b/0_78_2036_1222/master/2036.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fb867ce7dd8f5725b121d378f8407fe", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
