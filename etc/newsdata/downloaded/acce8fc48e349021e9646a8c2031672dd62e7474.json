Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday unveiled an ambitious new plan that would provide free college tuition to all in-state students.\n\nThe plan would apply to students regardless of the family\u2019s income level, a departure from similar plans in other states, which are geared toward low-income students. New Mexico\u2019s plan would apply to students at two and four-year colleges regardless of their immigration status.\n\nMs. Grisham called the program \u201can absolute game-changer\u201d for the state.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What are potential the benefits or drawbacks of free college for residents of New Mexico? Join the conversation below. \u201cHigher education in this state, a victim of the recession, has been starved in recent years. We are pivoting to a robust reinvestment in higher learning\u2014specifically and directly in our students,\u201d Ms. Grisham said at the 2019 New Mexico Higher Education Summit, where she made the announcement. If passed, the plan, which is called New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship, would affect an estimated 55,000 students across the state\u2019s 29 public higher-education institutions. The plan would also apply to adults returning to school. Although Democrats control both houses of the state\u2019s legislature, it is unclear if the plan will pass. State Sen. Gregg Fulfer, a Republican, believes the state needs to \u201cfix what\u2019s broke\u201d before creating new plans that require new sources of money that have to be sustained over time. \u201cI think with the education crisis we are in, this will be hard to pass in the legislative session coming and therefore will need to be looked at closely,\u201d Mr. Fulfer said. Tripp Stelnicki, the governor\u2019s director of communications, said he was optimistic the plan would be approved. New Mexico State Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez said the new plan would help create a much needed skilled workforce and address poverty and other social issues in the state. \u201cIt is not a done deal, but I know it will be very seriously considered by legislators,\u201d Ms. Lopez said. If the legislature passes the plan, New Mexico would join 20 states that have similar programs, including New York\u2019s Excelsior Scholarship, which provides free tuition to students attending state colleges for families making up to $125,000.
