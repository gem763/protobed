The Target Center\u2019s management, AEG Management TWN, tried to pass on the fees to the Trump campaign, threatening to block them from using the arena if they did not pay.\n\nBut the campaign threatened to sue the Target Center for a breach in contract, noting that Secret Service was in charge of security.\n\n\u201cThis last-minute squeeze seems to be nothing but a pretextual political effort with serious First Amendment ramifications,\u201d a letter read from the Trump campaign\u2019s lawyer to the Target Center\u2019s management firm.\n\nFrey protested the news that Trump was planning to rally in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis,\u201d Frey said in a statement in September.\n\nThe campaign noted that the Target Center arena\u2019s sudden security fees were extraordinarily high.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama rallied at the Target Center, which led to an estimated $20,000 cost for additional security from the police chief, according to a report at the time.\n\n\u201cThe Campaign cannot be in breach of an obligation it does not owe to AEG,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cYet AEG\u2019s failure to deliver the Target Center on October 9 would be a breach of contract.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s attempt to shut down a political event with high security fees is a tried and true tactic of the left.\n\nThe Trump campaign sent the letter Monday night as Frey was attending a playoff baseball game between the Minnesota Twins and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe rally is scheduled for Thursday night.", "description": "President Donald Trump's campaign accused Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey on Monday of trying to block the president's scheduled political rally.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/aug172019-Minneapolis-Mayor-Jacob-Frey-AP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
