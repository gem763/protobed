He was also criticised for staying at the Stadium of Light on a \u00a343,000-a-week deal despite being firmly out favour and the club suffering financial difficulties.\n\nThe former England international's contract was eventually cancelled in June 2018, before he spent last season with Blackburn, where he made 22 appearances in all competitions.\n\nIf he completes his move to Roma, Rodwell will join another Englishman, Chris Smalling, at the Stadio Olimpico, who is on a 12-month loan from Manchester United.", "description": "Jack Rodwell has been spotted at Roma's training ground as he prepares to undergo a medical ahead of sealing a shock move to the Serie A club.
