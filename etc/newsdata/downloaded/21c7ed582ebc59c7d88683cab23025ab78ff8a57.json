But what surprised me is that there was an effort to try to have this case go forward in an effort to try to help Royal Caribbean.\"\n\nKimberly, 36, and police officer Alan, 41, say the cruise ship firm should not have left the window open in the family play area.\n\nThe couple, from Indiana, previously slammed the cruise ship for leaving the window open for \"ventilation\".\n\n(Image: ENTERPRISE NEWS AND PICTURES)\n\nJudge Jimmy Sepulveda, of the San Juan Investigation Chamber, set Anello's bond at $80,000 and he was released to reappear in court on November 20.\n\nMr Winkleman told Mail Online that the attempted civil action by Chloe's family against Royal Caribbean had been hampered as the company and the Puerto Rican police would not hand over the CCTV footage which shows the terrible moment Chloe fell.\n\nThe lawyer was told this was to not hinder the investigation. He said this situation was now likely to change as the grandfather's defence team were entitled to see copies of all the evidence.\n\nAccording to El Vocero , Mr Anello, as well as his wife, son-in-law Alan Wiegand and Chloe's paternal grandparents, all had to be sedated by medics following the tragic incident.\n\n(Image: Today)\n\nMr Winkleman said Anello, an IT worker, will be able to return to American after November 20.\n\nHe told Mail Online: \"They are using the term negligent. That means we know he didn't mean to do it. But apparently they think the negligence rises to a criminal level.\n\n\"It's my understanding that nothing has really changed in terms of the family's viewpoint of Sam's position, that it was an accident and that he thought this was a wall of windows.\n\n\"He didn't realize the window was open. He puts her up on a railing thinking that there was a window there and either lets go or loses grip of her for a moment and she's gone.\"\n\n(Image: Attorney Michael Winkleman)\n\nIn an interview with Today in July, Chloe's parents said they do not blame her grandfather for the tragedy.\n\nAlan and Kimberly, from Indiana, said they blame the cruise ship for leaving the window open for \"ventilation\".\n\nKimberly said: \"When they told me Chloe had died, I didn't know she went out the window. I just saw Sam standing next to the wall of windows screaming and banging on it.\n\n\"I just kept saying 'take me to my baby, where is my baby?'.\n\n(Image: Today)\n\n\"Then I looked over and it wasn't water beneath, it was concrete. To lose our baby this way is just unfathomable.\"\n\nThe parents went on to describe how Chloe's grandfather is still distraught and was \"extremely hysterical\" at the time.\n\nThey added: \"He would cry over and over.\n\n\"At no point ever has Sam put our kids in any danger.\"\n\nIn a statement to Sky News, the family's attorney Mr Winkleman said: \"The grandfather didn't drop the child, the child fell due to an open glass pane that should have been closed securely.\n\n\"Chloe wanted to bang on the glass like she always did at her older brother's hockey games. Her grandfather thought there was glass just like everywhere else, but there was not, and she was gone in an instant.\"\n\n(Image: ENTERPRISE NEWS AND PICTURES)\n\nHe said that the family is demanding to know why there was an \"open window\" in a wall of fixed windows.\n\nChloe attempted to bang on the glass, unaware that there was none there, Mr Winkleman said.\n\nMr Anello was described as hysterical after toddler Chloe Wiegand plummeted 150ft from the cruise ship.\n\nPuerto Rico Ports Authority spokesman Jos\u00e9 Carmona said the family was gathered in or near a dining hall on the 11th floor and that the grandfather sat the toddler on the edge of a window.\n\nThe Freedom of the Seas has a height of around 210ft and the 11th floor will have been around 150ft above land level when the vessel was docked.\n\n(Image: Prima Hora)\n\nIt holds around 4,000 passengers and was ending a seven-day Southern Caribbean cruise of Antigua, St Lucia and Barbados at the time of the tragedy.\n\nAnello, an IT worker, was said to have left San Juan without giving a formal witness statement.\n\nMailOnline reports he said this was due to his extreme distress and confusion at what had happened.\n\nThis week, he voluntarily returned to the Caribbean nation after the arrest warrant was issued by a judge.", "description": "Chloe Weigand's parents still vow to sue Royal Caribbean for their daughter's death - while their lawyer thinks Puerto Rican authorities have an \"ulterior motive\" in charging grandfather Salvatore 'Sam' Anello with negligent homicide", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Attorney Michael Winkleman", "Enterprise News And Pictures", "Today", "Prima Hora"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17937448.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Chloe-Wiegand.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
