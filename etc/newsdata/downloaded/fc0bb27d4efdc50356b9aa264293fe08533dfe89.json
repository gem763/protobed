The New York-based comedian and musician \u2014 best known as the host of The Goddamn Dave Hill Show on New Jersey's WFMU and as a frequent contributor on This American Life \u2014 attributes the obsession to his grandfather. While Hill's family grew up in Cleveland, his grandpa chose to make his home on a small farm just outside Clinton, Ontario \u2014 a personalized protest against the idea of American exceptionalism.\n\n\"My grandfather talked about Canada all the time,\" Hill tells CBC Arts. \"He was always saying how much better Canada was than America. During one of my first visits to the country I remember him hanging out the car window just shouting hello to anyone we passed on the street. We tried to get him to stop but he wouldn't. He kept saying that this was Canada. You're expected to greet everyone here because they're friendly.\"\n\nParking the Moose. (Doubleday/Penguin Random House)\n\nDespite fond childhood memories of Canada, Hill \u2014 like most Americans \u2014 had very little context for the country. He wondered about the flavour profiles of Canadian culinary delights: ketchup chips, real maple syrup, poutine. He questioned if the weather actually got that cold. But mostly Hill wanted to know if his gramps was right \u2014 if, maybe, Canada was in fact the greatest country on Earth. Eventually, Hill made a decision: to feed his curiosities, he would start making weekend jaunts to Canadian cities and documenting the experiences in his journal.\n\n\"Canada is right above us and most Americans know absolutely nothing about it,\" says Hill. \"Maybe they've been to Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, but that's it. I think in general we've been pretty clueless about the country that on a surface level has so many similarities to ours. I really wanted to dig into Canada. I wanted to observe, then write about, what I picked up on with as much honesty and humour as I could.\"\n\nHill has collected his writing in his new book Parking the Moose, a funny and informative look at Canada from the perspective of an American outsider. In addition to hitting the major metropolises, the comedian also went to smaller towns in an effort to gain a well-rounded understanding of the country's culture. Hill notes that \u2014 living up to the cliches \u2014 there was a certain friendliness to the people. But it was the overall vibe that stuck with him the most.\n\n\"There seems to be a different default setting in Canada when it comes to people's attitudes,\" he says. \"I remember walking down the street with my girlfriend in Victoria. We overheard these two people having a conversation and it was just so...kind? They seemed to be really kind to each other and unbothered by everything.\"\n\nPutting together the book has been really rewarding. I've gotten to experience a lot. But really getting to know Canada is a project I could have spent at least the next 30 years doing. - Dave Hill\n\nHill has a unique theory about this Canadian disposition compared to our Southern neighbours.\n\n\"I honestly think it goes all the way back to the American Revolution. We needed to rebel. That history has invaded our psyche to the point that people always assume they're being messed with. And Canadians don't have that!\"\n\nThese are the kind of droll observations littered throughout Parking the Moose. The main tension of the book stems from Hill's fish-out-of-water perspective on our country and his constant comparison of Canada to the monolith of American culture. The book has been championed by many famous Canadians, winning high praise from both comedian Samantha Bee and scholar Malcolm Gladwell for its sardonic and witty writing. But even after spending an extended amount of time in Canada and winning the affection of some of our funniest and most intelligent citizens, Hill still feels as though he has a lot to learn about the country.\n\n\"Putting together the book has been really rewarding. I've gotten to experience a lot,\" he says. \"But really getting to know Canada is a project I could have spent at least the next 30 years doing. There are so many good things to explore.\"", "description": "The journey behind Dave Hill's new book was all aboot discovering his roots.", "authors": ["Graham Isador Is A Writer", "Theatre Creator Based Out Of Toronto.
