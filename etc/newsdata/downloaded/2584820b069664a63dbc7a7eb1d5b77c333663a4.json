He has a \u2018no free drinks\u2019 policy at Bertie Blossoms, his new Notting Hill pub, which even extends to wife Cherry. Staff say the policy is to prevent \u2018awkwardness\u2019 if people who barely know Ed try to blag a freebie.\n\nSheeran (right) surprised staff at swanky Chelsea restaurant Kutir by bringing his own wine \u2013 then taking the dregs home when he and pal James Blunt (left) failed to finish it (Kutir chef Rohit Ghai is pictured centre)\n\nThe singer took a \u00a3440 bottle of 1990 Penfolds Grange to swanky Chelsea restaurant Kutir (pictured)\n\nAs if the Queen doesn\u2019t have enough to worry about, now she has to decide who will take over one of the grandest pads in London.\n\nThe 21-room Apartment 1 at Kensington Palace remains empty after the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester vacated the property last month and moved into a home in a former stable block at the Palace.\n\nSo far the Queen has resisted offering the apartment to princesses Beatrice or Eugenie \u2013 insiders say they aren\u2019t important enough for such a prestigious property. In the meantime, the apartment is gathering dust.\n\nCrush of the week... Caitlin van den Bogaerde\n\nMy crush of the week is looking for a crush of her own. Aspiring pop star Caitlin van den Bogaerde is single again after breaking up with Alasdair Gill, the son of former Cabinet Minister Amber Rudd and the late journalist A.A. Gill. Caitlin, 20, is the daughter of concert pianist Sophie Roper-Curzon, and the younger sister of Brit Award-nominated star Birdy, with whom she regularly duets, sharing the videos on Instagram.\n\nPerhaps the split will inspire some Adele-style bestselling hits for the youngster who will surely make a success of her music career \u2013 after all, it\u2019s in her blood.\n\nAspiring pop star Caitlin van den Bogaerde (pictured) is single again after breaking up with Alasdair Gill\n\nCould Prince Harry\u2019s ex Cressida Bonas be preparing for a Klosters wedding?

But then disaster struck when she realised she had run out of red sauce.\n\nMost of us would have headed off to the shops in tracksuit bottoms and an old pullover, but Alexa is a supermodel, so as my snap shows, she slipped into an ultra-chic \u00a3584 jumpsuit and coat combo before heading to the nearest all-night store and emerging with a bottle of Heinz.\n\nAlexa slipped into an ultra-chic \u00a3584 jumpsuit and coat combo before heading to the nearest all-night store and emerging with a bottle of Heinz.\n\nRonnie Wood is \u2018miserable and tight\u2019\u2026according to the man who was his brother-in-law for 26 years.\n\nArtist Paul Karslake launched an attack on the Rolling Stones guitarist, who divorced Paul\u2019s sister Jo Wood a decade ago, when we met at his Soho exhibition last week.\n\n\u2018He is tighter than two coats of paint,\u2019 Paul told me. \u2018He\u2019s just weird, twisted and miserable.\u2019 Ronnie\u2019s new wife, Sally, tells me this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth \u2013 so I guess Paul is definitely off the Woods\u2019 Christmas card list!", "description": "TALK OF THE TOWN: Ed Sheeran, who was joined by James and Kutir chef Rohit Ghai, was pushing his luck as the London restaurant doesn't normally allow guests to bring their own bottle.", "authors": ["Charlotte Griffiths For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19635406-0-image-a-62_1570917486874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
