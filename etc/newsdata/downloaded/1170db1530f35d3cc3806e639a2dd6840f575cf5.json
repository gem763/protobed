Supplied\n\n\"They can own something for about the same price that they would have been renting,\" Mr O'Keefe said. \"That\u2019s a really attractive thing for them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor MaxCap, the fund is a way of expanding its push into equity investments, to offer higher-yielding direct investments in addition to its staple of commercial real estate debt.\n\n\"It\u2019s a much more aggressive strategy,\" MaxCap chief investment officer Brae Sokolski said.\n\n\"It\u2019s equity. In keeping with that, the returns are commensurately much higher. We\u2019re targeting 20 per cent-plus IRR which in this low interest rate environment is outstanding. But we feel it\u2019s done in the context of a very sound safe play with strong fundamentals.\"\n\nThe fund, which has already secured a 9.78-hectare site in Epping, in Melbourne\u2019s north and a 16.7-hectare site in Truganina, in Melbourne\u2019s west, aims to own about 10 investment sites in total that it will progressively develop and sell.\n\n\"It\u2019s the flipside of investing in strip retail,\" Mr Sokolski said.\n\n\"If strip retail is in decline, the flipside to this has to be some way people are getting goods into their house. It\u2019s not as if there are less goods being purchased. It just that the method by which people purchase has changed.\"", "description": "New closed-ended fund takes advantage of both changing retail models and low interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4846%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1e083d24cdd4e5942368aeb96b6a8553d4a2a969", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
