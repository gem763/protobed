He\u2019s signed to esports team Hashtag United, and he\u2019s also an official Red Bull athlete.\n\nI\u2019ve played a game of FIFA against him before. \u2018Pretty solid\u2019 and \u2018actually decent\u2019 were the phrases he used to describe my play, as he banged three past my keeper in quick succession. I\u2019m pretty sure he was going easy on me too.\n\nPessoa was at London\u2019s Red Bull Gaming Sphere last week to host a FIFA 19 workshop where he\u2019d be answering questions and providing his best tips and tricks for the new game. Luckily I didn\u2019t have to embarrass myself by playing him once again.\n\nHashtag Ryan appeared on Up Your Game to give his tips and tricks for the new FIFA game\n\nHe went over everything from custom tactics, to attacking, defending, as well as set pieces\n\nInstead, I caught up with him before he went live on the stream. There are plenty of new changes to FIFA this year, although they might not be immediately obvious. I asked him to give me the rundown on the most important new features of FIFA 19.\n\nTimed Finishing\n\n\u2018The first thing is to practice timed finishing,\u2019 he tells me. \u2018It adds an element to shooting that was never in the game before.\u2019\n\nIn FIFA 19, if you press the shot button to start powering up, and then press the button again the split second before your player strikes the ball, you\u2019ll get a bonus to accuracy and power. At the start, you\u2019ll literally have to be watching either the bar, or your player\u2019s leg as it moves towards the ball. But Pessoa says you\u2019ll eventually get the knack down.\n\n\u2018The first thing I did was go on amateur difficulty and just practice and practice.\u2019 The game has only been out for a couple of weeks, but he\u2019s already got hundreds of games under his belt.\n\nAttacking tips\n\nOld attacking tricks work too. The finesse shot is still very good (hold in RB/R1), and in the build up, you can use the same tactic from last year. When you\u2019re on the ball, you can make one of your nearby players go on a run (L1/LB). If you quickly press the button to bring them back from the run (R1/RB), a huge gap opens up, left by the defender that went with him. It\u2019s pretty easy to make space and progress up the pitch this way.\n\nFIFA 19 has been out for a couple of weeks, and millions are trying to figure out how to improve\n\nControlling the goalkeeper\n\nThe next new addition is the ability to manually control your goalkeeper using the right stick.\n\n\u2018If they cut inside they\u2019re probably going to shoot across the face of goal, so practice when to move your goalkeeper.\u2019 However, Pessoa also notes that good players will know you\u2019ll be moving your keeper in situations like these, and shoot the other way. Much like on the real pitch, scoring a goal is often about mind games and being unpredictable.\n\nSet pieces\n\nNext up, set pieces. In FIFA 19 so far, this is where games can be won.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve scored more from corners than penalties, getting a corner is basically a penalty,\u2019 says Pessoa.\n\nIt turns out if you can get free at the near post, corners are almost impossible to defend. Headers are viable, but surprisingly, Pessoa usually goes for a bicycle kick by holding in the left trigger and pressing the shoot button. During the stream he showed clips of this in action, and it works a surprisingly high percentage of the time.\n\nNew features this year include timed finishing and the ability to manually move your keeper\n\nDefending\n\nAs for defending, you\u2019re better off letting the game do it for you. \u2018If you control your centre backs, you\u2019re in for trouble,\u2019 says Pessoa. Instead, you should control your defensive midfielders and try to cut out passing lanes manually. If you\u2019ve got a fast attacking midfielder, you can even bring them back for more support. You can leave the rest up to the AI.\n\nThe question of who to put in your Ultimate Team is always on the minds of FIFA players. We\u2019re right at the start of the new game, so no one\u2019s team is top tier just yet. However, Pessoa\u2019s is already well on the way, with the likes of Icons Rio Ferdinand and Frank Rijkaard in defense and Kylian Mbappe on the wing.\n\nHe secured 30 wins out of 30 games in the first Weekend League of FIFA 19, and tells me next on his shopping list are the Patrick Vieira and Ruud Gullit Icon cards.\n\nThis year, he wants to win it all. He tells me he had a disappointing year in terms of results with FIFA 18, but it hasn\u2019t killed his passion. In fact, he\u2019s hungrier now more than ever. \u2018Right now the fuel to succeed for me on FIFA is unparalleled, I\u2019d be shocked if somebody has the same fire I have.\u2019\n\nWith the announcement of the ePremier League and more FIFA tournaments popping up all the time, there\u2019s never been a better time to try and succeed in FIFA esports. Ryan Pessoa will be competing at the top, and if you put the time in, maybe you could be too.\n\nThe full live stream containing all of his tips can be found on the Red Bull Esports Twitch channel.", "description": "Ryan Pessoa, aka Hashtag Ryan, is one of the world\u2019s best FIFA players.
