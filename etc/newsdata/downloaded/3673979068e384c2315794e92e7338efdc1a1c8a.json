Steve is a world-class batsman in all formats while Warner is Australia's highest ever T20I runs-scorer.\"\n\nSmith is set to play his first T20 international since 2016 and will look to continue the fine form he has shown since his return from a one-year ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.\n\nThe 30-year-old smashed 774 runs in four Ashes tests against England recently as Australia retained the urn.\n\nWarner scored 692 runs in this year's IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad and 647 runs in the 50-over World Cup in England as Australia reached the semi-finals.\n\nAustralia dropped all-rounder Marcus Stoinis while Ashton Turner was preferred ahead of fellow spinner Nathan Lyon. They also included the big-hitting Glenn Maxwell.\n\nThe 14-man squad captained by Aaron Finch will travel to Adelaide on Oct. 24 before the first T20 against Sri Lanka.\n\nAustralia T20 squad: Aaron Finch (captain), Ashton Agar, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Ben McDermott, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Billy Stanlake, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, Andrew Tye, David Warner, Adam Zampa.
