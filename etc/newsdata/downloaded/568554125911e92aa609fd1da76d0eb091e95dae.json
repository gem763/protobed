THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nCOOPER: Welcome to the second night of the CNN Republican presidential town hall from Columbia, South Carolina. Welcome. We\u2019ve heard now from Governor Kasich. We\u2019ve heard from Governor Bush.\n\nEveryone please welcome Donald Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Hello, everybody.\n\nCOOPER: Welcome. How\u2019s it going? Nice to see you.\n\nTRUMP: Hello, Anderson. Nice to see you.\n\nCOOPER: Have a seat.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve had quite a day.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, the pope is a wonderful guy.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Let\u2019s start right there.\n\nTRUMP: A little surprise.\n\nCOOPER: How surprised were you by what the pope said? For those who don\u2019t know, he said \u2014 part of what he said was \u201ca person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be, and not of building bridges is not Christian; this is not the Gospel.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: Well, I didn\u2019t think it was a good thing for him to say, frankly. And he was talking about the border, and as you know, I\u2019m very strong on border security, and we have to have a border in this country, and we certainly don\u2019t have one right now.\n\nAnd, as you know, we\u2019re talking about building a wall. We\u2019re gonna build a wall, and Mexico\u2019s gonna pay for the wall, and that\u2019s the way it is. They \u2014 you know, we have a trade balance, and \u2014 and if you look at it \u2014 imbalance of about $58 billion with Mexico.\n\nAnd it\u2019s really more than that, because we also subsidize, et cetera, et cetera, so they\u2019re gonna pay for the wall. But somehow, the government of Mexico spoke with the Pope \u2014 I mean, they spent a lot of time with the Pope \u2014 and by the time he left, he made a statement \u2014 I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Wait, you think that the government of Mexico somehow got the Pope to say this?\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. Well, I don\u2019t think they said that way. But I think they probably talked about isn\u2019t it terrible that Mr. Trump wants to have border security, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nAnd the Pope made the statement, and I think it was probably a little bit nicer statement than it was reported by you folks in the media, because after I read it, it was a little bit softer.\n\nBut the bottom line is we\u2019ve gotta have a border, we\u2019ve gotta have security. We have tremendous illegal immigration in the country. (inaudible).\n\nCOOPER: Well, I\u2019ll just say, the Pope did go on to say, \u201cthis is \u2014 this is not the gospel. As far as what you have said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I\u2019m not gonna get involved on that.\n\n\u201cI say only that this man is not Christian, if he has said things like that. We must see if he\u2019s said things in that way, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: And he also talked about having a wall is not Christian, and he\u2019s got an awfully big wall at the Vatican, I will tell you. So it\u2019s gonna be an interesting \u2014 how \u2014 how\u2019s he\u2026\n\nCOOPER: But people do come and go through the Vatican, and it\u2019s open to tour. TRUMP: And they\u2019re gonna come and go through the wall. I mean \u2014 you know, but they\u2019re gonna come and go legally. They\u2019re gonna do it legally. And that\u2019s what I want, and that\u2019s what a lot of people want, obviously, because they agree with me.\n\nCOOPER: But you \u2014 you\u2019ve been in fights with a lot of people. But in \u2014 with the Pope \u2014 I mean, does it give you pause?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like fighting with the Pope, actually. I don\u2019t think this is a fight. I think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media. I think that he heard one side of the story, which is probably by the Mexican government.\n\nHe didn\u2019t see the tremendous strain that \u2014 you know, the border\u2019s causing us with respect to illegal immigration, with the drugs pouring across the border.\n\nI mean, I \u2014 I just won the New Hampshire primary, and I will tell you these are amazing people. The biggest single problem that I had, no matter where I went in New Hampshire, was heroin, and it\u2019s pouring in. And it is just pouring into the area.\n\nAnd \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort of funny, because you \u2014 you look at New Hampshire as being this beautiful, idyllic place \u2014 magnificent. I loved it. I love the people there. I love the whole place. And it\u2019s the last place you think that they\u2019d really have a big drug problem.\n\nThey have a massive drug problem, as you know. And it\u2019s always the first subject, no matter what I do \u2014 it\u2019s the first subject they want to talk about, and we\u2019ve got to stop it. And it\u2019s pouring in through the southern border, and we are going to stop it.\n\nCOOPER: I just want to ask you one more question on the Pope, and then we\u2019ll move on, because there\u2019s a lot of other items in the news before we get to \u2014 to our voters, many of whom are undecided, as many people are in this state.\n\nTRUMP: Really? (inaudible) they\u2019re undecided?\n\nCOOPER: You could \u2014 you\u2019re doing well in the polls. You could pick up a couple votes tonight.\n\nTRUMP: Well, that\u2019s a maybe, actually (ph).\n\nCOOPER: Maybe. We\u2019ll see.\n\nBut you \u2014 you know, early on, you talked about forgiveness. And you were asked, in terms of your faith, whether you ask for forgiveness. At one point, I remember you said to me you tried not to do things wrong so that you don\u2019t have to ask for forgiveness.\n\nTRUMP: True. COOPER: Was there a moment when you first heard the Pope had said something about you that you thought, \u201cmaybe I\u2019m gonna have to ask for forgiveness?\n\nTRUMP: No. No, look. I\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 I have a lot of respect for the Pope. I think he\u2019s got a lot of personality. He\u2019s very different. He\u2019s a very different kind of a guy, and I think he\u2019s doing a very good job. He\u2019s \u2014 a lot of energy.\n\nBut I would say that I think he was very much misinterpreted, and I also think he was given false information. If he would have heard our side \u2014 the side from people that live in the United States?\n\nCOOPER: Would you like to meet with him and talk to him about it?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ll do it any time he wants. I mean, I think it would be very interesting. No, I like him. I mean, I like him as a personality, I like what he represents and I certainly have great respect for the position.\n\nCOOPER: I \u2014 I \u2014 as you know, we did a town hall last night. I talked to Marco Rubio, talked to Senator Cruz. You sent Senator Cruz a cease and desist letter to the campaign about an ad they\u2019re running that features an old interview you did with Tim Russert back in the late \u201990s\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Long time ago.\n\nCOOPER: Yeah, you \u2014 when you were\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Many, many years ago.\n\nCOOPER: \u2026 when you were pro-choice. You are now \u2014 say your position has completely changed\u2026\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m pro-life.\n\nCOOPER: \u2026 you are pro-life, and you\u2019re adamant about that. But\u2026\n\nTRUMP: But that\u2019s not the only thing. I mean, look \u2014 he has a problem with the truth. And even Marco Rubio \u2014 I guess today there was something about he was \u2014 you know, picture was manufactured, and it was not perfectly (ph)\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Photoshopped, right?\n\nTRUMP: Well, it was totally Photoshopped. I could see by just looking at it. In fact, they even made Marco a lot shorter than he is, if you look at it really. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s probably the thing that bothered him the most.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHe was a hell of a lot \u2014 he was, like, very small. I mean, he\u2019s not that small. Not too big, but he\u2019s not so small.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut \u2014 but I will tell you \u2014 I looked at that photo, I said immediately it was Photoshopped. But if you look what the he did \u2014 I\u2019m talking about Cruz \u2014 to Ben Carson, where he said, \u201clisten, he\u2019s out of the race. Everybody, come vote for us, he\u2019s out of the\u201d \u2014 that was so dishonest.\n\nAnd then he did something else that you people never picked up on, and I think it was the worst of all. He did a voter violation notice. It looked like it\u2019s right out of the IRS.\n\nCOOPER: Yeah, we talked about it.\n\nTRUMP: The official paper \u2014 it was so disgusting. And it\u2019s basically you have a voter violation.\n\nNow, they don\u2019t have lawyers. These are people that were frightened when they got it. And it graded them. And you have an F, F, F, F. And essentially, it says if you vote for Ted Cruz, this violation is going to go away. And let me tell you something, people voted for him because of that. That was a fraudulent document.\n\nAnd he said things about me. For instance, I\u2019m very strong on the Second Amendment. He said, \u201cDonald Trump will leave the Second Amendment; he\u2019s going to destroy the Second Amendment; you\u2019re not going to have a Second Amendment.\u201d There\u2019s even one going up now in Nevada. He\u2019s got something about land \u2014 that I\u2019m for taking back the land.\n\nI have nothing to do with it. He \u2014 he will make up stories. And you know, he holds up the Bible and then he lies. I think it\u2019s very inappropriate.\n\nCOOPER: But \u2014 but a cease-and-desist letter, I mean, you\u2019re not going to sue him.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you don\u2019t know that. But I like to send letters.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI have a lot of lawyers. I have wonderful lawyers. I like to send letters. But you know what?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIt\u2019s good that people know. And I think it\u2019s probably \u2014 it\u2019s probably affected him because I know the CBS poll just came out a little while ago, New York Times-CBS, and I mean, my numbers are fantastic. I think it had an impact\u2026\n\nCOOPER: But in that \u2014 in that particular commercial, he\u2019s using an interview you did give in the late \u201990s that doesn\u2019t represent your current position.\n\nTRUMP: But he\u2019s not saying that. He\u2019s saying, \u201cI am.\u201d And you take a look at the words he says, when he goes around talking to people, he uses that. That was \u2014 what? \u2014 17 or 19 years ago. That was a long time ago. It was with Tim Russert, who by the way, was a great guy. We miss Tim Russert. I really liked him a lot. But it was with Tim Russert. And you\u2019ve got explain my views now, too. You can\u2019t say, \u201cI am,\u201d because he would say \u201cI am.\u201d And that\u2019s what he was doing when he went out to audiences, and it\u2019s just not true.\n\nAnd as far as Second Amendment, I\u2019m the strongest person running on the Second Amendment. And he would say \u2014 you know, he\u2019d just make up stories. So it was inappropriate, Anderson, and we\u2019ll see what happens. Who knows? I mean, I think he\u2019s got other cases. I think the wonderful case is going to be whether or not, and I understand he got sued today actually. He\u2019s going to be sued by a lot of people and he\u2019s going to be sued by the Democrats if he ever got the nomination, which I don\u2019t think he will. Honestly, I don\u2019t think he will.\n\nBut if he ever got the \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got a very good chance of getting it. But he was sued today on the fact that he was born in Canada. It\u2019s a big problem.\n\nCOOPER: Do\u2026\n\nTRUMP: A problem for the party, for the Republican Party.\n\nCOOPER: You said now \u2014 cease and desist letter; as you say, you\u2019ve got a lot of lawyers. You like to send out letters. You certainly attack\u2026\n\nTRUMP: (inaudible), but it\u2019s something I will do on occasion.\n\nCOOPER: You certainly attack \u2014 your critics say, look, you\u2019re a bully. How do you respond?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m not a bully. No, I\u2019m not a bully at all. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bully at all. I built a great company. I filed as, you know, when I did my file, everyone said I wasn\u2019t going to run, then I ran. Then I signed certain documents. Everyone said, you\u2019ll never sign \u2014 you know, you\u2019ll basically sign your life away \u2014 form A or whatever it\u2019s called. I signed form A. It\u2019s like, you know, they said, \u201cWow, he signed that.\u201d\n\nThen they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never put in his financials because maybe they\u2019re not as good.\u201d Turned out they\u2019re much better than anybody ever even envisioned. And I built a great company.\n\nYou have to be \u2014 you have to have a certain personality to build \u2014 I have some of the greatest assets in the world, very low debt, tremendous cash flow. I mean, it\u2019s a truly great company.\n\nCOOPER: So as president, would you be sending cease and desist letters? Would you be\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, maybe to China.\n\nNo, I would be. I would be sending them to China to stop ripping us off. I would be sending them to other countries to stop ripping us off. I\u2019d send them to Mexico. And when I say cease and desist, maybe it\u2019s equivalent, OK? Maybe I do it with my mouth. (CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: (inaudible) disagree with?\n\nTRUMP: Of course. Look, our country is going to hell. We have a problem with China. We have a problem with Japan. We have a problem with Mexico both at the border and in trade. Carrier just announced they\u2019re moving to \u2014 Carrier Air Conditioner \u2014 I buy them all the time. I\u2019m not going to buy them anymore, by the way. I buy thousands. They\u2019re moving to Mexico. I saw the clip. I saw the boss say, \u201cWe\u2019re closing up; we\u2019re moving to Mexico.\u201d\n\nWhat do we get out of it? They\u2019re moving to Mexico. Now, they\u2019re going to make air conditioners, sell them to us, no tax, no nothing. We get nothing out of it.\n\nBy the way, if we said, \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re going to have to pay a 35 percent tax to get them through the border.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t even move.\n\nCOOPER: I want you to meet some of the voters. Sherry Burris (ph) is here. She\u2019s Republican who says she\u2019s currently undecided.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, that\u2019s too bad.\n\nCOOPER: She\u2019s got a question for you. Sherry?\n\nQUESTION: Hi. Nice to meet you.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: First, I wanted to start off saying that I\u2019m impressed with your business sense, especially because I\u2019m a commercial real estate broker.\n\nTRUMP: Good. Then you know. You know how\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nQUESTION: Yes. Maybe you can teach me some things.\n\nBut I also have a\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Where are you from?\n\nQUESTION: I\u2019m from Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nI also have a master\u2019s in public administration. I worked for 16 years in state government, all the way from working with the legislature to state and local government, trying to actually implement private sector policies. As you probably have already figured out, politics and government in general is a totally different animal.\n\nTRUMP: Totally different.\n\nQUESTION: Yes. Here\u2019s my concern. In private sector, if you don\u2019t like the deal, you can walk away. The president is not a person, it\u2019s not a business, it\u2019s an office that is powered to protect and serve the people of the United States.\n\nMy biggest concern is how are you going to govern and get buy-in from people that you may totally disagree with without getting angry and without \u2014 refusing to look for common ground. I like your principles, I want a strong president. I want someone who is strong, tenacious, but I\u2019m having some trouble getting past your self control.\n\nTRUMP: OK.\n\nQUESTION: Can you help me with that?\n\nTRUMP: I appreciate the question, actually. It\u2019s a great question.\n\nFirst of all, when it comes to \u2014 you know, some people say, oh, Trump is tough and I thought I did a great debate the other night. Time Magazine and everybody thought that I won. Drudge thought I won. You know, they do the polls after the debate. I thought I did a great debate, but some people thought I was too tough.\n\nI said, wait a minute. I have Jeb Bush and I have all these guys coming at me from 15 different angles, and you have to be tough and we have to be tough to protect our country.\n\nI have a great temperament. You don\u2019t build a great company and especially a company with very little debt and all of the kinds of things that I have, and I have employees that have been with me for many, many years. I mean, long-term employees. They\u2019re really great people and they\u2019ve been with me for a long time.\n\nBut we need a certain toughness. Look, we have ISIS chopping off people\u2019s heads, Christians\u2019 heads, everybody else\u2019s heads, drowning people in cages. You\u2019ve never seen \u2014 this is like medieval times. We need a certain toughness.\n\nI know that Hillary said I don\u2019t like Donald trump\u2019s tone. Tone? They\u2019re chopping off the heads of people. This hasn\u2019t happened since medieval times. We need certain toughness, and if we don\u2019t have the toughness, we\u2019re not going to end up with a country. You know, we\u2019re going to let people come into this country, they\u2019re going to be ISIS or ISIS-related and we\u2019re going to have problems like you\u2019ve never seen.\n\nYou had a problem where you had two radicalized, probably she came in radical, radicalized him, the two \u2014 the married couple, the young couple. They killed 14 people. They killed 14 people. They killed people, and you understand what I\u2019m talking about in California, they killed people that give them wedding parties. People that they knew very well. People that they worked with. People that they actually get along with. They killed them. There\u2019s something going on.\n\nWe need a certain toughness. We have weak people leading our country.\n\nCOOPER: So as president, though, I mean, you\u2019ve talked about this before, would your tone be different? Is there a presidential Trump?\n\nTRUMP: It would be \u2014 yeah. You and I have had this conversation. Yeah sure. Look, I went to the best school, I was a good student and all of this stuff. I mean, I\u2019m a smart person. I \u2014 my uncle was one of the top people at MIT, he was a great professor at MIT.\n\nI \u2014 like, you know, Like \u2014 it\u2019s a smart family, OK? I know \u2014 I can be more politically correct than anybody that you\u2019ve ever interviewed. You\u2019d probably say, boy, that was a boring interview. But I can be very \u2014 I can do whatever I want.\n\nI have Palm Beach, I have Maralago (ph). I deal with society. Society loves me, and I can act differently for different people. But we don\u2019t have time to be totally politically correct in this country. Our country is in serious, serious trouble.\n\nLet me give you one example, though, about toughness. So we have the Democrats and the Republicans, corporate inversions. There\u2019s trillions of dollars that cannot get back into this country. The Democrats agree it should come back in, the Republicans agree. This isn\u2019t something like a health care or whatever that they don\u2019t agree. This is something \u2014 trillions. They say 2.5 trillion, I say it\u2019s more than $5 trillion.\n\nCarl Icahn endorsed me. He\u2019s a great guy, he\u2019s a tough guy. I would get him involved in things. We\u2019ll get the smartest business leaders involved. But we have this 2.5 to $5 trillion outside of the country. The Republicans want it in, the Democrats want it in. They can\u2019t make a deal. They can\u2019t make a deal because there\u2019s no leader.\n\nI would put these people in a room, and within 10 minutes, I\u2019d have a deal. They all want it. This is something that \u2014 not where there\u2019s a dispute, they all want it. There\u2019s no leadership. Maybe they don\u2019t work hard enough, I don\u2019t know what it is.\n\nCOOPER: There\u2019s some \u2014 there\u2019s some candidates that were saying, look, compromise is a dirty word. You have to stand on principles. Do you believe in compromise?\n\nTRUMP: No, I believe in compromise where I win, OK?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Can you always win in a compromise?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, can you win. I mean, look. Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan, they ran a pretty good ship and they did well and everybody was happy. The country wasn\u2019t based on executive orders. Right now, Obama goes around signing executive orders. He can\u2019t even get along with the Democrats, and he goes around signing all these executive orders. It\u2019s a basic disaster. You can\u2019t do it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Corporate inversion. We have companies, great companies leaving the United States. You know, it used to be they\u2019d leave New York for Florida or they\u2019d leave some place for Texas or some other place, right? But we have great companies leaving this country. The great drug companies are leaving, many of them, they\u2019re going to Ireland. I mean, we\u2019re having announcements where thousands and thousands of jobs and greats companies are leaving. We can\u2019t let that happen.\n\nAnd they\u2019re leaving for two reasons, lower taxes, and my plan \u2014 under my tax plan, the taxes are much, much lower for the middle class and also for corporations. But very importantly, they\u2019re leaving to get back money. They are leaving to get the money that they can\u2019t bring back into this country.\n\nCOOPER: I want you to meet another voter. This is Todd Hicks. He\u2019s got a question about health care. He says he is voting for you on Saturday.\n\nTRUMP: I like \u2014 I like right from the beginning. Thank you, Todd (ph). You\u2019re doing the right thing.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening, Mr. Trump. My question\u2019s about health care and I\u2019m a local health insurance agent over in Canvas (ph), South Carolina. And I\u2019m not a big fan of Obamacare.\n\nTRUMP: You\u2019re right.\n\nQUESTION: Yes. You\u2019ve gone on record as stating that \u2014 many times that you\u2019re \u2014 one of your first acts of duty when you\u2019re elected president would be to abolish Obamacare.\n\nTRUMP: Right. A hundred percent.\n\nQUESTION: A hundred percent. I\u2019ve actually sat and watched the stick shock from customers as they come in and they\u2019ve seen the rising costs. What \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. (Inaudible). What is your exact plan and please \u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK \u2026\n\nQuestion: Be specific as to what you would do to replace Obamacare?\n\nTRUMP: OK. Great question. First of all, Obamacare as you know is a disaster. Your rates are going up 25, 35, 45, 55 percent. It\u2019s going to fail in \u201917 anyway unless as usual the Republicans bail them out. We know where the Democrats are coming from but the Republicans have been so weak.\n\nThe budget they passed four weeks ago is a \u2014 they call it the omnibus budget. It gives Obama everything he wanted. It gives him money to bring in people from Syria that we have no idea who they are or where they are, et cetera which is a disaster. We can\u2019t afford to do that.\n\nIt gives money for illegal immigration, for letting people come in illegally into this country. The whole thing is a disaster and the Republicans passed it. With health care, we have repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nCOOPER: What would you replace it with?\n\nTRUMP: A health care savings accounts (sic) which are great. We would do that or we\u2019re going to have and probably \u2014 and \u2014 you can say and/or \u2014 what I really like is the \u2014 I\u2019m a self-funder. I\u2019m not taking any money, OK? I\u2019m not taking money from the insurance companies so I can do what\u2019s right.\n\nI can do what\u2019s right for the people, I can do \u2014 and this is something that I think I\u2019ve been given credit for. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been given enough credit because I have turned down hundreds of millions of dollars. I could take \u2014 if Jeb Bush raised $148 million put it in a fund it\u2019s like throwing it out the window what he did with it.\n\nI would have had 500 \u2014 I would have had $1 billion \u2014 I have people asking me, \u201cplease let me give you\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m doing it all myself. What happened is we have lines around each state. It makes it impossible for people to bid to \u2014 for insurance companies to bid within those states. The insurance company would have a monopoly \u2014 would rather have a monopoly on here or New York or on Iowa or on any other place than be able to bid all over that United States.\n\nBecause they make much more money that way. What we do and the insurance companies take care of the politicians. They\u2019re giving the politicians \u2014 most of the guys that I\u2019m running against are getting money from insurance companies and they\u2019re getting money from \u2014 by the way other companies. Drug companies, pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThey give tremendous amounts of money to the people that I\u2019m negotiating against, that I\u2019m debating against, the people that are on the stage, the people that are in Congress, the Senators. So what I\u2019m saying is this, we have to get rid of the lines. We have to create competition. When you do that you will have the best health care you\u2019ve ever, ever had.\n\nAnd it\u2019ll be at a reasonable cost. They almost got rid of the lines when they were doing Obamacare but it didn\u2019t happen. Because the insurance companies have too many of the Senators under control.\n\nCOOPER: Let me ask \u2014 just to follow-up \u2026\n\nTRUMP: You understand what I mean. There\u2019s no competition.\n\nCOOPER: Did you get your answer \u2014 is that specific enough for you \u2014 do you \u2026\n\nQUESTION: Sounds fairly enough. Yes.\n\nCOOPER: I got one question about it. If Obamacare\u2019s \u2026\n\nTRUMP: Thank you \u2026\n\nCOOPER: Repealed and there\u2019s no mandate for everybody to have insurance, what\u2019s to \u2014 why would insurance company (sic) not have a pre-existing \u2014 insure somebody who has a pre-existing condition \u2026\n\nTRUMP: Well I like the mandate. OK. So here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different. I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets and I say this all the time. And I say this \u2014 look, I did five speeches, maybe six speeches today. We had a lot of rallies. We had of thousands and thousands of people. We get big crowds.\n\nEvery time I talk about this I get standing ovations. The Republican people, they\u2019re wonderful people. They don\u2019t want people dying on the streets. Sometimes they\u2019ll say Donald Trump wants single payer because there\u2019s a group of people \u2014 as good as these plans are and by the way your insurance will go way down, you\u2019ll have better plans, you\u2019ll get your own doctor which Obama lied. Remember this \u2026\n\nCOOPER: Will people with pre-existing conditions be able to get insurance?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. Obama lied when he said you\u2019re going to keep your plan, you\u2019re going to keep your doctor, you got to \u2014 it was a pure lie. And frankly, many Democrats went along only because they believed him. He lied 28 times he said it. Twenty-eight times.\n\nIf that were in the private sector you\u2019d be sued for fraud, OK? He lied to get the plan through. He got it through and it\u2019s turned out to be a disaster. The wrong people are buying it, you know what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s dead. It\u2019s going to \u2014 look, Obamacare is dead.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be repealed, it\u2019s going to be replaced. But I will say this, Anderson. If we don\u2019t do something quickly you\u2019re going to have a health care that you \u2014 like you\u2019ve never seen before in this country.\n\nNow, the new plan is good. It\u2019s going to be inexpensive. It\u2019s going to be much better for the people. But there\u2019s going to a group of people at the bottom \u2014 people that haven\u2019t done well. People that don\u2019t have any money that won\u2019t be able to be care of.\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019re going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare. We have hospitals that aren\u2019t doing well, we have doctors that aren\u2019t doing well. You cannot let people die on the street, OK?\n\nNow, some people would say, \u201cthat\u2019s not a very Republican thing to say.\u201d Every time I say this at a rally, or even today, I said it \u2014 once, it got a standing ovation.\n\nI said, you know, the problem is everybody thinks that you people, as Republicans, hate the concept of taking care of people that are really, really sick and are gonna die.\n\nThat\u2019s not single payer, by the way. That\u2019s called heart. We gotta take care of people that can\u2019t take care of themselves. But the plans will be much less expensive than Obamacare, they\u2019ll be far better than Obamacare, you\u2019ll get your doctor, you\u2019ll get everything that you want to get. It\u2019ll be unbelievable.\n\nBut you\u2019ve gotta get rid of the lines. You gotta have competition. Those people that are left \u2014 we\u2019ve gotta help them live. And everybody likes it when I say it, and that includes Republicans. And it\u2019s not single payer.\n\nI want to you meet Orrin Smith, he\u2019s a Republican from Leesville. He says he\u2019s undecided. Orrin, welcome.\n\nQUESTION: First of all, hello, good to see you again.\n\nTRUMP: Hello, Orrin. Nice to see you.\n\nQUESTION: I think it\u2019s about five years ago I sat in your office and you said you were thinking about running for president then, and you didn\u2019t run then. But man, are you running\u2026\n\nTRUMP: I should have done it. We would have had Obama for four years instead of for eight years. Right?\n\nQUESTION: \u2026 right, right. Well, man, are you running now.\n\nTRUMP: I am running. I am running.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, and\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Actually, this may be better timing for me if you (inaudible). QUESTION: \u2026 right, and you\u2019ve made a lot of statements about a lot of issues. You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground in\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Right.\n\nQUESTION: \u2026 in a very short period of time. One statement you made, I\u2019m really having trouble getting over, frankly\u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK.\n\nQUESTION: \u2026 and I wanted to ask you about it.\n\nTRUMP: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: As a matter of fact, when I was watching the debate, and you made this statement, I had to apologize to my children for the words that came out of my mouth when you said what you said. And that was \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, so correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead. Sure.\n\nQUESTION: \u2026 when you said that George W. Bush, which was our last Republican president, a man I respect greatly, a person that we really fought for when he was up against a lot of pressure \u2014 that \u2014 that he lied to get us in the war in Iraq.\n\nThat \u2014 that \u2014 that stung me very deeply.\n\nTRUMP: OK.\n\nQUESTION: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that. I\u2019m just wondering, given some time passing \u2014 perhaps you\u2019ve rethought that. Would you be willing to rethink that?\n\nTRUMP: Well, a lot of people agree with what I said. And I\u2019m not talking about lying, I\u2019m not talking about not lying. Nobody really knows why we went into Iraq. The Iraqis did not knock down \u2014 it was not Saddam Hussein that knocked down the World Trade Center, OK? That\u2019s\u2026\n\nQUESTION: What was \u2014 just \u2014 what you said was, \u201cthey lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction, and there were none, and they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: Well, there are a lot of people that think that. There are a lot of people that think \u2014 look, bottom line, there were no weapons of mass destruction. They said, \u201cthere are weapons of mass destruction.\u201d I was against the war when it started.\n\nQUESTION: So \u2014 so do you think \u2014 do you think the president of the United States, George W. Bush, lied to the American people?\n\nTRUMP: Well, look, I\u2019m not going to get your vote, but that\u2019s OK. Let me just (inaudible). QUESTION: I\u2019m just giving you another shot at it.\n\nTRUMP: Let me \u2014 let me tell you something. I\u2019ll tell you it very simply. It may have been the worst decision \u2014 going into Iraq may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made in the history of this country. That\u2019s how bad it is, OK?\n\nThe migration that you see today, the destruction of Europe, with Angela Merkel allowing millions of people coming into Germany. I have people from Germany \u2014 they want to leave Germany.\n\nThese are people, two years ago, that would \u2014 who\u2019d do nothing but talk about how they love their country, Germany. They\u2019re gonna leave Germany. Many, many people are leaving Germany. You\u2019re gonna end up with big problems in Germany.\n\nYou look at Sweden, the other day \u2014 you look at Brussels \u2014 I was in Brussels years ago. It was one of the most beautiful \u2014 now it\u2019s like an armed camp. So crazy, what they\u2019ve done.\n\nAll of this is the \u2014 everything that\u2019s happening started with stupidly going into the war in Iraq. Now, Iraq \u2014 we have \u2014 and people talk about me with the button \u2014 I\u2019m the one that doesn\u2019t want do this, OK? I\u2019m the one, from 2002, 2003, said you shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\n\nHere\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s what happens. We have spent $2 trillion in Iraq \u2014 in fighting Iraq. Two trillion. Two trillion. Thousands of lives, right. We have wounded warriors, who I love, all over the place, who say the most incredible \u2014 these are braver than all of us in this room put together.\n\nI look at the attitude, and I work with them, and these are great people. We got nothing. We have nothing. We\u2019re not even there \u2014 we can\u2019t even make a phone call right now\u2026\n\nCOOPER: But to his question, do you believe\u2026\n\nQUESTION: I\u2019m trying to separate \u2014 yeah.\n\nTRUMP: Let me tell you, do I know?\n\nCOOPER: Do you believe he lied, or do you\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: I can tell you this. I can \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 whether he lied or not, he went into Iraq. It was a horrible decision, OK. And Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center.\n\nWhere did these people go when they got on the airplanes? You know where they went? Do you know where they went? They went \u2014 a lot of them went to Saudi Arabia, OK? They didn\u2019t go back to Iraq. They went to Saudi Arabia.\n\nNow, there are sealed documents right now that nobody wants to allow to be opened that talk very much about this subject. I\u2019d like to see what it says.\n\nI will say this \u2014 Bush felt very \u2014 and Saddam Hussein overplayed his hand, because he was \u2014 you know, he \u2014 senior Bush did the right thing. He knocked the heck out of him, and then he pulled back, OK? He didn\u2019t get into the quagmire. And that was OK to do.\n\nThe problem is Saddam Hussein said, \u201cI drove them back. I drove the Americans back.\u201d He really overplayed his hand. And frankly, I think the son, being loyal to the father \u2014 I think he really wanted to go into Iraq, even if it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do.\n\nTRUMP: He went into Iraq. He started something that destroyed the Middle East. And I said, \u201cDon\u2019t go in because you\u2019re going to ruin the balance in the Middle East; you\u2019re going to have a total imbalance; you\u2019re going to have Iran taking over Iraq.\u201d Everything I said turned out to be true.\n\nIran is now taking over Iraq. So \u2014 and they wanted to do it for years and years years. They\u2019re going to walk in.\n\nSo, not only do we make a horrible, horrible deal where we\u2019re giving Iran $150 billion. We got nothing for it. We get our prisoners back. They should have been given back to us three years ago, four years ago. We shouldn\u2019t have even started negotiating until we got our prisoners back. And we would have had it that way.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem. So, we make all bad deals. The war in Iraq started the whole destabilization of the Middle East. It started ISIS. It started Libya. It started Syria. That was one of the worst decisions ever made by any government at any time.\n\nIn all fairness, Bush made the decision. Just one thing. And Barack Obama \u2014 Barack Obama, as bad as he is, and he\u2019s bad \u2014 but he got us out the wrong way. He should have left people there. And he should have done it differently. And he shouldn\u2019t have said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting out at a specific time.\u201d\n\nHe gave a specific date, as you know, to get out. So bad. So bad.\n\nCOOPER: Just to his question \u2014 one more chance. Either \u2014 you believe he either lied or did not lie. Are you willing to say which?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know what he did. I just know it was a terrible mistake.\n\nCOOPER: So, was it a mistake for you to say in that debate that you thought he lied?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d have to see the exact words. Look, I don\u2019t know. I would probably say that something was going on. I don\u2019t know why he went in. I don\u2019t know why he went in. Because honestly, there was no reason to go in. They didn\u2019t knock down the World Trade Center. It wasn\u2019t Iraq that knocked it down.\n\nCOOPER: You would not say again that George W. Bush lied.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019d have to look at some documents.\n\nCOOPER: OK. I want you to meet Craig Caldwell (ph). He\u2019s a small business owner. He says he\u2019s undecided. Craig?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Anderson.\n\nMr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Yes?\n\nQUESTION: You\u2019re considered the political outsider in this race. A lot of people attribute your overall success so far to that. If you go on to win this nomination and are elected in November, a Trump administration cabinet would consist of people outside of politics. If so, who would you \u2014 can you give us some examples of who you would consider and for what post they would\u2026\n\nCOOPER: You talked about Carl Icahn already.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, but I don\u2019t necessarily \u2014 you know, Carl\u2019s a very successful businessman. What I\u2019d really love Carl to do is check out how are we doing in trade with China, pal.\n\nCOOPER: You want him to negotiate.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d like him negotiating.\n\nCOOPER: Have you thought about\u2026\n\nTRUMP: I have other friends. I have some of the greatest businessmen in the world. They\u2019re all calling me now because they say, \u201cWow, this could happen.\u201d And they\u2019re all calling me.\n\nWe have the greatest business people in the world in this country. We don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks to negotiate with China, with Japan. We have Caroline Kennedy negotiating car deals and trade deals with \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t even know. Caroline Kennedy got to be the ambassador of Japan.\n\nCOOPER: Would you want all Republicans in your cabinet? Or would you want a cabinet of\u2026\n\nTRUMP: No, not necessarily. I want the best people. Honestly, I want the greatest negotiators. We can\u2019t lose $505 billion next year with China.\n\nCOOPER: Do you find it valuable as a leader in your business world to have people with very different opinions give you different thoughts?\n\nTRUMP: I like that. Yeah, and then you make the decision. I think I\u2019m very open to that. I like that. I\u2019ve always liked that. I\u2019m fine with it. I want the most talented people. We have the greatest negotiators in the world. I told you before. We have a trade deficit with Mexico \u2014 $58 billion. You know, when they say you won\u2019t build a wall. The wall is going to cost $12 billion. It\u2019s peanuts compared to what we lose. OK?\n\nThat\u2019s why Mexico is going to pay. It was already\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: They say they\u2019re not going to pay.\n\nTRUMP: I know they do. And it was Calderon the other day, who is the past president, but Calderon the other day said, \u201cWe will not pay.\u201d So the newspapers called me up. They said, \u201cHe said \u2014 Calderon said we will not pay. What does that mean? What are you going to say?\u201d I said, \u201cThe wall just got 10 feet higher.\u201d\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: We\u2019ve got to take a break. Back in a minute with more questions for Donald Trump.\n\nCOOPER: Welcome back. We\u2019re here at the campus of the University of South Carolina here in Columbia. Less than two days to go until Primary Day. Donald Trump taking questions from the voters right now. Thanks very much for being here.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you.\n\nCOOPER: Again, continuing. I literally was just handed this. There\u2019s a report now out tonight on Buzzfeed that includes \u2014 I have not heard it \u2014 includes an audio clip of what appears to be you on Howard Stern talking on the radio on September 11th, 2002. He asked you are you for invading Iraq? You said yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\n\nIs that accurate? Do you remember saying that?\n\nTRUMP: No. But, I mean, I could \u2014 I could have said that. Nobody asked me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a politician. It was probably the first time anybody asked me that question.\n\nCOOPER: But does that\u2026\n\nTRUMP: But by the time the war started \u2014 that was quite a bit before the war started.\n\nCOOPER: Yeah, this was 2002.\n\nTRUMP: By the time the war started, I was against the war. And there are articles \u2014 I mean, there are headlines in 2003, 2004 that I was totally against the war. And actually, a couple of people in your world in terms of the pundits, said, you know, there\u2019 definite proof in 2003, 2004 Trump was against it.\n\nCOOPER: But 2004, the Reuters article, which you pointed to a lot, and there were a couple of comments you made, I think, at a Vanity Fair party and one other comment. Those were, I think, a couple of weeks after the war began.\n\nTRUMP: Which is OK. A lot of people said \u2014 you know, it was so early that even if it was a little bit after the war, I mean, he was totally against the war. I was very much against it. That was probably the first time I was ever even asked about the war. Howard, who\u2019s a great guy, by the way. A lot of people don\u2019t understand that. But he is \u2014\n\nCOOPER: He\u2019s a great interviewer.\n\nTRUMP: He\u2019s a great \u2014 he\u2019s a great interview. He\u2019s a very talented guy and a good. But that was probably the first time \u2014 I don\u2019t remember that, but it was probably the first time I was asked about it.\n\nCOOPER: OK. I haven\u2019t heard it, but you may have said that.\n\nTRUMP: And, you know, when you\u2019re in \u2014 when you\u2019re in the private sector \u2014 yeah, I may have. When you\u2019re in the private sector, you know, you get asked things and, you know, you\u2019re not a politician and probably the first time I was asked. By the time the war started, I was against it. And shortly thereafter, I was really against it.\n\nCOOPER: I want you to meet another voter. Ryan Parsons is his name. He\u2019s an aspiring entrepreneur here in South Carolina.\n\nTRUMP: Hi Ryan.\n\nCOOPER: He\u2019s a registered Republican. Right now, he\u2019s undecided. Welcome.\n\nQUESTION: Hey Mr. Trump. It\u2019s an honor to speak to you.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you. Me too.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks for coming to Columbia. My girlfriend who\u2019s a lobbyist here in Columbia advised me not to say this, but in the spirit of you being here, I\u2019m going to say it anyway.\n\nQUESTION: Muhammad Ali once said that his greatest fault was that he didn\u2019t know how great he truly was. So my question to you is: What do you think your greatest fault is? And how do you overcome that? Or how have you overcome that? And how will you continue to do so in order to win the general election?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t know that it has to do with the general election. I have found this process amazingly interesting. Because, you know, I\u2019ve never done this. I\u2019ve been doing this for seven months. And I\u2019ve been giving credit. We\u2019re doing really nicely. And it\u2019s been very interesting for me.\n\nBut I will tell you, I\u2019ve said a couple of times, one of my faults is I will put up with people and deception, even though I know they\u2019re deceiving, too long. And \u2014 but when I get \u2014 when I, you know, get to it, I\u2019m too tough. In other words, too long, and then instead of just sort of forgetting about it, and especially things that don\u2019t matter that much, I never forget. I don\u2019t forget.\n\nI don\u2019t think you forget either, to be honest with you, but I don\u2019t forget. And, you know, my wife will tell me sometimes, \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 sometimes you\u2019ll go too long, but then when it gets bad, it\u2019s like\u2026\n\nCOOPER: So you hold onto stuff.\n\nTRUMP: I do. I hold onto stuff. And I\u2019d rather not hold onto stuff. But if I\u2019ve been deceived in anyway, or if something happens, I really don\u2019t forget. Sometimes you\u2019re better off forgetting. And in other cases, it\u2019s not such a bad habit. You know, you learn.\n\nBecause usually with people, and I talk a lot about success. Friends of mine ask me, would you speak about success or whatever? And a lot of people pay me a lot of money to do it, and we give it to charity and we have a lot of fun with it.\n\nBut a lot of people ask me that. And you don\u2019t want to necessarily \u2014 you want to remember when people deceive you once, usually that same person will do it again, because that\u2019s a trait that they have. So, it\u2019s not so bad, but I would say I hold on too long and I never forget. And sometimes forgetting is not a bad thing.\n\nI hope that makes sense. COOPER: This is Michael Letz (ph). He\u2019s been a Republican activist for over 30 years. He is also undecided, like many people in the state.\n\nMichael?\n\nQUESTION: Good evening, Mr. Trump. Welcome to the capital of southern hospitality.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Tea is sweet, but it looked like the questions tonight have been even sweeter.\n\nI\u2019d like to have you address a particular issue that I\u2019ve not seen any of our Republican candidates address to this point. In the numerous incidents recently of police-involved shootings, and the questions that have I\u2019ve been led to raise about racism and the racial tensions that have been caused, I\u2019d like to ask what your administration would do to be able to for future situations, make sure that our law enforcement and our first responders have the kind of support that they feel like they need? Because quite frankly, Mr. Trump, first responders\u2019 lives truly matter.\n\nTRUMP: You\u2019re right. I am a big, big supporter of the police. I think the police are being treated horribly in this country. And certainly, you have some bad acts and you have bad mistakes made on occasion. It\u2019s a tiny fraction compared to the great work that they do.\n\nSo I am without question a huge supporter of the police. We wouldn\u2019t be sitting here right now. We wouldn\u2019t have a safe society, really. You look at what\u2019s happening around the world. We wouldn\u2019t have as safe society. So I can tell you right now, I \u2014 I assume you are also, you\u2019re with me on this. I am a tremendous supporter of the police. And I think they are mistreated and misunderstood. And I think we should give them much more credit than we have given them.\n\nCOOPER: I want to ask you at the end of these, we like to sort of just ask a couple of personal questions, just to kind of let viewers get to know you in a different way.\n\nLast night, as you know, we did a town hall. Senator Cruz, I talked to him. He said \u2014 he was claiming that you had suggested your sister as a Supreme Court justice. You have not actually done that.\n\nTRUMP: I have not.\n\nCOOPER: You had said she would be great and she would be \u2014 she would be fantastic.\n\nTRUMP: She\u2019s very smart.\n\nCOOPER: But you\u2019d have to rule that out because she was your sister. What he said was \u2014 he says it\u2019s great to support your sister; that\u2019s a nice thing. But if you\u2019re actually suggesting someone for the Supreme Court, his sister is a radical pro-abortion judge. She struck down New Jersey\u2019s ban on partial-birth abortion as irrational. That\u2019s an extreme position. That\u2019s who he suggested as a Supreme Court justice last year.\n\nWhat\u2019s your reaction?\n\nTRUMP: So, my sister is a brilliant woman who was always a fabulous student, very, very smart. She was appointed by Ronald Reagan. He said appointed by Bill Clinton. She was elevated to the Court of Appeals, a very high position, right under the Supreme Court, as you know.\n\nShe was elevated to the Court of Appeals by Clinton; appointed by Reagan, elevated \u2014 and the reason she was elevated, she was an outstanding intellect and an outstanding judge. I don\u2019t even know what her views are on abortion. I really don\u2019t. She is certainly not a radical anything, because that\u2019s not her thing. But this is the kind of thing he said \u201cradical this, this, this on abortion.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not radical. She may have made a decision one way or the other. I never asked her. I wouldn\u2019t ask her. She wouldn\u2019t want to tell me. I know I got a very big call from a very great reporter actually at the New York Times. And they wanted to do a major piece on my sister. And they called me. Could I possibly get her to do the piece? I called her. She said, \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t do that; I don\u2019t want a piece; I don\u2019t want anything to do with it; I don\u2019t want any\u2026\u201d\n\nTRUMP: And they did the piece anyway. It was a very nice piece on her \u2014 but she refused to partake. She has no interest in that. In fact, I said, \u201care you sure my \u2014 you\u2019re my sister?\u201d\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThe reporter actually said, \u201ccould this be possible?\u201d\n\nCOOPER: A Trump who doesn\u2019t like publicity? I don\u2019t know.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like \u2014 you know, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. I get a lot of publicity. I don\u2019t necessarily like it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Come on, wait \u2014 wait a minute.\n\nTRUMP: No, it\u2019s true.\n\nCOOPER: I gotta call you on that. What?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s true.\n\nCOOPER: What do you mean?\n\nTRUMP: You know what, it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t love that. I can\u2019t stand \u2014 look, for the most part I find the press is extremely dishonest, OK? Very dishonest. I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest.\n\nAnd 25 percent are great. Of course, you\u2019re in that category. He did a great interview with me two weeks ago that I really liked. I thought it was really a great interview because, based on an article a little bit \u2014 in the Wall Street Journal, by Monica, who\u2019s a terrific person.\n\nBut \u2014 but my sister is a great intellect. She is a terrific person. She\u2019s not radical anything. I don\u2019t know what she did, having to do with \u2014 with abortion. But she\u2019s a great judge.\n\nI would have such a conflict of interest \u2014 and I think you probably went back and you checked. I do say sometimes \u2014 and I joke. I say, \u201cmy sister should be on the\u201d (inaudible). You know, I\u2019m laughing and having fun. But I would never do a thing like that\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Right. In fact\u2026 TRUMP: \u2026 because it\u2019s a conflict of interest.\n\nCOOPER: \u2026 and just \u2014 I want to read the quote, just so we \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 have it on the record. You said, \u201cI think she\u2019d be phenomenal. I think she\u2019d be one of the best, but frankly, we\u2019d have to rule that out.\u201d So you never actually were proposing it (ph). So just for the record.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. It\u2019s a \u2014 and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d want to do it either.\n\nCOOPER: So last night after the town hall, I went to celebrate at McDonald\u2019s. I had a number one meal, which is my favorite meal.\n\nTRUMP: (OFF-MIKE).\n\nCOOPER: I understand you like \u2014 you were a big fast-food guy as well \u2014 that you actually bring fast food to your plane sometimes.\n\nTRUMP: I do, sometimes. And \u2014 and frankly\u2026\n\nCOOPER: What \u2014 what do you eat \u2014 when \u2014 when you \u2014 when you roll up at a McDonald\u2019s, what does \u2014 what does Donald trump order?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nA fish delight (ph), sometimes, right? The \u2014 the Big Macs are great. The quarter pounder with cheese. I mean, I \u2014 it\u2019s great stuff.\n\nCOOPER: Do people at the windows be like, \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\nTRUMP: You know, I\u2019m a big \u2014 I\u2019m a person \u2014 they can\u2019t sort of believe it. But I\u2019m a person that \u2014 I like cleanliness, I like clean. And the one thing about the big franchises \u2014 you have to have a certain \u2014 you know, because of the importance.\n\nOne bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald\u2019s. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy\u2019s and all these other places, and they\u2019re out of business. You can\u2019t do it. I mean, I don\u2019t want to mention the name of the firm, but you see what a certain firm is going through right now. I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Do they make it? Do they not make it?\n\nSo I\u2019m a very \u2014 I\u2019m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you\u2019re better off going there than, maybe, someplace that you have no idea where the food\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s a certain standard.\n\nBut I think the food\u2019s good. And I eat it very carefully. You know, I do as good as \u2014 as well as I can. But I think all of those places \u2014 Burger King, McDonald\u2019s, I can \u2014 I can live with them. I had \u2014 the other night, I had Kentucky Fried Chicken. Not the worst thing in the world.\n\n(LAUGHTER) Not the worst thing in the world.\n\nCOOPER: What\u2019s your favorite kind of music?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think Elton John is great, I think the Stones are great. The Beatles, I love. Michael Jackson was a \u2014 actually a very good friend of mine. I knew Michael Jackson very well. Lived in Trump Tower for a long period of time, would go down to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe actually got married \u2014 you know, Lisa Marie Presley \u2014 the whole big deal at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 they were in the tower. And I will tell you, he was up there one week with her, and he never came down, so I don\u2019t know what was going on, but they got along.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, a lot of people say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t really\u201d \u2014 they were up there for a week. They never, ever came \u2014 I said, \u201cwhere the hell is Michael? I\u2019ve \u2014 nobody\u2019s seen\u201d \u2014 but \u2014 but he was a very talented guy. One of the truly most talented people.\n\nI knew him very well. I knew the real story of Michael Jackson. You know, When he died, I would watch people get on \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want to mention names, but people that you know very well and people that you interview \u2014 and they would talk about Michael Jackson.\n\nThey didn\u2019t even know him. I mean, very few people got to know Michael Jackson. But he was an unbelievably talented guy. He lost his confidence. And \u2014 he lost tremendous confidence because of, honestly, bad, bad, bad surgery.\n\nHe had the worst \u2014 he had people that did numbers on him that were just unbelievable \u2014 facially, and \u2014 you know, the plastic surgeons. But Michael was an unbelievable talent who actually lost his confidence. And \u2014 you know, believe it or not, when you lose your confidence in something, you can even lose your talent.\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve talked about working hard as president. You don\u2019t sleep a lot. How much \u2014 how many hours a night do you sleep? And how much television news do you watch? Because I get the sense \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I do like it. I watch\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: You seem to know everything that\u2019s being said about you.\n\nTRUMP: I \u2014 I actually get criticized for it. But I do watch it. I watch you a lot, and I watch other people. And you learn. I mean, especially with what I\u2019m doing.\n\nSomebody said, you watch, you get your generals through television. Well, I don\u2019t. I read a lot. OK? I love to read. But, you know, when I see you interviewing a general, or a \u2014 some security adviser or somebody, I mean, you learn a lot from that. COOPER: How much do you sleep?\n\nTRUMP: And \u2014 and by the way \u2014 about three to four hours a night.\n\nCOOPER: That\u2019s all you need?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s all I need, luckily. I mean\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Have you always been like that?\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 yeah, pretty much. I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 I honestly believe this \u2014 I love what I do. I love my business, I love \u2014 The Apprentice was such a tremendous success. NBC would have done anything to renew it with me. I mean, anything.\n\nSteve Burke came up to my office, the head of Comcast, and he said, \u201cplease, do it, do it, do it.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna run for\u201d \u2014 you can\u2019t run for president and have a show. It\u2019s \u2014 you know, the equal time provisions, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nTRUMP: I said no, Steve, I\u2019m not going to do it. They couldn\u2019t believe it, because they really didn\u2019t believe \u2014 nobody believed I was going to run, you know.\n\nMy wife actually said if you run, you will win. But you have to actually run. You can\u2019t just say you\u2019re going to run because you won\u2019t do well. You know, the polls were \u2014 the original polls, nobody believed I was going to run. Even when they say if he runs, and they wouldn\u2019t even do polls.\n\nBut she said if you run, you\u2019ll win. And Steve Burke came up to the office, he said, I really \u2014 you know, they wanted to renew The Apprentice because it was doing phenomenally well. Even after \u2014 can you believe it \u2014 14 seasons, 14 seasons and The Apprentice still did well. But I\u2019m not doing \u2014 you know, I have that with Mark Burnett and we\u2019re using Arnold Schwarzenegger, and hopefully, Arnold\u2019s going to do. Is Arnold going to do well? What do you think?\n\nCOOPER: A lot of people \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Will he be Trump?\n\nCOOPER: Will he beat you? Are you concerned about that?\n\nTRUMP: He\u2019s no Trump, right?\n\nCOOPER: All right. Are you \u2014 what kind of a \u2014 what kind of a parent are you? Because, I mean, your kids \u2014 a lot of people speak glowingly about your kids, they speak glowingly about you. Were you a tough dad, and are you different as a grandfather?\n\nTRUMP: So I get credit for my children. My children are very good children. They were smart, they went to good schools, they did well. Ivanka everybody knows, and then Don and Eric and then I have two younger \u2014 Tiffany, who\u2019s a terrific young woman, and she \u2014 she\u2019s just graduated from Penn and did mostly A\u2019s. And Baron is doing really good.\n\nSo I have five children. But one thing I think I was really, really a good parent because I put my children above everything, above the business, above everything. And Ivanka speaks to it very well and so do the others. But when people come up and they say why, I would say from the time \u2014 because I had so much \u2014 I had so much experience with alcohol because I have a brother, who is a phenomenal guy, the best looking guy you\u2019ve ever seen, but he became \u2014 he started drinking and I saw from a young age, he was quite a bit older than me. COOPER: He was an airline pilot.\n\nTRUMP: My brother Fred. He was \u2014 he was a very talented flyer of planes, it was \u2014 I mean, great pilots would go to him to study. I mean, it was a real ability he had. But the alcohol was \u2014 I mean, it taught me a tremendous lesson, and he taught me a tremendous \u2014 he was really very \u2014\n\nCOOPER: And that\u2019s why you don\u2019t drink.\n\nTRUMP: He said no \u2014 don\u2019t you ever smoke. He was (inaudible) he said don\u2019t you ever smoke, don\u2019t you ever drink. And I\u2019ve never had a drink. You know, I\u2019ve never had a drink and I\u2019ve never had a cigarette. Those are the good things, I don\u2019t want to tell you the bad things. There are plenty of bad things. But I never had a drink, I never had \u2014 you know, I never had \u2014\n\nCOOPER: You were never tempted to \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No, I just \u2014 I mean, I never liked the taste. I\u2019ve had friends \u2014 when I want to the Wharton School of Finance, I\u2019ve had friends that didn\u2019t like scotch, they hated the taste. And one in particular, became pretty successful, but ultimately alcohol destroyed him. He would be with me \u2014 we\u2019re like 18 or 19 years old, and he was trying to develop a taste for scotch, he ultimately became an alcoholic. He became quite successful, lost the success because of alcohol.\n\nI\u2019ve seen what it does to people, it\u2019s a horror show. And the one thing I can say is if you don\u2019t drink, there\u2019s no temptation. But people come up to me and they say could you see my children? You know, because my children are doing a good job. You know, famous last words. Where\u2019s wood? Is that wood? Yes. OK, I\u2019m going to knock on wood, OK, because who knows. But my children are doing a good job and they\u2019re solid.\n\nBut I would tell them from a very young age, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. I\u2019d say this so \u2014 over and over. In fact, Ivanka sometimes would be like Dad, you\u2019re driving me crazy. You know, she was like 4 years old, she didn\u2019t even know what it was. No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.\n\nAnd I just put it into them because I\u2019ve seen people that are really brilliant, people that you know, people \u2014 the top people in industry, they have children, they\u2019re very smart children, they have all the aptitude in the world but they get hooked on drugs, they get hooked on alcohol and they \u2014 alcohol believe it or not is almost harder than drugs, but it\u2019s harder to get away from it. But they get hooked on alcohol, they get hooked on drugs and as smart as they are, they never make it.\n\nCOOPER: So what is one thing you wish you didn\u2019t do? Like, what\u2019s one \u2014 advice or \u2014 I mean, are you watching TV late at night? What do you \u2014 like \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Well, I mean, look. I mean \u2014 a vice. I work very hard. Maybe I work too hard. I have \u2014 I had two very, you know, wonderful women frankly, that I am a worker. I love to work. I don\u2019t consider myself like a workaholic. I\u2019m a workaholic, but I don\u2019t consider that a bad thing. And I think probably I would have had \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have \u2014 I have a very good marriage now, Melania is fantastic.\n\nBut I had two women that I never blamed because I worked so hard that my job came first. Never came first with my children. I always said I was a better \u2014 I would say this. I was a better father than I was a husband.\n\nBut I worked very, very hard and I love doing it, and you know what I\u2019m very happy about, I have tens of thousands of employees. I\u2019ve put so many \u2014 I\u2019ve had thousands and thousands of employees and that takes care of health care, it takes care of education, takes care of so many things.\n\nSo not that I\u2019d change anything, but it I did a little bit less, probably wouldn\u2019t have had two marriages that didn\u2019t work out.\n\nDonald trump, thank you very much.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you very much.\n\nCOOPER: Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all the time we have. Our thanks to Donald Trump, to Governor Kasich and Bush. I want to thank everybody here in the audience who asked question. A special thanks to the voters, thanks to all the viewers at home and everybody here in Columbia for their help and hospitality.\n\nNext Tuesday, I hope you join us. New Day\u2019s Chris Cuomo is going to be moderating a South Carolina Democratic town hall. Our coverage continues with Don Lemon right after this.\n\n###", "description": "RUSH TRANSCRIPT,\u00a0Mandatory credit: CNN\u00a0 THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
