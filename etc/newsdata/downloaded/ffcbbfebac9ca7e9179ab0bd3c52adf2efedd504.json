It\u2019s the story of one of the most fascinating product releases in recent memory. It\u2019s also the story of the most polarizing product I\u2019ve ever reviewed\u2026twice.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is at once a hopeful glimpse into the future and a fascinating mess. It\u2019s a product I can\u2019t recommend anyone purchase, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m still glad Samsung had the guts to make.\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps most frustrating are the glimpses you get using the device, those moments it transcends lovely and is legitimately useful. And when you leave the device at home, you actually start to miss the 7.3-inch display.\n\nTwo scenarios in particular have really highlighted the value of Samsung\u2019s strong-headed approach to pushing boundaries.\n\nFirst is the gym. Unfolding the device and propping it up on the control panel of a piece of exercise equipment is a beautiful thing. Full-screen Netflix, baseball games from MLB At Bat. Watch the minutes and the calories just fly away. The Fold also works great with the Galaxy Buds, which are legitimately one of the best hardware products Samsung has produced in ages.\n\nSecond is the subway. I\u2019ve been prepping for interviews by reading Pocket stories on the train, with the Notes app open in a side window. This is great. Like a seriously awesome thing. And this is coming from someone who still has trouble embracing smartphones as serious productivity devices. There are just too many limitations to that small screen. When I want to get work done, the laptop comes out. I\u2019m not suggesting the Fold completely changes the math here, but it does edge ever closer, blurring that line a bit in the process.\n\nSo there you go. That\u2019s two distinct examples, covering both entertainment and productivity. The fact is the same as ever: big screens are good. The question is how we get there. It\u2019s a true fact, of course, that plenty mocked Samsung with the first Note device. It seems hard to believe, but in 2011, 5.3 inches seemed impossibly large for a phone. By 2018, however, 5.5 inches was the most popular screen size for handsets. And that number appears to still be growing.\n\nClearly Samsung was right on that one, and the Note played an outsized role in pushing those boundaries.\n\nAfter years of teasing flexible and foldable displays, the tech world was understandably excited when the Galaxy Fold finally arrived. Honestly, there were long stretches of time when it felt like the handset would never arrive. As such, it feels strange to suggest that the product was somehow rushed to market.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, of course, that part of the mainstreaming of big phones has been the technologies supporting the large screen. Samsung, Apple, Huawei, et al. have done a good job consistently increasing screen to body ratios. The new Notes may have bigger screens than ever, but other breakthroughs in manufacturing means we\u2019re not walking around with bricks.\n\nSimilarly, this decidedly first-generation device is big and thick. Anecdotally, reactions have been\u2026mixed. The two separate rounds of review devices I\u2019ve received from the company (round two, for reasons we\u2019ll get into in a second involved two devices) have coincided with big TechCrunch-hosted events in San Francisco. First TC Sessions: Robotics in April and then Disrupt last week.\n\nTake some of this with a grain of salt, because my co-workers can be pretty damn cynical about new technologies (and yes, I\u2019ve been at this long enough to include myself in this). Reactions ranged from genuinely wowed to disappointed bafflement. There was also one co-worker who repeatedly threatened to eat the device because she said it looked like an ice cream sandwich, but that\u2019s a story for another blog post.\n\nThere are plenty of things to be critical from a design standpoint. The \u201cfirst-gen\u201d feel runs very deep with the device. When closed it\u2019s quite thick \u2014 like two phones stacked atop one another. The crease is visible, as has often been reported. And the front display isn\u2019t particularly useful. I get why it\u2019s there, of course. There are plenty of moments when you just want to check a quick notification, bit it\u2019s incredibly narrow and sandwiched between two massive bezels.\n\nNone of those really matter much compared to the device\u2019s fragility. The Fold will forever be the device whose release date was pushed back after multiple reviewers sent back broken devices. Mine worked fine. The company went back to the drawing board for several months and came back with a more robust device that patched up some holes and reinforced the folding mechanism. Mine broke.\n\nAfter about 27 hours with the device, I opened it up in line at CVS and noticed something weird about the screen. Sitting between the butterfly wings was a mass of pixels I referred to as an \u201camorphous blob.\u201d I\u2019d been fairly gentle with the thing, but, as I put it in a followup, \u201ca phone is not a Faberg\u00e9 egg.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s understandable that the product isn\u2019t designed to, say, survive a drop onto hard concrete or a dunk in the toilet.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that many other modern phones have evolved over generations to withstand such accidental bumbles, it\u2019s also understandable that the Fold is a little more fragile. We can\u2019t say Samsung didn\u2019t warn us, and I do appreciate that Samsung was able to go back to the drawing board before wide release, but there\u2019s a pretty strong argument to be made that a smartphone that needs to literally ship with warnings like the ones stated up top isn\u2019t fully ready for prime time.\n\nCNET recently got its hands on a folding machine and found that the handset could withstand 120,000 fold. That\u2019s a little more than half of the promised 200,000. Another third-party test found similar results. Not ideal, but not terrible. It\u2019s about three years\u2019 worth of folds. If you\u2019re dropping $2,000+ on a phone, you may well want it to last closer to the promised five years \u2014 though if you have that sort of disposable income, who knows?\n\nI would honestly be more concerned with the kind of day to day issues that could potentially result in damage like what I saw. It\u2019s possible that mine had a defect. I\u2019ve been using a replacement that Samsung dropped off after collecting mine to send back to Korea for testing. Granted, I\u2019ve been using it even more gingerly than its predecessor, but so far, so good.\n\nThis morning I saw a report of a user experiencing what appears to be the same defect in the same spot. A commenter astutely pointed out the placement of a screw discovered during a recent teardown that could be the source of these issues. As ever, it will be interesting to see how this all\u2026unfolds.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get too far into the other specs here. I wrote thousands of words in my original review. Nothing about the underlying technology has changed between versions one and two. All of the big updates have been to the folding mechanism and keeping the device more robust.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting, I think that my model had 5G built-in. Both technologies feel like a glimpse into the future, but there\u2019s little to recommend plunking down the requisite money to purchase either in 2019. The clear difference is that slow saturation of next-generation cellular technology is a bit more understood at this point. Telling someone that their fingernails can damage their $2,000 phone is a different conversation entirely.\n\nI do think that Samsung\u2019s committed to the Galaxy Fold long-term. And I do believe that there will eventually be a place for the products in the market.\n\nThe biggest short-term concern is all the negative press following the first wave of devices. The FlexPai felt more like a prototype than consumer device. The Fold feels like something of an extended public beta. And the Huawei Mate X, which, although incredibly promising, is still MIA, as the company does another pass on the product. Global availability is another question entirely \u2014 though, that\u2019s due to\u2026other issues\u2026\n\n[gallery ids=\"1885397,1885396,1885395,1885394,1885393,1885392,1885391,1885385,1885384,1885382,1885381,1885379,1885378\"]\n\nKnowing Samsung, the company will return from all of this with a much stronger offering in generation 2. There are a LOT of learnings to be gleaned from the product. And while it offers a glimpse into the promise of foldable, you\u2019re better off waiting until that vision is more fully realized.", "description": "Avoid pressing hard on the screen.
