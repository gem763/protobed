There were claims she had driven down the wrong side of the road after leaving an RAF base on August 27.\n\nThe mum-of-three later fled Britain claiming diplomatic \u00adimmunity. Harry\u2019s mum Charlotte Charles said: \u201cShe\u2019s got to be suffering as well, she\u2019s a mum. Without knowing who this person is properly, we can\u2019t begin to try to start our grieving process.\n\n\u201cIf we have to, we will go to \u00adWashington. We just want to sit and talk with her. We don\u2019t \u00adunderstand how you can just get on a plane and leave behind the devastation she has without even speaking to us or facing us, or an apology of any kind.\u201d\n\nSacoolas was said to have just left RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire when she allegedly hit Harry. Her husband Jonathan worked at the base, used by US intelligence personnel.\n\nThe couple\u2019s children had been attending the \u00a324,500-a-year private Winchester House school in nearby Brackley, where Harry\u2019s dad Tim worked as head of maintenance.\n\nBoris Johnson today vowed to contact Donald Trump if the US does not revoke Sacoolas\u2019s diplomatic \u00adimmunity. He said he would be making contact with the US ambassador and hoped the matter would be \u201cresolved\u201d.\n\nBut the PM, who named Sacoolas in a TV interview, added: \u201cIf we can\u2019t, then of course I will be raising it personally with the White House.\u201d\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nThe US embassy in London said last night: \u201cWe will not comment on the driver\u2019s identity.\u201d It also said requests for diplomatic \u00adimmunity to be revoked receive \u201cattention at senior levels\u201d but added: \u201cImmunity is rarely waived.\u201d\n\nA British former intelligence officer said: \u201cThe Americans have behaved very badly over this and many believe they have abused diplomatic immunity.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly arrogant to expect Britain to put up with this kind of \u00adbehaviour. If the reverse happened in America there would be a public outcry.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Anne Sacoolas,, who allegedly knocked Harry Dunn, 19, off his bike near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, was fined years previously in Virginia, US, for \"failure to pay full time and attention\"", "authors": ["Louie Smith", "Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Sky", "Pa", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530547.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Anne-Sacoolas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
