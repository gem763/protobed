However, it actually originated in Europe prior to the spread of Christianity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The best Google Doodles Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

more notable pretzel myths involves a group of monks baking the snacks in a Vienna basement who overheard an invading army tunnelling under the city walls in 1510.\n\nAs a reward for helping to thwart the invasion, the pretzel bakers received their own coat of arms.\n\nIndeed, the pretzel has been in use as an emblem of bakers in southern areas of Germany since at least the 12th century.\n\nThe unique texture of the pretzel is achieved by dipping the dough in a lye solution and sprinkling with salt just before baking. This results in a chemical process known as the \u201cMaillard reaction\u201d.\n\nWhile the soft pretzel has existed for centuries, it was only in the nineteenth century that they were baked until hard to extend their shelf life. In 1947, the Reading Pretzel Machinery Company unveiled a pretzel-making machine that produced up to 250 pretzels per minute.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest pretzel was baked in 2015 in El Salvador, weighing over 780kg with a length of 29ft.", "description": "Pretzels are the chewy baked treat enjoyed by millions around the globe \u2013 and they\u2019re being honoured with their very own Google Doodle.
