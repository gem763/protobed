The first thing I did when I landed in Moscow was put on a dress and go to Red Square to get a picture.\n\n\u2018My guitar tech says that every night he gets really scared that I\u2019m up there going, \u2018F**k the NRA!\u2019 and some nutcase is going to pull a gun out or something,\u2019 he told NME.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But it doesn\u2019t scare me. Because we\u2019re just doing what\u2019s right. If someone\u2019s going to shoot me for it, then I\u2019m prepared to get shot for it because I believe in it.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s intense, dark and scary to say, but I\u2019m prepared to die for this s**t. As a result, that show in Moscow had the craziest crowd, because those are kids that needed that release and me the most.\u2019\n\nYungblud \u2013 real name Dominic Harrison \u2013 is able to pull off a little black dress just as well as he does a sharp suit on the red carpet, and he revealed his refusal to conform started when he was a child.\n\nHe revealed he first wore a dress aged 12 at his next door neighbour Annabelle\u2019s house: \u2018I remember rubbing my hand on the silk and processing how it felt on my body and I felt really f**king good in it.\n\n\u2018It opened a part of me that I didn\u2019t realise existed. It totally embedded in me. I felt like I became myself more in that 10 seconds.\u2019\n\nHe explained earlier in the year that his choice of outfit is based on how he feels rather than anything else: \u2018Boxes are for cereal. Labels are for clothes. We are human and the need for division is becoming less relevant every day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so funny, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some geezer called Gaz saying \u201cwhy the f**k\u2019s he wearing a dress? It\u2019s been done before, mate.\u201d\n\n\u2018Like, I\u2019m doing it because I want to. I\u2019m not doing it for any other reason because he did it or she did it or anyone did it, I\u2019m doing it because I feel sexy as f**k. So look at me Gaz, I\u2019m sexy as f**k!\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
