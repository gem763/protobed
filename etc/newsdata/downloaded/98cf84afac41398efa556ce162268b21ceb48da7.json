REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\n\nThe comments in a note circulated to diplomats last week show the gap between the two countries on a project seen as an existential threat by Egypt, which gets around 90% of its fresh water from the Nile.\n\nThe note distributed by the Egyptian foreign ministry, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, points to key differences over the annual flow of water that should be guaranteed to Egypt and how to manage flows during droughts.\n\nIt comes as Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan met on Sunday and Monday for their first talks over the hydroelectric dam in more than a year. [nL3N26607J] A spokesperson at Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry, Nebiat Getachew, said on Monday the meeting had so far produced no agreements or disagreements, and gave no immediate response to the Egyptian claims.\n\nEgyptian officials were not immediately available for comment, but Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has expressed unease in recent days over delays in negotiations.\n\nThe $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was announced in 2011 and is designed to be the centrepiece of Ethiopia\u2019s bid to become Africa\u2019s biggest power exporter, generating more than 6,000 megawatts.\n\nIn January, Ethiopia\u2019s water and energy minister said that following construction delays, the dam would start production by the end of 2020 and be fully operational by 2022. [nL8N1Z31YO]\n\nThe dam promises economic benefits for Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt fears it will restrict already stretched supplies from the Nile, which it uses for drinking water, agriculture and industry.\n\nDEADLOCK\n\nThough nationalist, sometimes belligerent rhetoric between Egypt and Ethiopia has cooled in recent years, the sides have remained deadlocked.\n\nA report from International Crisis Group earlier this year warned that Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan could \u201cblunder into a crisis if they do not strike a bargain before the GERD begins operation\u201d.\n\nEgypt says it shared its proposal for filling and operating the dam with Ethiopia and Sudan on July 31 and Aug. 1, inviting both countries for a meeting of foreign and water ministers.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in a letter dated August 12, 2019, Ethiopia summarily rejected Egypt\u2019s proposal and declined to attend the six-party meeting,\u201d the Egyptian government\u2019s note said.\n\nEthiopia had instead proposed a meeting of water ministers to discuss a document that included an Ethiopian proposal from 2018, it said.\n\nBoth proposals agree that the first of five phases for filling the dam should take two years, at the end of which the GERD\u2019s reservoir in Ethiopia would be filled to 595 metres and all the dam\u2019s hydropower turbines would become operational.\n\nBut the Egyptian proposal says that if this first phase coincides with an extreme drought on Ethiopia\u2019s Blue Nile, similar to that experienced in 1979-1980, then the two-year period should be extended to keep the water level at Egypt\u2019s High Aswan Dam from dropping below 165 metres.\n\nWithout such a concession, Egypt says it would risk losing more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion in economic output annually, as well as electricity valued at $300 million.\n\nAfter the first stage of filling, Egypt\u2019s proposal requires a minimum annual release of 40 billion cubic metres of water from the GERD, while Ethiopia suggests 35 bcm, according to the Egyptian document.\n\nThe note cites Ethiopia as saying last month that Egypt\u2019s proposal \u201cput(s) the dam filling in an impossible condition\u201d, a charge Egypt dismisses.\n\n\u201cThe Ethiopian proposal ... overwhelmingly favours Ethiopia and is extremely prejudicial to the interests of downstream states,\u201d it says.", "description": "Egypt says Ethiopia has \"summarily rejected\" its plan for key aspects of operating a giant dam the East African nation is building on the Nile, while dismissing Ethiopia's own proposal as \"unfair and inequitable\".", "authors": ["Aidan Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430753153&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0HU-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
