The Nationals lead the series 2-0 and could conceivably win it before Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nTrump played high school baseball at the New York Military Academy and has thrown out the ceremonial first pitch at major league games. Asked if he would do so again this weekend, he joked that he would have to dress up with a lot of heavy armor and would look too heavy. \u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president is a New York Yankees fan who would often attend their games and sit in the owners\u2019 suite or near the dugout. He welcomed the Astros to the White House last year after they won the 2017 World Series and said their victory was even more special following the devastation Hurricane Harvey wrought on the Texas city.\n\nWashington Nationals pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez said people should \u201crespect that situation\u201d if the president wants to attend the game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the president, and if he wants to come, why not?\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nTrump would be the first sitting president to attend a World Series game since George W. Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch at New York\u2019s Yankee Stadium before Game 3 in 2001. As the former controlling owner of the Texas Rangers, Bush knew several of the players involved.\n\nOther presidents who attended World Series game were Woodrow Wilson (1915), Calvin Coolidge (1924), Herbert Hoover (1929, 1930, 1931), Franklin Roosevelt (1933, 1936), Dwight Eisenhower (1956), Jimmy Carter (1979) and Ronald Reagan (1983).\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writers Ben Walker and Ronald Blum contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump says he is planning to attend the World Series on Sunday if it goes to a fifth game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kevin Freking"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/10/16/trump_90927_c0-223-5350-3343_s1200x700.jpg?6e863663add57988df42be9f4f07a4255363aa1c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
