More\n\nSilicon Joule\u2122 technology replaces the lead-grid and cell connecting, lead-strap material inside a traditional lead battery with a treated silicon wafer. Gridtential is licensing the technology, enabling manufacturing partners to easily adapt their factories to provide high performing, higher voltage 24V & 48V batteries to their customers, without giga-scale capital investments.\n\nGridtential Energy, the inventor and developer of Silicon Joule\u2122 bipolar battery technology and Crown Battery, a leading global manufacturer of 99% recyclable batteries came together last week at the Crown Battery manufacturing facility in Fremont, OH to complete the largest production run of Silicon Joule\u2122 bipolar batteries to date, significantly exceeding yield and throughput targets established for the current design. Manufacturability validation was a key objective for the event and with the benefit of pre-manufactured materials, including treated silicon wafers, the rate of manual production reached less than 5 minutes per unit.\n\nBatteries produced during this event will be filled, formed and shipped to investment partners and customers with evaluation agreements spanning four continents and includes two US automotive OEMs.\n\nSilicon Joule\u2122 bipolar technology has created an innovative class of lead batteries with silicon at its core. It is a design driven, low cost, high performance, patented energy storage solution that provides improved power density, cycle life and temperature range, while retaining full lead battery recyclability. This is all accomplished while leveraging existing technologies from mature industry supply chains \u2013 allowing rapid adoption by utilizing current lead-battery infrastructure.\n\nThe batteries produced last week are a precursor to powerful 24V & 48V batteries that are scheduled for similar production runs in the near future. The company is also accelerating its plans for higher power and larger format products based on the demonstrated progress with our partners.\n\n\"Industrialization is a key step in bringing innovation to an industry and we are very pleased to see Silicon Joule batteries being produced seamlessly on the production floor at Crown Battery,\" stated John Barton, CEO of Gridtential Energy. \"We feel fortunate to work with like-minded battery manufacturers and equipment suppliers to produce products that open up new markets and extend the dominance of lead batteries in the energy storage arena by harnessing more of lead's performance potential.\"\n\nCompared to standard lead batteries, Silicon Joule\u2122 bipolar battery technology removes up to 40% of lead and associated weight through elimination of lead grid and strap material; increases cycle life by 3X to 5X; improves DCA (Dynamic Charge Acceptance) 3X to 10X; extends the operating temperature by +10\u00b0C; and reduces the cost of ownership over the life of the battery by up to 80%, depending on application.\n\nSpecial thanks to Crown Battery for the excellent work and support from the Engineering & Operations teams and to Wirtz Manufacturing for their professional preparation of the active material.", "description": "FREMONT, Ohio, Oct. 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Using technology similar to a solar cell, Gridtential Energy's breakthrough Silicon Joule\u2122 technology allows batteries to deliver up to 5X the power density with up to a 40% weight reduction - and it can be manufactured in current lead battery plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rQxUbNLHcLMNQskBSMnt.w--~B/aD0zMjI7dz00MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_PRNEWSWIRE_LIVE/Gridtential_Energy_and_Crown_Battery-c1cb733493a71d1ab3e9efbbefff9742", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
