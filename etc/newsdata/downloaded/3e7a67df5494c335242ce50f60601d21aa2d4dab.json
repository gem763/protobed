Witness their joint opposition this week to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposal to ease methane regulation. The dirty secret is that the petrol giants don\u2019t mind rules that hurt small competitors.\n\nThe Obama EPA in 2016 rushed out new regulations requiring oil and natural gas operators to limit methane emissions from wells, pipelines and storage facilities. As usual it ignored the law. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act directs the EPA to list stationary sources that contribute significantly to \u201cair pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d Yet the Obama EPA never determined if methane from gas or oil production endangered public health, let alone if pipelines or storage were major pollution sources.\n\nThe Obama EPA claimed it didn\u2019t need to make a separate \u201cendangerment\u201d finding for methane from oil and gas because it had already done so for greenhouse gases from motor vehicles in 2009. But cars primarily spew CO2, which is less potent than methane but has a much longer atmospheric lifespan.\n\nMethane makes up only 10% of global greenhouse-gas emissions with wetlands the biggest source. Of the 60% of methane emissions attributable to human activity, oil and gas account for a third. Oil and gas production makes up a mere 1.2% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nThe Obama Administration also overlooked that energy producers have a financial motive to reduce methane leaks. Some oil producers flare excess methane because it\u2019s too expensive or there aren\u2019t pipelines to transport it to markets. But they lose money on natural gas that leaks from pipelines or storage.\n\nHence most energy companies have adopted technologies to limit leaks. Methane emissions from U.S. oil and gas have declined 12% since 2005 even as oil and gas production increased 80% and 51%, respectively. Methane emissions from the prolific Permian Basin fell 4% while energy production doubled.\n\nThe EPA estimates that a mere 1.4% of natural gas pumped from the ground escapes into the atmosphere. A 2015 Carnegie Mellon University study found greenhouse-gas reductions even with a lifecycle leakage rate of 9% from liquefied natural gas displacing coal for electricity. In sum, the Obama rule would have subjected producers to costly reporting requirements and liabilities for minimal climate benefits.\n\nThe Trump EPA is proposing to rescind the Obama methane rule while retaining emissions limits for ozone-forming volatile organic compounds that can escape from wells with methane. The EPA estimates its revisions will save energy companies between $97 million and $123 million from 2019 through 2025. That\u2019s chump change next to the $50 billion in combined earnings that Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and BP reported last year. But the deregulation will help small producers struggling amid low oil and natural gas prices.\n\nLarge producers are trying to burnish their green image by criticizing the Trump EPA for loosening climate regulation. But they\u2019d also no doubt be relieved if their small competitors, which have continued to increase production, had to fold due to the regulatory onus.
