We swear an oath before the beginning of every Congress. My Oath is something I\u2019ve taken seriously throughout a lifetime of public service - from solider, to state representative to congressman. Unfortunately, leftists in Congress are using their sacred oath to the Constitution as justification to flout the primacy of its principles. We see this no more clearly than in the most recent push to impeach the president.\n\nThese rushed, faux impeachment proceedings are shrouded in secrecy. No one knows what the rules are, and it gives liberal members \u2013 like Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffDemocrats see John Bolton as potential star witness Top State Department official arrives for testimony in impeachment probe The Hill's Morning Report - Trump grapples with Turkey controversy MORE (D-Calif.) - an opportunity to blatantly fabricate facts of convenience and mislead the American people.\n\nThat\u2019s Schiff\u2019s M.O. He\u2019s spent the last two years misleading the American people about the contents of the Mueller report. Once hopes fizzled with that (findings: \u201cNo collusion, No obstruction\u201d), they\u2019ve rolled out the next phony investigation with yet another forgone conclusion.\n\nTo be clear, the impeachment investigation hinges on the accusation that our president would withhold military aid from a strategic ally in the event it failed to provide opposition research on the son of a political opponent. Serious allegations to be sure, but a stretch considering the full context of the president\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe \u201cquid-pro-quo\u201d that Schiff and many others allege, never happened. Read the five-page call transcript for yourselves. That conclusion was reiterated in the testimony from Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerMulvaney helped organize controversial Ukraine meeting State Dept. official told to 'lay low' after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker Top State Department official arrives for testimony in impeachment probe MORE: there was no quid pro quo. It\u2019s why Adam Schiff was so quiet in front of the cameras two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, Schiff, a master at projection and no stranger to soliciting foreign intervention in American elections, was caught late last year soliciting dirt on President Trump with a caller Schiff believed to be a Ukrainian politician. The caller was actually a Russian radio host and the assertion was a prank. Isn\u2019t Schiff doing exactly what he wrongly is accusing the president of doing? How can he rightly oversee an investigation on the same thing of which he\u2019s obviously guilty?\n\nHis own guilt aside, we\u2019ve once again witnessed Chairman Schiff cross a line. During the Intelligence Committee hearing two weeks ago, Schiff, in his opening remarks, lied to the world about the contents of the transcript of the call between President Trump Donald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top? MORE and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Schiff fabricated the contents of President Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine, all to promote a fake, partisan narrative. Schiff\u2019s characterization of the call was so egregious, even he had to later call it \u201cparody\u201d after being pressed by Republican members of the committee. Most recently, it appears Schiff has been untruthful regarding his interactions with the so-called \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Schiff doesn\u2019t care about his oath, the truth or fairness; which is why I joined a group of my colleagues, along with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthy10 top Republicans who continue to deny the undeniable Furious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Five ways Trump's Syria decision spells trouble MORE (Calif.), to offer a resolution calling for the formal censure of Adam Schiff.

His appointment demonstrates that the majority party isn\u2019t interested in the facts, but they are interested in usurping the authority given to the American people. House Democrats will stop at nothing less than overturning the will of the American people and obtaining that power for themselves.\n\nIndeed, that\u2019s a coup.\n\nPerry represents 10th District of Pennsylvania.", "description": "The most solemn duty undertaken by members of Congress is to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.
