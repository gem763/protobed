The identity of the whistleblower has not been publicly disclosed.\n\nThe complaint was released as acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House intelligence committee. Maguire had initially been blocked from releasing the complaint to Congress.\n\nIn his opening remarks on Thursday Maguire said the situation was \u201ctotally unprecedented\u201d.\n\nThe complaint details how the Trump administration sought to block access to the transcript of the call with Zelenskiy \u2013where Trump asked the Ukraine president to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and offered help in investigating Joe Biden, a potential 2020 presidential rival.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, in the days following the call, \u201csenior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room\u201d.\n\nThe White House released a memo of the call, but not a verbatim transcript, on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials were directed by White House lawyers to remove the transcript from the computer system where \u201csuch transcripts are typically stored\u201d, the whistleblower wrote. The transcript was instead stored in a separate system \u201cthat is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\n\u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump appeared to address the rolling Ukraine controversy on Thursday morning, tweeting: \u201cTHE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!\u201d\n\nThe complaint suggests other details of other phone calls have been treated in a similar way, raising concerns about other conversations Trump may have had.\n\n\u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under the administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, submitted in August, is at the heart of the rolling Trump-Ukraine scandal. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is testifying before the House on Thursday. Maguire initially blocked the release of the complaint to Congress, citing issues of presidential privilege and saying the complaint did not deal with an \u201curgent concern\u201d.\n\nThe whistleblower said they were \u201cnot a direct witness to most of the events described\u201d. However, they wrote: \u201cI found my colleagues\u2019 accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.\u201d\n\nIn the 25 July call with Zelenskiy, Trump told the Ukraine president he should work with Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the US attorney general, William Barr, to look into unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, the former vice-president, helped remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden, the current frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe publication of the complaint comes after Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, announced an official impeachment inquiry on Tuesday following the whistleblower\u2019s complaint regarding alleged violations by Trump, setting the stage for a long and rancorous fight in the run-up to next year\u2019s presidential election.", "description": "Whistleblower alleges Trump \u2018solicited interference\u2019 in 2020 election with Ukraine phone call, and that officials sought to block records of the call", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt", "Corey Brettschneider"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da7e85a18def8b7f1c0b588d0434ed142d283c9e/0_278_4202_2523/master/4202.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff6dade58d144586c8ac1a2a4f4f2075", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
