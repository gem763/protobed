George Schaller, a renowned biologist and gorilla expert, conducted the first detailed studies of mountain gorillas in the 1950s and early \u201860s, in what was then the Belgian Congo. He also was the first to discover that wild gorillas could, over time, become comfortable with periodic human presence, a boon to researchers and, later, tourists. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana)\n\nKINIGI, Rwanda (AP) \u2014 Deep in the rainforest of Volcanoes National Park, a 23-year-old female gorilla named Kurudi feeds on a stand of wild celery. She bends the green stalks and, with long careful fingers, peels off the exterior skin to expose the succulent inside.\n\nBiologist Jean Paul Hirwa notes her meal on his tablet computer as he peers out from behind a nearby stand of stinging nettles.\n\nThe large adult male sitting next to her, known as a silverback, looks at him quizzically. Hirwa makes a low hum \u2014 \"ahh-mmm\" \u2014 imitating the gorillas' usual sound of reassurance.\n\n\"I'm here,\" Hirwa is trying to say. \"It's OK. No reason to worry.\"\n\nHirwa and the two great apes are all part of the world's longest-running gorilla study \u2014 a project begun in 1967 by famed American primatologist Dian Fossey.\n\nYet Fossey herself, who died in 1985, would likely be surprised any mountain gorillas are left to study. Alarmed by rising rates of poaching and deforestation in central Africa, she predicted the species could go extinct by 2000.\n\nInstead, a concerted and sustained conservation campaign has averted the worst and given a second chance to these great apes, which share about 98% of human DNA.\n\nLast fall, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature changed the status of mountain gorillas from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered,\" an improved if still-fragile designation, reflecting new survey data.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened without an intervention some biologists call \"extreme conservation,\" which has entailed monitoring every single gorilla in the rainforest, periodically giving them veterinary care \u2014 to clean infected wounds, for instance \u2014 and funding forest protection by sending money into communities that might otherwise resent not being able to convert the woods into cropland.\n\n\"The gorillas are still here. We celebrate that as a victory,\" Hirwa says.\n\nInstead of disappearing, the number of mountain gorillas \u2014 a subspecies of eastern gorillas \u2014 has risen from 680 a decade ago to just over 1,000 today. Their population is split between two regions, including mist-covered defunct volcanoes within Congo, Uganda and Rwanda \u2014 one of Africa's smallest and most densely populated countries.\n\n\"The population of mountain gorillas is still vulnerable,\" says George Schaller, a renowned biologist and gorilla expert. \"But their numbers are now growing, and that's remarkable.\"\n\nOnce depicted in legends and films like \"King Kong\" as fearsome beasts, gorillas are actually languid primates that eat only plants and insects, and live in fairly stable, extended family groups. Their strength and chest-thumping displays are generally reserved for contests between male rivals.\n\nHirwa works for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a conservation nonprofit group. The organization is a successor to the Digit Fund, which Fossey created in 1978 after poachers killed one of her favorite gorillas, Digit. Today the organization supports research, education and training for future conservationists in Africa.\n\nEvery week, Hirwa and other scientists gather data as part of long-term behavioral research.\n\nAs Hirwa recently observed a gorilla family, he gingerly pulled back a stalk of stinging nettles for a better view.\n\nHe watched as the silverback, a 19-year-old named Pato, walked on all fours toward a squirming infant gorilla, Macibiri. Pato sat beside her and ran his long fingers through her fur, grooming her, looking for insects or other things caught in her glossy black coat. He made a low hum.\n\n\"Not every silverback will do that, will pay attention to the infants,\" Hirwa says. \"That shows his personality. Pato is one chill silverback.\"\n\nHirwa noticed a fresh wound on Pato's chest, a small red slash.\n\nMost likely, he surmised, Pato had been jousting with the family's second silverback for control of the group.\n\nLater, Hirwa informed the chief park warden and the staff at Gorillas Doctors, a nongovernmental group whose veterinarians work in the forest.\n\nThe vets monitor wounds and signs of respiratory infections, but they intervene only sparingly.\n\nWhen they do \u2014 for example, by darting a gorilla with antibiotics \u2014 they almost never remove the animals from the mountain, since reuniting gorillas can be difficult. A long absence can change the delicate social dynamic.", "description": "Deep in the rainforest of Volcanoes National Park, a 23-year-old female gorilla named Kurudi feeds on a stand of wild celery.
