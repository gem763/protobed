AA is the third-highest investment-grade rating.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, Paul Chan, said the city\u2019s government disagrees with Fitch\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cThe social incidents over the recent months have not affected Hong Kong\u2019s core competitiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nFitch said the outlook on the rating was negative. It said some public discontent was likely to persist, despite some concessions by the Hong Kong government to protesters\u2019 demands.\n\nOn Wednesday, the city\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam said she would officially withdraw the controversial extradition bill that sparked the turmoil. But she stopped short of meeting some other demands, such as establishing an independent inquiry into police conduct.\n\nSome protesters threatened to stage more demonstrations this weekend, including one that could again obstruct traffic to the city\u2019s airport. The Airport Authority ran local newspaper advertisements on Friday urging protesters not to disrupt travelers\u2019 journeys.\n\nThe Asian financial and trading hub is at risk of a recession, with July data showing an 11.4% slump in retail sales and a decline in tourist arrivals.\n\nFitch said events had inflicted \u201clong-lasting damage to international perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of Hong Kong\u2019s governance system and rule of law, and have called into question the stability and dynamism of its business environment\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe potential for renewed eruptions of social unrest could further undermine confidence in public institutions, and tarnish perceptions of Hong Kong\u2019s governance, institutions, political stability, and business environment,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, Fitch\u2019s analysts said they expected Hong Kong to retain its \u201cconsiderable financial buffers,\u201d including a large fiscal reserve, and said the city had ample resources to maintain the Hong Kong dollar\u2019s peg to the U.S. dollar.\n\nRival S&P Global rates Hong Kong at AA+, equivalent to Fitch\u2019s rating before the downgrade. Moody\u2019s Investors Service assigns the territory an Aa2 rating, which is in line with Fitch\u2019s new assessment. S&P and Moody\u2019s last cut Hong Kong\u2019s ratings in 2017, after downgrading mainland China. Both the ratings companies have stable outlooks on their ratings.\n\nYields on Hong Kong\u2019s 10-year government bonds rose 0.06 percentage point on Friday to 1.123%, Refinitiv data showed, alongside a broader selloff in global bond markets. Yields on these benchmark bonds have fallen sharply from 2.267% a year earlier.\n\n\u2014P.R.
