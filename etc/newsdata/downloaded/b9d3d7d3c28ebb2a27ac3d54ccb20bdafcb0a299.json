Bhagwat could have restricted himself to locating \u201clynching\u201d as an alien practice and asking people to desist from it. But in going further to express irritation with those using \u201clynching\u201d to describe the mob vigilantism and terming this a conspiracy, Bhagwat betrayed concern for form over substance.\n\nCall it \u201clynching\u201d or \u201cmob murders\u201d the crime is no less deadly: lives are being brutally snuffed out and the rule of law derailed. Even the argument that lynching denotes \u201ctraditions alien to Bharat and belong elsewhere\u201d doesn\u2019t pass muster: no civilised society condones mobs meting out instant punishment. By asking critics to talk less about human rights and warning that they erode communal relations, Bhagwat is essentially restating the \u201cAsian values\u201d thesis that Asia leans towards collectivism, authoritarianism and social harmony over human rights.\n\nExtending that argument, Bhagwat wants those condemning lynchings to pipe down in the name of national pride and social harmony. However, lynchings undermine both national pride and social harmony. In today\u2019s connected world one cannot expect to sweep them under the carpet, and adopting ambiguous positions on such a medieval practice hurts India\u2019s global standing. The \u201cAsian values\u201d argument, according to which concepts such as democracy and human rights apply only to the West and not to Asian societies, is currently being challenged by Hong Kong\u2019s brave protesters even as India, another Asian country, has practised democracy for the last seven decades \u2013 indeed that is what the freedom fighters who brought the Indian republic into being fought and sometimes sacrificed their lives for.", "description": "RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat\u2019s befuddling claim that \u201clynching\u201d originated from another country and religious culture alien to India and using the \u201clynching\u201d word to describe recent incidents of mob violence defames India exemplifies the difficulty...", "authors": ["Toi Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/toiedit-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
