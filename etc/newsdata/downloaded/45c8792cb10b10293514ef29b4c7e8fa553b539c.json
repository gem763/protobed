The Indian rupee INR=D4 was weaker by 0.88% at 71.52 against the dollar by 1014 GMT.\n\nOil prices surged nearly 20% at one point on Monday, but prices came off their peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump authorised the use of his country's emergency stockpile to ensure stable supply.

The stock was the biggest loser on the NSE index.\n\nAuto and finance stocks also contributed to losses, with Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and State Bank of India sliding 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively.\n\nFor mid-day report click", "description": "Indian shares end lower as oil prices soar after Saudi attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB2N09U_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
