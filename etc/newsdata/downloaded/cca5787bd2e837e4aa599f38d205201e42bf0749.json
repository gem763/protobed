This partnership builds upon Okta's strategic investment in DataGrail earlier this year.\n\nDataGrail logo (PRNewsfoto/DataGrail) More\n\nOkta customers seeking a privacy solution to help automate privacy compliance can now easily connect DataGrail to their environment, no coding required. Within minutes of connecting DataGrail to Okta, they can develop a clear picture of where personal data lives across their organization.\n\nPrivacy regulations continue to expand, yet most technology platforms fail to meet the growing demands of these regulations. The primary issue is that these platforms were never designed to address sweeping privacy regulations (past or present), and in turn, they are severely limited and lack scalability. As a result, many organizations have no idea what systems they have in place that contain personal data, making compliance nearly impossible.\n\nIn an attempt to achieve compliance, companies often rely on disparate, manual, and error-prone processes, but those methods are not accurate or scalable. Additionally, consent preferences are often siloed by departments or systems\u2014like marketing, customer service, and sales\u2014so customer preference changes aren't necessarily reflected everywhere.\n\nThe DataGrail Platform allows companies to simplify and automate the process of maintaining compliance with privacy laws. DataGrail's Live Data Map features 150+ pre-built connectors with companies \u2014 such as Salesforce, Marketo, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Okta and many others \u2014 providing organizations with an accurate real-time view of the applications used and a view into all the personal data that maps to each of those systems. With DataGrail, companies can confidently reduce inefficiencies and eliminate error-prone processes to comply with data privacy regulations.\n\n\"Companies of all stages and sizes are adopting more and more cloud applications, while consumers are becoming increasingly aware of their privacy implications, and demanding privacy management as a result. DataGrail's solution not only helps companies achieve compliance, but it gives them a 360-degree view of the landscape and is scalable in a way that helps them maintain and manage compliance long-term,\" said Monty Gray, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Okta.\n\nJoint Customer Success\n\n\"After implementing Okta and DataGrail, we've been able to successfully automate the identity and privacy management process, which has been crucial in our preparation for the CCPA and other privacy laws that will follow,\" said Martin Rues, CISO at Outreach.io. \"We are a small and nimble team here at Outreach.io and this system has allowed us to scale in a way that was previously not possible based on our current resources. It also will set us up for long-term success on a global level, so we are prepared when data access requests begin to increase. Technology helps keep our team lean, and it saves us time and money while eliminating the risk present with manual processes.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Today, DataGrail, a leading privacy management firm announced a partnership with Okta, the leading independent provider of identity for the enterprise, to make it seamless for customers to manage matters of privacy and identity, enabling continuous compliance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dX2e5ioWwQphUcQcECZGJA--~B/aD01Mjt3PTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_PRNEWSWIRE_LIVE/DataGrail_Simplifies_Privacy_Compliance_Management-35537532bf33ed2b99ac3a8b276e34d3", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
