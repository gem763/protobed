Both of my parents were Democrats. Some of my siblings. Almost all of my cousins.\n\nHeeding President John F. Kennedy\u2019s call to ask not what your country can do for you, but to ask what you can do for your country, they believe government should protect working families against the predatory practices of multinational corporations such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.\n\nThey fought and continue to fight bravely, both on and off the battlefield, in defense of America\u2019s founding principles of free speech, freedom of religion and of conscience, freedom of association, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nJUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT\n\nYet the tragedy of our time is that these Democrats are being betrayed by their own party, by imposters who pretend to be Democrats but are not.\n\nThe truth is, freedom-loving Democrats and Republicans stand together against a third group that has infiltrated our national political parties \u2013 extreme leftists who openly reject the ideals expressed by the American founders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhether they call themselves democratic socialists or \u201cwoke\u201d advocates for social justice, these authoritarian leftists have little in common with past leaders of the Democratic Party \u2013 people such as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, along with governors like Ann Richards of Texas.\n\nWhile Jimmy Carter said \u201cthe love of liberty is a common blood that flows in our American veins,\u201d the new authoritarian leftists seek to do everything they can to restrict freedom, not expand it.\n\nFor Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described democratic socialist who spent his honeymoon touring the Soviet Union, that means making private health insurance illegal and creating a \u201cnational wealth registry\u201d to aid government confiscation of \u201cexcessive\u201d wealth.\n\nOf course, many, if not most, real Democrats are horrified by these leftist assaults on long-established American liberties.\n\nFor former Rep. Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, D-Texas, it means that all churches, synagogues, mosques and religious organizations that do not publicly accept gay marriage shall lose their tax-exempt status and not be allowed to participate in public life.\n\n\u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at a CNN town hall Oct. 10.\n\nFor New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, it means passing a law making it a crime to use the words \u201cillegal alien\u201d in a way that can be construed as \u201cdemeaning,\u201d punishable by a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nIndeed, the new authoritarians seem to go out of their way to attack the Bill of Rights, especially freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to bear arms.\n\n\u201cI would love to regulate free speech,\u201d Rep Ted Lieu, D-Calif., announced in a jaw-dropping admission on live TV a year ago. \u201cThe First Amendment prevents me from doing so.\u201d\n\nRealizing what he had just admitted to, Lieu quickly added that it\u2019s probably better if government not regulate speech but, instead, \u201coutsource\u201d such censorship to big tech monopolies such as YouTube and Facebook. \u201cI would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the past, Democrats sought to use the power of the state to check the worst excesses of the free market, to provide a safety net for people in time of need, while simultaneously protecting the fundamental rights and responsibilities outlined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn contrast, the imposters now taking over the Democratic Party want to abolish parts of the U.S. Constitution and replace them with something else \u2014 an alien ideology that gladly sacrifices basic civil liberties in the pursuit of allegedly higher ideals.\n\n\"Leftists are more likely than liberals to argue that economic inequality renders America\u2019s constitutional liberties hollow,\" Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic. \"They\u2019re more likely to look abroad \u2014 to the Soviet Union or Cuba in past eras, and to Scandinavia today \u2014 for alternatives to America\u2019s political and economic models.\"\n\nOf course, many, if not most, real Democrats are horrified by these leftist assaults on long-established American liberties.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey are quick to say they are fighting for better wages and affordable health care, not a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that could cost as much as $93 trillion.\n\nYet, if they are not careful, their party will soon be led not by pro-union Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, but by extreme leftist ideologues who care more about punishing churches for thought crimes than they do about creating jobs and better schools.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ROBERT J.
