Smallest, biggest or shiniest. You could also see how many conkers they can fit in their pockets. If there aren't any horse chestnut trees near you, then you can gather fallen sticks and have an impromptu game of \"pick up sticks\".\n\nYou could also try the CBBC conkers bonkers quiz to see how much you actually know about them.\n\nJust a note: Many primary schools now don\u2019t allow conker games due to health and safety, so best to just keep them at home.", "description": "Autumn is a fantastic time to get out and about with your child, but with the days getting shorter, colder and wetter it can be a struggle to know what fun things you can do.
