She then proceeded to reach her first quarterfinal, get her first top-10 win and bag her first title.\n\n\"I'll definitely remember this moment for the rest of my life,\" Gauff told the crowd.\n\nGauff had to wait to fully celebrate because the final point ended on an Ostapenko challenge. But once the match was official she raised her arms in celebration and let out a big smile as she looked at her box, where dad Corey and mom Candi were watching.", "description": "After losing in the qualifying rounds, Coco Gauff got a second chance and won her first title Sunday in Linz, Austria.
