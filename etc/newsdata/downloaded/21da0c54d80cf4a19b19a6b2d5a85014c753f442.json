(AP) - After Dolan Shoemaker\u2019s first ballet performance as a student at the Mississippi University for Women, his father\u2019s feedback was succinct.\n\n\u201cThat looks a lot harder than I thought it would,\u201d Shoemaker recalls him saying.\n\nShoemaker\u2019s parents had driven from Decatur to support his new endeavor, and he took those words as high praise from his blue-collar father \u2014a farmer and an auto body repair instructor at East Central Mississippi Community College \u2014 who had been particularly impressed with how proficiently Shoemaker lifted the ballerinas during the dances.\n\n\u201cWhen he said that, I told him, \u2018It\u2019s like holding a 100-pound sack of horse feed over your head, smiling and walking off the stage like a prince,\u2019\u201d Shoemaker said. \u201cHe never missed a performance.\u201d\n\nShoemaker, 57, built an impressive professional ballet resume before returning for good to Columbus about five years ago. Now, he teaches about 70 intermediate or advanced dance students as ballet master for Wherehouse Dance Company in the Brickerton Shopping Center, and while his peak dancing days may be behind him, he still finds time to perform with a group based in New Albany.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still on that stage,\u201d Shoemaker said. \u201cInstead of being the prince, I\u2019m the king sitting on the throne watching the young guys do the hard turns, leaps and lifts. \u2026 I can still do it, though.\u201d\n\nFinding ballet was a sort of happy accident for Shoemaker. Toiling away in 1982 at Mississippi State University as a computer science major \u2014 which, he said, he hated \u2014 he signed up for a dance class on campus just for fun. The teacher for that class, however, saw potential in his footwork and soon Shoemaker earned a scholarship to study ballet at MUW.\n\nFrom there, Shoemaker studied on scholarship at the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre before starting his professional career with the Ballet Mississippi company in Jackson, with which he performed for six years across the Southeast. He\u2019s performed as a guest artist with companies from Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, and he\u2019s been assistant production manager three times for international ballet competitions in Jackson.\n\nDuring his career, Shoemaker has studied with dancers from England, Russia, Cuba and a half-dozen other countries. His favorite places to perform, however, are in South Louisiana.\n\n\u201cI love the Cajuns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always had great receptions with good food and usually lots of wine. Just great people.\u201d\n\nShoemaker started teaching in 1992 when he co-founded the Mississippi Metropolitan Ballet in Madison. Since returning to Columbus, one of his primary goals is removing the stigma from boys learning to dance \u2014 something that kept him from even trying until he was 19. He teaches a boys\u2019 class at Wherehouse each week, and the ones who give it a try tend to quickly see its value, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to recruit because there is such a stereotype,\u201d Shoemaker said. \u201cBut anything you would hear from a football, basketball or baseball coach about discipline or teamwork, the same applies to ballet. It requires discipline because it\u2019s so physical, and you have to trust your teammates because if one domino falls, they all fall.\u201d\n\nThe audience that has been most receptive, he said, is soccer players.\n\n\u201cOne boy, his soccer game has improved, because his footwork has gotten better,\u201d Shoemaker said.\n\nFor Shoemaker, dance, at long last, has brought him back to where he believes he belongs. It\u2019s actually his third time living in Columbus \u2014 he came back briefly in the \u201890s and taught at MUW \u2014 but this time, he\u2019s here for good. Wherehouse, he said, is the \u201cmost nurturing environment\u201d in which he has ever taught and his life, generally, is working out pretty well.\n\n\u201cThis is my home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve bought a house here. I\u2019m staying.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After Dolan Shoemaker's first ballet performance as a student at the Mississippi University for Women, his father's feedback was succinct.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Zack Plair", "The Commercial Dispatch"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/26/exchange-ballet_teacher_37663_c0-63-1500-938_s1200x700.jpg?f931fd0127f445df48acccbbb2a7767806d8abba", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
