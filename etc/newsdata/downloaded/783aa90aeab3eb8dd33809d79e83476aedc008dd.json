The blasts at key facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais forced Saudi oil giant Aramco to suspend production of about 5.7 million barrels per day \u2014 roughly half the kingdom\u2019s output and 5 percent of the world\u2019s total supply \u2014 with a fuzzy time frame on when normal production would resume. Various trade analysts warned that the price of a barrel could spike this week; one expert even declared that, \u201cin the oil universe,\u201d the strikes were \u201cperhaps equivalent to the 9/11 attacks.\u201d\n\nThe attacks were claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, an Iran-linked faction already responsible for multiple rocket and drone strikes on targets within Saudi Arabia\u2019s borders \u2014 acts which they view as retaliation for the Riyadh-led coalition\u2019s near-half-decade war in their country. But these seemed of a different magnitude of sophistication: A supposed fleet of 10 Houthi drones flew hundreds of miles undetected over Saudi territory before unleashing a crippling attack on infrastructure critical to global energy markets.\n\n\u201cHouthi missiles have struck Saudi sites before, including its oil infrastructure,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cBut the latest strike on Aramco was a symbolic blow against the historical hub of the kingdom\u2019s oil riches, and the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plans to remake the kingdom\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nThey added that Abqaiq \u201cmay be the world\u2019s most important piece of oil infrastructure, built to process about 7 million barrels a day of oil so that it can be shipped out of the Persian Gulf to foreign markets.\u201d\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nThe symbolic heft of the attack added to the impression that it couldn\u2019t just be a Houthi-directed strike. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Tehran directly for launching \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d and said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the attacks originated from Yemen.\n\nU.S. officials told my colleagues that some 15 structures at Abqaiq were damaged on the west-northwest-facing sides of the facility \u2014 not the southern facades, as one would expect with an incursion from Yemen. On Sunday, the Trump administration released declassified satellite photos they thought showed evidence of cruise missile strikes originating from Iraq or Iran. Other reports suggested the attack involved drones launched from a base in Iraq run by another Iran-backed militia \u2014 this time as a reprisal for an earlier Israeli drone attack on the Iraqi group that supposedly was assisted by Saudi intelligence.\n\nPhotos released by Trump administration show extent of weekend attack on Saudi oil industry. US officials say evidence now pointing towards cruise missile attacks from Iraq or Iran, not drone strikes from Houthis in Yemen. But no official assessments yet from DC or Riyadh. pic.twitter.com/0HDz4DFXnH \u2014 Dion Nissenbaum (@DionNissenbaum) September 15, 2019\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi denied that his country\u2019s territory was used for the attack. The Iranians were all the more vociferous. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif urged Washington to stop \u201cblaming\u201d Iran and consider talks in a tweet where he rejected Pompeo\u2019s \u201cdeceit.\"\n\nBut after a summer of attacks on shipping tankers in the Persian Gulf, it\u2019s impossible to dismiss the Iranian hand in the equation. President Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign has squeezed the Iranian economy and probably convinced some officials in Tehran of the utility of carrying out asymmetric acts of sabotage that rattle neighbors and raise the geopolitical stakes in the region. Hard-liners in Iran are also eager to move away from the strictures of the nuclear deal already abrogated by the Trump administration and put more pressure on Zarif\u2019s boss, President Hassan Rouhani.\n\n\u201cThe attack fits with Iran\u2019s apparent strategy at the moment,\u201d tweeted Michael Singh, a former George W. Bush administration official. \u201cFaced with a de facto oil embargo, it aims to deter the US by escalating its regional aggression and nuclear activities, likely because it perceives these are two areas of comparative advantage.\u201d\n\nIran has, until now, retained a degree of plausible deniability. Keen to tamp down tensions, regional rivals like the United Arab Emirates have been coy about directly pinning the blame on Iran after various attacks. The strained relations between the Trump administration and the country\u2019s traditional allies in Europe \u2014 who all opposed Trump\u2019s departure from the nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions on Iran \u2014 have made it hard for Washington to cobble together a joint response to suspected Iranian violations. And the general volatility of the White House has prompted many other governments to second-guess Trump\u2019s broader motives and strategy.\n\n\u201cIf you are Iran,\u201d observed Ilan Goldenberg, a Middle East expert at the Center for New American Security, \u201cthis lack of US credibility gives you more flexibility to support these types of unattributed attacks, because the threshold for believing US claims at this point is so high it\u2019s almost impossible to meet.\u201d\n\nAfter remaining conspicuously silent through the weekend, Trump tweeted Sunday evening that \u201cthere is reason to believe that we know the culprit\u201d and that his administration was waiting for more clarification from the Saudis before determining how to proceed. In a subsequent tweet, Trump seemed to pour cold water on speculation that he was preparing for a meeting with Rouhani on the sidelines of upcoming events at the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nHawks in Washington, including plenty of figures within Trump\u2019s own party, are opposed to the president sitting down with Rouhani. That pressure has been mirrored in Tehran, too, where a group of hard-line lawmakers issued an official parliamentary warning last month scolding Rouhani for considering a Trump meeting. Their influence \u2014 and that of the powerful Revolutionary Guard \u2014 may underlie the latest attacks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should overlook [the] possibility this was set up by Iranian hardliners alarmed by [the] possibility of a Trump-Rouhani meeting and determined to sabotage it,\u201d suggested Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. diplomat and senior vice president of the Middle East Institute in Washington.\n\n\u201cThere are hawks in Iran and America and in the region who want military conflicts,\u201d said a senior Iranian government official, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity. \u201cSuch attacks will make a military confrontation inevitable and that is what hardliners in Iran and elsewhere want. Such confrontation will harm not only Iran but all the countries in the Persian Gulf.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
