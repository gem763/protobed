New Zealand still fell short of its record winning margin against Tonga: 102-0 in 2000.\n\nTonga, ranked 15, showed an indomitable spirit by scoring the last of the match through captain Siale Piutau and holding top-ranked New Zealand scoreless for the last 15 minutes.\n\nNew Zealand also took eight minutes to score its first try through winger Sevu Reece, and the floodgates opened as Tonga barely touched the ball as it played into a stiff breeze in the first half.\n\nBridge recorded his second try by catching the kickoff which started the second half and running in almost unopposed as the scorline mounted relentlessly.\n\nHooker Codie Taylor, scrumhalf T.J. Perenara, and back rowers Matt Todd, Ardie Savea and captain Kieran Read also scored before the All Blacks\u2019 attack fizzled toward the end of the match.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our last hit-out together and I guess we\u2019ve got two weeks between now and our first (World Cup) game,\u201d Read said. \u201cIt was really important we just kept building and it\u2019s the exciting part from here on in.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to keep control. You\u2019ve got to earn the right to score tries like we did and if wingers are scoring tries on the sideline that means you\u2019re doing a good job on the inside.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks\u2019 forwards were dominant at breakdowns, giving their team an almost constant supply of possession. Among the backs the veteran Smith, Bridge, center Anton Lienert-Brown and Perenara were outstanding. Savea and Read were impressive among the forwards.\n\nNew Zealand scored almost at will from set pieces - the best example coming when Crotty went over the line as first receiver from an attacking scrum - and from turnovers. Smith scored both of his tries from long range after breakdown turnovers.\n\nHead coach Steve Hansen told reporters Thursday that Smith was suffering from a loss of confidence after an injury-plagued season. He fully recovered his confidence Saturday with his double and as by playing a key lead-up role in several tries.\n\nSavea was rewarded for an outstanding game with a try in the 47th minute, created from a cross kick by Ioane which Reece caught on the fly. Reece turned the ball infield to Crotty and he passed to Savea who finished like a winger.\n\nNew Zealand will face much greater defensive pressure at the World Cup but will take confidence from the fact that, when given space, its attack is well-oiled.\n\nTonga will also try to find positives from its defeat.\n\n\u201cA loss like this is difficult for the boys to take,\u201d Piutau said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll go back to the drawing board and learn a lot from this match and hopefully we can execute come the World Cup.\u201d\n\n____\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Winger George Bridge scored four tries while fullback Ben Smith and center Ryan Crotty bagged doubles as New Zealand overwhelmed Tonga 92-7 Saturday in its last match before defending its Rugby World Cup title in Japan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/aptopix_new_zealand_tonga_rugby_79043_c0-120-3600-2218_s1770x1032.jpg?3d4418892aeca941ac90b2a0a958981728f26c1d", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
