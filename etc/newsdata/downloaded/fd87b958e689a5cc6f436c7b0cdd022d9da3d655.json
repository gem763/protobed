Sometimes I would even find toilet paper they had used for their menstruation and that affected me because I realised that some people cannot afford pads. It\u2019s really sad, people are very poor and cannot afford such cheap items,\" he explained.\n\n\"I put one pack of pads on the dashboard and when there are two left, I buy another pack. It is only R17 and I wish all other drivers would start joining this initiative. I have also started buying wipes so that those who leak can use them,\" he said.\n\nAlthough he has tried to normalise menstruation in his community, he says he still faces a challenge where people find it taboo to speak about periods and where \"sex is more normalised than menstruation\".\n\n\"There are a few kids who are still shy to use the pads because some of the boys make funny faces and remarks when they see that someone is menstruating, however, I have tried to normalise this by talking to them and explaining that this is normal,\" Kamogelo said.\n\n\"If condoms can be available everywhere, pads should be too\"\n\n\"Now, all the neighbouring school children, their parents and vendors outside the schools know that there are pads in my car and they come to ask for them.\"\n\nKamogelo, who is a father to a male child, also believes that the solution to normalising menstruation is teaching about it in schools from primary school level.\n\n\"There is a very wrong misconception in a man\u2019s mind about menstruation. Some believe that when a woman menstruates she should stay away from men, food and church. That concept must change. As much as there are Life Orientation books that contain information about sex, those same books should contain information about menstruation.\"\n\nHe said if condoms can be available everywhere, pads should be too.\n\nKamogelo also urged other drivers and motorists to join his initiative by keeping pads in their cars.\n\n\"It is important for all of us to help one another,\" he said.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
