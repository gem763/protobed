But the classic chaat pairing of spicy and verdant cilantro chutney with sweet and sour tamarind sauce provides another level of brightness and complexity. Don\u2019t skip the chhonk, a sauce made of melted ghee, cumin seeds and red chile powder that is drizzled over the top of the nachos. It provides a rich finish and even more crunch.", "description": "These vegetarian nachos take their cues from paapdi or papri chaat, the spicy, tangy and sweet Indian snack of fried dough wafers piled with chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, yogurt and various chutneys This take starts with standard nacho elements: tortilla chips, black beans and a healthy amount of bubbly, melted cheese But the classic chaat pairing of spicy and verdant cilantro chutney with sweet and sour tamarind sauce provides another level of brightness and complexity", "authors": ["Priya Krishna", "Ritu Krishna", "Alison Roman", "Julia Moskin", "Elaine Louie", "Ali Slagle", "John T.
