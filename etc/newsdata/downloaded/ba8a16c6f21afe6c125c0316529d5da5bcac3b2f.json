Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza, for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"The committee explained the trio's work has greatly expanded knowledge of how physiological responses make life possible, adding such a response is key to many things, including producing red blood cells and fine-tuning the immune system.The Nobel Committee also added the scientists are now focused on developing drugs that can treat diseases by either activating or blocking the body's oxygen-sensing machinery.The winners will share the 918-thousand U.S. dollars cash prize between the three of them.Kim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
