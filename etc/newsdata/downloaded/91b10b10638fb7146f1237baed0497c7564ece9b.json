However, Pompeo said there was no evidence the drones were launched in Yemen and accused Iran of \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\u201d said Pompeo.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi responded angrily to Pompeo\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cSuch fruitless and blind accusations and remarks are incomprehensible and meaningless.\u201d\n\nIran has denied claims it was responsible for the attacks, with Iranian officials also warning that US military assets in the region were within range of its missiles. \u201cHaving failed at \u2018max pressure\u2019, [Pompeo is] turning to \u2018max deceit\u2019,\u201d the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, wrote on Twitter.\n\nAs the diplomatic crisis deepened, Trump tweeted that reports he had been willing to meet with Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, before the drone attacks were false. \u201cThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions.\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!),\u201d he tweeted on Sunday.\n\nBut political commentators were quick to point out that those comments came from Pompeo and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, who five days ago said on camera that Trump was willing to meet with Rouhani with \u201cno preconditions\u201d at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nEric Columbus (@EricColumbus) Here\u2019s video of Pompeo and Mnuchin saying what Trump just called \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 that he would meet with Iran without conditions.\n\n\n\nIn light of the bombing of Saudi oil facilities, Trump is pretending they didn\u2019t say this and blaming the media.\n\npic.twitter.com/PX9gbwLBiZ\n\nOver the weekend a senior commander from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards warned that the Islamic republic was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war.\n\n\u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000km around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 aerospace force, Amirali Hajizadeh, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nSaudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the kingdom was \u201cwilling and able\u201d to respond to this \u201cterrorist aggression.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oilfields and pipelines have been targeted by rebels over the past year but never on such a scale and causing such disruption. Analysts warned that global supplies of oil are likely to suffer a \u201cmajor jolt\u201d following the attack. Aramco said the attacks would cut output by 5.7m barrels a day, more than 5% of global crude supply.\n\nNo casualties were reported but the full extent of the damage from Saturday\u2019s attack was not clear, nor the type of weapons used, and reporters were kept away from the plants amid beefed-up security.\n\nAramco also said it will dip into its reserves to offset the disruption. On Saturday, CEO Amin Nasser said that \u201cwork is underway\u201d to restore production, but the incident could affect investor confidence ahead of Aramco\u2019s stock market debut.\n\nA significant volume of oil production can be restored within days but the company would need weeks to reach full output again, Bloomberg News reported Sunday, citing unnamed sources.", "description": "US president says he has \u2018reason to believe we know the culprit\u2019 of the drone attacks on Aramco plant", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19054b329709a6cc41d18b644337207d230922c4/0_506_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2dc70bdf3c37d3232ed635cc15701c6a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
