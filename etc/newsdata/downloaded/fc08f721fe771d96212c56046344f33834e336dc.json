They\u2019re very results orientated and they don\u2019t want to let anything get in the way of them achieving what they need to achieve. Sometimes that means pointing the finger elsewhere. I get that.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re concerned about is that coaches are no different to players in that they should respect the referees. If they have an issue around refereeing then they should go through the appropriate channels in the appropriate way. If they want to talk about World Rugby, then hopefully it\u2019s founded on some fact rather than just hearsay.\u201d\n\nTwice Jones criticised referees following the games against Wales, targeting Mathieu Raynal for the way he judged potential red-card offences in their Twickenham clash and accusing Pascal Gauzere of losing control of the players early in the hotly-charged and fiery Cardiff return.\n\nJones has also criticised how strict the governing body is in disciplining those who speak out against them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to comment on referees,\u201d Jones said at Twickenham on 11 August following the victory over Wales. \u201cWorld Rugby are like Big Brother, they have facial recognition everywhere. You say one word and you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nGosper also issued a response to All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, who has called on World Rugby to do more to help the Pacific Islands grow in the wake of New Zealand\u2019s 92-7 demolition of Tonga at the weekend, though he was happier to brush off the criticism.\n\n\u201cWorld Rugby are as good as anyone to blame, I guess,\u201d laughed Gosper.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u2019s first day back in Japan went from bad to worse after World Rugby\u2019s chief executive Brett Gosper issued a stinging response to the England boss\u2019s recent referee criticism, reminding him that he is no different to players and should keep to \u201cfact rather than hearsay\u201d.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/12/brett-gosper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
