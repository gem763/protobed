Bright and bouncy on his feet, he was a lively support player down the left-hand side from the first minute.\n\nLeft footed, he tried to make an overlap whenever he spotted the opportunity.\n\nHis timing was good, making his move at just the right time to get towards high positions.\n\nNot yet filled out, Thomas looks a good size for a left back. He is not too small or too big, perfect for a low centre of gravity when tackling, and enough height to handle back post defensive headers.\n\nThis was a game when he was most impressive when surging forwards and crossing on the run.\n\nDespite the challenge of the opposition right back or indeed the centre back coming across to try and hold him up, he delivered two excellent balls to the far post area, one an absolute peach that resulted in a goal-bound header.\n\nThomas has scored one goal and set up another while on loan with Barnsley this season\n\nHe was sharp on the turn, although his direct opponent was a diminutive wide ball player rather than a speed merchant. Thomas had him in his pocket for the whole game.\n\nHe showed fair speed and bravery, too. His defensive work was adequate. He was not extended too much in his game.\n\nI also noticed a decent long throw down the line, an asset which I am pleased to say Leicester did not overuse as an attacking weapon. His delivery was swift and he made early decisions.\n\nI wondered if he felt that with two tall and mobile centre backs to his right, he had good insurance for his forward flurries and was well-protected in midfield.\n\nWhat does he need?\n\nI saw him on a day when his group were in the ascendency and it would be wiser to watch him when his team are playing stronger opposition.\n\nI will see him again under more pressure but he looks a prospect and reminds me of the notes I made in this column about Chilwell three or four seasons ago.", "description": "Our scout is a top football expert who attends matches each week searching for the next star.
