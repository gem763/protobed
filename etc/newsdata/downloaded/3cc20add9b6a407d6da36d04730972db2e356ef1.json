Richard Hunter discusses whether a deal - or some certainty - could see the stock market bounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "\u2018We want an income not just for today, but a growing income into the future,\u2019 says Evenlode Global Income\u2019s Ben Peters, as he discusses the companies it favours.", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
