To the contrary, both of the non-testifying individuals named in paragraph four figured in key events examined in the Mueller Report. Assessment of these choices by the Special Counsel is a matter for others.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. was present at the now-famous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which Trump campaign officials met with Russians. Before that meeting, he also received an email offering \u201cdirt\u201d on Democratic president candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say, I love it,\u201d Trump Jr. responded.\n\nAn attorney for Trump Jr., Alan Futerfas, did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the confirmation that his client never testified.\n\nThe Mueller report says Trump Jr. declined a voluntary interview, but several lines that follow that statement are blacked out.\n\nLawyers for other witnesses in the probe have said they believe Trump Jr.\u2019s attorneys informed prosecutors he would assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called to the grand jury and that Mueller\u2019s team elected not to force his testimony by asking a judge to grant him immunity.\n\nIn April, prior to release of the report, one of the president\u2019s personal attorneys tamped down talk that Trump Jr. exercised his constitutional right to remain silent.\n\n\u201cI can tell you I have no knowledge that anybody took the Fifth,\u201d Rudy Giuliani said at the time.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. was present at the now-famous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting where campaign officials met with Russians.

The move was widely seen as a courtesy aimed at avoiding a potential clash between Mueller\u2019s office and the White House.\n\nMcGahn\u2019s attorney, Bill Burck, told POLITICO on Sunday that there was no need for McGahn to go in front of a grand jury because he was willing to answer prosecutors\u2019 questions.\n\n\u201cDon McGahn voluntarily agreed to be interviewed. There was no need for a grand jury subpoena,\u201d Burck said.\n\nMcGahn\u2019s extensive interviews, which total about 30 hours, provided a key part of the narrative surrounding several episodes of potential obstruction. Mueller ultimately reached no legal conclusion about those instances.\n\nLimiting the use of a grand jury in the obstruction probe also gave the Justice Department greater leeway to make that portion of the report public with few redactions.\n\nHowell noted in her order last week that Mueller\u2019s final report disclosed that one person highly central to the investigation \u2014 President Trump \u2014 was not interviewed or called before the grand jury. The special counsel considered subpoenaing Trump because of dissatisfaction with written responses to prosecutors\u2019 questions but elected not to do so, the judge observed.\n\nThe document that confirmed the lack of grand jury testimony by Trump Jr. and McGahn is a court declaration filed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer, the Justice Department\u2019s highest ranking career official.\n\nWeinsheimer\u2019s declaration relates to a part of the House-Justice Department legal fight about supporting documents for Mueller\u2019s report, including dozens of FBI reports detailing interviews with key witnesses in both parts of the special counsel probe.\n\nIn a court filing earlier this month, the Justice Department said the process of sharing so-called 302 reports from the Mueller probe with the House was ongoing. DOJ lawyers said they had yet to turn over the summaries of interviews with McGahn, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump aide Steve Bannon and former White House communications director Hope Hicks.\n\nThe House has received FBI reports on Mueller interviews with other key players, including Chris Christie, Michael Cohen, Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Rod Rosenstein, Chris Ruddy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Sean Spicer.\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ce/93/5588c83c41efa4b79cee67abe977/20191020-mcgahn-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
