But Francois believes a civil action can be brought against Buckingham Palace itself, which serves as the monarch's administrative headquarters\n\nThis meant his family lost land, titles and wealth - and now he's looking for her to be included in the history books.\n\nUnder English law, the Royal Family cannot be prosecuted under criminal law nor sued through the civil courts.\n\nBut Francois believes a civil action can be brought against Buckingham Palace itself, which serves as the monarch's administrative headquarters.\n\nThe retiree, who bears a striking resemblance to Edward, his supposed late grandfather, said that he has 'absolutely no interest' in compensation.\n\nHe is instead looking for closure and for the history books to be 'rewritten as necessary' to reflect his family's place in the sovereignty's lineage - as he has no children of his own.\n\nHe said: 'In the 1900s, the true line of succession was unlawfully concealed to block the Graftieauxs from their place in history.\n\nPierre-Edouard Graftieaux and Marie-Rose Graftieaux (right) the parents of Francois Graftieaux.
