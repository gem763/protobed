You\u2019re about to see the biggest capital for labor swap in history,\u201d Mayo said.\n\nMayo said automation can reduce the amount of repetitive work being done by humans, such as data input in a mortgage application.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot less errors, you need a lot less people to do it, and the customer is a lot happier too,\u201d Mayo said.\n\nHis report notes that banks are already in the process of reducing headcount, claiming that U.S. banks have seen the largest decline in employee counts and branch locations in history.\n\nStill, Mayo says the finance industry in the U.S. spends more on tech than any other industry, about $150 billion annually. For a banking industry that has underperformed the market by 70% in this century, Mayo says the investment in technology should pay off in lower expenses over time, particularly for the larger banks.\n\n\u201cThis should lead to record efficiency and market share gains by scale players, reflecting our theme, \u2018Goliath is Winning,\u2019\u201d Mayo wrote.\n\nAshley is a Production Assistant for Yahoo Finance.
