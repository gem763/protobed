And Trump\u2019s recent abrupt troop withdrawal from northern Syria, roundly condemned by many on both sides of the political spectrum, swiftly turned into a victory lap.\n\nNext, President Trump likely will cut U.S. military ties to Afghanistan, just as he did with Syria.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Trump\u2019s foreign policy doctrine is not pure impulse and personal bias masquerading as strategy. Instead, it is framed in terms of return on investment. Unlike his immediate predecessors, who framed their foreign policy in idealistic terms, Trump eschews the advancement of moral values and conducts foreign policy within a short-term transactional prism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConsider the stark differences over the past 20 years. For example, President George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural speech explained that the \u201cpolicy of the United States is to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\u201d Post 9/11, Bush stated that the \u201csurvival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, President Obama\u2019s foreign policy goals embraced a limited military role and greater reliance on diplomacy and international alliances. As he explained in one speech at West Point, \u201cU.S. military action cannot be the only \u2014 or even primary \u2014 component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail.\u201d Perhaps to draw a distinction from the ambitious Bush doctrine, Obama noted \u201ca strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is na\u00efve and unsustainable.\u201d\n\nAside from the differences regarding the use of force, both presidents were unified by the pursuit of certain ideals in their foreign policy doctrines.\n\nTrump is cut from different cloth. He consistently has opposed the use of American military resources unless there is a clear economic payoff. He probably is the first U.S. president to ask for a direct quid pro quo for the invasion of Iraq and the lives sacrificed there in the form of oil. And he made a campaign promise to bring American troops home.\n\nThen, consider Trump\u2019s decision-making framework built on these pillars:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGreat nations do not fight endless wars\u201d;\n\n\n\n\n\nMake other countries, including key allies, pay for their own security;\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild strong national borders;\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease military spending and modernize defense assets;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhance American prestige, end free-riding by \u201c\u2018allies\u2019 [who] are making billions screwing us\u201d; and\n\n\n\n\n\nPut America first.\n\nConventional wisdom dictates that Trump\u2019s precipitous troop withdrawal from Syria was a disaster that encouraged Turkey to invade that country. Trump\u2019s response is that Turkey did not breach our border and it is not his concern to protect Syria\u2019s territory or the Kurds in Syria. In other words, a result predicted by the direct application of the Trump doctrine.\n\nApplying Trump\u2019s framework to Afghanistan, it is inevitable that the president will trigger a withdrawal of U.S. armed forces in the near future. Again, conventional wisdom \u2014 espoused by the \u201cdeep state,\u201d beltway bandits, parasitic contractors and consultants in the Washington swamp \u2014 will cry that withdrawal from Afghanistan will be disastrous.\n\nBut Afghanistan is a disaster even with U.S. presence there. According to one estimate, the war has cost the U.S. $975 billion since 2001. U.S. military deaths total at least 2,218, according to Department of Defense statistics (other estimates put the number at 2,400) and more than 20,000 have been wounded. At least 147,000 people have died since the conflict began in 2001, including about 38,000 civilians.\n\nTrump has been hostile toward U.S. involvement since the beginning. He has described Afghanistan as \u201ca complete waste,\u201d saying we have been \u201cserving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers.\u201d In recent remarks, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a war that\u2019s been going on almost 19 years and, frankly, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d His attempt at securing a peace deal with the Taliban was purely to dump and run.\n\nThere is no immediate indication that the situation in Afghanistan will change for the better. The closest analogy for building a stable society in that part of the world is Pakistan \u2014 and it took the British Empire 90 years. Despite direct British rule for 90 years, and colonial rule for over a 100 years before then, Pakistan is not a stable democracy or a model for anyone to emulate.\n\nExpecting Afghanistan to turn out differently in just 19 years, when the actual diurnal administration is at the mercy of a corrupt local government, is sheer folly. Even following the conventional approach, Pakistan represents the best-case outcome for Afghanistan in 100 years. The American taxpayer is unlikely to pay trillions of dollars to create another Pakistan.\n\nTrump did not get elected to follow conventional foreign policy with its endless follies overseas. The electorate recognized \u2014 and rejected \u2014 the foolishness of these alien entanglements and saw through the swamp\u2019s purported wisdom when they elected Trump to office. And if past is prelude, a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan fits perfectly into Trump\u2019s decision matrix. It will surely evoke condemnation, but 19 years did not build a stable state in Afghanistan and 19 more is not going to.\n\nUnless the American taxpayer is willing to commit another 80 years and over $5 trillion more to bring Afghanistan into something approximating a stable country, the present strategy is too expensive. If Afghans care to establish a stable democracy, they must take control of their own destiny.\n\nSandeep Gopalan (@DrSGopalan) is vice chancellor and executive vice president of academic affairs at Piedmont International University in North Carolina.
