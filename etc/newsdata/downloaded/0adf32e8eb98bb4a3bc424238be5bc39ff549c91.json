Adware is a type of malicious software that is designed to collect information on users and serve them ads without their knowledge. It's often downloaded unwittingly by users and compromises security while hiding its existence. According to security researchers at Kaspersky Labs: 'Adware is the name given to programs that are designed to display advertisements on your computer, redirect your search requests to advertising websites and collect marketing-type data about you \u2013 for example, the types of websites that you visit \u2013 so that customized adverts can be displayed.'\n\nIf they recognized that Google was running a security test, the apps automatically refrained from posting ads.\n\nWhile running in the background, malicious software exported information about unwitting users' devices to creators, including what apps are installed on the device and whether it allows apps outside of the mainstream app store to be downloaded.\n\nResearchers say this would give the adware's proprietors insight into whether the device is vulnerable to a more serious malware attack.\n\nGoogle has reportedly removed all of the exploitative apps but according to researchers they may still be available in third-party app stores.\n\nSecurity experts say they've linked the attacks to a college student attending a university in Vietnam.", "description": "More than 40 apps on the Google Play store have been have been infecting Android phones with adware designed to steal device information and plaster screens with full-size ads.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20147502-0-image-a-8_1571945402130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
