I\u2019m sure Andy Farrell will do that.\n\n\u201cA week ago everyone was saying how badly Johnny Sexton was needed against Samoa, for example.\n\n\u201cBut there does need to be new blood, new faces, and that can bring enthusiasm.\n\nNew Zealand\u00b4s Jack Goodhue is tackled during the Rugby World Cup quarter final against Ireland (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard the word predictability a lot in the last 12 months about how Ireland play.\n\n\u201cA lot of teams have given Ireland compliments that even if you work out their game plan they are so efficient that you can\u2019t stop them.\n\n\u201cBut the game has moved on, and it\u2019s moving on again, to having more variety in breaking down defences.\n\n\u201cIreland have been stopped a lot in the last 12 months, so they have to start doing things differently and making it difficult for opponents to analyse them.\n\n\u201cIreland have decent strike runners and they probably don\u2019t get enough of the ball.\n\n\u201cWe saw a master class from New Zealand in how to get the ball to your strike runners really quickly.\n\nNew Zealand\u00b4s Anton Lienert-Brown in action against Ireland (Adam Davey/PA)\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not about them scoring tries off that but it\u2019s the line breaks they make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually setting them up one-on-one in a bit of space, and that in turn creates quick ball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing and it\u2019s tough on them, but they should be criticised because they under-performed.\u201d\n\nTaskmaster boss Schmidt built Ireland into a formidable machine that at its best was difficult to disrupt, but latterly opponents found ways to throw a spanner into the works.\n\nIreland turned their 2018 Grand Slam into a frustrating third-place finish at this year\u2019s Six Nations, losing 32-20 at home to England and then 25-7 to Wales in Cardiff.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s men then suffered a record 57-15 loss to England at Twickenham in August, before slipping up 19-12 to hosts Japan during their Pool A campaign.\n\nJapan celebrate victory over Ireland (Adam Davey/PA)\n\nA comfortable 27-3 win over Scotland perhaps masked some shortcomings when viewed in hindsight, and Quinlan now believes Schmidt has suffered for not finding a solution to Ireland\u2019s attacking deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThis defeat does taint Joe Schmidt\u2019s legacy a little bit because it\u2019s the World Cup, but I don\u2019t think it should,\u201d said Quinlan, speaking as an ITV pundit.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s another four-year wait to try to go past that quarter-final.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s the tag around Irish players\u2019 necks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they ever healed from the Six Nations, then losing at Twickenham and to Japan damaged confidence.\n\n\u201cNot many teams would have been able to cope with the tempo and pace, the execution and accuracy and pace that New Zealand produced. They found an A-plus performance.\n\n\u201cIreland lacked shape in attack and couldn\u2019t influence the game in any way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a build-up of nine months of hitting a brick wall and not being able to figure it out.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s hard on Joe Schmidt, because he has to take responsibility.\u201d", "description": "Ireland have lost seven quarter-finals in nine World Cups.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/02/wire-19973140-1571621340-208_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
