Sign up here.\n\nFacebook isn't randomly turning on your microphone to sell you more targeted ads, as some conspiracy theories have asserted \u2060\u2014 but on Tuesday, the social media giant admitted that it has, in fact, been listening in on some users\u2019 conversations.\n\nFollowing an investigation by Bloomberg, the company admitted that it had been employing third-party contractors to transcribe the audio messages that users exchanged on its Messenger app.\n\nThe company said the messages used were \u201ctotally de-identified audio snippets used to improve AI transcription of messages from people who had opted into transcription on Messenger.\u201d\n\nThe company says the practice has now been stopped, at least temporarily. There is no indication that Facebook has used the information it collected to sell ads.\n\n\u201cMuch like Apple and Google, we paused human review of audio more than a week ago,\u201d a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. When asked if the practice was likely to be restarted, the company declined to answer.\n\nREAD: Facebook just paid a $5 billion fine for privacy breaches. Now it wants access to your brain.\n\nSo what was Facebook\u2019s excuse for listening to users' audio? Everyone else was doing it.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told VICE News that the practice was \u201cvery common in tech\u201d \u2060\u2014 at least until a week ago, when media reports revealed that Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft were all capturing and listening to audio from users\u2019 devices.\n\nIn April, Bloomberg reported that Amazon was employing thousands of people to listen to what users say to its Alexa-powered speakers. Then, in July, Belgian broadcaster VRT obtained more than 1,000 audio recordings captured by Google, and the company admitted that the recordings underwent human review.\n\nLast month, the Guardian revealed that Apple captured what its users were telling Siri, and reviewed those recordings to grade Siri\u2019s responses.\n\nAnd last week, an investigation by Motherboard revealed that Microsoft was using human contractors to carry out quality assurance on recordings for the company\u2019s Cortana voice assistant.\n\nREAD: Facebook misled journalists about how bad the Cambridge Analytica scandal was\n\nAll the companies, including Facebook, said the data was stripped of any identifying information and was only used to improve their products, and not to help tailor ads to users.\n\nFacebook says it followed the lead of other companies to \u201climit human review of non-public audio.\u201d When asked if it also captures audio from its Portal video calling product, the company declined to answer.\n\nThe revelation is just the latest in a long string of privacy violations the company has admitted to in recent years, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which compromised the data of 87 million users, and a 2018 hack that exposed the personal information of 50 million users. Just last month, the company last month agreed a $5 billion fine with the FTC after an investigation of privacy practices.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked by Congress last year about Facebook purportedly listening to people\u2019s conversations without permission.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about this conspiracy theory that gets passed around that we listen to what\u2019s going on on your microphone and use that for ads,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nCover: File photo dated 02/04/19 of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who will remain as chairman of the social networking giant after an attempt to strip him of the position put forward by a group of shareholders was rejected.
