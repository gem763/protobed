This week, Bloomberg posted a captivating feature about how that CEO nearly pulled off the scam of a lifetime. It\u2019s a fascinating story of how someone tried to fake it \u2018til they almost made it \u2014 but also a cautionary tale about big ambitions can push people to make disastrous decisions.\n\nElizabeth Pierce apparently had huge ambitions to build an undersea cable to give Alaskans (and eventually, parts of Japan, the Pacific Northwest, Greenland, Iceland, and London) better internet access. It was a noble cause. Internet for much of rural Alaska is slow and depends on expensive satellites, and an undersea cable could bring much faster speeds at cheaper prices for consumers. (Undersea cables are also being explored by big tech companies. Microsoft and Facebook jointly own a 4,000 mile transatlantic cable, and Google has invested in some as well.)\n\nTo get investors to back the project, Pierce needed to prove that she had completed contracts that would guarantee some revenue. So, to show investors that the business was solvent, she went right ahead and forged signatures on contracts that, if they\u2019d been legit, would have been worth more than a billion dollars in total.\n\n\u201cYou wanted to believe in the good she was doing. How many people were putting together billion-dollar projects in Alaska?\u201d one investor told Bloomberg.\n\nPierce protected the made-up contracts with an iron fist, once reportedly telling a customer, \u201cI am the only person at Quintillion to authorize or otherwise accommodate customer requests or alleged contract issues.\u201d She apparently kept the contracts she \u201cnegotiated\u201d on a personal Google Drive. When she started to realize her sham was falling apart, she apparently just decided to try to delete them by moving them to the trash of her Google Drive.\n\nMost surprising? Despite Pierce\u2019s crimes, Quintillion actually laid some cable, leading to better internet for some Alaskans. And two other telecom companies have recently announced multimillion dollar plans to lay Arctic cables, so she may have kicked off competition for a new market.\n\nThe story itself is worth reading in full \u2014 it\u2019s 15 minutes well-spent.", "description": "Last year, the CEO of Quintillion, an Alaskan company trying to build a trans-Arctic undersea cable, was charged with wire fraud after forging contracts to help raise more than $250 million from investors.
