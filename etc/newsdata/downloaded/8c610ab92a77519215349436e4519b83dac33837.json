Their answers will be published anonymously in Young Post. Then readers vote for their FAVOURITE answer. We will eliminate the contestant with the LEAST votes every week until we have a winner. The ultimate Brain Game winner will win a Mobile Pixel Duex duo monitor, which has been sponsored by searchingc.com, one of Asia\u2019s leading online shopping platforms.\n\nVotes close at midnight on Sunday.\n\nThe contestants\n\nContestant 1\n\nHello, my 18th-century friend! The world has changed a lot since the Age of Enlightenment. Let me share something from my century that I think will blow your mind.\n\nIn my century, people use a device which lets you capture images, look up information, and communicate with others instantly. Recently, a new type of connection was invented to make these devices work even faster. Just as your century is famous for many life-changing inventions of its own, this latest invention will help us to improve many different industries by connecting people, and machines, much more easily.\n\nNow, you may wonder, what\u2019s the point of being able to connect to things really quickly. Well, for one thing, you need to understand just how much people love fast connection. Hopefully, this has given you an idea of what 5G is like.\n\nContestant 2\n\nIt\u2019s an honour to meet you. Today I\u2019d like to tell you about something which I think you\u2019ll find amusing.\n\nIn your century, people communicate through letters. But three centuries into the future, the way we share information will change a lot. Machines called computers will be invented and become rather common. They will send messages through wires. These many computers will form a system called a network. The network will improve year by year. The 5th generation, commonly called 5G, will work almost instantaneously.\n\nPlease accept my greetings from the future, where a lot awaits you.\n\nContestant 3\n\nImagine your farm is so big that you can\u2019t manage by yourself. To solve this problem, we have invented something called 5G networks. We can use it to make machines to do tasks for us, such as watering crops as soon as the soil becomes dry, and cutting them when they have grown.\n\nWhat about the cows? You used to have to observe the cows in person to make sure they were healthy. Now, a detailed analysis of each cow\u2019s health can be sent to you instantly through the 5G network.\n\nIn short, 5G allows things and people to communicate in a faster, more efficient way.\n\nContestant 4\n\nDo you need to earn money, but can\u2019t be bothered to get out of bed? Allow me to introduce you to 5G. With 5G, you could, for example, tell your servants to give this gizmo known as a smartphone to your business partners, then conduct all your business with them in real time from the comfort of your own home.\n\nYou could even employ a 5G-based AI \u2013 that\u2019s a code name for \u201csmart person\u201d \u2013 and let him make all your decisions for you \u2013 he\u2019s programmed to do it. You don\u2019t even have to feed him \u2013 much like your tired, overworked servants!\n\nTo summarise, 5G may well turn you into a giant slob, but hey, at least you\u2019ll be very, very rich.\n\nContestant 5\n\n18th century people: Could you explain what 5G is?\n\nMe: It\u2019s hard to explain \u2026 it\u2019s basically a new kind of mobile internet connectivity which allows people to download content much faster.\n\n18th century people: What is mobile internet \u2026 I don\u2019t get it?\n\nMe: In the modern world, we can use a device to call people, capture moments, and find information. And you need something called the internet to make it work.\n\n18th century people: Cool!\n\nMe: Yeah! So, 5G is the fifth generation of internet, which is faster and better than older versions.\n\n18th century people: Amazing, I never heard of such a thing, but I\u2019m impressed!\n\nContestant 6\n\nThink of it like this; telegraphs can be sent without any wires, only a small device and 5G. This is an invisible entity where (in areas where it is available) you can send data in different forms.\n\nOther than telegraphs, messages can be displayed on a visual output we call a screen. One can have access to all sorts of information, so long as they have access to 5G \u2013 this depends on how much one has paid for this access, and also where they are.\n\nContestant 7\n\n5G might sound strange, but it is based on an age-old idea.\n\nWhat would you do if you wanted to send a message to someone who lived far away? You would go to the post office, post a letter, and then pray that it gets delivered on time. But after a while, we found that physical letters were too bulky and took too long to deliver. So we decided to use wave frequencies to send messages instead. These mean we can send messages in seconds.\n\nThanks to 5G technology, we can now send messages instantly. It is so powerful that nations use it to spy on each other!\n\n*In case of dispute, Young Post reserves the right to reserves to decide the result\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "The ultimate Brain Game winner will win a Mobile Pixels Duex duo monitor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/78f0d12c-e4c3-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires112006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
