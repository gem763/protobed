The subject of injustice is raised and, like a well-trained dog salivating at the sound of a bell, this chump simply cannot help but think of gun violence and American abuses. A few days ago he pleaded ignorance when asked about China \u2014 he doesn\u2019t know the history, it\u2019d be unfair to comment without being fully informed, etc. But the media kept ringing the bell by asking him about human rights. He was destined to start drooling on himself eventually.\n\nThe best part \u2014 besides the classic whataboutist line, \u201cnone of us are perfect\u201d \u2014 is Kerr noting that Chinese fans and media have never pressed him about injustice in the United States. Any theories about why that might be? Why wouldn\u2019t inhabitants of a totalitarian state, which is right now carrying out a program of mass internment, be eager to start visiting westerners chattering about human rights?\n\nYou know who he sounds like here? Our \u201cAmerica First\u201d president, who made a similar point in defense of his wish for warmer relations with Russia in 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,\u201d Trump said of Putin in an interview with then-friend Joe Scarborough, adding, \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe.\u201d Kerr should try that in his next interview. \u201cAt least Xi Jinping\u2019s a leader.\u201d\n\nI think this makes Trump officially \u201cwoke\u201d now. He long ago reached the fourth stage of NBA-style social consciousness that\u2019s now been attained by Kerr: Woke; extremely woke; ludicrously woke; whataboutist apologetics for foreign fascism.\n\nWith the PR disasters now coming daily, the NBA is officially done talking about all this:\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) said Friday it had cancelled all remaining press events for its current China tour, citing the \u201ccomplicated and unprecedented\u201d controversy over Hong Kong protests and free speech\u2026 \u201cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u201d the NBA said in a statement. \u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019d be unfair to ask players to answer difficult and complicated questions like, \u201cAre concentration camps bad?\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, there are still plenty of opportunities for the NBA to kiss Chinese ass. Russell Westbrook is reportedly being hailed as a hero in China today for showing up to a press conference in Japan dressed in a traditional Chinese coat. Maybe if the Rockets can convince James Harden to start wearing a Mao suit this flap with Morey will blow over.\n\nBy the way, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the NBA is perfectly capable of taking a moral stand on foreign affairs when the spirit moves them. In lieu of an exit question, try to guess which country has offended the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 strong sense of social justice.
