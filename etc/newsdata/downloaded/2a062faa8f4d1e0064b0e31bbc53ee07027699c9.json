Conversations are continuing and will be ongoing.\n\nAfterwards, U.S. President Donald Trump also stated that China will be buying more agriculture products and that they want a deal \u201cvery badly.\u201d\n\nThe cash index made all-time highs today and the futures are right behind, with today\u2019s high just 3 handles off the all-time highs. The first target for SPX 500 (cash index) is 3067, which is the 127.2% extension from the Sept. 19th highs to the Oct. 3rd lows. First support comes across at Wednesday\u2019s highs near 3010.\n\nThe S&P 500 cash index made all-time highs today and the futures are right behind, with today\u2019s high just 3 handles off the all-time highs.

Support comes in on the day at 97.50.\n\nAs a result, are near unchanged on the day at 1505. The precious metal was trying to break out of a bullish pattern (either a descending wedge or flag) and was up as much as $14.50 before pulling back to unchanged. If gold were to close below 1505, the daily candlestick would be a shooting star or inverted hammer, both of which have reversal implications.\n\nThe expectations are now set that \u201csomething\u201d will be done regarding Phase One of the U.S.-China trade war. Watch for more headlines over the weekend and early next week.\n\nIn addition, keep in mind the looming announcement of a Brexit extension, as well as economic data, including NFP on Friday, more earnings, and the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. We may see some volatility next week!", "description": "Shares Analysis by Joe Perry covering: XAU/USD, S&P 500, Gold Futures.
