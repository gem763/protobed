We have done them a great service,\u201d Mr. Trump said in remarks from the White House.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cLet someone else fight over this long, blood-stained sand.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Islamic State fighters are under \u201clock and key\u201d in the region and that those who did escape have been \u201clargely recaptured.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is contending with the fallout of his decision this month to withdraw dozens of U.S. troops from a buffer zone along the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nLawmakers in both parties said it allowed Turkish forces to overrun Kurdish fighters who fought with U.S. troops for years, and that he added insult to injury by negotiating a cease-fire that allows Turkey to establish a safe zone while pushing out Kurds.\n\nThe president said Turkish forces had been itching for years to overrun the Kurds, and that he couldn\u2019t authorize a shooting war with Turkey, a NATO ally. He took credit for pulling American troops out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nMr. Trump said the main Kurdish commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, called him to express gratitude for American efforts, even though some Kurds pelted exiting U.S. troops with potatoes the other day.\n\nMoving forward, Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Putin have negotiated plans to patrol Syria\u2019s northeastern border, a power structure that is alarming congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cWhat will the president do to prevent Russian and Turkish aggression and the potential slaughter of our allies and friends, the Kurds? When will the administration present its strategy to Congress?\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said. He also said he fears a resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Trump said it\u2019s up to foreign powers to work it out.\n\n\u201cNow Turkey, Syria and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s their neighborhood, they have to take care of it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
