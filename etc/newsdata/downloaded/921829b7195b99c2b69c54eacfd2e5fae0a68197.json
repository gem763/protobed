Can't wait for Tim to be vindicated when Katie leaves her message for the players. Ended the show at exactly the right moment. Had me jumping up and down, whooping and laughing.\"\n\n*The Circle returns tonight at 10pm on Channel 4", "description": "The Channel 4 show turned brutal during the portrait mode challenge, and things will get even more awkward as the fake pals finally meet", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20400497.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EH_CHP_041019THE-CIRCLE-CATFISH_1265JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
