Yes, I\u2019m being serious. New research has shown that Vitamin D can help alleviate IBS, and exposure to the sun is a great way to get more vitamin D. Of course, that\u2019s not the only drug-free remedy for IBS. So, if you struggle with IBS symptoms, please read on and I\u2019ll tell you what may be causing your symptoms and I\u2019ll help you find the best way to treat it.\n\nWhat is IBS and What Causes It?\n\nDiet: Your bowels are the final stop for what you eat and what is discarded during the digestion process. A poor diet produces more toxic waste because the body only keeps the nutrients and discards the rest. Just as a poor diet affects your entire body, it directly affects the health of your bowels. And sometimes, sensitivities or allergies to certain foods can cause IBS. Some of the more common foods associated with IBS symptoms are: wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, milk and carbonated drinks.\n\nYour bowels are the final stop for what you eat and what is discarded during the digestion process.

Stress: The role of stress in IBS is a little more complicated than diet. Stop thinking about IBS for a second and think about a time where you could \u201cfeel\u201d stress affecting you. Some common examples are headaches, heartburn, muscle tightness, and high blood pressure. My point is that the way your body handles stress is different for everyone. And studies have shown that chronic stress is common for people with IBS.\n\nThe role of stress in IBS is a little more complicated than diet.

And studies have shown that chronic stress is common for people with IBS. Sorbitol: Foods and medicines that contain sorbitol (a sugar alcohol often used as an alternative to sugar) have been known to trigger IBS symptoms. Why sorbitol? Undigested sorbitol will overstay its welcome in your small intestine, where it ferments the bacteria also living there. That fermentation produces hydrogen gas, which causes the signature bloating, cramps, and flatulence associated with IBS. Sorbitol is a signature ingredient in \u201csugar free\u201d foods \u2013 artificial sweeteners, diet drinks, gum, diabetic products. It\u2019s also in a lot of medications, such as antibiotics and antidepressants. If you have IBS and are prescribed medication, ask your doctor about sorbitol-free medications.\n\nFoods and medicines that contain sorbitol (a sugar alcohol often used as an alternative to sugar) have been known to trigger IBS symptoms.

Genetics: Research suggests that your genes and family health history can make you more likely to develop IBS. But even if your genetics are working against you, you do have options. More on this below.\n\nAs many as 45 million Americans suffer from excess gas, mucus in the stool, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. If you\u2019re one of them, then you know IBS is painful and embarrassing. And it\u2019s the second leading reason why Americans call in sick at work. Yet, despite its prevalence, what IBS is and what causes it are questions that haven\u2019t been answered by the medical community. IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that the variety of its symptoms can\u2019t be pinned on an obvious cause. For example, we know what causes Celiac disease. But IBS is diagnosed when a doctor sees the symptoms but can\u2019t determine their cause with certainty. With no known direct cause, IBS is difficult to treat. That said, there are several factors and triggers associated with IBS:\n\nSide Effects of standard IBS Treatment\n\nNatural Remedies for IBS\n\nVitamin D: Recent research showed that Vitamin D deficiency is common in people with IBS. So it\u2019s no surprise what happened when researchers studied the effects of Vitamin D on IBS symptoms. It worked, of course, and here\u2019s how. Stress, alcohol, poor diet, and antibiotics are some of the biggest killers of your gut flora. Vitamin D can help maintain these gut flora. By adding it to your diet, it\u2019s possible that it can restore bacterial balance to your digestive system. As I said earlier, sunlight is the best natural source of vitamin D\u2014try to get at least 15 \u2013 20 minutes of direct sun exposure a day. I also recommend that you take a 5,000 IU supplement daily.\n\nRecent research showed that Vitamin D deficiency is common in people with IBS.

Probiotic Supplement: Diets high in unhealthy fats can rob the stomach and digestive tract of microbial flora, which are key for breaking down food waste before it passes out of your intestines. Making healthy changes to your diet is crucial, of course. And in additional to taking vitamin D, I also suggest you take a high-quality probiotic to also help shore up your gut flora. Look for a product containing at least 10 billion live organisms per dose.\n\nDiets high in unhealthy fats can rob the stomach and digestive tract of microbial flora, which are key for breaking down food waste before it passes out of your intestines.

For IBS, it can improve digestive health by strengthening intestinal walls and regenerating mucosal cells. On top of that, it\u2019s an immune system booster and inflammation fighter.\n\nis a multi-purpose nutritional supplement.

Oregano Oil: Oregano oil can help relieve inflammation in your stomach and intestines, which can trigger IBS. Oregano oil has one side effect though (a good one this time!): happiness. Yes, oregano oil is also an aphrodisiac and can stimulate a happy mood and reduce stress.\n\nBecause there are a lot of possible causes of IBS, it is difficult to treat IBS with precision. For many people, IBS is a lifelong disorder, which means that it can take years of different treatments and medications to find lasting relief. There are dozens of over-the-counter and prescription medications for IBS, and each carry its own set of possible side effects. I\u2019ve always been a skeptic of IBS medications \u2013 for both their effectiveness and side effects \u2013 and a recent study confirmed that. In the study, 668 people with IBS, who took traditional IBS therapies (laxatives, fiber, and stool softeners) were surveyed about the successes, side-effects, and their satisfaction with their treatments. Nearly 75% of them reported that they discontinued treatment because of side effects and that those side effects caused them to miss work, school and social activities.Here are some of the best ways I\u2019ve used to treat IBS. Unfortunately, none of these are a sure-fire \u201csilver bullet\u201d, but one or a combination of some of them can greatly reduce your IBS symptoms.\n\nReferences:\n\nIn addition to these natural IBS fighters, I can\u2019t stress enough that you take an inventory of your diet and how much you are exercising. A better diet and more exercise will greatly improve your total health in countless ways, perhaps even IBS. It can be difficult and inconvenient to find out what\u2019s causing your IBS. And if you are lucky to identify the triggers, it can be just as frustrating to make the life changes necessary to eliminate IBS forever. But, I can tell you with confidence, that the benefit of making those changes will be their own reward in the end (pun intended).", "description": "Now that the spring sun has finally decided to stick .09/02/2019 3:24:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
