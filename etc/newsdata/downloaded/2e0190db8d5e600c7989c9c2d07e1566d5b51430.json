It is putting lives and livelihoods at risk unnecessarily and it is wantonly endangering the integrity of the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cMore widely, it is undermining our country\u2019s economy, democracy and role in the world. It is using political manipulation, bullying and lies. And it is doing these things in a deliberate and considered way.\u201d\n\nThe Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said she was delighted Lee was joining at such a crucial time in British politics.\n\nShe said: \u201cHe brings almost 10 years of parliamentary experience and decades of professional expertise. He shares our commitment to prevent a disastrous no-deal Brexit, and to stop Brexit altogether.\n\n\n\nAt the start of a crucial day in the Commons, Johnson condemned a backbench plan aimed at delaying Brexit to avert a no-deal departure, calling it a \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn responded by criticising the PM\u2019s language.\n\nMPs will vote on Tuesday evening on whether to take control of the order paper to allow the passage of the bill. Johnson has promised to seek a general election if they do so, and to remove the whip from any Tory rebels who back the plan.\n\nAnswering questions following his statement, the PM said Tory MPs who might subsequently vote against an eventual deal he might reach would also be ejected, saying: \u201cI think you can take it that what\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s public defection appeared to temporarily put Johnson off his stride as he addressed MPs on the G7 summit in Biarritz, and Brexit negotiations he claimed were progressing well.\n\nTimeline Countdown to an election? Show Hide MPs have backed the motion to allow a debate on a bill tomorrow that would prevent a no-deal Brexit. In return, prime minister Boris Johnson says he will seek to hold an election, and will table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Prime minister Boris Johnson has asked the Queen to prorogue parliament during this week. MPs were due to have a recess period anyway for the party conference season. If the prime minister gets his way, instead parliament will be dissolving for an election. The Labour and Conservative party conferences are due to be held on consecutive weeks. This is the date that Johnson was proposing parliament returns for the Queen\u2019s speech setting out a legislation programme for his government. Alternately, it could end up being the date of a general election. EU leaders meet for the final European council summit before the UK's extension is due to expire. They could possibly agree a new deal at this point - with just about enough time for Johnson, or whoever is prime minister by then, to try and get it through parliament. The six-month article 50 extension will expire, and current prime minister Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal on that date.\n\nContinually barracked by Labour MPs, Johnson said he would never agree to another extension.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country wants this done and they want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal, we will leave by 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay.\n\n\u201cThis house has never before voted the prime minister to surrender such a crucial decision to the discretion of our friends and neighbours overseas.\u201d\n\nThe bill, if passed, would mandate a new Brexit date of 31 January if no departure deal was reached by mid-October, also mandating the PM to accept whatever delay the EU sought, if MPs agreed to this.\n\nJohnson said: \u201cIt would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation. That\u2019s what it does. There is only one way to describe this deal: it is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill. It means running up the white flag.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Labour leader said he condemned the use of the word \u201csurrender\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope he will reflect on his use of language. We\u2019re not surrendering because we\u2019re at war with Europe. They are, surely, our partners.\u201d\n\nCorbyn mocked Johnson\u2019s claims of progress in Brexit talks, saying the EU did not agree on this. He said: \u201cIt is increasingly clear that this reckless government only has one plan \u2013 to crash out of the EU without a deal.\u201d", "description": "Former minister defects to Lib Dems, accusing Boris Johnson of pursuing a \u2018damaging Brexit\u2019", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Peter Walker", "Heather Stewart", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e7a63926c93a7f7634879230039577cc46043c/0_126_3343_2006/master/3343.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f057a0cec9e18db760bc86519c0ab82"}
