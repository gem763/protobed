They\u2019ve come down a lot.\n\nThe sector\u2019s big dog, Tesco, is making just above 3 per cent. How will it and the other members of the \u201cbig four\u201d (Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Morrisons) handle a fresh onslaught from the discounters? We\u2019re about to find out.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAldi makes 1.7 per cent, according to its latest UK results, which have just emerged. It recorded an 11 per cent increase in sales for the year to December 2018, but operating profits fell by 26 per cent to \u00a3198m.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t come as any great surprise when you consider that the business is still in its growth phase. For the next couple of years, it\u2019s planning to open a store a week on average. It\u2019s particularly keen to stamp its foot more prominently within the M25, with a plan to double the number of stores from 45 to 100 by the end of 2025.\n\nThe capital\u2019s consumers should cheer that. Aldi\u2019s business model isn\u2019t terribly complex. It leverages its vast buying power to stock a limited range of products at a much lower price than its traditional rivals and puts money back into its customers\u2019 pockets through doing that.\n\nAt the same time it has managed to establish a reputation for quality, key to expanding its appeal. This has all posed a serious challenge to its rivals.\n\nAnalysts sometimes like to point out that Aldi is not without challenges of its own. Most of its growth is coming from new openings. Getting more out of its existing estate is proving a lot harder.\n\nWhen Aldi enters a new area, it draws in a lot of people. But then it reaches an equilibrium with its rivals. The business will face more of a challenge when most people have easy access to one of its outlets, or perhaps a Lidl, its shadow sibling which is growing at a similarly fast clip.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: that\u2019s years away from happening.\n\nThe existing players have chosen to handle the pair by keeping their prices within sight of them while offering more choice and services such as online shopping by delivery or click and collect.\n\nBut they\u2019re still feeling the strain. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda tried to turn the big four into a big three with their ill-fated merger plans, which were in part motivated by the impact of the German pair.\n\nThe discounters \u2013 it\u2019s really a misnomer because they\u2019re just damn good retailers \u2013 may effect the same result, just by forcing one of them on to the rocks.\n\nBrexit, a faltering British economy and a bad global outlook should all serve to enhance the pair\u2019s appeal. When shoppers are facing a squeeze, the question \u201cwhy pay more\u201d will raise itself with more of them. Why contribute to Tesco\u2019s 3 per cent, and thus its shareholder dividends?\n\nThis is what could help Aldi, and Lidl, to add growth from existing stores to what they\u2019re getting from new ones.\n\nOnline, where the existing players are getting most of their own growth, provides an interesting wrinkle. It\u2019s worth paying higher prices for convenience, particularly for people who are time poor.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
