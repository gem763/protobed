Red flag warnings are issued when warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger. Authorities said the Saddleridge blaze started as a brush fire in Sylmar, the northernmost neighborhood of Los Angeles, and quickly spread, driven by the hot, dry Santa Ana winds that sweep down from the deserts and across the region. In Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, the Sandalwood fire swept through a hilltop mobile home park and destroyed 74 structures and damaged 16 others in Calimesa. At least two people have died, according to authorities.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Gov. John Bel Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, won four years ago after voters soured on his Republican opponent due to a sex scandal. Edwards' opponents are Congressman Ralph Abraham, who is a three-term U.S. congressman, a farmer and a veterinarian, and businessman Eddie Rispone who has amassed a big fortune and financed his own campaign. In an effort to turn over the governor's mansion back to the GOP, President Donald Trump held a rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Friday and he urged residents to \"fire\" Edwards and replace him with one of the two Republicans. Edwards is leading in the polls, but if he doesn't get at least 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters would be forced into a future runoff.\n\nYankees and Astros collide in epic ALCS clash\n\nThe American League Championship Series kicks off Saturday night as the Astros welcome the New York Yankees to Houston (live, 8:08 p.m. ET).
