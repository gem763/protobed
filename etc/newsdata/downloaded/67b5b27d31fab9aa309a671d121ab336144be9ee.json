But she spent the early part of the year embracing the idea, and being welcomed with open arms.\n\nIn July, Pitchfork dubbed her \u201cthe pagan pop star,\u201d and when NME asked her if she really followed through with her plan to hex Trump, she said, \u201cYeah, I did it. Why not? Look, I do a lot of shit.\u201d She explained her interest in witchcraft in vague, poetic terms: \u201cYour thoughts are very powerful things, and they become words, and words become actions, and actions lead to physical changes. I really do believe that words are one of the last forms of magic, and I\u2019m a bit of a mystic at heart.\u201d The event blew up on Tumblr, where witchcraft enthusiasts GIF\u2019d her alongside other famous witches, proclaimed her \u201cthe new Supreme,\u201d and churned out a stream of original artwork. One fan posted instructions for combining quartz, rose water, and agate stones to rejuvenate the skin and appear as magical as Lana herself.\n\n2017 was a huge year for internet witches, even outside this brush with the entertainment news cycle. The witchcraft community, or \u201cwitchblr,\u201d was ranked the 11th largest community on Tumblr for 2017, in the platform\u2019s annual compendium of its most popular memes, fandoms, topics, and groups. The top 10 communities had all been on the list before, but this was the first year witches charted. Beyond the cult of Lana, why was this year in #witchblr so big?\n\nTumblr content insights manager Amanda Brennan offered some speculation, telling The Verge in a phone call, \u201cAs people are dealing with the political climate and watching the world feel like it\u2019s falling apart, a lot of them are drawn to finding this deeper connection with the physical world, and this idea of magic being something that exists outside of them, but that they can have a little bit of control or influence over.\u201d\n\nShe says a lot of the growth in the #witchblr tags can be read as reactionary, particularly when it comes to Tumblr users who are embracing witchcraft as a hobby, rather than a strictly religious practice. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Uh, I feel like I can\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m calling my senators, and it doesn\u2019t do anything. Let me take some time, focus on what part of the world I can control, and take a little piece of my narrative back through this idea of magic.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe top #witchblr posts of the year, according to data compiled by Brennan, included explainers and instructional guides to candles, crystals, teas, curses, and palm reading. Much of the community\u2019s growth is, unsurprisingly, coming from people who want to learn about witchcraft and are looking for a good place to break into the community. Master posts that aggregate tarot tips, spells, DIY projects, literary resources, and religious history into one enormous text are also wildly popular.\n\nRae, a 19-year-old witchblr blogger from Michigan, told The Verge via Tumblr direct message, \u201cI think the community is best at helping each other, as cheesy as it may be. [E]veryone, in my experience, has been very kind and helpful. As a baby witch, I would reach out for advice, and others wouldn't hesitate to help me learn.\u201d\n\nAlso among the top posts: plenty of \u201cemoji spells,\u201d a genre of self-help that Tumblr promoted during its \u201cPost It Forward\u201d mental health awareness project in May. Emoji spells are just artful combinations of emoji that are \u201ccharged\u201d when you \u201clike\u201d them and \u201ccast\u201d when you reblog them. (My personal favorite genre of witchblr post is emoji spells intended to protect net neutrality.) They\u2019re fun, though their connection to real witchcraft is obviously nonexistent. Like Del Rey\u2019s flowery prose about thoughts and vibrations, they\u2019re an embrace of an aesthetic, rather than a rigorous practice with cultural and religious significance.\n\nthey\u2019re an embrace of an aesthetic, rather than a rigorous practice with cultural and religious significance\n\nBrennan says she doesn\u2019t see much of a clash between disparate intentions and backgrounds in the witchblr community on-platform, though she\u2019s aware it\u2019s often discussed on outside blogs and podcasts. She certainly remembers a late 2015 controversy referred to as \u201cboneghazi,\u201d during which a debate about the harvesting of human remains nearly destroyed witchblr entirely. But in 2017, she sees the community\u2019s renewed popularity happening alongside the rise of \u201cwholesome memes,\u201d a genre of internet language and artwork that contrasts the severe, alienating irony of the broader internet with outpourings of sticky-sweet sincerity. \u201cIt\u2019s all about good energy and helping each other out,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs wholesome memes rose, so did this idea of using the magic around or within you to lift other people up, as well as yourself.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, and much better than trends you could name on other platforms this year. But Araceli, a 20-year-old witchblr blogger from Spain, told The Verge via Tumblr that she worries about how white and American-centric the community can be. \u201cThe witchblr community appropriates non-white cultures (Native American, Yoruba, Hindu, Caribbean, Romani, and so on) and comes up with a lot of shitty excuses for that.\u201d She still participates in witchblr because she can see it\u2019s trying to get better, and says there are plenty of blogs focused on making people of color more visible.\n\nShe\u2019s also concerned about the fact that some younger witches don\u2019t bother to understand the history of witchcraft, even if she doesn\u2019t necessarily disapprove of their general intentions. \u201cWe feminists have created this figure of a nature-oriented, possibly queer, sorority-centered witch that was burned not [because] of their magic, but [because] they defied the norms. That may have been the case, but at least in Spain, the Inquisition\u2019s archives show another profile \u2014 poor, outcast, old women who defied religious authority and tried to make money out of scamming their neighbors. Some believed their magic was real, some didn't, but most of them used it to get financial stability.\u201d\n\n\u201cit\u2019s this kind of exploration of what is inside of you, and what things you can do to take control of one little piece of your life.\u201d\n\nThough she could rattle off plenty of misconceptions about the history of witchcraft and paganism, she interrupts herself and concludes, \u201cHonestly, who cares? These were women who burned for resisting conventionalities and displaying non-conventional, non-patriarchal religious beliefs. And we\u2019re their heirs.\u201d She loves the jokes, memes, and \u201cMillennial humor\u201d of witchblr, and thinks the spells that circulate there are \u201ccute\u201d \u2014 like a book of recipes handed down by your grandmother, except they\u2019re all for \u201csacred lavender bread\u201d or anti-anxiety solutions.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see what Araceli is worried about when it comes to the centrality of white, American cultural interests. Witchblr accounts that look an awful lot like glossy lifestyle blogs are common. They\u2019re often centered around collectible (expensive) crystals, or the idea of the \u201ckitchen witch,\u201d which Brennan describes as \u201cvery self care.\u201d The most popular kitchen witch posts are photo sets of herbs, tea, or food, characterized by soft lighting and appealing, Instagram-ready still-lifes. These posts get tons of notes because they intersect with other popular communities on Tumblr, like photography, cooking, and interior design.\n\nOn top of the cultural connotations, many of these posts are full of things that cost money. But Brennan argues that, as with studyblr \u2014 an enormous community that has sprung up around study tips and academic ambition \u2014 pristine arrangements and expensive accessories are secondary to conversation and shared knowledge. Again, self-help is huge. \u201cThere are tons of master posts that are like, little everyday things you can do to feel this power,\u201d she explains. \u201cA lot of it is like \u2018Come up with a mantra and say it every day.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t cost any money, and it\u2019s very low lift, a low barrier to entry. Maybe it\u2019s not as traditional as other things, but it\u2019s this kind of exploration of what is inside of you, and what things you can do to take control of one little piece of your life.\u201d\n\nFor an outsider, the appeal of witchblr looks a lot like the appeal of any other community on the women-dominated social platform. The Tumblr posts look cool. The contributors are talented and funny. This kind of camaraderie is rare on the internet. There are thousands of notes on simple text posts like \u201ceverybody thinks you\u2019re kinda creepy and cool when you say you\u2019re a witch until they see you collecting water under the rain and screaming at a jar,\u201d or \u201cpros of drinking tea: it tastes good, warms the soul, magical. cons: i\u2019ve peed 15 times today.\u201d The way reblogs work in the witchblr community is reminiscent of the way email chains functioned inside middle school friend groups once upon a time, and they have the goofy allure of a slumber party ritual. For example, in the last week, 17,000 people have liked or reblogged a photo of a tarot card with a pink candle, captioned, \u201cReblog this within 30 seconds in order to receive luck in your efforts for romance, assistance in your relationships, and/or to help [ease] conflict in your current relationship.\u201d\n\nBella, an 18-year-old blogger from New York, told The Verge via Tumblr, \u201cI think this year in particular, some of our posts reached people that had no idea this community even existed, and who wanted to learn more \u2026 I think the community is best at providing a place for people to learn about and experience witchy things without it being so serious.\u201d\n\nIn a disorienting political year, Tumblr users practiced their studied witchcraft \u2014 or sweet, sloppy approximations of magic \u2014 both to protect their hearts and minds, and to confront the things that frighten them. Amid all the self-help efforts, witchblr frequently congregates to decide what to do about President Trump, with posters offering screwball suggestions, real curses, and commiseration over the fact that they\u2019ve failed so far. There was a lot to be afraid of in 2017 and plenty of reasons to look for a space that was simultaneously as beautiful and charmed as a daydream and as dark as our frames of mind.\n\n\u201cWe're broke and we're tired,\u201d Araceli says. \u201cBut we're trying.\u201d", "description": "The rise of witchblr was a response to a year in which nothing made sense", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany", "Dec"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3pfO6grP0u8kuEFLdQWgm1Cgbc=/0x38:1337x738/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9854915/Screen_Shot_2017_12_12_at_7.45.23_AM.png", "published_at": "2017-12-12"}
