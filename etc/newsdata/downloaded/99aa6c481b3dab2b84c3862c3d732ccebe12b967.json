You have to lift your standards, and keep them up there.\n\n\"We have to work together as a forward pack and we always push each other at every training session.\n\n\"When it comes to the game, it just comes down to execution.\"\n\nMbonambi also extinguished concerns over his fitness after he left the field shortly after half-time against Japan.\n\n\"It was just my hamstring that was feeling a bit tight, from the cramps obviously,\" he said.\n\n\"They made a medical call not to risk it and carry on. But at the moment, I am feeling 100 percent.\"\n\nSunday's kick-off is at 11:00 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Hooker Bongi Mbonambi has helped explain South Africa's flawless lineout record at the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9235/678b0c6b82f74ab1b68bab4018513158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
