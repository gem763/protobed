But unlike an ICO coin or token, a security token comes with an underlying investment asset, like stocks, bonds, funds or real estate investment trusts (REIT).\n\nHowever, there are more differences between ICO and STO. Let's take a look at them here.\n\nHow Is STO Different From ICO?\n\nFirst and foremost, most ICOs are meant for raising funds in an unregulated environment.\n\nMost ICOs actually position their offerings as utility tokens to circumvent regulations. Most founders and projects argue that they distribute users tokens to access their decentralized applications (DApps) or native platforms. The main logic here is that the purpose of their coin is usage and not speculation. Such line of reasoning lets ICO projects to avoid regulation and necessary registration with SEC or other strict regulators.\n\nICO vs STO processes.\n\nIn contrast, STOs are launched with regulatory governance in mind. They are registered with required government bodies, meet all the legal requirements and are 100% lawful.\n\nHence, it is way easier to launch an ICO than STO. STO requires a company to do a lot of upfront compliance work. While everyone can launch and participate in an ICO (unless local laws state otherwise), only entirely regulatory compliant companies and accredited or at least known investors can sell and purchase security tokens.\n\nICO vs. STO \u2014 Advantages\n\nThe most commonly mentioned advantages of an ICO include:\n\nNo entry barrier for both buyers and sellers.\n\nPositive network effects.\n\nThe tokens are distributed in a simple automated way.\n\nThe teams can manage their funds however they prefer.\n\nA successful ICO often requires just a well-executed digital campaign.\n\nIf a coin raises in price and team delivers, investors enjoy high profitability and early adopter benefits.\n\nSome ICOs allow for anonymous participation.\n\nAt the same time, an STO offers the following advantages:\n\nInvestors actually acquire underlying assets that derive their value from something else.\n\n100% regulated offerings that ensure investors security.\n\nProjects that go for STOs are generally more mature and trustworthy than the ones in the ICO sphere.\n\nSTOs are experiencing significant growth while ICOs space shrinks.\n\nIt is an ongoing trend.\n\nSecurity tokens are expected to be traded via broker-dealers who are also supervised by regulatory bodies.\n\nSecurity tokens are the next big step in traditional finance.\n\nLess speculation and market manipulation.\n\nICO vs. STO \u2014 Disadvantages\n\nThe most obvious disadvantages of an ICO are:\n\nHigh volatility and manipulation of the crypto market.\n\nLow liquidity.\n\nUncertainty if the product will be finished and delivered as stated in the white paper.\n\nScams and pump and dump schemes are common for ICOs.\n\nRegulations can cause problems for both projects and investors.\n\nUnregulated space with a lot of risks.\n\nMeanwhile, the disadvantages of STOs are:\n\nTakes a lot of time, effort, and money to get a green light from the regulators.\n\nCan be limited to accredited investors only.\n\nCan require significant amounts of money.\n\nSo far, the SEC has not approved a single Reg A+ STO, and only allows for institutional investor participation.\n\nICO vs STO comparison.

You need to decide for yourself where you want to participate and what is your level of risk tolerance.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0//", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
