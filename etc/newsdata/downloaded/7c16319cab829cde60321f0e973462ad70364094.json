REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe are breathing optimism,\u201d said Martin Lundstedt, Volvo Group\u2019s President and CEO (VOLVb.ST), who traveled to Sao Paulo to take part in the biennial Fenatran expo, the largest truck and machinery trade show in the country.\n\n\u201cLatin America ... is coming back. We are having a very strong year.\u201d\n\nEconomic growth, however, has been sluggish in Brazil, with economists now expecting less than 1% growth in 2019, a forecast that has undergone several downward revisions since the year began. Still, for all their rhetoric, Brazil\u2019s top four truck makers did not announce new investments in the country.\n\nTruck sales and production have defied the broader economic trends, and industry trade group Anfavea this month revised its growth forecasts upward. It now expects domestic Brazil truck sales to rise 35% while production will grow a healthy 8%, weighed down by a crisis in Argentina, the second-largest consumer of Brazilian trucks.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that the truck market is always ahead of the curve, ahead of economic growth,\u201d said Wilson Lirman, who leads Volvo in Latin America.\n\nThat economic growth \u201cstarts around now,\u201d Lirman added, pointing to sweeping financial reforms that Brazil\u2019s right-wing government has proposed, which have cleared several congressional hurdles but not yet received final approval.\n\nBrazil has South America\u2019s largest auto industry and is a particularly important base for truckmakers, where it is Volvo\u2019s second-largest market globally. The country was Mercedes Benz\u2019s largest market in the world before its economy crashed in 2015. It remains the largest market for Swedish maker Scania [SCVSA.UL], a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE).\n\nBrazil\u2019s truck sales reached 137,000 in 2014 and essentially fell by half the next year, according to industry figures. They have grown significantly since then and will push 100,000 for the first time since the crash this year, but have yet to recover to their pre-recession levels. The recession is Brazil\u2019s deepest on record.\n\n\u201cMany of you will remember when we said, \u2018Remember the Brazilian market because we will be ready for when it comes back,\u2019\u201d said Stefan Buchner, head of Mercedes Benz Trucks, who also traveled to Sao Paulo for the Fenatran trade show. \u201cNow, here we are. The Brazilian market is growing.\u201d\n\nMercedes Benz, the market leader in Brazil with about 30% market share, expects 2020 to be an even better year for its truck business.\n\n\u201cWhy is that? We have significantly reducing interest rates,\u201d said Philipp Schiemer, who leads Mercedes Benz in Latin America. \u201cWe had very bad years in the construction business ... but it\u2019s regaining some strength, and the retail business is also picking up.\u201d\n\nNot everyone has believed in the truck business potential.\n\nFord Motor Co (F.N) this year announced it would exit the heavy truck business in South America, shutting its oldest plant in Brazil, located in the heart of the continent\u2019s auto industry: the city of Sao Bernardo do Campo. Ford said this was necessary to return to profitability in the country, where it has been losing money for years.\n\nWhile growth is robust, overall sales numbers are still historically low, meaning that growth rates can appear overstated.\n\n\u201cThe base is very low, we are coming out of a crisis,\u201d said Luiz Carlos Moraes, a Mercedes Benz executive who is also the president of Anfavea, the auto industry trade group.", "description": "Brazil's largest truckmakers are expressing optimism again about the growth prospects for Latin America's largest economy, even as the country continues to struggle to rebound from a deep recession that began in 2015.", "authors": ["Marcelo Rochabrun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440679488&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0SD-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
