My family and I are excited about the move to San Diego.\u201d\n\nNonu is a veteran of 103 tests and more than 300 professional games, winning World Cup titles in 2011 and 2015 and playing in All Blacks teams which won five Tri-Nations or Rugby Championship titles and eight Bledisloe Cup series.\n\nHe played Super Rugby for the Hurricanes and Highlanders and spent three seasons with French club Toulon before joining the Blues last year. But he failed to win selection in New Zealand\u2019s squad for the current World Cup in Japan, making a comeback to international rugby unlikely.\n\nHis signing with San Diego is a major coup for the MLR.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019a is a huge addition for us,\u201d Legion head coach Rob Hoadley said. \u201cIt is undeniable that he will have a major impact on the MLR this season.\n\n\u201cHe is a world-class player who has proven himself to be one of the greats of the game. His talent and leadership will be a perfect addition to the San Diego Legion organization.\u201d\n\nMajor League Rugby was founded in 2017 with its inaugural season being played in 2018. The competition now features 12 teams, with 11 from the U.S. and one from Canada. The Seattle Seawolves have claimed the title the first two seasons.\n\n____\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former All Blacks center Ma'a Nonu has become the highest-profile player to commit to a Major League Rugby franchise, signing with the San Diego Legion for the 2020 season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
