Through a two-week qualitative study, they found that respondents were spending 350 to 400 minutes, or about six hours a day, on their phones, but often less than 1 percent of that on news apps. No news apps, with the exception of Reddit, broke the top 25 apps used.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t younger audiences using news apps?\n\nAccording to researchers, young adults, and particularly those raised as \u201cdigital natives\u201d as part of Generation Z (ages 18 to 24), have high expectations for a \u201cflawless, seamless, personalized online experience\u201d that news organizations are not often able to provide.\n\nThis \u201cseamlessness\u201d refers to the user experience of the app \u2014 including, for example, the desire for features such as customizable news feeds with an endless scroll \u2014 but also to how news organizations integrate themselves to platforms such as Instagram or Twitter. Often, said Matt Taylor, a strategist at Flamingo who worked on the report, news organizations struggle with striking the right tone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a person and how he behaves at different social circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s either that this person is behaving similarly in all the places, so they\u2019re not fitting in, or they\u2019re trying way too hard to fit in, sort of like a dad trying to be cool at a party.\u201d\n\nIf news orgs want to get and keep new Gen Z users, they HAVE to get better tech. News apps and sites still aren't intuitive enough. Gen Z is used to Netflix. When was the last time that logged you out? Compare that to a news site. https://t.co/rHM47bdruq \u2014 Elana Zak (@elanazak) September 3, 2019\n\nThe key, Taylor said, is for news organizations to retain their brand but adapt it across multiple platforms. These instincts are embedded into the way young people use the Internet, which is why they expect it from other individuals and organizations.\n\nThe other challenge for news organizations, researchers say, is that for young users, there is a near-constant level of \u201cbackground\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d exposure to news that not only dulls the desire to actively seek out news through dedicated apps but can cause fatigue that drives them to seek out content that is explicitly not news \u2014 such as, you know, oddly satisfying \u201cslime porn,\u201d or this video of a leather-clad motorcyclist in Belgium saving a tiny kitten.\n\n\u201cTo be online today is to have these currents constantly hitting you,\u201d said Lucas Galan, head of applied data science at Flamingo. \u201c\u2026 Just by osmosis, you can quickly become tired with a story without really engaging with it in depth.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study, many respondents found traditional news organizations \u201cnegative and depressing\u201d and \u201cactively looked for more entertaining or uplifting news in social media or aggregators.\u201d\n\nPaula M. Poindexter, a communications professor at the University of Texas at Austin, agreed, adding that based on her research, it is not just that young people are shying away from news apps but also that their general interest in the act of reading the news seems to be waning.\n\nIn the past, children used to look at their parents or teachers reading the physical newspaper, which implicitly signaled to them that reading the news is an important part of adult life, she said. Since most American users \u2014 not just millennials \u2014 now get their news from social media and websites rather than the print product, children are growing up looking at adults staring at their phones, with little sense of what applications they are actually on. The \u201cmodeling\u201d for news consumption that used to be present no longer exists, Poindexter said.\n\nUh-oh. So now what?\n\nThe researchers from Flamingo emphasize that their research does not suggest that younger audiences no longer have the appetite or, as frequently alleged by older pundits, the attention span for important journalism. They pointed, for example, to the growing interest among young adults in longer-form stories and podcasts as evidence that there is a \u201cthirst\u201d for deeper engagement with hard-hitting news. It just needs to be delivered on the right terms, they added.\n\nNews organizations need to make their apps \u201cas simple and intuitive as Facebook or Netflix,\u201d the report states. They also need to adapt to the platforms that younger users have already integrated into their lives \u2014 but without losing the authority of their brand.\n\nSome organizations are already trying to do this: the New York Times launched a weekly documentary TV show on Hulu and FX earlier this year and more recently aired the pilot of \u201cDiagnosis,\u201d another documentary series on Netflix. The Washington Post runs a TikTok account that, among other highlights, got into faux \u201cbeef\u201d with Trevor Noah\u2019s \u201cDaily Show.\u201d\n\ni am ready to go to battle in a washington post daily show tiktok war, @davejorgenson https://t.co/aUBo9ekOxr \u2014 Steven Rich (@dataeditor) August 12, 2019\n\nWhether these efforts will pay off remains to be seen. Poindexter said she has been monitoring the news consumption habits of young users for close to a decade and still has not figured out whether active, meaningful engagement with news is evolving or fading altogether.\n\n\u201cIf we do nothing \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of nothing being done \u2014 [the latter] could very well be the outcome,\u201d she said.", "description": "Respondents ages 18 to 35 were spending 350 to 400 minutes a day on their phones, but often less than 1 percent of that on news apps.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZTLIZ6FJPEI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
