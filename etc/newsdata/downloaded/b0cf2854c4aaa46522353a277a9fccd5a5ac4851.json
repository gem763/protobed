The official predicted a long process that the admininstration would fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nLegally cementing the three-committee impeachment probe as an official legislative process, not an informal patchwork of hearings, could be a game-changer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's efforts to stop a House impeachment got a kick in the gut on Friday with a federal court ruling\n\nA judge in Washington ruled that House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (pictured) can have everything in the Robert Mueller report that was withheld from Congress because of grand jury secrecy rules\n\nWhen Mueller's report cited grand-jury materials, it was blacked out \u00ad\u2013 along with footnotes pointing to evidence; Judge Beryl Howell is awarding the evidence to the Democras in Congress too\n\nThe White House has refused to obey subpoenas and document requests from House committees engaged in impeachment inquiries, insisting Speaker Nancy Pelosi must first hold a politically fraught floor vote to formally authorize it.\n\nBut Howell, a Barack Obamam appointee, declared Friday that '[e]ven in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry.'\n\n'The Speaker of the House of Representatives has announced an official impeachment inquiry, and the House Judiciary Committee, in exercising Congress\u2019s \"sole Power of Impeachment\" ... is reviewing the evidence set out in the Mueller Report,' Howell wrote.\n\nShe set an October 30 deadline for Trump's Justice Department to hand over '[a]ll portions of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election that were redacted pursuant to' restrictions typically placed on grand jury materials.\n\nDemocrats will also get 'any underlying transcripts or exhibits referenced in the portions of the Mueller Report that were redacted' for grand jury secrecy reasons.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the Trump nemesis who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Howeel's 'thoughtful ruling recognizes that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary.'\n\n'This grand jury information that the Administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work,' he said.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell ruled that the Justice Department can't keep secret grand-jury-related materials away from congressional committees that are engaged in an impeachment inquiry\n\nPage after page of the Mueller report was redacted, much of it to hide federal grand jury information from prying eyes\n\nMueller's report, the result of 22 months of secretive interviews and testimony, exists in three versions. The complete report is available only to senior federal law enforcement officials like the FBI director and the attorney general.\n\nThe publicly released version includes more than 2,000 lines \u00adblacked-out \u2013 called 'redactions' \u00ad\u2013 amounting to about 12 per cent of the report.\n\nCongress got a near-complete version, with only grand jury materials redacted. Howell's ruling is appealable, but if it stands those final redactions will drop away on Capitol Hill.", "description": "The judge set an October 30 deadline for Trump's Justice Department to hand over anything redacted from the Mueller report because of grand jury secrecy, plus evidence that led to those parts.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20196864-0-image-a-16_1572034589148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
