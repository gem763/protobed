Nonetheless, he went ahead and did it. Lives have been lost as a result. The punishment is economic sanctions that have lasted 5-10 days? What would warrant a military response from the U.S., bearing in mind we\u2019ve seen an attack by Iran on Saudi Arabia, as well?\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: I never get out front of the president\u2019s decision whether to take the awesome undertaking of using America\u2019s military might to protect American interests, but the world should know we\u2019ve done it before. We took strikes into Syria. When chemical weapons were used, we did it to uphold the fundamental norm that chemical weapons can\u2019t be used. The previous administration refused to enforce this basic, decent human rights norm. We did it and the world should know that we will continue to do that, whether see American interests at stake or fundamental norms around the world that need to be enforced, we\u2019ll use all the powers that we have.\n\nYou suggested the economic powers that we\u2019ve used. We\u2019ll certainly use them. We\u2019ll use our diplomatic powers as well. Those are our preference. We prefer peace to war. But in the event that kinetic action or military action is needed, you should know that President Trump is fully prepared to undertake that action.", "description": "Mike Pompeo warned that Donald Trump is \"fully prepared\" to take military action against Turkey over its actions against the Kurds in Syria.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/01/d2ca5a_us-secretary-state-mike-pompeo-accused-impeachment-investigation-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
