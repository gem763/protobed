(AP) - A newly approved law will require New York to provide inmates with information on HIV prevention when they are discharged from a prison.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the legislation on Wednesday. The law says the state will give inmates information on how to go about getting free HIV testing when they are discharged.\n\nThe law specifies that inmates should also be given contact information for \u201cHIV counseling and testing service providers\u201d in the city or county where they intend to live upon release.\n\nState Sen. James Sanders Jr. supported the bill and says the information given to the inmate could be lifesaving.\n\nThe state\u2019s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision says it already \u201csubstantially complies\u201d with the law but will make any updates before it goes into effect.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A newly approved law will require New York to provide inmates with information on HIV prevention when they are discharged from a prison.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
