They have their dreams ahead of them. so, when it come to mine, I\u2019ve already lived my life.

This is #MenAbuse #WomanAreTrash\"\n\n\"Zodwa Wabantu if she's dating an 18 year old is a bloody predator. Khule if he's dating/sleeping with an 18 year old is a bloody predator..Sies on both them. Sexual predators tend to rely heavily on age of consent of 16&18. A 34 year old and 45 year ifunani kuma teenagers?\"\n\n\"What Khune and Zodwa Wabantu are doing is predatory behaviour.
