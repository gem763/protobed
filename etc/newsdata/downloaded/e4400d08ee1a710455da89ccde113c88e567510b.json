Doug Collins (R-GA), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, was on Fox News Monday raising questions about what House Intel Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) knew about the whistleblower complaint and when he knew it. Here\u2019s what he told Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade (bolded emphasis added):\n\nCollins: \u201cIf you go back, actually the whistleblower complaint was on August 14th I believe. On August the 28th, go back and look at Adam Schiff who is now heading the ramrod investigation. He actually put a tweet out saying basically what the whistleblower complaint said. This is a month ahead of time. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if there was not more communication here.\u201d\n\nCollins also said there is a troubling reason why Pelosi has not called for a House vote on a formal impeachment inquiry:\n\n\u201cAnd this is why I\u2019ve said this week that the Speaker abused her power \u2026 she said we\u2019re starting the impeachment inquiry and she gave it to her buddy Adam Schiff who has been dishonest with the American people from the get-go on Russia. And why that is important for everybody in this country to know is a [true] impeachment inquiry would actually afford due process, it would make sure both sides were heard. It would make sure the President and the minority have the rights that are not present in the hearings currently. \u201c\n\nKilmeade pointed out something else during the segment about how Pelosi made \u201ca slip\u201d in an interview she did with 60 Minutes on Sunday about when she read the Ukraine call transcript. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\nKilmeade: \u201cNancy Pelosi on 60 Minutes last night was asked \u2018Did the President call you?\u2019 She said \u2018yes, he called me.\u2019 [This was] before she came out with the impeachment inquiry. [Trump said] \u2018the letter was perfect. We\u2019re gonna release the transcript, the call was perfect.\u2019 And she said to him, \u2018I knew what was in the letter.\u2019 Then she paused and said \u2018it was in the public domain.\u2019 Number one, it was not in the public domain, and the transcript had not been released yet. How could she possibly know?\u201d\n\nCollins isn\u2019t the only GOP leader in the House raising alarm bells about what Democrats knew and when they knew it.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (WY), who is the GOP Conference Chair, tweeted out a clip of the Pelosi interview on Monday and stated \u201cThis is starting to seem like a political set up\u201d:\n\n.\u2066@SpeakerPelosi\u2069 said on 60 Minutes last night she knew the details of the classified Ukraine call before White House released transcript. This is starting to seem like a political set up. So, Madame Speaker, \u201cwhat did you know and when did you know it?\u201d pic.twitter.com/g5tlL5hBsX \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 30, 2019\n\nFred Fleitz, who has extensive experience working for various intelligence agencies including the CIA NSC, and DIA, speculated last week that the whistleblower might have had \u201coutside help\u201d writing the actual complaint itself \u2013 either from a member of Congress or staff:\n\nI am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA.\n\n\n\nMy suspicions grew this morning when I saw the declassified whistleblowing complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified.\n\n\n\nFrom my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff.\n\nHe also wrote that it was \u201cmore than a coincidence\u201d that a Schiff tweet from late August virtually mirrored the whistleblower complaint.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to see shades of the Russia collusion hoax playing out all over again. This whole thing stinks.\n\nRelated \u2013>> Schiff\u2019s Staffer Traveled To Ukraine, Trip Was Paid For By Group Funded By Hunter Biden\u2019s Old Firm\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
