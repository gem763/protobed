No matter the geopolitical or domestic turmoil, you can count on them to be there, lurching from one scandal to the next.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that Donald Trump seems to have taken to heart \u2014 with the U.S. president\u2019s sometimes glamorous, sometimes goofy, never-not-scandalous first family traipsing after him to global summits and state visits.\n\nThe trouble is that maintaining bevvies of VIPs can be expensive \u2014 especially as economies threaten to turn sour. Whether the cost is worth the benefit isn\u2019t always clear, however, as neither the U.S. nor the U.K. is terribly transparent when it comes to funding their first families.\n\nBelow, POLITICO takes a stab at tallying up the price tag for the British royals and the presidential brood, and dishes each family a Sponger rating for how much they\u2019re costing the taxpayer.\n\nThe royals\n\nThe scandals swirling around the royals in recent months have focused on Prince Andrew\u2019s connections to the late billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and Harry and Meghan\u2019s use of private planes while lecturing the rest of us about climate change.\n\nBoth raise a similar question: To what extent should taxpayers pick up the tab for minor royals?\n\nThe queen herself is funded through the \u00a382.2-million-a-year Sovereign Grant, which came to about \u00a31.24 per taxpayer in the last financial year. She uses this for the upkeep of all her palaces (including the \u00a32.4 million renovation of Harry and Meghan\u2019s pad, Frogmore Cottage), as well as her staffing and travel costs.\n\nFifteen other senior royals are largely financed by two slush funds set up by King Edward III in the 14th Century: the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster. With vastly valuable holdings of residential and agricultural land, their combined income last year stood at \u00a343.3 million.\n\nThen there\u2019s the cost of police protection, covering not just the Fab 16 but also some of their children, including such lesser figures as Andrew\u2019s daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, ninth and 10th in line to the throne respectively.\n\nThe exact budget for guarding the royals is not public, but in 2017 it was estimated the Royalty and Specialist Protection Team \u2014 also responsible for guarding government ministers and foreign dignitaries \u2014 had running costs of \u00a3128 million.\n\nFollowing criticism of expensive royal travel \u2014 including some \u00a3126,000 charged to the taxpayer for protecting Princess Eugenie during her gap year to Asia, America and Africa \u2014 it was reported that the younger members of the family were being urged to ditch the Royal Train and private jets in favor of budget travel.\n\nWilliam and Kate at least seem to have got the memo: Last month the duke and duchess of Cambridge and their family boarded a \u00a373.05 Flybe flight from Norwich to Aberdeen.\n\nThis was interpreted as a delicious act of trolling by the parents-of-three, coming as it did after William\u2019s brother Harry suggested it was an eco-crime to have more than two children before dashing off for the first of four journeys by private jet. A grateful and cash-strapped nation saluted the thrifty couple, while pouring scorn on the newlyweds.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Sponger Rating: 9.5 / 10\n\nWould have been 10 if not for William and Kate\u2019s Flybe flight.\n\nThe Trumps\n\nWhen it comes to salaries, the Trump family is cheap compared with the British royal family. Presidential compensation has remained the same since 2001 at $400,000 a year, along with a $50,000 expense allowance, $100,000 travel account and $19,000 entertainment budget. First lady Melania Trump draws no salary, but her own support staff costs about $500,000 a year. The pair live at the White House for free along with their teenage son, Barron.\n\nThe president\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, both employed as senior White House advisers, also draw no salary.\n\nSo, are Americans actually getting a good deal? Not quite.\n\nAs with the British royals, the real strain on the public purse comes from keeping up with the itchy feet of young, energetic VIPs who are at best vulnerable and at worst a hostage situation waiting to happen.\n\nFlying teams of bodyguards around the world is proving particularly pricey in the case of the Trump administration. The president has five children, four of whom are adults, three with children of their own, leading to a total of eighteen family members entitled to protection.\n\nThe full cost of guarding the Trump children and grandchildren is not available, however breakdowns for some individual trips have been released by the Government Accountability Office at the request of Congress, giving us a glimpse into the sums involved.\n\nFor example, we know that Trump\u2019s decision to invite his adult children to accompany him on his state visit to the U.K. in June cost taxpayers $3.5 million and that his frequent trips to his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago each come with a similar price tag, at around $3.4 million per visit.\n\nMore broadly, Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the White House is costing U.S. taxpayers dearly. By October, he will have racked up 1,000 days in office, nearly 300 of which have been spent at his own properties, and more than 200 at golf resorts. In May, it was reported that the U.S. government had spent $102 million to facilitate presidential rounds of golf, including $60,000 on renting golf carts for the secret service to trail along behind him in one year alone.\n\nAs with the minor royals, it\u2019s the personal travel by lesser Trumps that is the most eye-catching.\n\nA November 2018 business trip by Donald Trump, Jr. to India, where he sought to sell a family condominium, set taxpayers back nearly $100,000. When the president\u2019s youngest daughter Tiffany visited Serbia in March it cost $23,000; two months later she spent a weekend at the Cannes Film Festival. The price tag: $19,000.\n\nThanks to Trump\u2019s international property portfolio, his companies often make money off his family\u2019s trips to his properties. In February 2017, for example, Donald Jr., Eric and Tiffany Trump all travelled to Vancouver to open a new Trump hotel; the cost of putting up the secret service at the Trump International Hotel and Tower Vancouver was $20,000.\n\nIt was not long after that, in August, that the head of the secret service warned that the agency is at risk of running out of money due to the strain of protecting the extensive Trump family.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Sponger Rating: 9/10\n\nThe Trumps certainly share the royals\u2019 love of lavishness and carelessness about public funds. But the U.S. has one big advantage. Presidencies last four to eight years, and Trump\u2019s family members will lose their protection as soon as he leaves office (Trump himself will continue to receive secret service protection for another 10 years). Unlike the Brits, U.S. taxpayers won\u2019t be stuck paying the first family\u2019s bills forever. Unless Ivanka runs for president. Or Barron marries Princess Charlotte \u2026", "description": "POLITICO tallies up their tabs.", "authors": ["Rosa Prince", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1147994693-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
