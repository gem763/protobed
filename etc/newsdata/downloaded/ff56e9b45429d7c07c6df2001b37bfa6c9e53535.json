Several minutes later, she reported that Santa was far away in Morocco but would be at the caller's home on Christmas morning.\n\nMrs Trump later tweeted that helping children track Santa \"is becoming one of my favorite traditions!\"\n\nThe NORAD Tracks Santa programme became a Christmas Eve tradition after a child mistakenly called the forerunner to the North American Aerospace Defence Command in 1955 and asked to speak to Santa.\n\nThe programme wasn't affected by the government shutdown. It's run by volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado using pre-approved funding.\n\nThe Trumps later travelled to Washington National Cathedral to attend the Solemn Holy Eucharist of Christmas Eve. The cathedral's website said the programme included readings from Holy Scripture, favourite congregational hymns and seasonal choral and instrumental music as well as Holy Communion. Passes were required.\n\nTrump most likely would have been attending Christmas services at a church near his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. But he scrapped plans to head to Florida for the holidays after parts of the government were forced to shut down indefinitely in a budget stalemate with Congress.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Christmas Eve took calls from children anxious to find out where Santa was on his gift-giving journey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6763/781a7a586aad407a9d765692d9579ee9.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-25"}
