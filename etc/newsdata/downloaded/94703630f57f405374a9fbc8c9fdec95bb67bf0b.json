His post, which has since been deleted, included an image that read, \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The former British colony has been rocked by months of political unrest in a challenge to China.\n\nOn Monday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver waded into the fray . He reportedly spoke to Kyodo News, a local news outlet in Japan, and expressed his support for Morey \"in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.\"\n\nIn a statement the next day, Silver said the NBA could not regulate what \"players, employees and team owners\" say, and that the league was motivated by \"far more than growing our business.\"\n\n\"It is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\" he said in the statement. \"It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\"\n\nThat response has sparked outrage in China. Several NBA partners have spoken out defiantly over the last few days, saying China's sovereignty over Hong Kong is non-negotiable and disagreeing with the league's handling of the situation.\n\nThere's a lot at stake for the NBA.
