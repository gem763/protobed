Enter a pair of series devoted to teen troubles, Hulu's \"Looking for Alaska,\" adapted from a young-adult novel; and Netflix's \"Daybreak,\" a strange construct set in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\n\"Looking for Alaska\" clearly wants to be Hulu's answer to \"13 Reasons Why,\" a time-bending soap opera -- based on John Green's book -- that opens with a car crash, then backs into the meat of the story.\n\nSet in Orlando in 2005, the focus of that would be Miles (Charlie Plummer), a new arrival at a snotty boarding school who is rather morbidly obsessed with the final words of famous people, and who approaches the mystery that is his future by describing it as \"The Great Perhaps.\"\n\nA little lost in his new surroundings, Miles almost instantly befriends the outcasts and runs afoul of the cool kids. His circle includes Alaska (Kristine Froseth), hence the title, as well as the nickname-bestowing the Colonel (Denny Love) and Takumi (Jay Lee).\n\nAlaska and her buddies love pulling pranks, much to the chagrin of the school's headmaster (\"Veep's\" Timothy Simons). Still, this is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance and the mystery of Alaska's fate, with peripheral forays into class and racial divides.\n\nRead More", "description": "New Hulu and Netflix series unleash more streaming teen troubles, one based on a young-adult novel, the other following a nuclear apocalypse", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191017085451-looking-for-alaska-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
