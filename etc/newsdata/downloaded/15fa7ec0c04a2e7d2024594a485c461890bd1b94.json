The Massachusetts senator spoke with CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns a day before a new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll showed a surge in Warren's popularity, with more voters believing she could defeat President Trump.\n\nWarren sat down with Huey-Burns in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Saturday. Huey-Burns asked Warren what she says to people who may be inclined to support her, but aren't sure if she can defeat Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Look, I know how to fight and I know how to win. I've been around this block before,\" Warren said.\n\n\"When I ran for the Senate I'd never run for public office before and people said to me, 'A woman can't win this seat,'\" she added. \"A very competent woman had just lost it.\"\n\nWarren taught law at several universities \u2014 including Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 before launching a Senate bid for the 2012 election. She said at one point, the polls had her down by double digits. But she ended up defeating the Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, and becoming Massachusetts' first female senator. She won a second term in 2018 with 60% of the vote.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren in an interview with CBS News in New Hampshire on Saturday, September 7, 2019. CBS News\n\n\"I make every day count,\" Warren said about her campaigning style. \"And I stay in the fight for all the right reasons.\"\n\nThe latest CBS News/YouGov Tracker shows an increasing number of Democratic voters believe Warren could win the White House.\n\nThe survey shows that the current Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, receives much support for his perceived electability. About 3 in 4 voters who are considering Biden think he would beat Mr. Trump \u2014 the highest number for anyone in the Democratic race.\n\nBut Warren has made substantial gains on her electability. In the latest poll, 55% of voters think she could beat Mr. Trump \u2014 up from 39% in June.\n\nIn an aggregate vote preference across early-state contests through Super Tuesday, Warren leads the pack with 26% of voters picking her as their first choice. That's a one-point lead over Biden.\n\nBiden's support has largely held and even risen in some places like in Iowa, so the movement toward Warren is not attrition from Biden, but of lower-tier candidates losing supporters who have gone to Warren or, in lesser numbers, to Sanders.\n\nMeanwhile, Warren leads the entire Democratic field for certain candidate qualities. A majority of voters \u2014 42% \u2014 said in the survey that she is the most knowledgeable about the issues in the 2020 race. Warren also scored the highest for enthusiasm, with 46% saying they'd be enthusiastic if she became the nominee, compared to 29% for Biden.\n\nWhat does Warren's rise in the polls mean for the campaign?\n\nBiden still clings to a narrow lead over Warren for convention delegates, which will ultimately decide the Democratic nominee. Biden has an estimated 600 delegates available to him through Super Tuesday, compared to 545 for Warren.\n\nWarren said she attributes her rise to \"what I fight for and how I fight.\" She said Americans are getting frustrated with inaction on issues like gun safety, prescription drug prices and climate change.\n\nBut Warren shook her head when Huey-Burns asked if she ever imagined she would be a front-runner.\n\n\"I think of this as, I'm in it with more and more and more people,\" Warren said. \"We're doing this together, side by side.\"\n\nAnthony Salvanto contributed to this report.", "description": "A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll shows Elizabeth Warren attracts more enthusiasm than any other Democratic candidate", "authors": ["Jason Silverstein"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/08/39874357-293c-4b54-850e-917b7135be44/thumbnail/1200x630/ff28e800583bd670b438a85fbddaf5bd/warren.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
