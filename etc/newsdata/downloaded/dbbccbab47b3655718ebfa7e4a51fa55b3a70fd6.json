The act doesn't allow families using surrogates to recoup legal and some other costs.\n\n\"I would hope eventually that it would be more attainable,\" Maynard said. \"This is a process that costs a lot of money and a lot of couples don't have that money, and not a day goes by that I don't think about that.\n\n\"We're very fortunate that we were able to use surrogacy to build our family and find our surrogate and work with them to have a child. So I would hope that it's more attainable for more families.\"\n\nUnexplained pregnancy loss\n\nMaynard and Foley began trying to have children after their marriage in 2013, but endured four miscarriages over the next three years.\n\nThey tried in-vitro fertilization. Although the embryos were healthy, the attempts to transfer them into Maynard's uterus didn't succeed, and doctors couldn't explain why.\n\nMaynard kisses Oscar with proud dad Mark Foley looking on. (CBC/Steve Lawrence)\n\nMaynard, a critical-care nurse, and Foley, an emergency-room doctor, decided to turn to a surrogate to carry their child to term.\n\nSurrogacy in Canada\n\nWhen a child is born through a surrogate in Canada, the woman is the legal mother at birth. Even if the child is genetically related to both the intended parents, they go through an adoption to become the legal parents.\n\nJust as in any other adoption, there are legal fees and agency fees.\n\nHowever, in a regular adoption, the parents could recover some of those costs through an adoption tax credit. Families who use a surrogate cannot.\n\n\"So essentially applying for the paperwork to adopt your own genetic child is not covered, which we found kind of frustrating,\" said Foley.\n\nFoley applied for the adoption tax credit on his income tax return, but was denied by the CRA. He estimates receiving the tax credit would make a difference of up to $5,000 to his family.\n\nIn an email, a CRA spokesperson said the organization isn't able to comment on the details of Foley's case it's before the courts.\n\nHowever, the agency says, under the adoption tax credit, a parent who adopts a child can claim some expenses up to a maximum of $15,905, such as fees paid to an agency licensed by a provincial or territorial government.\n\nLast year, about 1,590 people claimed the adoption tax credit.\n\nFoley hasn't kept track, but estimates his family has spent more than $100,000 in their attempts to have a baby \u2014 a cost that is not unusual for parents who pursue in-vitro fertilization and surrogacy.\n\nFoley said he applied for the adoption tax credit, but was denied by the Canada Revenue Agency. (CBC/Steve Lawrence)\n\nFoley said ultimately he would like to see all related treatments covered as medical expenses, but thinks changing the adoption credit would be a good start.\n\n\"To me it's just logically unfair,\" he said. \"It's something that should be considered \u2026 a medical illness, an inability to conceive. It's not something that you can predict.\"\n\n'I think everybody deserves to have a family'\n\nHalifax resident Beth Roberts was the surrogate for Oscar. Previously, she was a surrogate for another family.\n\nRoberts said she has found the experience rewarding, and believes if the cost of surrogacy were lowered for the intended parents, most women who choose to become surrogates would see it as a positive arrangement.\n\n\"I think that there is a double standard as far as what couples go through in surrogacy versus adoption,\" she said. \"Sometimes it's more cost effective for surrogacy and other times it's more cost effective for adoption. I think it depends on the situation.\"\n\nBeth Roberts and Maynard shortly after Oscar's birth. (Beth Roberts)\n\nSome examples of Roberts's costs that were covered by Maynard and Foley during the pregnancy included a special diet and medication, as she developed gestational diabetes\n\nOther costs included lost wages if she felt too ill to go to work or the cost of help around the house for activities like shovelling snow.\n\n\"I think everybody deserves to have a family and however they want to build their family is their own choice. I don't think it should cost tens of thousands of dollars to have a child,\" Roberts said.\n\nPurpose of the tax credit\n\nTed Sawa, one of the lawyers acting for the family, said the original purpose of the adoption tax credit was to lessen the expense for families.\n\n\"Back in 2005, the Income Tax Act was amended to provide relief for couples who choose adoption to have a child,\" he said. \"Back when that occurred, the budget speech at that time said that a fair tax system evolves over time to reflect changes in the economy and society.\"\n\nSawa's firm usually handles 12 to 24 surrogacy cases at any given time.\n\nTed Sawa, a lawyer with the firm Boyne Clarke, is part of a team acting on behalf of the Foley-Maynard family. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\n\"In 2005, the government decided that people who chose adoption to have a child should find some relief for the expenses through the tax system,\" he said.\n\n\"The government should also modernize the tax system now to provide similar relief for people who choose to have a child through a surrogacy arrangement.\"\n\nMaynard's and Foley's case is scheduled to be heard in the Tax Court of Canada in April.\n\nBut before they can deal with that, there's a much more important day for them to get through: their second baby arrives in March, also by surrogate.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "A Dartmouth, N.S., couple\u00a0who turned to surrogacy to become parents\u00a0is challenging the Canada Revenue Agency in court in a bid to reduce the cost of the process.", "authors": ["Shaina Luck Covers Everything Court To City Council.
