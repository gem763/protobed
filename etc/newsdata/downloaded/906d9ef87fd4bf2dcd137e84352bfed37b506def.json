Critics frequently accuse Trump of violating the emoluments clause.\n\nThe president ran a string of resorts around the world before being elected president. His children have largely taken over running the family business.\n\n\"Whether I lost $2 billion, $5 billion or less, it doesn\u2019t make any difference. I don\u2019t care,\" Trump said. \"I'm doing this for the country. I'm doing it for the people.\"\n\nTrump had said he would have the G7 summit at Doral without cost to U.S. taxpayers but will now look for other sites.\n\n\"I don't think it'll be as exciting or as good,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that being president has cost him between $2 billion and $5 billion that he would have made if he had continued running his business instead of getting into politics.
