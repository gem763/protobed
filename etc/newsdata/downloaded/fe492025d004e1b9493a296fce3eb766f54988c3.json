In context, it appeared Trump was referring to the physical subscriptions, not pulling the press access of the two papers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even want it in the White House anymore,\u201d Trump told Hannity. \u201cWe\u2019re going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post. They\u2019re fake.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s comment did draw the attention of Ted Boutrous, the attorney who represented CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Playboy\u2019s Brian Karem after their press passes were pulled.\n\n\u201cMore compelling evidence, indeed another confession, that @realdonaldtrump and his team engage in content- and viewpoint- discrimination regarding certain (indeed many) members of the White House press corps, in plain violation of the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nHannity\u2019s interview with Trump, conducted outside with the Rose Garden as a backdrop, took up his full hour.\n\nIt was, to say the least, quite a contrast to the interview that Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace conducted on Sunday of Mick Mulvaney, in which Wallace challenged Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff repeatedly on his comments that seemed to confirm there was indeed a quid pro quo when it came to aid to Ukraine. Mulvaney tried to walk those comments back.\n\nOn Hannity, though, there was no mention of Mulvaney at all.\n\nInstead, Trump went unchallenged in his assertions \u2014 ones that he, Rudy Giuliani and Hannity have repeated frequently since House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry. Roughly speaking, they are that the real collusion was with the Clintons and Ukraine, the real corruption was with the Bidens, and the real disgrace was the way that the Trump team was investigated by Robert Mueller and the deep state.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at the 2016 election and it is a disaster,\u201d said Trump, referring to the Russia probe \u2014 not his own victory.\n\nHannity is Trump\u2019s highest rated on-air booster. He spoke at a Trump rally last year. And much of the hour sounded like adviser agreeing with the boss, whether that be the unfairness of the impeachment process or the soundness of the Syria policy.\n\nHe did interrupt Trump \u2014 albeit it wasn\u2019t to challenge him. When the president started to refer to Elizabeth Warren as \u201cElizabeth Warren,\u201d Hannity reminded him of the nickname he gave her.\n\n\u201cPocahontas,\u201d Hannity said.\n\n\u201cPocahontas,\u201d Trump said, before explaining that he\u2019s reluctant to talk about who he thinks he\u2019ll face in 2020.\n\nTrump said, \u201cShe rose from the ashes, and I give her credit for that, but I don\u2019t like talking about it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
