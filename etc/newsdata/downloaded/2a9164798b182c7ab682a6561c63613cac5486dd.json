But it does tell an interesting story about the people who created it.\n\nAs It Happens host Carol Off spoke with John Love, a synthetic biology professor at the University of Exeter who led the team that dissected the fatberg. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nHow does one approach a lump of fatberg?\n\nWell, you have to be really, really careful because you don't know what's in there.\n\nDoes it smell?\n\nOh, yes. It's horrible. It smells really, very organic, shall we say. There's just a real stench of sewer that comes with it. Some of the fatberg is almost buttery in appearance. It's yellowish. And you can see that it's very greasy to the touch. It feels slimy. But there is grit in there and there are fibres in there, and you can really feel them as well. I suppose it's like wool dipped in candle wax.\n\nProfessor John Love disposes of the remains of a melted chunk of fatberg after dissection. (John Love)\n\nHow do you keep from retching when you look at this?\n\nWell, I suppose it's just practice really, isn't it? You get used to a lot. And I suppose, as a biologist, I've dissected quite a few smelly things in my life. So this is just another one. It is not pleasant, but you get by.\n\nI don't think I could get used to it. But you must wear something, some protective clothing of some kind.\n\nYes, we do. When we were doing the fatberg dissection, we were wearing stab-proof gloves, and over those stab-proof gloves we had just our normal neoprene gloves. We had our lab coats on with closed cuffs, all done up to our neck. We had our safety goggles. We didn't need a mask because the work that we were doing was in a special hood that had a pane of glass in front of it. So we were working underneath in this hood. And we had our safety shoes on as well.\n\nYou have all these precautionary things on you because [of] the possibility [that] there's something sharp, dangerous or toxic. So did you find anything like that in your fatberg?\n\nWell, actually \u2014 and this is sort of the good news \u2014 we didn't, which was also, for us, the disappointing news. In terms of macroscopic things in the fatberg, we've mostly found wet wipes. We found the residues of nappies and incontinence pads. We found ... female sanitary products. We even found some false teeth.\n\nTim Henderson, a 'flusher' or trunk sewer technician holds a fatberg as he works in the intersection of the Regent and Victoria streets sewer in London on Dec. 11, 2014.

You found false teeth?\n\n[Laughs] We did. We found a set of false teeth. Yeah. So a lot of things go down the toilet that we're not really aware of.\n\nOh, yeah. Usually thrown there by children. But losing a set of false teeth \u2014 that must have been a distressing day for somebody.\n\nTo be honest, that was the thing that nearly sent one of my colleagues over the edge. When he saw the false teeth in there, he felt it was like something out of a horror movie.\n\nHere's a sampling of what experts at the University of Exeter found when they dissected the massive fatberg found beneath the streets of Sidmouth. (Submitted by John Love)\n\nThis, of course, is different from what they've found in other fatbergs, isn't it? Can you describe how this differs?\n\nWell, the fatberg in London, for instance, contained a lot more sharps and things like needles and things from drug abuse. Actually, Sidmouth, where this fatberg is, is a very genteel, coastal town. It's a holiday resort and also inhabited mainly by retired people. We did not find \u2026 any drug paraphernalia. Instead, we found things that are more associated with maybe older people.\n\nLike false teeth.\n\nYes, like the false teeth.\n\nWe know in \u2026 London's East End, this mammoth fatberg they found \u2026 they found cocaine, they found syringes, condoms. I guess reflecting a different lifestyle.\n\nThat's right. And I think that's what makes these fatbergs actually quite interesting because they do clarify a little bit maybe \u2026 [about] the social history of what's going on in a specific area.\n\nThey seem to accumulate very, very quickly as well.\n\nSince South West Water has cleaned the sewer in which this was found \u2026 they've actually found that there's a new deposit beginning, and it's already about seven centimetres deep.\n\nSamples taken from a fatberg in southwest England showed no detectable levels of toxic chemicals, according to scientists at the University of Exeter who studied the mass. The fatberg measured about 63 metres in length when it was found underneath the town of Sidmouth earlier this year. (University of Exeter/The Associated Press)\n\nThere was a fellow we interviewed back in January talking about the efforts to try and get people not to flush all these things down the toilet. And he, I guess the public service announcement was the three Ps: pee, poo and paper. Nothing else should go down there.\n\nThat's exactly right. When we were doing the dissection, we found, obviously, the plastics and the cotton, wool, and everything, the wet wipes. These were all really not decomposed at all.\n\nWe actually also looked at \u2026 the microscopic fibres in the fatberg, and we found that most of them \u2014 99 per cent of them indeed \u2014 were cellulose fibres that came from toilet paper. So toilet paper is really well-designed to disaggregate in the sewer system and to actually not be such a problem.\n\nWet wipes do contain a large proportion of plastic, and they're not just paper. And I don't think people realize that.\n\nIn London's East End, they actually have put a piece of that fatberg on display at the museum for people to see what they're doing to the sewers. Any plans to do that in Sidmouth?\n\nNot in Sidmouth. The minute you take it [the fatberg] out of the sewer, it starts to decompose almost like a \u2014 well, essentially, it's like a dead organic body, if you like. And it will decompose in oxygen, so that's not nice. It doesn't really subsist outside for very long, unless you preserve it.\n\nOh, gosh. I don't think I want to hear anything more about this, but I have to ask one last question. Any message out to see if anyone is looking for a set of false teeth?\n\n[Laughs] If they do need a pair of false teeth \u2014 an upper jaw \u2014 we can provide one. But I can't say it looked particularly pleasant, and I wouldn't want to put it in my mouth.\n\nWritten by Kristen Fenn with files from The Associated Press. Produced by Kate Swoger.
