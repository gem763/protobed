We are one week away form the European Council summit and just a few weeks away from the date of October 31\".\n\nHis warning comes ahead of high-level talks between himself and Steve Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, who is due to visit Brussels again on Thursday.\n\nMr Barnier earlier briefed EU commissioners at a cabinet meeting in Brussels on the proposals. G\u00fcnther Oettinger, Germany's EU commissioner, told reporters: \"Once again, we discussed the proposal from the British government, and basically, all colleagues agreed with Barnier: namely the proposal from the British government does not represent a satisfactory solution.\"\n\nLater on Thursday Mr Barnier told the European Parliament: \"Why are we not in a position to reach a deal yet? The British proposals have led to three serious concerns.\n\n\"What we're being asked for in reality is to accept a system that hasn't been properly developed, that hasn't been tested: there will be controls spread out across Ireland and it will largely be based on exemptions and derogations on technology that is yet to be developed. Changes to international law through the common transit convention but with none of the guarantees that should be set out in this protocol,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to have proper, rigorous checks all along the border of the single market. We need operational, real controls - credible controls. We're talking about the credibility of the single market here to consumers, companies, and third countries that we negotiate agreements with.\"\n\nWe're not really in a position where we're able to find an agreement Michel Barnier, EU chief Brexit negotiator\n\nThe second point raised by Mr Barnier was that the UK proposals are not \"legally operational\" \u2013 that the UK was in fact asking to come up with the answers to how to manage the border later in the transition period.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Even if it were to be implemented, every four years they could call this into question.\n\nSpeaking in the same debate, European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said: \"I will be less diplomatic than Michel Barnier. I think the proposal that Boris Johnson put forward exactly one week ago was not serious at all, dear colleagues.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It gives a veto to the DUP, it puts customs facilities not on the border but in all the other parts of the islands of Ireland.\"\n\nHe also questioned why some Labour MPs had hinted they would vote for the plan, stating that UK moves to rip up environmental, social and labour standards \"should be contrary to all the things Labour has defended in the past\".\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker had told French newspaper Les Echos overnight that the UK would \"collapse\" in the event of a no-deal.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission said in a statement after Wednesday's meeting that the \"EU remains constructive even when British emotions run high\" \u2013 an apparent reference to hostile briefings emanating from Downing Street earlier in the week.", "description": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has dismantled Boris Johnson's border proposals\u00a0point-by-point in a comprehensive speech to the European Parliament.
