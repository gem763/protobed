Says", "language": "en", "text": "Juul has long said that it did not deliberately target teenagers. In a statement, Matt David, a company spokesman, said, \u201cWe are reviewing the letters and will fully cooperate.\u201d\n\nThe high levels of nicotine in Juul products are of particular concern for their effects on the still-developing brains of a generation of teenagers and as a potential gateway drug that could reverse decades of a steep decline in smoking rates.\n\n[Here\u2019s what you should know about the lung illness linked to vaping.]\n\nResearch into the long-term effects of e-cigarettes is at an early stage, which is one of the reasons the F.D.A. is trying to restrict marketing assertions by Juul and other companies in the industry. The agency ordered the company to submit its plan to correct the issues outlined in the warning within 15 days.\n\nWhen public health officials publicly released a report of the first possible vaping-related death on Aug. 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an extensive warning against vaping: \u201cE-cigarette products should not be used by youth, young adults, pregnant women, as well as adults who do not currently use tobacco products. If you use e-cigarette products, monitor yourself for symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, chest pain) and promptly seek medical attention if you have concerns about your health.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, authorities have singled out for concern vaping devices and liquids that are \u201coff the street,\u201d or have been modified or used in a way that the manufacturer did not intend.\n\nJuul\u2019s rise has been meteoric, culturally and financially. It had virtually no sales in 2015, but by 2018 it had a valuation of $16 billion. That is less than half of its current estimated valuation of $38 billion, making the company one of the most recent successful growth stories in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhether the agency\u2019s action will dent its sales remains unclear. The F.D.A. warned that if Juul did not comply with laws governing vaping devices, it could impose civil penalties or an injunction, or seize the company\u2019s products .", "description": "The agency sent a warning letter to the company, saying it violated regulations by touting its vaping products as safer than traditional tobacco cigarettes.", "authors": ["Matt Richtel", "Sheila Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/science/09JUUL/09JUUL-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
