The Tokyo government is formulating counterproposals, including earlier start times, so that the races can be held in Tokyo.\n\nThe metropolitan assembly issued a statement Monday requesting that the IOC and the 2020 Olympics organizing committee explain how they came up with the Sapporo proposal, urging them to reach an agreement with the metropolitan government and relevant sporting associations before making their decision.\n\nTokyo now plans to submit the statement, signed by the chairman and vice chairman of the assembly, as well as various political parties, to the IOC and organizing committee.\n\nThe statement emphasized that the marathon and race walking events \"are a precious opportunity for a wide range of citizens to get involved, including as spectators or volunteers,\" and also cited a variety of issues, such as costs, accommodation availability and security, should the event be shifted to Sapporo.\n\nWhile having \"a standpoint which puts athletes first is extremely important,\" there is also \"a need for discussions based on a solid understanding of Tokyo's initiatives up to this point,\" the document stressed.\n\nThe planned change of venue will be discussed during a special session of the IOC commission starting Wednesday in Tokyo.\n\nCoates told reporters after his talks with Koike that the IOC Executive Board was \"the competent authority to take a decision such as this,\" and the decision \"has been taken.\"\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Residents of the capital are divided over whether to hold the 2020 Olympic Games marathon and race walking events in Sapporo, according to a survey released Monday by the Tokyo metropolitan government.
