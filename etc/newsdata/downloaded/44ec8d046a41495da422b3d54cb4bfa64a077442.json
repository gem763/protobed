A year earlier, she was honoured for conflict prevention by the Chirac Foundation in France and has been welcomed by Michelle Obama.\n\nBut Ismail came under greater scrutiny last year when she spoke in support of the Pashtun Protection Movement, which defends the rights of the Pashtun tribe in the north-west.\n\nQuoting witnesses, Ismail said the army crackdown on Pashtun militants near the border with Afghanistan had led to frequent disappearances and sexual assaults.\n\nMost women were silent on such issues due to stigma, she said, but when a boy told her security forces were barging into his home and harassing his mother, she went to investigate.\n\nPakistan: where the daily slaughter of women barely makes the news | Mohammed Hanif Read more\n\nIsmail said: \u201cDozens of women had come to tell us that the incident of sexual harassment was not unique. It is systematic. It had been happening for years.\u201d\n\nShe was detained briefly in 2018, but her fears mounted in February when she was taken into custody for two days after attempting to hold a news conference.\n\nIsmail said she was held in a cold, dirty room with a urine-soaked sheet on the ground. She said she was denied food and water, and other female inmates warned against talking to the \u201chigh-profile terrorist\u201d.\n\nIn May, police filed a complaint against Ismail under an anti-terrorism law after she spoke out about the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl.\n\nIsmail declined to discuss how she escaped Pakistan, saying she did not want to put others at risk. Her name was widely circulated to seek her arrest and airport authorities were told not to let her leave.\n\n\u201cThere were videos created online by military trolls which were clearly saying that the moment I\u2019m in custody they will teach me a lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cI spoke about the issue of rape \u2013 now they will \u2018teach me\u2019 what rape is.\u201d\n\nShe said security forces attacked her driver and a friend who was handcuffed, beaten and administered electric shocks for 14 hours in an attempt to extract information on her whereabouts.\n\nFor now, Ismail is living with her sister in New York. She said her initial fears of being sent back to Pakistan, a historical ally of the US, were eased after she held meetings in Washington at the state department and with staff of US lawmakers.\n\nBut she remains worried about her parents in Pakistan. Ismail said they had become isolated with security forces interrogating anyone who dares to even text them.\n\n\u201cI wanted to speak freely and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Ismail said. \u201cHowever, when it comes to the future of Pakistan, I do not see a prosperous Pakistan until the military establishment decides it needs to go back to its barracks.\u201d", "description": "Gulalai Ismail escapes after months in hiding and seeks political asylum", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Washington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8cc87935b078fcc3721a706d72125d8e2480038/0_206_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54251719d9d5b80619bbcd97946c7686", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
