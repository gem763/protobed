It did not provide further details.\n\nFrench officials have previously said that a U.S. withdrawal would force them to also leave, given they rely on U.S. logistical support.\n\nA regional diplomatic source told Reuters on Thursday that Paris was preparing to pull out its several hundred special forces. They are operating closely with Kurdish-led forces, who are now the target of Turkey\u2019s offensive in northern Syria. French aid workers are also in the zone.\n\nIn another headache for the Elysee, dozens of French Islamic State fighters and hundreds of French women and children are being held by Kurdish groups in areas close to the Turkish offensive.\n\nFrance fears they could escape amid the offensive, return home and carry out attacks or fall under the hands of the central Damascus government, which could use them as bargaining tools.\n\n\u201cThe absolute priority must be to stop the resurgence of Islamic State in the region,\u201d the presidency said, adding that the risk of \u201cIslamic State terrorists\u201d escaping was being taken fully into consideration.\n\nFrance has repeatedly said that foreign fighters should be judged and imprisoned where they had committed their crimes, dismissing any possibility of them being brought home. Analysts say that position is becoming increasingly untenable given the evolving situation.\n\nThe Elysee said additional measures were being taken to strengthen security on French territory.\n\n\u201cFrance will increase its diplomatic efforts ... to obtain an immediate end to the Turkish offensive,\u201d it said.", "description": "France said on Monday it was taking measures to ensure the safety of its military and civilian personnel in northeastern Syria as the United States begins to withdraw its forces from the area following a Turkish offensive against Kurdish militias.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
