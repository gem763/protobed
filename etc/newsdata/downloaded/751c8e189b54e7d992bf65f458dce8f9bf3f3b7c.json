The answers were encouraging \u2013 for the most part.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler \u2026 was referencing a July phone call in which President Donald Trump prodded his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. Three officials answered that it was not appropriate to ask a foreign leader for a political investigation. A deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, Adam Hickey, said he would not comment on the president\u2019s activities.\n\nIf the published witness list is correct, it means Department of Homeland Security Senior Cybersecurity Advisor Matthew Masterson, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Nikki Floris, and U.S. Election Assistance Commission Vice Chair Ben Hovland were all willing to say that an American president should not ask a foreign government to investigate a domestic rival.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s Adam Hickey, the deputy assistant attorney general in the National Security Division, balked. He could\u2019ve commented on the underlying principle, without commenting on Donald Trump\u2019s actions specifically, but the DOJ official chose not to.\n\nWhat amazes me about incidents like these is how easy the question should be to answer. Heck, even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) knows how to answer it properly.\n\nAs regular readers know, CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan recently asked Cruz whether it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to urge foreign countries to go after one of his domestic rivals. \u201cLook, of course not,\u201d the Texas Republican replied. \u201cElections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it\u2019s not the business of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections.\u201d\n\nCruz added, \u201cListen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections. That\u2019s true for Russia. That\u2019s true for Ukraine. That\u2019s true for China. That\u2019s true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not generally in the habit of singling out the junior senator from Texas as an example to follow, but there\u2019s no reason Republicans can\u2019t answer this simple, fundamental question the way Ted Cruz did. It should be especially easy for someone at the Justice Department to do so.\n\nAnd yet, here we are.\n\nAlas, a variety of GOP officials continue to struggle with this. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) recently had an embarrassing exchange with reporters who asked, \u201cDo you believe it\u2019s appropriate for the president of the United States to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival? Yes or no?\u201d The Colorado Republican refused to give a straight answer.\n\nA week later, after the senator and his aides had time to prepare a sensible response, another reporter asked Gardner to comment on the scandal, and the Republican lawmaker abruptly ended the interview.\n\nThere\u2019s no good reason for this to be so difficult.", "description": "Is it appropriate for an American president to ask a foreign government to investigate a domestic rival?
