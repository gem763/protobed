The scandal, which was uncovered almost a year later, has come to be seen as baseball\u2019s \u201closs of innocence,\u201d the cause of fans\u2019 diminished feelings for the game they once adored and a mortal blow to the nation\u2019s confidence as it entered the 1920s, a decade of disrespect for elders, contempt for institutions and worship of the fast life and the fast buck.\n\nAfter a puzzlingly inept performance by his White Sox in Game 1, the club\u2019s founder and owner, Charles Comiskey, heard rumors that the \u201csporting set\u201d had been looking for a big score and that maybe some of his players had agreed to throw the series. Some sportswriters and players, and many big-time gamblers, knew something was up, too, as the long odds that had favored the White Sox in late September dropped precipitously: Anyone wishing to place a bet on the Reds by opening of the series would have had to accept even money or slightly worse.\n\nComiskey considered blackballing the suspected wrongdoers, but he recognized that breaking up his team would be a financial disaster. He elected to fume silently through the 1920 season, even though some of his players continued to fix the occasional game. Finally, after the so-called Black Sox scandal of 1919 was revealed in late September 1920, he suspended seven of the players (the eighth, the first baseman and plot ringleader Chick Gandil, had already left the team). His decision arguably cost the team the 1920 pennant.\n\nThe \u201ceight men out\u201d included the stars Joe Jackson, whose lifetime batting average of .356 was second at that time only to that of Detroit\u2019s legendary Ty Cobb, and pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who had won 29 games in 1919 and 28 two years before. Both men confessed their role in the plot to Comiskey, and then to grand jurors, who indicted them for conspiracy to defraud.", "description": "The 1919 plan to fix the World Series is shrouded in myth.", "authors": ["John Thorn"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/09Thorn1/09Thorn1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
