For years, Turchynov said, he\u2019d been hacking unpublished press releases from business newswires and selling them, via Moscow-based middlemen, to stock traders for a cut of the sizable profits.\n\nOleksandr Ieremenko, one of the hackers at the club that night, had worked with Turchynov before and decided he wanted in on the scam. With his friend Vadym Iermolovych, he hacked Business Wire, stole Turchynov\u2019s inside access to the site, and pushed the main Moscovite ringleader, known by the screen name eggPLC, to bring them in on the scheme. The hostile takeover meant Turchynov was forced to split his business. Now, there were three hackers in on the game.\n\nNewswires like Business Wire are clearinghouses for corporate information, holding press releases, regulatory announcements, and other market-moving information under strict embargo before sending it out to the world. Over a period of at least five years, three US newswires were hacked using a variety of methods from SQL injections and phishing emails to data-stealing malware and illicitly acquired login credentials. Traders who were active on US stock exchanges drew up shopping lists of company press releases and told the hackers when to expect them to hit the newswires. The hackers would then upload the stolen press releases to foreign servers for the traders to access in exchange for 40 percent of their profits, paid to various offshore bank accounts. Through interviews with sources involved with both the scheme and the investigation, chat logs, and court documents, The Verge has traced the evolution of what law enforcement would later call one of the largest securities fraud cases in US history.\n\nThe case exemplifies the way insider trading has been quietly revolutionized by the internet. Traders no longer need someone inside a company to obtain inside information. Instead, they can turn to hackers, who can take their pick of security weaknesses: a large corporation or bank may have good in-house security, but the entities it works with \u2014 such as financial institutions, law firms, brokerages, smaller investment advisories, or, in this case, newswires \u2014 might not.\n\nAs one person involved in the press release scheme pointed out, it doesn\u2019t matter what level of security a company has, \u201cyou\u2019ve always got the human factor: that one employee who will click on the phishing email or is happy to exchange their password for money.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust about every organization that compiles financial data that could be useful for traders has, at some point, been hacked,\u201d says Scott Borg, director of the US Cyber Consequences Unit, a nonprofit research institute that does consulting for the US government. \u201cAll the bureaus of economic analysis from major countries in the world have almost certainly been hacked.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Borg says, these hacks fly below the radar. They tend to be \u201csophisticated and targeted,\u201d and companies often refrain from reporting them, whether to avoid liabilities and reputational damage or because they don\u2019t even know what information has been stolen.\n\nIn the last eight years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has added three new teams to enhance its cybercrime detection capabilities and pushed companies to bolster their own security and quickly disclose breaches. The measures have had some success, as evidenced by a recent case involving law firms infiltrated by three Chinese hackers, but it\u2019s a cat and mouse game. Even the SEC isn\u2019t safe: in 2016 the commission was hit. The attack was not made public until the following year, generating accusations of hypocrisy.\n\nThe international nature of trading hacks makes enforcement particularly difficult. Shortly before Turchynov was bragging about the scheme, the US Secret Service, whose mission includes protecting the country\u2019s financial infrastructure, started taking an interest in what he was up to.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2012 onward, the three newswires \u2014 Business Wire, PR Newswire, and Marketwired \u2014 were endlessly patching holes and uninstalling malware in an effort to block the hackers\u2019 access, court documents show. Askari Foy, a cybersecurity expert formerly with the SEC, explained that it would be standard practice for one of these firms to contact the FBI to launch a criminal investigation, which would give authorities access to their systems for forensic analysis.\n\nAfter authorities alerted PR Newswire to a potential breach, the wire hired the private cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg in March 2012 to investigate further. Turchynov\u2019s malware was detected and uninstalled, according to court documents. He sent a panicked message to the Moscovites on March 27th, presumably referring internal newswire emails he had access to:\n\nWhen you get back here write to me right away, there are several problems. The first and largest is that PR is fucked up. They detected the module and removed all our shit there. They took away that temporary server. I haven\u2019t gone on to the new one yet, I\u2019m waiting. This happened on the 13th [March]. The second problem: your guys were detected. They were trading with very big money and there was a lot of fuss about them, about how it\u2019s not the season and when it was the season they traded.\n\nBut by May 30th, 2012, thanks in part to their new co-worker Ieremenko, the hackers had regained access to PR Newswire and were back in business.\n\nThe US Secret Service decided to send an assistance request to Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services, according to Ukrainian agent Oleksiy Tkachenko and US court documents. Their Ukrainian counterparts set to work following Turchynov about his daily life.\n\nAccording to a peer who was also contacted by the Ukrainian agents, they noticed that Turchynov socialized with a group of 10 other men in their 20s, including his colleagues Ieremenko and Iermolovych, who had abundant cash and no discernible source of income. Turchynov is said to have owned a house in Koncha-Zaspa, Kiev\u2019s equivalent to Beverly Hills. On social media, he displayed an extravagant gold clock collection, a gun, a luxury car, and pictures of him and his friends in Kiev nightclubs.\n\nIn November 2012, the Ukrainians, accompanied by US Secret Service agents now working in tandem with the FBI, carried out raids on nine properties around Kiev tied to the hackers. They confiscated Ieremenko and Turchynov\u2019s laptops, uncovering hundreds of press releases as well as chat logs relating to the scheme. A few months later, US Secret Service Special Agent Alexander Parisella arrived in Ukraine to question Turchynov, Ieremenko, and others at interviews organized by Ukrainian intelligence agents, according to court documents.\n\nFrom there, the case went cold. Ukraine does not extradite its own citizens, so Special Agent Parisella could do little more than try to get the hackers to talk about the press releases and other stolen payment card data they had found.\n\nNone of the hackers were charged in Ukraine, either. Ukrainian law enforcement said they never received the required request from the US to do so, a fact confirmed by a US agent at trial. It seems Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services had something else in mind for Turchynov, the Americans\u2019 key suspect.\n\n\u201cBack then, he paid the mentiy [Russian slang for cops]. Well, not paid. He gave them his collection of clocks worth half a million. He handed over his house. He handed over his Bentley, and then they said, \u2018Ok now you are working for us or you\u2019ll go to America\u2019,\u201d said a person in close contact with Turchynov at the time.\n\nFrom US Special Agent Parisella\u2019s visit onward, Turchynov continued to hack press releases, but now at the behest of elements within Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services, Ukraine\u2019s Cyber Police Chief Serhii Demedyuk told The Verge. The intelligence agents began running a parallel operation to the Moscovite middlemen, using Turchynov\u2019s access and sourcing their own traders, according to Demedyuk.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what, in fact, happened, and that needs to be admitted,\u201d said Demedyuk of the way Ukrainian intelligence agents allegedly profited from illegal trades.\n\nUkraine\u2019s intelligence services did not respond to requests for comment about their involvement.\n\nThe origins of the trading hack are murky. In court, a government witness identified a man known only as \u201cValerie\u201d as the \u201cmain guy.\u201d Witnesses and documents also identified someone named Roman as his point of contact with the traders. Online, according to multiple sources who spoke to The Verge, the purported ringleader was known only by the screen name eggPLC.\n\nDemedyuk and others who spoke on the condition of anonymity believe eggPLC is a Moscow-based stock trader originally from St. Petersburg, who since at least 2008 had been hiring hackers to work for him. On a number of dark web forums, where exploits, stolen login data, and personal details are bought and sold, The Verge reviewed instances of eggPLC advertising for hackers to help him access brokerage accounts. According to a person connected to the scheme, he would then use the brokerages to drive share prices up and down while making trades from his own accounts. This variation of the old-school stock scam known as pump and dump was revived in the mid-2000s by traders using hackers to manipulate prices.\n\nBased on what Demedyuk and those with knowledge of the scheme say, it would have been around 2009 that eggPLC recruited Turchynov to hack the newswires. Turchynov would send the stolen press releases to eggPLC and two other Moscow-based middlemen, who would pass them on to traders; the hackers would take a 40 percent cut of profits, and the middlemen took 10 percent. From his inactive ICQ numbers, a messenger service once popular in Russian-language hacking circles, it appears that eggPLC was running a full-fledged business through the dark web. One number he advertised was his personal number; another bore the name \u201ceggPLC support.\u201d\n\nIn St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, and the US, the stolen press releases attracted growing groups of traders, some employed at investment companies and others working independently. Friends approached friends, and circles grew.\n\nTwo of the traders, the brothers Pavel and Arkadiy Dubovoy, come from one of Ukraine\u2019s most well-known and wealthiest evangelical Baptist families, several members of which got rich privatizing Ukrainian factories in the 1990s. Arkadiy, who owns an ice cream factory in Odesa, immigrated to the Atlanta suburbs in the mid-1990s, thanks to a law offering refugee status to persecuted religious minorities from the Soviet Union. Pavel studied for a while in the US near Arkadiy. But together with a large contingent of the Dubovoy family, they moved to Kiev when their cousin Oleksandr was elected to parliament in 2007.\n\nWhile living in Ukraine in November 2010, according to court documents, Pavel Dubovoy sent Arkadiy\u2019s partner in the construction business an email containing instructions on how to access the stolen press releases.\n\nAfter the Christmas holidays, Arkadiy and his business partner, Alexander Garkusha, traveled from their homes in Alpharetta, Georgia, to the Atlanta airport where they met a Philadelphia-based Slavic Baptist pastor and trader named Vitaly Korchevsky.\n\nAs a former Morgan Stanley portfolio manager and vice president, Korchevsky had a strong reputation for financial planning advice among the new immigrant community, many of whom arrived with little English and understanding of life in America. Korchevsky was a prominent religious figure in the US-based Slavic Baptist community as well and was often invited to preach around the US and the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Korchevsky would finish work at Morgan Stanley in New York and make the almost two-hour journey back to South Philadelphia, where he would spend the evening driving around the suburbs visiting Slavic Baptists he hoped to attract to his small evangelical Christian gatherings. He later organized a union of 28 Russian-speaking churches and spent much of his large income to establish his own church in Philadelphia. He also sponsored many of his own congregation to emigrate from the former Soviet Union, as he had done in the late 1980s. They would often live at his house until they found work and housing.\n\n\u201cHe was very religious... but when I met him, I saw in him a businessman as well. He is a man of ambitions. He is a man who loves himself and ambitions,\u201d said a Slavic Baptist leader who has known Korchevsky for three decades. \u201cHe loves being in a position of a leader... and being a persona that people look up to.\u201d\n\nArkadiy and Garkusha met Korchevsky to discuss the scheme at an airport restaurant while he had a layover in Atlanta. It was a tough sell at first. The financially astute pastor was unimpressed, saying that the printed releases they were showing him were publicly available. Arkadiy left the meeting thinking it was just another one of his younger brother\u2019s bad ideas. A second meeting was stymied by technical difficulties. It was only on the third attempt, when the group finally got proper access to the server to show Korchevsky, that the pastor declared the scheme was workable.\n\nArkadiy began opening brokerage accounts. Arkadiy\u2019s English is so limited he would ask others, like his son Igor, to write emails on his behalf, he said. He also claimed in court to have no knowledge of stocks and a limited ability to use computers. Consequently, he gave Korchevsky permission to trade with his money from his accounts and paid him about 10 percent of the profits. Korchevsky, who was setting up a Philadelphia fund at the time, secretly made trades from his own accounts, a move that would later lead to the group being cut off by the middlemen for not paying their full commission.\n\nArkadiy was also running his own side game. His brother Pavel had introduced him to another former Wall Street trader, Vladislav Khalupsky, who split his time between Odesa and Brooklyn. Arkadiy opened accounts for Khalupsky to trade with. He later testified that he wanted to see who was better: Pastor Korchevsky or Khalupsky. Arkadiy also sent his son Igor to learn how to trade at Khalupsky\u2019s Odesan firm.\n\nThe scheme continued to grow in this way, with friends, family, co-workers, and fellow congregants roping one more person into a seemingly foolproof way to get rich. Two managers at Arkadiy\u2019s Ukrainian firms opened accounts, and two of his relatives in Odesa joined as well. (The Dubovoy family is very large, and only five members have been implicated in the case.) A year later, Arkadiy\u2019s accountant and fellow churchgoer Leonid Momotok got involved. Momotok, who had some knowledge of the stock market, opened more accounts to trade with, including one under the name of his brother. The more unrelated the entities and accounts, the harder it is for the regulators to detect and investigate.\n\nFor someone like Korchevsky, a registered US investment adviser with over a decade of experience, the stolen press releases were easy money.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2011, a press release from Dendreon Pharmaceuticals was uploaded on PR Newswire at 3:34PM and published less than 30 minutes later at 4:01PM, just after the markets closed. The release announced the company\u2019s new drug would not meet its forecasted sales target. At 3:56PM, when it had yet to be published and four minutes before the markets closed, Korchevsky purchased 1,100 put options, a contract giving the ability to sell the stock at a specific price within a specific time period. The next day, Dendreon\u2019s stock fell 67 percent and Korchevsky sold his put options for a profit of more than $2.3 million. Phone records have Korchevsky calling Arkadiy\u2019s office twice before the release was published and twice again after he sold the put options.\n\nThere were also times when the traders lost money. Despite a positive release, internet company Verisign\u2019s stock price unexpectedly dropped on April 26th, 2013. Arkadiy\u2019s son Igor Dubovoy emailed Korchevsky: \u201cArkadiy asked me to sell all the stocks if you do not have Internet can you please let me know if I should do it or if you have the service to do it.\u201d Shortly after, Igor closed out the Dubovoy group\u2019s positions for a loss of $114,038. Igor then sent Korchevsky another email: \u201cI already sold everything and just saw your email not sure if i sold it the way you had it planned.\u201d Korchevsky responded to Igor: \u201cits ok ... not the last day ... it was strange anyway ... got the numbers right ... reaction mixed.\u201d\n\nIn Ukraine, Pavel, who held a joint account with his brother Arkadiy, was responsible for paying the hackers their commission. He did so through his British shell company, using account numbers provided by an unidentified individual, likely Roman, who was mentioned several times at the trial as being the Dubovoy\u2019s point of contact. In one of several emails from February 2012, confirming payments to Arkadiy, Pavel stated he had paid $95,000 into Turchynov\u2019s Estonian bank account next to which he wrote \u201cthe guys.\u201d It was disguised as a payment for building equipment from Arkadiy\u2019s property development company, a common vocation of Soviet Baptists who were often denied access to state-gifted accommodation. The email also included a note that $160,000 had been paid to \u201cVlad\u201d aka Khalupsky, the Ukrainian-US trader who provided investment advice. Pavel would also email wish lists of expected company announcements to Arkadiy in Georgia and to the hackers via the Moscow ringleaders.\n\nIt is not clear how Pavel first became acquainted with Roman, who introduced Pavel to the scheme and worked for its main ringleader, according to testimony. It is also not fully apparent what Pavel does for a living. His politician cousin Oleksandr described him in an interview with The Verge as a \u201ctechnical specialist\u201d and \u201cfreelancer\u201d who also dabbled in property development, though said he was unsure of his trading capabilities.\n\nReached over the phone in March, Pavel denied being involved in insider trading or in trading generally. \u201cI honestly had very little to do with it. My relatives were much more involved,\u201d said Pavel of the press release scheme and his indictment by the US authorities. \u201cI had absolutely nothing to do with it,\u201d he went on. \u201cI have never had any broker accounts or conducted any trades. I don\u2019t even know how it\u2019s done\u2026I don\u2019t know what is going on in the case\u2026I don\u2019t know why [they have connected me].\u201d\n\nPavel subsequently declined repeated requests to meet, and didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about the hacking scheme.\n\nIn November 2014, almost two years after Agent Parisella\u2019s visit to Kiev, the third hacker, 27-year-old Iermolovych arrived at a luxury resort on the sunny shores of Cancun, Mexico, on vacation from Ukraine\u2019s freezing winter. Just after midnight, as he sat relaxing in the hotel restaurant, a group of Mexican law enforcement officers approached, according to a source with knowledge of the event. The officers told him that he was not welcome in Mexico and that they were taking him to the airport. The Ukrainian consulate had agreed to fly him back to Ukraine, they said. Meanwhile, the police searched the room upstairs, waking his wife and confiscating his laptop. When Iermolovych arrived at the airport in darkness, he was hustled onto the back of a commercial passenger plane and told he would have one stop in Dallas, Texas.\n\nHowever, as the plane touched down in Dallas, the source said, the passengers in the front four rows stood up and announced they were US Secret Service agents. Iermolovych did not proceed to Ukraine. The Mexicans had handed him over to US law enforcement. There were no extradition proceedings.\n\nIermolovych was initially charged with selling data from over 300 stolen corporate payment databases based on information found on his laptop in the Kiev 2012 raids. Law enforcement then found evidence of press releases on the laptop the Mexican authorities confiscated. After being transferred to the Hudson County Correctional Facility in New Jersey, the US authorities presented Iermolovych with a choice of serving two to three years or 20, and encouraged him to accept a plea agreement.\n\nEven with one of the hackers in custody, uncovering the entire the network was difficult. Iermolovych denied knowing any of the traders and claimed to have only chatted with the Moscow ringleaders online, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Moreover, the traders would access and read the press releases on an offshore server, minimizing traces of evidence.\n\nExperts say getting caught for this type of insider trading often depends on the lengths a trader will go to to avoid detection. Identifying a trader who is using inside information is almost impossible if they keep changing where they\u2019re trading from, even with cooperation from multiple countries, according to Borg, the director of the US Cyber Consequences Unit. Traders can further cover their tracks by establishing credit ratings at brokerages anonymously through cryptocurrencies or shell companies that they then shut down.\n\nThe Dubovoy group was somewhat less careful. Since 2010, the SEC\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center has joined Wall Street\u2019s self-regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), in monitoring the markets for signs of insider trading. Their algorithms are designed to pick up on stock prices fluctuating before major corporate announcements, indicating that those buying or selling have insider knowledge, said Janet Austin, a professor at the University of New Brunswick and author of the book Insider Trading and Market Manipulation: Investigating and Prosecuting Across Borders. The SEC\u2019s Center for Risk and Quantitative Analytics then looks at the entity making the flagged trades to see if they can find links to the company, like a relative or a past employer. If they cannot find any immediate link, they store the data in case the entity does it again. The volume of trades to sort through still makes detection difficult.\n\nFINRA aided the SEC in its investigation of the press release case. Both declined to comment for this story. What likely happened, according to Austin, was that, armed with the knowledge that stolen press releases were being used on the markets, the regulators looked at logs of suspicious trades and gradually discovered that some of the entities were associated.\n\nThe Dubovoys used the same brokerage accounts repeatedly, and they owned some of them directly or through immediate family members with shared surnames. Their association could also be easily confirmed through the fact that they were part of the same church community.\n\nIn 2014, the middlemen discovered the Dubovoy group was trading from many more accounts than they were declaring. They started threatening Pavel, according to court testimony. Arkadiy made a trip to Ukraine in January 2015 where he even met Valerie, the \u201cmain guy.\u201d Roman, their middleman contact, made different proposals as to how the group could make good and regain access: paying $50,000 a day for continued access to the server, or $100,000 a week, plus a $300,000 deposit. (The sums were indicative of how valuable the releases had become on the black market.)\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out. Eventually, the group found a new way to get the releases through the husband of Arkadiy\u2019s cousin, Valery Pychnenko who was able to meet the middlemen through his own channels. Pychnenko would send the releases to himself using a nondescript email account, which Igor would access and then forward to Vitaly.\n\nBut just as the newswires did not always inform their clients that they were having security problems, the middlemen appear to have chosen not to tell the traders that one of their hackers was arrested.\n\nNine months after Iermolovych\u2019s arrest, in August 2015, FBI agents led pastor Vitaly Korchevsky, with graying slicked-backed hair, out of his upscale suburban home in Philadelphia. The same day, Arkadiy, Igor, Garkusha, and Momotok were also arrested at their homes in Georgia.\n\nKorchevsky was accused of making $17.5 million in illicit gains, Arkadiy over $11 million, and Igor $249,000. Momotok and Garkusha made approximately $1.3 million and $125,000, respectively.\n\nThe news shocked the US Slavic Baptist community and Korchevsky\u2019s fundamentalist congregation, in particular, many of whom refused to believe he was guilty. The persecution Baptists suffered at the hands of the Soviet Union has left many suspicious of the authorities and the media, according to Olena Panych, an academic on post-Soviet Baptists.\n\nHis supporters alleged that the case was a US government plot aimed at persecuting the Christian leader. Korchevsky\u2019s defense argued, and US prosecutors have admitted to the court, that they found no press releases on Korchevsky\u2019s computers or evidence that he was in contact with the hackers.\n\nKorchevsky was careful, according to witness testimony. He often traveled to Ukraine to trade and used computers that Arkadiy had paid for. He would also be careful to delete the evidence and leave whatever technical equipment he could behind in Kiev. An FBI forensic specialist testified that they were unable to reconstruct deleted attachments, which they believed were press releases. In the indictments, the prosecutors instead pointed to Korchevsky\u2019s trading patterns, which in many instances mirrored those of other defendants accused of trading on the releases, as well as presenting emails and chats between Korchevsky and other members of the Dubovoy group discussing trades.\n\nSeveral Slavic Baptist leaders told churchgoers not to discuss the issue publicly and to pray. After his arrest, his supporters created a Pray for Vitaly Korchevsky Facebook page and sometimes prayed outside the courthouse during his hearings.\n\n\u201cI ask you please not to rush to conclusions,\u201d said pastor Konstantin Likhovodov in Portland, Oregon, speaking a week after Korchevsky\u2019s arrest. \u201cHe is a god-fearing man. And it even surprises me brothers, that we would so quickly agree with non-believers to the detriment of what we know about our own brother\u2026 I am embarrassed to say that there are members of this church who have allowed themselves on the internet...to say he is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. I have a question: What right do you have to judge another? Who do you think you are?\u201d\n\nAfter initially pleading not guilty, Garkusha, followed by Momotok, Arkadiy, and Igor all plead guilty before the trial. They are currently awaiting sentencing. When a person in the Pray for Vitaly Korchevsky Facebook group posted about them pleading guilty in 2016, the admin responded:\n\nHow do you know these other guys didn\u2019t get paid off by the govt to lie to the judge? Watch, they will get off with a slap on the wrist, and a few million each. I think you underestimate the governments abilities to create a situation when they need one, and their ability to get whatever they want. I recommend you really search inside yourself and ask yourself who the real criminal is here.\n\nKorchevsky\u2019s church has suffered immensely because of the case. After the US government froze his funds, the congregation began pooling its resources to pay for his lawyers. Korchevsky allegedly used some of his trading proceeds to purchase nine properties in the Philadelphia suburbs, a strip mall, and a 9 percent stake in a Georgia apartment complex. At least five of the houses, according to those who know him, were purchased on behalf of new immigrant families who had yet to establish credit ratings: \u201cYes, it is true actually all of them\u2026I did not buy anything for myself,\u201d wrote Korchevsky via email when asked about some of the properties. Korchevsky did not respond to further questions about his role in the scheme.\n\n\u201cIt really shocked people because they did not think that he could do anything wrong because he had done so much good for them,\u201d said a Baptist leader who has known Korchevsky for three decades. \u201cHe is really heartbroken because everything that he built has been crushed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t admit the guilt, I almost positively think that it\u2019s church related. He has the image of a man who cannot do that. As long as people think he\u2019s innocent he can continue to be a star,\u201d said the Baptist leader, who believes Korchevsky is guilty.\n\nThe only stolen release the US was able to obtain before the arrests in 2015 was one that was screenshotted by Khalupsky on Viber, a mobile application that doesn\u2019t retain data. He emailed the release to his Yahoo account, which the government likely searched. Placed together with the emails and trading windows, the screenshot was a key piece of evidence against the Dubovoy group, the only traders to be criminally indicted. After the arrests, Igor gave the FBI access to an email account containing over 200 releases, which he said he had forwarded to Korchevsky.\n\nKhalupsky, the Wall Street trader who resided in Brooklyn and ran an Odesa trading firm, was detained hiding out in Odesa in February 2017. After placing him under nightly house arrest, Ukrainian authorities granted an American extradition request, as Khalupsky is a US citizen.\n\nThe group turned on itself over the course of the proceedings. Khalupsky, like Korchevsky, plead not guilty, claiming he had been mislead by the Dubovoys. Arkadiy, Igor, and Garkusha testified against them at the trial. In turn, Khalupsky\u2019s defense attorneys attacked their credibility by linking them to past cases involving a drug scheme stretching from Panama to Europe and money laundering in Latvia.\n\nA jury found Khalupsky and Korchevsky guilty on all counts on July 6th. Korchevsky\u2019s supporters were twice scolded by the judge for praying outside the courthouse during the trial. As the verdict was read, his family broke down in tears, according to Bloomberg. The pair has yet to be sentenced.\n\nFree on bond, after the verdict, Korchevsky addressed his Philadelphia congregation to thank them for their support. With a smile of a man vindicated, he said he would appeal the verdict:\n\nThe Lord showed with certainty that they could not present a single piece of evidence that I ever held any information. It doesn\u2019t exist. Of course a story was told that I destroyed the computer, though they found a 17-year-old computer in my house. But God knows and we can express it bravely before him: that there was nothing of the sort. Not a single computer or cell phone was ever destroyed.\n\nTwo related SEC civil cases were brought against traders at investment and trading companies in Moscow and Kiev as well as individuals in St. Petersburg. They have argued their innocence based on the lack of evidence that they possessed the unpublished releases or had contact with the hackers. Unlike in Korchevsky\u2019s case, where there were dozens of emails to US-based servers and one stolen release, the mainstay of evidence in the SEC civil cases is the trading patterns.\n\nIn dozens of instances, the traders and entities named in the civil case would trade within hours, sometimes minutes, of each other, and before a release became public. The traders\u2019 choice of stock would also follow the hackers\u2019 fluctuating access to the newswires.\n\nOne defendant in the civil case, David Amaryan, whose company Copperstone Capital won an award for best Russian hedge fund in January 2015, claimed that one of his employees devised an algorithm to pick up early trades occurring on the market and mimic them. The logic being that the early trades were made on the basis of someone else\u2019s insider information. After an uncomfortable round of questioning, during which prosecutors proved to the court that he knew other defendants in the case he had previously denied knowing, Amaryan and his three companies agreed to pay $10 million to the SEC. He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Similar settlements have been made by other Russian and Ukrainian defendants, including one of Ukraine\u2019s most prominent investment firms. In total, the SEC has recouped $53 million in ill-gotten gains from investment firms, traders, and brokerages.\n\nIermolovych, the hacker removed from Cancun, is the only defendant to be sentenced so far in the case, in May 2017. He received a 30-month prison sentence.\n\nIn all, the case would later be described by the FBI as the largest known computer hacking and securities fraud in the world. The combined total of profits made public by the SEC stands at over $100 million, but that represents only a fraction of the money authorities believe was made off the stolen press releases. Several of the people currently charged, including Pavel, have not had their profits established and therefore aren\u2019t included in the total. Furthermore, during pre-trial, a defense attorney referred to a sealed affidavit saying that the FBI has identified more than 100 individuals who traded on the hacked information. So far, the authorities have only initiated proceedings against 42 entities, including 20 individual traders.\n\nSafe from US hands under Ukrainian law, and likely safe from Ukrainian law because of his connections, Arkadiy\u2019s younger brother Pavel, the person who introduced the group to the releases, is the only one of the criminally charged traders still at large.\n\nPavel has amassed high-profile ties, especially after his and Arkadiy\u2019s cousin Oleksandr Dubovoy entered Ukrainian politics. The Dubovoy group associates with figures from the Kremlin\u2019s evangelist for healthy living to Russia\u2019s most decorated singer, who was personally congratulated by Putin on his 80th birthday during a party held at the Kremlin. One of their most significant connections is the former deacon of the Dubovoy\u2019s church in Kiev: Oleksandr Turchynov (no relation to the hacker Ivan Turchynov). Oleksandr Turchynov is the former head of intelligence services and one-time acting president, and he currently oversees the police, intelligence services, and army. That makes him one of the most powerful politicians in Ukraine.\n\nOleksandr Turchynov and the Dubovoys were known among congregants at Word of Life for their shared love of the number seven, says their now former pastor Volodymyr Kunets. Kunets says they chose the number because it signifies completeness in the Bible, the day God rested. Pavel and Oleksandr Dubovoy have cell numbers with at least four sevens, and Oleksandr Turchynov and Oleksandr Dubovoy have customized car license plates with four sevens, said Kunets. (There is no indication that Oleksandr Turchynov was associated with Pavel\u2019s trading scheme, and his representative denied the politician is acquainted with Pavel, but said he is close to Pavel\u2019s cousin Oleksandr Dubovoy.)\n\nPavel and Oleksandr Dubovoy fell out with their pastor Kunets after they, along with Oleksandr Turchynov, paid millions of dollars to help construct a new church for the Word of Life congregation, located next door to the original church. The trio then de facto took it over from an aggrieved Kunets in July 2017. He had been their pastor for over 10 years.\n\nSpeaking in general terms about the community and the case, Panych, the researcher studying post-Soviet Baptists, said that due to scarce finances, churchgoers have learned to accept politicians and wealthy parishioners, preferring to leave it up to God to judge their actions.\n\n\u201cYou understand, the church also needs rich people. They donate money. They build prayer houses. But where they get the money, it\u2019s not always clear,\u201d said Panych.\n\nKunets told The Verge that when news broke of the US case in August 2015, Pavel left for Belarus to stay with relatives, where he remained for around a year before returning under a different passport. Ukraine\u2019s police say that Pavel is living in Ukraine under a fake Russian passport. He seems to be living quite openly since returning. Just before Christmas in 2017, The Verge saw Pavel at a Sunday service, which, according to churchgoers, he has been attending regularly in the past year. He has also traveled abroad, checking in on Facebook in Tehran, Iran, a country where arrest by the waiting FBI is almost impossible.\n\nUkraine\u2019s police say they have questioned Pavel, yet their American colleagues have not handed over the necessary information to arrest him. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services say they have no information regarding Pavel.\n\nThe press release case received little attention from the Ukrainian media and the Ukrainian evangelical Baptist community, but Pavel cropped up in one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest corruption cases of 2017, which was featured in a BBC Panorama program. Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau accused Pavel of attempting to bribe one of their agents to shut down an investigation into his cousin\u2019s Odesan factory and Odesa\u2019s notorious mayor, who the BBC alleged is part of a mafia ring. According to leaked documents from Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general office, Pavel offered the agent $100,000 to lift a freeze on his cousin\u2019s bank account, an additional $200,000 to be paid once the freeze was lifted and a further $200,000 to close the case entirely.\n\nThe drama in Pavel\u2019s life has not stopped there. He was shot at three times in February, according to his cousin Oleksandr Dubovoy. The injuries, said Oleksandr, were sustained during a meeting in a cafe when Pavel attempted to rescue an unknown woman from being beaten by a group of men. Interviewed by phone from a hospital, Pavel said the conflict with Pastor Kunets over the church they had built together had been \u201cexhausted.\u201d He denied involvement in the press release case, though did not respond to further detailed questions.\n\nHis cousin Oleksandr Dubovoy explained, when asked, that the group did not see the scheme as a contradiction of their faith: \u201cAs much as I have read, listened and heard from his relatives and I know him well too, they, and he, in particular, don\u2019t see it as stealing something.\u201d Pavel was a tool or link who passed on an instrument and didn\u2019t know how it was going to be used, said Oleksandr.\n\nThe FBI declined to give an official comment about the press release case or the alleged involvement of the Ukranian intelligence services.\n\nThe hacker Turchynov has so far escaped consequences of the scheme collapsing as well. He went on to hack Ukraine\u2019s fiscal services database in 2016 for a different Ukrainian business group, according to Demedyuk, Ukraine\u2019s cyber police chief, and stole information and altered taxes on the group\u2019s behalf. When the police began investigating in January 2017, Turchynov fled through Ukraine\u2019s war-torn eastern territories to Russia, a country out of reach to the US and Ukrainian authorities.\n\nFor Ieremenko, the press release indictment signaled the beginning of a rocky new stage in his hacking career. When the US indictments were announced in August 2015, some \u201cnot very good people\u201d at Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services together with the hacker Turchynov, used Ieremenko\u2019s ignorance of Ukrainian extradition law to blackmail him, according to Demedyuk, who said the agents no longer work at the intelligene services. Ieremenko was told if he paid them, he would be safe from extradition, which, legally speaking, he was anyway. Turchynov, acting as the go-between, further toyed with Ieremenko by telling him the blackmail sum was twice as much. Ieremenko paid up. The pair fell out when Ieremenko discovered he had been duped.\n\nIeremenko\u2019s skills were subsequently sought out by Artemy Radchenko, a slickly dressed ambitious 23-year-old with wayward connections. In October 2015, two months after Ieremenko was indicted by the US for the press releases, they set up Benjamin Capital Group, a UK-registered investment bank in Ukraine\u2019s capital city. According to Ukraine\u2019s cyber police chief and a source with knowledge of the project, Benjamin Capital was set up to look like a legal trading and investment firm. Radchenko attracted investors who were paying for Ieremenko\u2019s proven technical abilities to hack inside information. They hired employees and rented servers and two floors of office space.\n\nOn employee forums, workers complained about the company\u2019s management and salary delays. In winter 2017, Ieremenko realized Radchenko had used all the investors\u2019 money as well as their operation\u2019s profits to buy himself apartments abroad and luxury cars, said Demedyuk.\n\nRadchenko continued to keep Ieremenko at the company under threat of violence. Before things began to fall apart, Ieremenko had been struck with the idea of hacking the SEC\u2019s EDGAR filing system and was having some success in his new project, according to Demedyuk and a source familiar with the attempts. EDGAR is used by every company trading on US stock exchanges to file financial reports, which are then published online. When Ieremenko finally decided to leave, Radchenko was enraged.\n\n\u201cRadchenko hired thugs to beat up or, I don\u2019t know, even kill Ieremenko. He has a vendetta. Because from what we know about Radchenko..he\u2019s very aggressive,\u201d said Demedyuk.\n\nIn addition to failing to pay his employees, Radchenko made the decisive mistake of not paying his own bodyguards. As the more mainstream business people had walked away from Benjamin Capital, they had been replaced by an unsavory crew, which included Ukrainian organized crime figures. The investors banded together with Radchenko\u2019s own bodyguards and beat him up \u201cpretty well,\u201d according to Demedyuk. They then went after Ieremenko. Instead of punishing Ieremenko, some of the investors made him an offer to move to Russia to work for them while paying off Radchenko\u2019s debt.\n\nBreaches of the SEC, including of its EDGAR filing system, occurred from October 2016 to April 2017, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source, though the SEC\u2019s statements issued in September mentioned only a 2016 intrusion without elaborating on a timeline. The SEC says it is still investigating what happened.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In the original article, The Verge reported that a Russian trader named Roman Vishnevsky was the \u201cRoman\u201d identified by witnesses and documents as the middle man in the scheme. However, the testifying witnesses never identified \u201cRoman Vishnevsky\u201d as the middle man, and Mr. Vishnevsky asserts that he is not the middle man. Before publication, The Verge attempted to reach Mr. Vishnevsky multiple times with no response. Therefore, despite its efforts, The Verge never had the opportunity to inform Mr. Vishnevsky that he would be named as the middle man in the scheme. Immediately after publication, Mr. Vishnevsky contacted The Verge and vehemently denied and refuted any involvement in the scheme, explaining that he was not, in fact, the \u201cRoman\u201d identified by witnesses and documents as the middle man in the scheme, and further that he was unaware of The Verge\u2019s efforts to contact him before publication. Accordingly, The Verge has removed all reference to Mr. Vishnevsky from the article.", "description": "For more than five years, hackers based in Ukraine infiltrated American business newswires, stole unpublished press releases, and passed them to stock traders to reap tremendous profits.", "authors": ["Isobel Koshiw", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDawTjWgr9x8Um8xabkXX-MIXV4=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12188489/VRG_ILLO_2726_001.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-22"}
