This is my Christmas, not yours. Stop bullying me.\"\n\nStunned Daniel hit back against the bully allegation, but then put his foot in it again by commenting on Sinead's appearance.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nSinead replied: \"I know what I look like. I see myself in the mirror every day. But if I can just get that tiny bit of strength I'm going to use it. And not be confined to bed by you.\"\n\nDaniel really crossed the line when he told dying Sinead she had co consideration for how hard it was for him.\n\n\"Sorry if my imminent death is making you sad,\" said Sinead, who accused her husband of being selfish.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhen Daniel asked if he should go, he did not expect seething Sinead's response.\n\nWith a stinging reply, she said: \"Too right I'm being serious. We don't need you. I don't need you. Go on, go. Don't bother coming back.\"\n\nAfter giving him a menacing look, Daniel stood up and walked out of the flat as the rest of the family remained in silence.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCorrie viewers took to Twitter after watching the explosive Christmas scenes.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Sinead is right Daniel, you should be making every moment special @itvcorrie not treating her like this\"\n\n\"Why did Daniel have to spoil Sinead\u2019s Christmas,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Sinead and Daniel are getting in one last argument.
