(AMS:PHIA) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nWhile Koninklijke Philips's 2.0% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 3.8% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Koninklijke Philips!\n\nENXTAM:PHIA Historical Dividend Yield, September 3rd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 54% of Koninklijke Philips's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Koninklijke Philips's cash payout ratio in the last year was 42%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's positive to see that Koninklijke Philips's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Koninklijke Philips's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Koninklijke Philips's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac0.70 in 2009, compared to \u20ac0.85 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.0% a year over that time.\n\nWhile the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is unappealing.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Koninklijke Philips has grown its earnings per share at 6.9% per annum over the past five years. The rate at which earnings have grown is quite decent, and by paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends, the company is striking a reasonable balance between reinvestment and returns to shareholders.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Koninklijke Philips N.V.
