Ad Policy\n\nIn his now-infamous July 25 telephone conversation with the President of Ukraine, Trump raised the issue of Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mail server and the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.\u201d Trump\u2019s words, as so often, are muddled, and the transcript has some frustrating ellipses. But the thrust of his comments clearly refer to a debunked conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike was owned by a Ukrainian (which is not true) and that the company, which did the forensic examination of the DNC\u2019s servers after the 2016 hacking, was hiding a server holding missing Hillary Clinton e-mails. These are ideas that are most charitably described as debunked.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for Trump to bring up conspiracy theories about the Clinton e-mail server during his rallies or on his tweets. \u201cWhen will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn\u2019t allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?\u201d Trump asked in a typical tweet on May 7, 2017.\n\nWe\u2019re used to thinking of this sort of conspiracy chatter as red meat that Trump throws to his base but doesn\u2019t necessarily believe himself. But in speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a private phone call, Trump wasn\u2019t trying to convince any potential voter or hold his coalition together. He seemed to be talking from genuine conviction, asking a fellow leader for a favor in proving that the conspiracy theory about CrowdStrike was true.

It\u2019s hard to explain Trump\u2019s behavior in any other terms. The Inquiry The Republican Party Is Going Down With Trump Joan Walsh Impeachment Is Winning John Nichols It\u2019s Time to Unite Around the Constitution John Nichols\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, University of Miami political scientist Joseph Uscinski said, \u201cPowerful people can\u2019t use conspiracy theories very well. They\u2019re tools of the weak to attack the powerful.\u201d But he added that \u201cTrump has built his entire machine on conspiracy theories.\u201d These words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cbuilt\u201d suggest that conspiracy theories are something Trump consciously creates but doesn\u2019t himself believe.\n\nThe idea that conspiracy theories are almost exclusive to marginalized groups (\u201cthe weak\u201d) has a venerable academic tradition. In American history, the classic formulation was found in Richard Hofstadter\u2019s influential 1964 essay \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics.\u201d The essay was animated by Hofstadter\u2019s characteristic hostility towards populism and imbued with his conviction that wisdom resided in the consensus built by centrist elites. Current Issue View our current issue\n\nEven in Hofstadter\u2019s own lifetime, there was ample reason to doubt the view that conspiracy theories were the property of the fringes. After all, conspiracy theories had flourished in high politics, with Joseph McCarthy dominating the Republican Party in the early 1950s and shaping figures like Richard Nixon, who made red-baiting a staple of political discourse. On the Democratic side, Lyndon Johnson was hardly a marginal figure, yet he also believed in conspiracy theories, holding to the absurd view that the anti-war movement of the 1960s was directed by foreign powers.\n\nThe elite-conspiracy theories of the Cold War era had drastic consequences\u2014leading to not just McCarthyism, but also American military invention in Vietnam (which was in part motivated in the nonsensical idea that the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese were mere puppets of Moscow and Beijing). The domestic spying of the era, notably the COINTELPRO program that targeted domestic radicals from 1956 to 1971, was also fueled by elite paranoia. Contra Hofstadter, the paranoid style is a vice of the elite as well as the masses. And it\u2019s much more dangerous when held by the powerful.\n\nWith Trump, we have the biggest conspiracy theorist in the White House since Lyndon Johnson and Nixon. Like those earlier presidents, Trump is using the power of his office to vindicate his fears and smear his enemies.\n\nNor is Trump alone in his administration in believing in conspiracy theories\u2014or, at the very least, acting as if he does. One of the revelations of the unfolding impeachment saga is that Trump has corralled leading members of his administration, most notably Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr, in his global quest to prove that the American intelligence community and its allies entrapped Trump in the Russiagate scandal.\n\nAs with many conspiracy theories, there\u2019s a smidgen of truth to Trump\u2019s fantastical scenario. It\u2019s true that members of the intelligence community and the permanent security bureaucracy don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s heterodox foreign policy views\u2014and have been trying to hamstring him. Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear documents this clash, which he describes as an \u201cadministrative coup.\u201d\n\nBut this \u201cadministrative coup\u201d is a far cry from Trump\u2019s \u201cDeep State\u201d fantasies, which rest on many provably false claims (such as the idea that CrowdStrike is a Ukrainian company). It is plausible enough that many White House officials and civil servants routinely try to undermine Trump\u2019s personal orders. What isn\u2019t plausible is the idea that the entire narrative created in the Mueller report is a fabrication designed by spies to destroy Trump.\n\nEven the announcement of impeachment proceedings hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from wanting to use his position to prove the \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracy is true. The Daily Beast reports that last week William Barr and US Attorney John Durham of Connecticut traveled to Italy to track down one of the threads of this conspiracy. According to the news site, \u201cBarr and Durham were especially interested in what the Italian secret service knew about Joseph Mifsud, the erstwhile professor from Malta who had allegedly promised then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign aide George Papadopoulos he could deliver Russian \u2018dirt\u2019 on Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s behavior is extremely odd. As Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute tweeted, \u201cI don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but a lot of weird aspects of this seem consistent with Barr having gone full tinfoil hat. As in: The AG personally globetrotting to play Nancy Drew would make more sense if he\u2019s decided his own subordinates are Deep State agents.\u201d Sanchez added, \u201cIt\u2019s stuff you\u2019d look at if you suspect the [intelligence community\u2019s] entire analysis of Russian intervention is an elaborate fabrication. Or at any rate, it\u2019s stuff you\u2019d look at if you\u2019re dutifully trying to build a case for an audience that believes that.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, its immaterial whether Barr believes in what he\u2019s doing. His actions are what counts, and he\u2019s acting as if the conspiracy theories are true.\n\nTrump and his inner circle have fallen into quicksand: The more they try to prove that \u201cthe Deep State\u201d has framed Trump, the more their violations of rules and norms make impeachment necessary.
