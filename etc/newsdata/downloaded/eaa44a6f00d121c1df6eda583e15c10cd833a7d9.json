(AP) - Jason Hughes kicked three field goals and Evan Gray put the finishing touches on New Hampshire\u2019s 23-6 victory over Duquesne with a 72-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run on Saturday.\n\nThe Wildcats came within 58 seconds of notching their first shutout of the season, but Daniel Parr connected with Kareem Coles Jr. for a 12-yard TD to provide the final margin of victory.\n\nHughes started the scoring for the Wildcats (2-2) when he capped an eight-play, 42-yard drive with a 45-yard field goal at the 11:16 mark of the first quarter. Dylan Laube\u2019s 6-yard TD run with 15 seconds left in the quarter put New Hampshire up 10-0.\n\nHughes added a 39-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 38-yarder in the third to put the Wildcats up 16-0.\n\nNew Hampshire put the game out of reach when Pop Lacey picked off a Parr pass at the Wildcats\u2019 43-yard line. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Lacey pushed the ball back 15 yards, but Gray broke loose for a TD on the next play.\n\nBrosmer completed 17 of 31 passes for 202 yards, while Gray finished with 99 yards on 10 carries.\n\nParr was 14-of-32 passing for 183 yards and two interceptions.\n\nNew Hampshire had 433 yards of offense and held the Dukes (2-2) to 233, including just 50 yards on 23 carries on the ground.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jason Hughes kicked three field goals and Evan Gray put the finishing touches on New Hampshire's 23-6 victory over Duquesne with a 72-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
