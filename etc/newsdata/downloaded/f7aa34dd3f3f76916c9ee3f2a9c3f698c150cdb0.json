The European council president, Donald Tusk, held intensive discussions over the weekend and ambassadors for the EU27 meet this morning.\n\nThe government will for the third time bring on a vote today seeking an early election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, coupled with more time to scrutinise the withdrawal bill. MPs are expected to reject this. But over the weekend, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party offered to back a general election on 9 December \u2013 leaving many EU officials convinced the UK will soon go to the polls. No 10 has let it be known it will look at the proposal if Labour does not support the government\u2019s own timetable for the Brexit bill and an election. Labour is insisting on a no-deal Brexit being ruled out before it backs going to the polls. The draft EU paper suggests a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is off the table.

Backed into a dead-end tunnel, Baghdadi apparently detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three children who were with him. Donald Trump adopted bloodthirsty-sounding language in describing how Baghdadi met his end on Saturday night.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kayla Mueller, who died at the hands of Isis.

The incumbent, Mauricio Macri, conceded defeat on Sunday night, telling supporters at his headquarters that he had called Fern\u00e1ndez to congratulate him and invited him for a breakfast chat on Monday at the Pink Presidential Palace. A large crowd of supporters burst into a roar outside the Frente de Todos (Everybody\u2019s Front) party bunker in the Chacarita neighbourhood of the capital city of Buenos Aires at 9pm when preliminary official results gave the victory to Fern\u00e1ndez. With almost 70% of the vote counted, Fern\u00e1ndez, who is no relation of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, recorded a 47% victory against Macri\u2019s 41%.\n\nGender pay gap widens with age \u2013 The gender pay gap is at its most extreme for women in their 50s, new research has revealed. Women\u2019s average salaries at that age are 28% \u2013 or \u00a312,509 \u2013 lower than men\u2019s. The number of women working in their 50s and 60s has risen by 75% from 2.7 million in 1999 to 4.8 million today. ONS data shows the gender pay gap between age 18 and 21 is 18%, falling to 13% for those in their 20s, rising again to 16% for those in their 30s, and reaching 25% for women and men in their 40s. \u201cMore and more women are working in their 50s and 60s \u2013 and workplace culture needs to catch up to this shift,\u201d said Claire Turner from the Centre for Ageing Better. \u201cMaking all jobs flexible by default would help many of those with caring responsibilities stay in work, and stop them losing out on pay and progression.\u201d\n\nDemocrat quits after \u2018revenge porn\u2019 \u2013 The rising Democratic star Katie Hill has resigned from Congress after a sexualised smear campaign blamed on the husband she is divorcing. It included naked photographs that were leaked and published by rightwing outlets such as the Daily Mail. Hill was accused of an affair with a staff member, which was denied by both parties. She admitted to a separate relationship with a different staff member on her congressional campaign. In her resignation statement, Hill called the publication of the photographs illegal and said she was \u201ccurrently pursuing all legal options\u201d. Supporters say she is a victim of \u201crevenge porn\u201d, which is a crime in most of the US. Hill said: \u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. I know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d\n\nNo place to stay \u2013 Britannia Hotels has been rated the worst hotel chain in the UK for the seventh year in a row, with guests repeatedly describing its rooms as \u201cfilthy\u201d and complaining about mouldy bathrooms and peeling paintwork.

Wetherspoon Hotels was rated best for the first time, sharing the top spot with Premier Inn, Britain\u2019s biggest hotel chain, which has come first for the last four years.
