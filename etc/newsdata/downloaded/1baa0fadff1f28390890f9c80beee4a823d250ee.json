Mirae prevailed in a process that began early this year and attracted widespread interest from private-equity funds and government-run funds, these people said.\n\nThe two sides were on the verge of a deal last month, but a more formal agreement was held up when Anbang discovered the fraudulent deed transactions while performing a routine title search, according to people familiar with the matter. The search indicated that ownership of at least four California hotels had been transferred to limited liability companies.\n\nOne deed showed a transfer of ownership for Anbang\u2019s Montage Laguna Beach hotel, a luxury coastal resort in Southern California, to a company known as Andy Bang LLC, according to California property records. San Francisco\u2019s Westin St. Francis, the Loews Santa Monica and the Four Seasons Silicon Valley in East Palo Alto were also transferred to limited liability companies, though no sales prices were recorded, according to property records. Deeds for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Half Moon Bay and in Laguna Niguel were also faked, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nThese fraudulent transfers occurred without Anbang\u2019s knowledge or approval, say people familiar with the matter.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nScientists discover new evidence of the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs.\n\nInside Kevin Durant\u2019s new headspace.", "description": "A Chinese insurer has agreed to sell a luxury hotel portfolio for more than $5.8 billion, overcoming an unusual stumbling block: A California individual...", "authors": ["Craig Karmin", "Konrad Putzier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR048_westin_ZG_20190910173351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
