Their screams were awful, we don\u2019t know what happened to them.\u201d\n\nA helicopter was due to be mobilised this morning to help in the search for the missing mum and son, believed to be aged around 70 and 40.\n\nRegional Civil Protection chief Sergio Delgado confirmed: \u201cAuthorities are searching for two people believed to have been swept away in floods who were in a prefabricated bungalow as well as a person who has disappeared in the Arenys de Mar area.\u201d", "description": "A mum and her son are feared to have died after their home was swept away in the village of Vilaverd near the east coast city of Tarragona", "authors": ["Natalia Penza"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703469.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Vilaverd_17746JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
