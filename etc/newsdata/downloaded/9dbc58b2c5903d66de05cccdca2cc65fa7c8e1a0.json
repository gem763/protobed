He was charged Aug. 30 in Washington and accused of starting his scheme in about February 2017.\n\nMohammed, who has lived in the District and Northern Virginia, \u201cused his position as a branch manager at Wells Fargo to ingratiate himself with elderly bank customers by providing them with personal assistance in their banking matters,\u201d he admitted in plea papers.\n\nMohammed had cashier\u2019s checks made payable to Navy Federal Credit Union, where he and his wife had opened a personal account in 2014, he admitted. Court filings stated that the checking and savings accounts were exclusively used by Mohammed.\n\nPlea papers did not detail what the money was used for but said Mohammed spent or used virtually all of it.\n\nBefore the scheme, according to court filings, Mohammed had only $193.96 in the credit union account. Thereafter, almost all its savings deposits were fraudulently obtained, he admitted. Yet at the end of the nearly two-year, half-million-dollar fraud, he was left with $3,233.37 in March, according to plea papers.\n\nAmong his expenditures, Mohammed acknowledged that in November 2018, he withdrew money from ATMs or bought goods and services exceeding $5,000, including an $886 Amtrak ticket. That same month, Mohammed deposited $100,000 into his Navy Federal account and used $32,450.51 to pay for American Express charges, plea papers said.\n\nHe faces up to 10 years in prison after admitting to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of engaging in monetary transactions, according to plea papers.\n\nIn a plea deal, Mohammed and U.S. prosecutors in the District agreed that after accepting responsibility, he faces a recommended sentence of 41 to 51 months and a fine of up to $150,000 under federal guidelines, and will pay $509,849.95 in restitution.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of Washington set sentencing for Jan. 8.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland woman convicted in Ponzi scheme in which prosecutors said she claimed to use voodoo, prayer rituals to ward off investigators\n\nVA official steered 88 disabled veterans to sham job training in $2 million fraud-bribery scheme\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The manager got older customers to sign blank withdrawal slips after winning their trust to personally handle transactions.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
