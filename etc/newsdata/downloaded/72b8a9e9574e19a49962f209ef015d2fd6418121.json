And I asked that all the ushers from our wedding walk her coffin to her grave.\u201d\n\nSaima was killed by encephalitis \u2013 a condition that causes inflammation of the brain and claims 6,000 victims a year in the UK.\n\n\u201cOn the day of her funeral I told Saima I would make her proud,\u201d says Michael.\n\n\u201cAnd if one good thing can come out of this horrendous situation, it\u2019s to raise awareness and help other families.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Real Life/flixnpix.co.uk)\n\nHe and Saima met through dating website Plenty of Fish in September 2015.\n\nThey spoke for three months online before meeting in person.\n\nUp to then, Michael had been wary of forming close relationships, scarred in childhood by a family tragedy.\n\nWhen he was 12 his mum Jane, 37, and brother Ben, nine, were killed in a car crash on a holiday in South Africa.\n\nMichael and his dad Adam were in the car but survived.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I was unsure about letting someone into my life.\n\n\u201cI was scared to lose another person,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as soon as I saw Saima I fell in love.\u201d\n\nThey quickly became inseparable \u2013 and a year later Michael proposed to nursery manager Saima.\n\n\u201cIt may have seemed quick, but I had no doubt I\u2019d found my soulmate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSaima was my best friend. We loved travelling, going out, seeing our circle of friends \u2013 building our life together.\u201d\n\nThey married at a converted textile mill in Manchester in August 2018 in front of 175 guests \u2013 Saima wearing the beautiful white gown she had picked out with the help of her mum and sisters.\n\n\u201cI bawled my eyes out when I saw her in her dress. She looked beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got married under a canopy made from my mum\u2019s wedding dress.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\nAfter a honeymoon in Mauritius, they quickly settled into a blissful married life \u2013 but in early December, Saima began to complain of flu-like symptoms. She saw her GP who advised her to rest and take paracetamol.\n\n\u201cAll she said was she felt miserable and run down,\u201d says Michael.\n\nSaima felt well enough to go into the nursery next day \u2013 but then Michael, who now works in his family\u2019s clothing business, got a call from the nursery.\n\n\u201cI raced over. Saima hardly recognised me. She struggled to walk. I had to carry her to the car.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to A&E, she had seizures. Then her eyes rolled back and she stopped responding. I fell to my knees, crying in the hospital.\u201d\n\nDoctors placed Saima in an induced coma to run tests.\n\nA scan revealed her brain was swollen by encephalitis, a condition caused by either infection or the immune system attacking it.\n\nSymptoms include headaches, neck stiffness, drowsiness, confusion, altered personality, hallucinations and memory loss.\n\nFor four days, doctors at Manchester\u2019s Stepping Hill Hospital fought to save her.\n\nMichael says: \u201cThe medical team took advice from encephalitis specialists, but they told us Saima\u2019s brain and many of her organs weren\u2019t functioning.\n\n\u201cHer heart was only beating because she was on a machine. If they turned it off, she\u2019d have little chance.\n\n\u201cI prayed to God, \u2018If she survives but has no quality of life, please take her.\u2019\n\nI knew she would have hated being in a vegetative state.\u201d\n\nWhen doctors could find no heartbeat, Michael and Saima\u2019s family agreed the machine should be turned off.\n\n\u201cI gave her a kiss and told her I loved her and that I\u2019d make her proud,\u201d he says.\n\nIn keeping with the couple\u2019s Jewish faith, Saima was buried the next day on December 18 \u2013 16 weeks after they wed.\n\nMany of the guests who had been at the wedding were at Saima\u2019s funeral as she was buried in her wedding dress in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.\n\nMichael, of Cheadle, says: \u201cMy godfather has asked if there was anything I wanted in the service. I said Saima had wanted to wear her dress again. I fetched it from the wardrobe and handed it to him.\n\n\u201cIn my funeral speech I said how much I loved her and how I had lost my soulmate.\u201d\n\nNext April, Michael will take on a three-day, 200-mile cycling challenge from his Manchester wedding venue to London\u2019s Buckingham Palace in a bid to raise \u00a325,000 for the Encephalitis Society, hoping more research will lead to better treatment and a better chance of survival.\n\nHe will be joined by about 30 other riders, many of whom knew Saima.\n\n\u201cEven those who survive encephalitis can be left with horrible side effects,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so dangerous. More research will mean people like Saima don\u2019t just disappear.\n\n\u201cI decided to end up at Buckingham Palace because I wanted somewhere fit for a queen. That\u2019s what Saima was to me.\u201d\n\nFor more information on encephalitis, click here .
