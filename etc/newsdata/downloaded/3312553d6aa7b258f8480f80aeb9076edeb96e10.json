(Jeff Gross/Getty Images)\n\nIf Tim Tebow really thinks college athletes should not receive compensation for their on-field services, if he thinks they should play purely for love of the game and that money would ruin college sports, ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas has a way for Tebow to perform a trial run for that system.\n\n\u201cTim could choose to work for free at ESPN, if he wants to,\u201d Bilas told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I should work for free. An individual choice does not justify the policy.\u201d\n\nTebow, an ESPN college football analyst and the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner, argued Friday that athletes\u2019 pursuit of compensation diminished college sports. Speaking on \u201cFirst Take,\u201d Tebow, 32, said paying student athletes would turn the NCAA \u201cinto the NFL where who has the most money, that\u2019s where you go.\u201d\n\nWhen he played at Florida, Tebow said, he didn\u2019t want any money for the time he devoted to football, nor did he want any cut of the profits the athletic department reaped by using his name and likeness. He said he was motivated to play college football because of his family connections to Florida and the pride he took from representing the institution.\n\n\u201cI knew going to Florida, my dream school, where I wanted to go, the passion for it, and if I could support my team, support my college, support my university, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re changing it from us, from we, from my university, from being an alumni where I care, which makes college football and college sports special, to then, okay, it\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s not about we, it\u2019s just about me. And yes, I know we live in a selfish culture where it\u2019s all about us, but we\u2019re just adding and piling on to that where it changes what\u2019s special about college football.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why people are more passionate about college sports than they are the NFL. That\u2019s why the stadiums are bigger in college than they are in the NFL, because it\u2019s about your team. It\u2019s about your university. It\u2019s about where my family wanted to go. It\u2019s about where my grandfather had a dream of seeing Florida win an SEC championship, and you\u2019re taking that away so that young kids can earn a dollar, and that\u2019s just not where I feel like college football needs to go.\u201d\n\n.@TimTebow passionately expresses his thoughts on the California Senate passing a bill allowing student-athletes to have endorsements. pic.twitter.com/W5uBW7ePNm \u2014 First Take (@FirstTake) September 13, 2019\n\nTebow was weighing in on Fair Pay to Play Act, a bill that this week passed the California state legislature that would allow college athletes in that state to make money of their names and likenesses and maintain NCAA eligibility. The NCAA has called the proposal \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d arguing states lack the jurisdiction to grant student athletes these rights.\n\nBilas, a practicing attorney, doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s immoral for college athletes to be told they\u2019re worth nothing when they\u2019re not worth nothing. They\u2019re worth billions,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2026 This train is rolling down the tracks toward compensation and the NCAA\u2019s response is, \u2018Let\u2019s lash the players to the tracks and tell lawmakers they\u2019ll be hurting the student athletes.' That\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nThe bill awaits Calif. Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s (D) signature. The legislation, once ratified, is set to take effect in 2023 and would set up a fierce court battle between the NCAA and the state of California, home to some of college sports\u2019 most iconic brands.\n\nTebow said he felt qualified to talk about the issue because of the commercial success his No. 15 jersey had while he attended Florida, where he won two BCS national championships and two Southeastern Conference titles.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at the University of Florida, my jersey was one of the top-selling jerseys around the world,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cIt was like Kobe, LeBron and I was right behind them, and I didn\u2019t make a dollar from it, but nor did I want to because I knew going into college what it was all about.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a valuable perspective, Bilas said he thought when he saw Tebow\u2019s segment. Bilas likened it to professional athletes, such as Tom Brady, who choose to accept less money in their contracts so their teams have more capital to sign other great players.\n\nBut that\u2019s a choice, and college athletes don\u2019t have one. Instead, Bilas said, the NCAA insists individual players don\u2019t hold any market value and therefore don\u2019t deserve compensation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an outright lie, and they know it,\u201d said Bilas, a frequent NCAA critic.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Tim Tebow or the last walk-on on the roster,\u201d he added. \u201cLet each make the decision that\u2019s best for them. If getting no compensation is really the best approach, let it stand on its own in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Texas-LSU air-conditioning tiff now involves HVAC investigations and spreadsheets\n\n2-0 Maryland was throttled by Temple last year, but the Terps say everything\u2019s changed\n\nGeorgia fans organize last-minute \u2018pink-out\u2019 to honor Arkansas State coach\u2019s late wife\n\nVirginia is surging, FSU is reeling entering ACC matchup turned upside-down", "description": "The two ESPN personalities have far different takes on the prospect of college athletes making money of their names and likenesses while maintaining NCAA eligibility.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "September At Am", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9TdoIMN1cLzse2aaKUI0vcLGaw8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D62N7GNM4RGSZAELIK2TLQKNJQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
