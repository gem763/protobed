The first will enter service in 2021.\n\nAs well as its online shopping and delivery operations, Amazon operates vast data centres and cloud computing services.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, data centres were responsible for about 1% of the world's energy use in 2018. And demand for cloud computing is expected to increase.\n\nImage copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon has pledged to use more electric vehicles\n\nMr Bezos said 40% of the energy Amazon used was currently from renewable sources but this would rise to 100% by 2030.\n\nAmazon will also invest $100m (\u00a380m) to restore forests and wetlands.\n\nThe company will also measure and report greenhouse gas emissions regularly.\n\n\"We want to use our scope and our scale to lead the way,\" said Mr Bezos in a press statement.\n\nIn June 2017, the Trump administration said the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\n\nBut Amazon said it would meet the targets set out in the agreement 10 years \"ahead of schedule\".\n\nIn July, thousands of Amazon workers staged protests about pay and working conditions at the online retail giant.\n\nThe disruption was timed to coincide with Prime Day, when Amazon offers discounts and promotions.", "description": "The chief executive says Amazon will buy thousands of electric vehicles and become carbon neutral by 2040.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E251/production/_108873975_mediaitem108873971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
