Dan Crenshaw dismissed as \u201cfairy tales and socialist utopias.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Democrats want to tackle climate change, they should work with Republicans on serious solutions that can become law,\u201d said Rep. Greg Walden, Oregon Republican.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans drove home the point Wednesday by posting a list of seven bills \u2014 one for each hour of CNN\u2019s \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall \u2014 described as \u201ccommonsense, bipartisan solutions to tackle climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegrettably, a seven-hour, televised parade of the most radical ideas from 2020 Democrats is taking priority over serious policy to continue emissions reductions, boost clean energy, and protect America\u2019s economy and workers,\u201d said the committee minority.\n\nIncluded were bills to promote carbon-capture innovation; reduce wildfire risk through aggressive forest management; fuel advanced nuclear technology development; improve government energy efficiency, and reduce diesel emissions.\n\n\u201cHey, here are some bipartisan solutions that clean up the environment, promote innovation, don\u2019t ruin the economy, AND are based in reality!\u201d tweeted Mr. Crenshaw. \u201cOr we can believe in fairy tales and socialist utopias by banning nuclear, cleaner natural gas, plastic straws and cows.\u201d\n\nClimate activists have responded by accusing Republicans of promoting \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201csolutions\u201d as a smokescreen to appease voters and undermine the economic and energy overhaul sought by progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat.\n\nThose bent on bringing down the fossil-fuel industry are also less than thrilled with the GOP push for technologies such as carbon capture, which removes and stores carbon emissions, while efficiency measures are seen as insufficiently ambitious.\n\n\u201cWe keep hearing this buzzword: innovation. It\u2019s basically code for, \u2018Let\u2019s let the fossil-fuel industry and other carbon-intensive industries figure this out. Government shouldn\u2019t get involved,\u2019 \u201d Jesse Bragg, media director for Corporate Accountability, told Pacific Standard. \u201cInnovation, in that sense, is the status quo.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s nuclear. Although Democrats have long described human-caused climate change as an \u201cexistential threat,\u201d the party is deeply divided on nuclear power, despite its ability to provide low-cost, abundant, carbon-free energy.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, came out at Wednesday\u2019s town hall against nuclear energy after proposing a $3 trillion climate plan that calls for 100% zero-emissions electricity generation by 2035.\n\n\u201cThe problem is it\u2019s got a lot of risks associated with it, particularly the risks associated with the spent fuel rods,\u201d said Ms. Warren, adding, \u201cIn my administration, we are not going to build any new nuclear power plants, and we are going to start weaning ourselves off nuclear energy.\u201d\n\nBanning Nuclear Increases Carbon Emissions\n\n\n\nThe front runner with \u201cthe plan\u201d has no idea how emissions actually work.\n\n\n\nIf you want proof that banning nuclear doesn\u2019t work just look at Germany & Japan. Nuclear is banned and emissions went up.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t put these people in power. https://t.co/di8DItic5C \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) September 5, 2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Winner-take-all\u2019 philosophy\n\nIn the House, Democrats have been accused of grandstanding by holding dozens of climate hearings with little legislative follow-through. The party\u2019s biggest climate victory this year was the passage of H.R. 9, a resolution to stop President Trump from exiting the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nRep. Rob Bishop, Utah Republican and ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said hearings have focused on \u201cfluff,\u201d although that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, given that \u201cthe more time they spend on going through this fluff, the less time they have to do damage.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said the House leadership is wasting opportunities to \u201cactually directly solve problems with the atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we keep mentioning are: Why aren\u2019t we talking about forest fire mitigation, which destroys the atmosphere and the air?\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we talking about carbon sequestration, that can be done with grazing, that can improve the air and actually solve some of these problems? Why aren\u2019t we talking about regulatory permitting?\u201d\n\nHouse Natural Resources Committee chairman Raul Grijalva and Rep. Jared Huffman, California Democrat, said Republicans seeking solutions need to \u201cstand up to their denialist colleagues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would love to work on a broadly bipartisan response to the climate crisis,\u201d they said in a July 28 op-ed for Business Insider. \u201cBut that depends on whether climate deniers and the fossil-fuel industry continue to call the shots for congressional Republicans.\u201d\n\nFor Rep. John Curtis, Utah Republican, the denial runs both ways. Democrats have decried Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to withdraw from the Paris accord, but the agreement sets lower emissions targets for China, the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter.\n\n\u201cThere are people who would claim that Republicans deny science,\u201d Mr. Curtis said. \u201cI say you\u2019re denying science if you\u2019re not willing to look at the impact on the whole world, and are simply looking at the impact on the United States.\u201d\n\nAs mayor of Provo, Utah, he spearheaded clean-air efforts aimed at reducing vehicle traffic, at one point riding his bike to work for 100 days over the course of a year.\n\nIn Congress, however, Mr. Curtis, who replaced Rep. Jason Chaffetz in November 2017, said he has become frustrated with the \u201call or nothing, unrealistic approach to addressing climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if, \u2018Our way is right, and unless you agree with us 100%, get out of the way,\u2019\u201d Mr. Curtis said. \u201cUnless you can support the Green New Deal, you don\u2019t care about the environment. That\u2019s a winner-take-all philosophy.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
