She had suffered multiple slash and stab wounds to her face, throat, and chest.\n\n(Image: CPS)\n\nBut when police and paramedics arrived on the scene, Farrell was nowhere to be found.\n\nIn the hours that followed the killing he was tracked down to the flat of a friend on nearby Mansel Street, and armed officers moved in to arrest him.\n\nAfter a stand-off at the address - which had seen Farrell standing in the kitchen of the flat holding a knife to his throat - the suspect was arrested.\n\nOfficers also seized a bag of bloody clothing at the address which Farrell had previously worn before showering and changing.\n\nPolice were concerned the defendant was under the influence of substances, and he was later taken to Morriston Hospital. It was there he wrote his chilling confession.\n\nHe subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter - but denied murder.\n\n(Image: CPS)\n\nDuring his trial at Swansea Crown Court, he told the jury the the \"flashbacks\" made him want to try to write everything down to make sense of what happened on April 23.\n\nHe wrote that on the day of the \"murder\" he had had been arguing with Miss Lodwig and that she would not let matters rest.\n\nHe wrote: \"Next thing I had her tied up and told her I'd had enough and I was going to kill her. I did by repeatedly stabbing her in the face and throat.\"\n\nThe writing of the confession was captured on a body-worn camera on one of the South Wales Police officers who was guarding him.\n\n(Image: CPS)\n\nThe court heard how forensic evidence from Farrell's flat supported the version of events as set out in the confession.\n\nMiss Lodwig had suffered multiple slash and stab wounds to her face and neck, there was a blood-stained kitchen knife by the bed, blood splatter on the walls, and blood and enzymes from saliva from the victim on two dressing gown belts found nearby.\n\nThe trial heard evidence from expert witness Claire Morse who said: \"In my opinion the nature and distribution of blood staining indicated Miss Lodwig was assaulted whilst on the bed, where there was at least one blow in her wet blood. She had laid in the bed for some time after she started to bleed.\"\n\nThe trial also heard from pathologist Stephen Leadbeater who told the court that among the injuries suffered by the the victim were stab wounds to the neck which cut major arteries, and stab wounds to the chest which penetrated her lungs.\n\nAsked by his barrister in court why he had written the document in hospital, Farrell described it as a \"release\".\n\nHe said: \"I was confused\u2026 needed to get things down\u2026 I needed to work it out... I was horrified. Shocked. I just didn't understand it\u2026 I couldn't understand it\u2026 that I had killed someone. It doesn't go away\u2026 I knew that girl.\"\n\nFarrell was convicted of murdering Sammy-Lee Lodwig, and of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his neighbour Christopher Maher in an attack the previous week.\n\nHe will be sentenced on Friday, November 1.", "description": "Jason Shaun Farrell wrote how he \"tied up\" 22-year-old Sammy-Lee Lodwig before \"repeatedly stabbing her in the face and throat\"", "authors": ["Jason Evans", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Cps"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20760920.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jason-Shaun-Farrell-Sammy-Lee-Lodwig.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
