(Matthew Barakat/AP)\n\nShahin Indorewala had a job working with children with autism, but she wanted to gain more experience in marketing. So she applied to Fast Trak Management, a small Falls Church company that bills itself as \u201cthe number 1 marketing firm in the Northern Virginia Area.\u201d\n\nNow, Indorewala is suing the company, claiming that she was discriminated against because of her religion when she asked to use break time to pray.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on Tuesday, Indorewala claimed she was \u201chumiliated\u201d by Fast Trak\u2019s chief executive mocking her Muslim beliefs.\n\nThe chief executive, Ramses Gavilondo, disputes her version of events, saying Indorewala decided she did not want the job.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the lawsuit on Indorewala\u2019s behalf, held a brief news conference outside Fast Trak\u2019s office on Wednesday, where CAIR labeled Fast Trak \u201ca company that disregarded federal law and chose not to hire her because of her faith.\u201d\n\nIn a video of the news conference, Indorewala said that her first interview went well, and she was asked to return for a second interview. At that interview, Indorewala said, an assistant manager at Fast Trak told her that the company offers a long lunch break. Indorewala asked if she could take a shorter lunch break, so she could take two five-minute breaks during the workday to pray.\n\n\u201cShe promptly ended the interview. She said, \u2018That\u2019s not going to work. We have fixed hours here,\u2019 \u201d Indorewala said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the assistant manager then allegedly walked with Indorewala to Gavilondo and said that the job\u2019s hours wouldn\u2019t work for Indorewala. Indorewala said she then explained to Gavilondo that she prays five times a day. Indorewala says that at that point, Gavilondo pointed to her headscarf and made mocking comments about religion.\n\n\u201cAm I really being made fun of for my religion in public in what\u2019s supposed to be a professional workplace? \u2026 Clearly I was being discriminated against because of my religion,\u201d Indorewala said at the news conference. \u201cThat was it. I just kind of quietly left the office. I didn\u2019t want to create a scene or anything, but I was pretty hurt and pretty embarrassed.\u201d\n\nReached by phone Thursday, Gavilondo initially ended the call abruptly. In a second call, he said that he didn\u2019t reject Indorewala\u2019s application. Instead, he said, she was the one who decided she did not want the job.\n\n\u201cSomeone came for an interview. They didn\u2019t want to work here. \u2026 It\u2019s like me going to a store to buy Kit Kats, and then I don\u2019t want to eat the Kit Kats,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he recalled that Indorewala brought up her Muslim faith, but he did not specifically recall her request for five-minute prayer breaks during the day. And he said he had not made fun of her hijab: \u201cI\u2019m not a fashion expert. People can wear whatever they want.\u201d", "description": "The company\u2019s chief executive disputes the job applicant\u2019s version of events.", "authors": ["Julie Zauzmer", "Reporter Covering Religion", "Faith", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ua2y0pGwnOhVAbzEXk0C-VlJL_8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VHKRXXG72YI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
