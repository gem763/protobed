It cited as evidence the fact basketball player LeBron James has faced criticism for defending his business interests with the communist regime in Beijing.\n\nInternational observers, basketball fans, and lawmakers alike panned James\u2019 statements this week that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey should have \u201cwaited a week\u201d to defend the peaceful pro-democracy protesters of Hong Kong because James was in China at the time and Morey\u2019s comments personally inconvenienced him. James contended that freedom of speech had \u201cnegative\u201d consequences, echoing the pages of the Global Times.\n\nFollowing James\u2019 comments, the Times and similar Communist Party media outlets changed the tenor of their NBA coverage completely, from justifying Chinese communists celebrating the September 11 jihadist attacks to spite Morey to encouraging Chinese people to support NBA players because they had no control over Morey\u2019s remarks.\n\nMorey sparked a global controversy by publishing an image on Twitter reading, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The NBA forced him to delete the tweet and apologize profusely; it also issued its own kowtowing apology to the Communist Party.\n\nFacing extreme backlash from disgusted fans at home, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver later attempted to claim that Morey was \u201csupported in his freedom of speech,\u201d but did not clarify by who. Morey has not made any public comments since his apology for posting a statement in defense of freedom and human rights.\n\nJames has faced no professional repercussions for defending communist China and has lost no endorsement deals. He has also faced no legal consequences for his remarks, as the United States fully protects its citizens\u2019 rights to express themselves politically.\n\nDespite this, the Global Times declared American freedom of speech \u201cfake\u201d because other Americans objected to James\u2019 remarks. Americans \u201chumiliated\u201d James, the newspaper claimed, a response that \u201cimpressed Chinese society deeply.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Freedom of speech\u2019 in the U.S. is indeed fake,\u201d the propaganda outlet declared. \u201cIt must be based on political correctness. In other words, as Morey\u2019s support for Hong Kong protests is in line with US political correctness, it should be categorized as \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 which must be strongly defended. But James\u2019 criticism of Morey, which is not politically correct enough, has nothing to do with freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times provided no evidence of any individual in America declaring that James did not have the right to state his opinion.\n\nIn the same article, the Times attacked America for allowing its citizens free speech, lamenting that America\u2019s \u201csystem\u201d does not censor opinions online like China\u2019s does.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s difficulties come mainly from the internet opinion, but there is no lack of institutional forces to manage them in Chinese society,\u201d the newspaper \u2013 one of the few legal media outlets in the country, as it is paid for and controlled by the Communist Party \u2013 said. \u201cHowever, the trouble in the US lies more in its system. The internet, mainstream media outlets, and political figures such as members of Congress have joined hands to crack down on buffers like James who tried to mitigate the NBA row.\u201d\n\nIn a separate article, the Global Times also used its usual trick of claiming that Chinese \u201cnetizens\u201d had supported James\u2019 comments and were outraged that anyone would criticize them, not noting in this article what it did in the last: Beijing heavily regulates online opinion and no comments that Communist Party dictator Xi Jinping personally disagrees with are allowed to remain online. Nonetheless, the Times applauded the \u201crestraint\u201d of the Chinese people and claimed it was America that \u201chas zero tolerance for different opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames\u2019 move was just an expression of his views, which should be respected, never satirized or treated violently, [a government-approved] user argued,\u201d the Times said, adding \u201cfreedom from satire\u201d to its definition of free speech.\n\nHu Xijin, head propagandist at the Global Times, teased this line of attack on Twitter Wednesday, receiving a barrage of mockery and insults for asking, \u201cdoes LeBron James have the freedom to express disagreement with Morey?\u201d\n\nDaryl Morey supported Hong Kong protesters. It is freedom of speech. I get it. But also in the US, does Lebron James have the freedom to express disagreement with Morey? \u2014 Hu Xijin \u80e1\u9521\u8fdb (@HuXijin_GT) October 16, 2019\n\nAs a tool of the Communist Party, Hu is one of the few Chinese citizens allowed to use Twitter.\n\nMillions of people in Hong Kong, legally protected from falling under Chinese communist rule, have taken the streets since June demanding the Communist Party stop attempting to usurp the power of its government. As authorities have responded with extreme violence, protesters are now also demanding that police be held accountable for brutalizing the protesters and that their peers, prisoners of conscience, be freed.\n\nMorey expressed support for their movement.\n\nJames, returning from lucrative exhibition matches in China this week, weighed in after the Global Times\u2019s Hu had announced that he had ordered his writers to back off from the NBA, which now feared losing too much money from outraged American fans and having that profit loss trickle down to China. James called Morey \u201cuneducated\u201d and said his remarks were the \u201cnegative\u201d consequences of freedom of speech. Attempting to clarify on Twitter after near-unanimous condemnation, James added that he would not discuss the \u201csubstance\u201d of the Hong Kong protests, but that he only meant to criticize Morey for not taking James\u2019 personal business dealings in China into account.\n\nOn Tuesday, James offered what he claimed were his final remarks on the matter, derisively stating that the Hong Kong protests were not his \u201cproblem.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The Chinese state propaganda outlet\u00a0Global Times declared that free speech does not exist in the United States in a column on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Mark-J.-Terrill-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
