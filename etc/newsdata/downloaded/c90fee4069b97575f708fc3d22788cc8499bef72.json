The statement ends with the words: \u201cAccordingly the court will make an order declaring that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect.\u201d There is no mention of any delay until next Tuesday when the supreme court is due to hear further appeals in the case.\n\nBrexit: Labour and SNP demand recall of parliament after Scottish court rules prorogation unlawful - live news Read more\n\nCan MPs return to the Commons and resume their debates?\n\nJolyon Maugham QC, the barrister who masterminded the Edinburgh court challenge, argued that since the government had not applied to delay the effect of the ruling, parliament is no longer suspended. If the government wants to delay prorogation further, he maintained, ministers would have to make a fresh application at a UK court immediately to resuspend parliamentary sittings.\n\nThe government and many Westminster politicians, however, appear to be taking the line that MPs should wait until the supreme court has had its final say after next week. A spokeswoman for the Speaker, John Bercow, and the House of Commons authorities said it would be up to the prime minister to recall parliament during prorogation. \u201cAny decision to accelerate the meeting of parliament during prorogation is a matter for the government,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen does the case return to court?\n\nIf the government does not feel the need to make an emergency application to suspend the effect of the Scottish court ruling, the next scheduled judgment is due to be delivered in Belfast on Thursday when high court judges will give their ruling on a similar challenge to the prime minister\u2019s proroguing of parliament. Whichever way that goes, there could then be a further and speedy appeal to Northern Ireland\u2019s appeal court, which could involve judges sitting at the weekend.\n\nWhen does the supreme court intervene?\n\nThe UK\u2019s highest court has arranged a three-day hearing starting on 17 September to join together all three appeals from the legal challenges in Edinburgh, Belfast and London. The Northern Ireland claims are partially being fought on separate grounds, relying on the 1998 Northern Ireland Act, which gave legal effect to the Good Friday agreement, which formally ended the Troubles.", "description": "Fresh legal battles erupt after judges say Johnson suspended parliament unlawfully", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "Robert Saunders", "Peter Bone", "Margaret Beckett", "Michael Chessum", "Meg Russell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee5f477546fa28bf13d200d6e5ea0ae2c80db55/0_45_4139_2484/master/4139.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f48ae682cd33d55b32d4e5e46d9a8f67", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
