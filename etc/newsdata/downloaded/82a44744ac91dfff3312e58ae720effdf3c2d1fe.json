Kind of\u2026 (Picture: John Lewis & Partners/PA Wire)\n\nWe\u2019re delighted and horrified to inform you that Christmas is, at the time of writing, just 75 days away.\n\nWhile we\u2019re only just dusting off our winter coats and drowning our sorrows over the dark nights with pumpkin lattes, we\u2019re prepared to start engaging with one of the best parts of the festive season.\n\nThat\u2019s right: Christmas adverts. Specifically, John Lewis\u2019 festive slot, which pretty much marks the beginning of the annual countdown to Christmas.\n\nSo, when can we expect to see it, who might be starring in it and where can you watch previous ones?\n\nTake a seat.\n\nWhen is the John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 out?\n\nThe release date hasn\u2019t been officially announced but if our sleuthing is anything to go by, we could expect to see it in the next month.\n\nLast year\u2019s advert featured Elton John (Picture: John Lewis & Partners/PA Wire)\n\nThe Monty the Penguin advert (2014) and Man on the Moon (2015) adverts both dropped on 6 November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2016 (Buster the Boxer) and 2017 (Moz the Monster) adverts both dropped four days later on 10 November.\n\nHowever, last year\u2019s advert, The Boy and the Piano, featuring Elton John, dropped a bit of a spanner in the works, as it was released on 15 November.\n\nIf this year\u2019s advert follows a similar schedule, we can expect to see it between 6 \u2013 15 November, which by all accounts feels very soon.\n\nWe still hold a special place in our hearts for Monty (Picture: John Lewis)\n\nWho is rumoured to be in this year\u2019s John Lewis Christmas advert?\n\nJohn Lewis haven\u2019t yet confirmed who will be in this year\u2019s advert, or what the heart-warming message will be.\n\nUntil 2018, the adverts often featured lower tempo covers of existing songs sung by artists including Ellie Goulding, Lily Allen, Aurora and Tom Odell.\n\nLast year\u2019s advert also bucked this trend featuring an original performance from Elton John.\n\nSpeculation has already started on Twitter, with Lewis Capaldi and Ed Sheeran featuring in some of the gossip surrounding who could be the star of the ad this year.\n\nHowever, most of the comments have been on the humorous side with users joking about Brexit and Baby Shark making an appearance:\n\nIf I was making the John Lewis Christmas ad, I'd do a family torn apart by Brexit patching it up \u2013 a Christmas miracle! \u2013 to the sound of Blinded By Your Grace Pt 2 by Stormzy.\n\nWhich is why I don't get to make John Lewis Christmas ads. \u2014 Alice Beverton-Podcast (@alice) August 1, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Capaldi doing a slowed-down, whispered Too Shy by Kajagoogoo as two shy reindeer meet and fall in love, then one of them falls off a roof \u2014 Lauren Turner (@thisislaurent) August 1, 2019\n\nTruthfully, no-one knows which in our opinion, makes it all the more exciting!\n\nPrevious John Lewis Christmas adverts 2018 \u2013 The Boy and the Piano 2017 \u2013 Moz the Monster 2016 \u2013 Buster the Boxer 2015 \u2013 Man on the Moon 2014 \u2013 Monty the Penguin https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2019/10/11/5651675537574219291/1024x576_MP4_5651675537574219291.mp4 2013 \u2013 The Bear and the Hare https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2019/10/11/222950286777430979/1024x576_MP4_222950286777430979.mp4 2012 \u2013 The Journey https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2019/10/11/4442649465155636750/1024x576_MP4_4442649465155636750.mp4 2011 \u2013 The Long Wait https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2019/10/11/764969771632444413/1024x576_MP4_764969771632444413.mp4\n\nMORE: Disney launches new line of Christmas baubles including Captain Marvel and the Up house\n\nMORE: Lindt is launching a milk chocolate Lindor with white chocolate centre for Christmas", "description": "The most anticipated advert of the year is nearly here!", "authors": ["Anna Paul"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sei_39946069-8986_1570805126.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
