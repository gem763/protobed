Freedom of expression is a cornerstone, if not the cornerstone, of liberal democracy. Who could be opposed to that?\n\nThe problem is that Facebook doesn\u2019t offer free speech; it offers free amplification. No one would much care about anything you posted to Facebook, no matter how false or hateful, if people had to navigate to your particular page to read your rantings, as in the very early days of the site.\n\nBut what people actually read on Facebook is what\u2019s in their News Feed \u2026 and its contents, in turn, are determined not by giving everyone an equal voice, and not by a strict chronological timeline. What you read on Facebook is determined entirely by Facebook\u2019s algorithm, which elides much \u2014 censors much, if you wrongly think the News Feed is free speech \u2014 and amplifies little.\n\nWhat is amplified? Two forms of content. For native content, the algorithm optimizes for engagement. This in turn means people spend more time on Facebook, and therefore more time in the company of that other form of content which is amplified: paid advertising.\n\nOf course this isn\u2019t absolute. As Zuckerberg notes in his speech, Facebook works to stop things like hoaxes and medical misinformation from going viral, even if they\u2019re otherwise anointed by the algorithm. But he has specifically decided that Facebook will not attempt to stop paid political misinformation from going viral.\n\nI personally disagree with this decision, but I think it\u2019s something about which reasonable people can disagree. However I find it deeply disingenuous to claim that this is somehow about defending free speech. If someone were to try to place a blatantly false political ad on any platform or network, would anyone seriously consider a decision not to run that ad an attack on free speech? Of course not. And they shouldn\u2019t take the converse argument seriously either.\n\nThe larger issue, though, is that Facebook seems to think that if an algorithm is content-agnostic, it is therefore fair. When Zuckerberg talks about giving people a voice, he really means giving those people selected by Facebook\u2019s algorithm a voice. When he says \u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world \u2014 a Fifth Estate,\u201d what he actually means is that Facebook\u2019s algorithm is itself that Fifth Estate.\n\nThe belief is apparently that any human judgement based on content beyond the absolute minimum required by law and implied by the social contract \u2014 i.e. filtering out hate speech, abuses, or dangerous medical misinformation, all of which he stresses in his speech \u2014 is dangerous and wrong, and that this goes for both native content and paid advertising. According to this belief, Facebook\u2019s algorithm, so long as it is content-agnostic, is definitionally fair.\n\nAnd that belief is just flat-out wrong. As we\u2019ve all seen, \u201coptimizing for engagement\u201d all too often means optimizing for outrage, for polarization, for disingenuous misinformation. True, it doesn\u2019t mean favoring any side of any given issue; but it does mean favoring the extremes, the conspiracy theorists, the histrionic diatribes on all sides. It means fomenting mistrust, suspicion, and conflict everywhere. We\u2019ve all seen it. We\u2019ve all lived it.\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision to accept political ads regardless of content is essentially a logical extension of how their algorithm optimizes for engagement. It speaks to their belief that as long as they don\u2019t pass judgement based on content, their ongoing, ceaseless editing of what people see and don\u2019t see \u2014 and please call it censorship if you think this is any way about freedom of speech \u2014 is therefore fair and just. This belief was defensible ten or even five years ago. It is not defensible today.\n\nBut it is also not going to change. Facebook\u2019s original sin is not political ads; it is optimizing for engagement so that their users see more ads of all kinds. That\u2019s what needs to change for Facebook to become a positive force in the world \u2026 and it\u2019s also what never will, because that engagement is the fundamental engine of their business model.", "description": "This week Mark Zuckerberg gave a speech in which he extolled \u201cgiving everyone a voice\u201d and fighting \u201cto uphold a wide a definition of freedom of expression as possible.\u201d That sounds great, of course!
