(AP) - Miami will start N\u2019Kosi Perry at quarterback Friday night against No. 20 Virginia.\n\nPerry is taking over for Jarren Williams, the starter for Miami\u2019s first five games this season. Williams is dealing with what the Hurricanes (2-3, 0-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) are calling an \u201cupper-extremity injury\u201d believed to be his shoulder, based on the way he was favoring it on the sideline during last weekend\u2019s loss to Virginia Tech.\n\nWilliams threw three interceptions in seven attempts in that game, the first three interceptions of his Miami career. Perry replaced him and completed 28 of 47 passes for 422 yards and four touchdowns. Perry\u2019s yardage total tied for the 10th-best single-game performance in Miami history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Miami will start N'Kosi Perry at quarterback Friday night against No. 20 Virginia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/virginia_tech_miami_football_84514_c0-84-2015-1258_s1770x1032.jpg?a5cb0a948dee27eb1d5f0d6fd972d436892427bd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
