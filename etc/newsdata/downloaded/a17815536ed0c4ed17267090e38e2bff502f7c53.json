Pascal Pich has walked the line between addiction and passion, for years Pascal spent 40-hours-a-week cycling, swimming and running.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI always say you feel alive, it seems funny, but exercising on a bike, on foot, it feels like living:\u201d\n\nPascal lived for sport he is a four-time ultra-triathlon world champion.\n\nAn ultra-triathlon must involve 3.86 kilometres of swimming, 180 kilometers on a bike and a full 42.2 kilometer marathon: \u201cI would wake a midnight and swim until 4am, then I took the train to work. I came home and ate, then went out on my bike for a three or four hour ride. Then I would run for two hours. Then the day was over and then it would start again at midnight.\u201d\n\nDuring sporting activity, the brain is stimulated and releases endorphins they provide a feeling of well-being and euphoria, but when exercise is intense and repeated the brain releases the hormone dopamine, which activates addiction.\n\nFrancis Chaouloff is a neurobiologist:\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re floating, you lose track of time, have no other worries, you\u2019re in a trance, one can imagine that for some individuals, this chase for the trance is constant.\u201d\n\nPascal had to slow down to keep his family together, but the former world champion is back for a new challenge an ultra-triathlon across five continents in just one-year.", "description": "Sport practiced to the extreme has the potential to turn into an unhealthy obsession.
