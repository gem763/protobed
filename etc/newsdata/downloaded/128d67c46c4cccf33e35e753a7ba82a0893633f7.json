The accounts associated with the unnamed presidential campaign, which Reuters identified as the Trump campaign, were not successfully compromised.\n\nThe Trump campaign told The Hill they had \u201cno indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\u201d\n\nTom Kellermann, who served on a presidential cybersecurity commission during the Obama administration, said campaigns should ensure \u201cmodern cybersecurity technologies\u201d are being used to insulate endpoints, and that \u201cwebsites and mobile apps should be tested for vulnerabilities and hardened accordingly.\u201d\n\nBut even if campaigns take those steps, Kellermann said, rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran could lead to attacks on other aspects of campaigns and elections.\n\n\u201cIran has dramatically increased their capability sets, and the number of attacks against the U.S. over the last year,\u201d said Kellerman, who\u2019s now chief cybersecurity officer for the firm Carbon Black, adding that Iran\u2019s cyber \u201ccapabilities have been dramatically improved thanks to transfers from Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIranians come in third place of the axis of evil in cyber, they don\u2019t have as many hackers as the Chinese and Russians do, but they have a handful of very elite crews who have benefited dramatically from Russian tech transfer,\u201d Kellermann said. \u201cThey are contenders, and they are to be respected.\u201d\n\nIran has been counted among the major nations posing cyber threats to the U.S. for several years, alongside China, Russia and North Korea.\n\nIn the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment published earlier this year by now-former Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats wrote that Iran \u201ccontinues to present a cyber espionage and attack threat,\u201d and that Iranian actors were specifically \u201ctargeting US Government officials, government organizations, and companies to gain intelligence and position themselves for future cyber operations.\u201d\n\nSen.

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) ahead of the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe attacks came amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, after the U.S. blamed Iran for striking two Saudi Arabian oil facilities last month.\n\nThey also followed a U.S. Cyber Command cyberattack against Iran in June that disabled Tehran\u2019s ability to target oil tankers, which occurred in response to Iran shooting down an American drone and attacks on American tankers.\n\nChristopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told The Hill on Monday that CISA is \u201caware of the report from Microsoft about Iranian actors targeting U.S. accounts and we are working with the company to assess and mitigate impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe encourage all Americans to be vigilant and on guard against this and other cyber threats -- scrutinize emails, reset passwords routinely, maintain up-to-date antivirus and operating system patches, and enable multi-factor authentication,\u201d Krebs said.\n\nMark Orlando, the chief technology officer of Cyber Protection Solutions at Raytheon Intelligence, encouraged similar techniques to rebuff cyberattacks from Iranians and other sources, and emphasized the severity of cyber threats to email accounts headed into the 2020 election cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant threat, and it\u2019s a threat from lots of different groups, foreign and domestic, it\u2019s relatively unsophisticated, so it doesn\u2019t take a lot to be successful,\u201d Orlando told The Hill on Monday.", "description": "A recent hacking attempt by Iran targeting a U.S. presidential campaign highlighted the vulnerability of email accounts heading into the 2020 elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/irancyber_100719hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
