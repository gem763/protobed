Fighter jets flew over spectators who waved Chinese flags.\n\nThe display highlighted Beijing\u2019s ambition for strategic influence to match its status as the second-largest global economy, even as Xi\u2019s government suppresses dissent that illustrates the tensions between a closed, one-party dictatorship and a rapidly evolving society.\n\nThose strategic goals include displacing the United States as the Pacific region\u2019s dominant power and enforcing potentially volatile claims to Taiwan, the South China Sea and other disputed territories.\n\n\u201cNo force can stop the progress of the Chinese people,\u201d said Xi, was joined on the Tiananmen rostrum by Premier Li Keqiang, former Presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin and other party figures. Authorities said the event would include 15,000 troops, more than 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of military equipment.\n\nHONG KONG VIOLENCE LEAVES 1 SHOT BY POLICE AS CHINA MARKS 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNIST PARTY\n\nThe parade commemorated the Oct. 1, 1949, founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China by then-leader Mao Zedong following a civil war with the Nationalist government, which retreated to Taiwan. China\u2019s Communists are closing in on the 74-year record of the former Soviet Communist Party as the longest-ruling Marxist-Leninist party.\n\nThe display of \u201chigh-quality weapons\u201d is meant to show Beijing is on track to \u201crejuvenate China in the global arena,\u201d Henry Boyd, a military analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, told The Associated Press\n\n\u201cThe message is, this is a great power to be taken seriously,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cIt is not to be treated as an inferior.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has identified China as the U.S.'s top geopolitical threat.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attended the Beijing parade with a delegation of Hong Kong officials and dignitaries in a show of unity with the ruling party.\n\nXi, wearing a gray Mao jacket, rode in an open-topped limousine past dozens of rows of truck-mounted missiles, armored personnel carriers and other military gear.\n\nSoldiers in helmets and combat gear shouted, \u201cHello, leader!\u201d and \u201cServe the people!\u201d Xi replied, \u201cHello, comrades.\u201d\n\nSupported by China\u2019s economic boom, military spending has risen 400 percent over the past decade as Beijing tries to match the United States, Russia and Europe in weapons technology. Foreign analysts say China is, along with the United States, a leader in unmanned aircraft and is catching up in missiles and some other areas.\n\nThe parade \u201caims to show the outside world China\u2019s confidence\u201d and ability to protect its \u201coverseas interests,\u201d said Yue Gang, a retired army colonel and military commentator.\n\nDespite \u201cgreat improvements,\u201d China \u201cshould not relax vigilance and needs to continue to make efforts,\u201d Yue said.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army, the world\u2019s biggest military with 2 million men and women in uniform, also is working on fighter planes, the first Chinese-built aircraft carrier and a new generation of nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nPICTURES: PROTESTS IN HONG KONG\n\nA closely watched weapon unveiled Tuesday was the Dongfeng-17, a nuclear-armed glider that foreign analysts say is designed to maneuver at high speed to evade anti-missile defenses. That could help counter American systems like those deployed in South Korea and Japan.\n\nAnother was an unmanned aircraft dubbed Sharp Sword that, if equipped with bombs or missiles, would be the first combat drone developed by a power other than the U.S. and its European allies.\n\nDrones have \u201cbecome an indispensable weapon\u201d for Chinese forces, said Song Zhongping, a military analyst.\n\nBeijing\u2019s emphasis on missiles and other long-range weapons reflects expanding official ambitions to project power beyond Chinese shores after decades of its forces being confined to land.\n\nAnalysts say the long-range H-6N bomber, shown for the first time Tuesday, could be used to attack U.S. or other forces in the Pacific.\n\nAnother missile displayed, the Dongfeng-41, is believed to have the world\u2019s longest range at up to 9,400 miles. Analysts say it may be able to reach the United States in as little as 30 minutes and carry as many as 10 warheads to hit separate targets.\n\nThe soldiers and military hardware were followed by 70 floats celebrating China\u2019s economic achievements and former Communist leaders.\n\nChina\u2019s military spending last year was the world\u2019s second-highest at an estimated $250 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The United States, with a force of 1.3 million, led in spending at $650 billion, or more than 2\u00bd times China\u2019s level.\n\nChina\u2019s nuclear arsenal has about 280 warheads, compared with 6,450 for the United States and 6,850 for Russia, according to SIPRI. Beijing says it wants a \u201cminimum credible nuclear deterrent\u201d but won\u2019t be the first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Communist Party\u2019s hold on power appears to be secure three decades after it crushed pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square in 1989.\n\nBeijing is trying to shore up cooling economic growth and prevent politically dangerous job losses amid a tariff war with Washington over trade and technology that has battered Chinese exporters.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "China\u2019s Communist Party marked 70 years in power Tuesday with a military parade showcasing the country\u2019s global ambitions and advancements in weapons technology.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
