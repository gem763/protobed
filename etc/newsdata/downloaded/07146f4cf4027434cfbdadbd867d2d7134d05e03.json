Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not true that Trump has never had a good poll from Fox\u2019s pollsters; in January 2016, he celebrated a Fox poll that showed him leading in the Iowa caucuses. Nor is it the case that Fox\u2019s poll team generally mirrors the network\u2019s coverage. The pollsters represent the sort of objective analysis that the network\u2019s pundits only claim to espouse.\n\nAD\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not surprising that Trump is particularly angry about the new results.\n\n1. The poll shows that a majority of Americans want to see Trump removed from office.\n\nThe top-line numbers are some of the worst Trump has seen on the question of impeachment and removal from office. In the Fox News poll, 51 percent of respondents said that Trump should be both impeached and removed, with 4 percent saying he should be impeached but not removed.\n\nAmong suburban women, a constituency that is of ongoing concern for Republicans, nearly 6 in 10 support Trump\u2019s removal. Even more than 1 in 10 Republicans \u2014 and 12 percent of people who voted for Trump \u2014 think he should be ousted.\n\nMore than half of respondents said they thought Trump is more focused on doing what serves himself best as opposed to what best serves the country. Nearly a fifth of Republicans said that they think Trump is focused more on Trump than the country.\n\n2. Americans find Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine particularly troubling.\n\nAsked their views about what Trump did \u2014 specifically, ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden \u2014 most respondents said that the request was \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d troubling. Even a fifth of Republicans said it was at least \u201cvery\u201d troubling that Trump made the request.\n\nTrump and his allies have been arguing that the request was solely a function of Trump\u2019s desire to see possible corruption uprooted. It\u2019s an argument that suffers from two distinct problems: There\u2019s not strong evidence that Biden was engaged in anything close to corruption, and there\u2019s no evidence that Trump has put a focus on corruption anywhere that a prominent Democrat wasn\u2019t involved.\n\nThat argument appears to have gained traction. Fully 40 percent of Republicans think it\u2019s inappropriate for Trump to ask foreign leaders to investigate political rivals \u2014 nearly twice as many as find the Ukraine situation troubling. This suggests, perhaps, that some supporters accept the idea that Trump wasn\u2019t looking to undermine Biden specifically.\n\nBut the numbers above are grim for Trump as an impeachment inquiry moves forward. Unearthing additional evidence suggesting that Trump\u2019s goal was solely to undercut Biden could presumably increase the number of people who consider Trump\u2019s actions out of bound. (Assuming the normal rules of political scandal apply, which may not be a fair assumption.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3. Views of the situation among Republicans are complicated.\n\nThirteen percent of Republicans believe that Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That\u2019s a big chunk of the president\u2019s own party \u2014 1 in 8 Republicans. But it\u2019s not many relative to the population overall.\n\nFox\u2019s pollsters asked those Republicans why they didn\u2019t think Trump should be impeached.\n\n22 percent of those who opposed impeachment said Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n22 percent said the impeachment push was a politically motivated attack.\n\n17 percent said there was a lack of evidence.\n\n12 percent said they approve of the job he\u2019s doing.\n\n10 percent said that what Trump did wasn\u2019t impeachable.\n\nThat 17 percent is interesting, implying (as we just noted) that more evidence might sway them. As it stands, 9 percent of Republicans see the Ukraine call as impeachable, with another 38 percent calling it inappropriate.\n\nThere\u2019s a broad sense that this is political. Eighty-one percent of Republicans think Democrats just want to hurt Trump politically. About 6 in 10 Republicans think that Republicans in Congress oppose impeachment because they think Trump did nothing wrong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe flip sides of those questions are interesting, too. Only 11 percent of Republicans think that Democrats sincerely think Trump did something impeachable. But about a quarter of Republicans think that members of their party are opposing impeachment to protect the president.\n\n4. There remains a significant gender gap in views of what happened.\n\nOn the questions of both approval of Trump\u2019s job performance and impeachment, there are big gaps between men and women. Men are 13 points more likely to approve of Trump\u2019s job performance; women are 13 points more likely to want to see him booted from office.\n\nSome of the broadest gaps are among whites with college degrees. More than half of men with degrees approve of Trump\u2019s job performance while only about a third of white women with degrees do, a 20-point gap. White women with degrees are 14 points more likely to want to see Trump impeached and removed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n5. Fox News has covered its poll less than other networks.\n\nOne small detail that should relieve Trump: His favorite network is talking about the results of the poll less than other networks.\n\nA search of mentions of either \u201cFox News poll\u201d or \u201c51 percent\u201d since the poll was released Thursday evening shows that Fox News and Fox Business have mentioned it less frequently than CNN or MSNBC, particularly when including overnight reruns of shows.\n\nWhen Fox News does cover the poll, its coverage can be a bit different in tone than the other networks.\n\n\u201cPolls are showing support for impeachment,\u201d host Laura Ingraham said. \u201cAnd the polls are not going in the way the president wants them to go. If you believe the polls, you don\u2019t believe the polls \u2014 including a poll done by Fox News. A thousand registered voters called randomly on cellphones and home phones. Supposedly 51 percent say they want the president either impeached or removed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSupposedly.\u201d \u201cIf you believe the polls.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Thursday morning, a reporter noted that support for impeachment had increased since a July Fox poll. \u201cSince then a lot has happened,\u201d he said, \u201cmost notably, of course, the House Democrats launching the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe last Fox News poll was released July 25, the day that something else notable happened: that call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.\n\nAD", "description": "A new poll from the president\u2019s favorite cable network shows that half the country wants him removed from office.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oH7gHRH4V21lU-w2feRzeESjADY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZFW76LHLJAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
