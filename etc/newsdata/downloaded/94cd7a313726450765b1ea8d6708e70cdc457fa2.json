The brief said Apple employs 443 DACA recipients who come from more than 25 countries, and it detailed the stories of five employees \u201cwho play vital roles throughout Apple\u201d but remained anonymous in the brief because they \u201cfear retribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not hire them out of kindness or charity. We did it because Dreamers embody Apple\u2019s innovation strategy,\u201d Apple wrote in the brief. \u201cThey come from diverse backgrounds and display a wide range of skills and experiences that equip them to tackle problems from different perspectives. Because they thrived in the face of adversity, they often exhibit extraordinary levels of grit and drive.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation. The program also allows recipients to legally work in the U.S. Trump rescinded the program in an executive action two years ago as part of his ongoing agenda to halt immigration and demonize those who try to enter the country.\n\nEfforts to pass bills in Congress to protect DACA recipients haven\u2019t made much headway despite bipartisan support. House Democrats passed a DACA bill in June, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he likely won\u2019t bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on the legality of Trump\u2019s attempt at ending DACA next month.\n\nRead the full brief from Apple below:", "description": "The tech giant filed a brief that says it employs hundreds of recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals because they \"embody Apple's innovatio...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d955985210000f602f9b153.jpeg?cache=k2rpowvvtv&ops=1778_1000"}
