But it is an anecdotal list that is already substantial and growing apace. Consider, among scores of other examples, the following:\n\nEarlier this year, Google labeled the Claremont Institute\u2019s The American Mind a \u201cracially or ethnically oriented publication\u201d and banned the Institute from advertising its 40th anniversary gala with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. According to Claremont, \u201cwhat offended Google\u2019s bots was Claremont\u2019s campaign against identity politics and political correctness.\u201d (After Claremont went public with its protest of this matter, Google said it had made a mistake.)\n\nIn August of last year, Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey admitted during an interview on CNN that his company\u2019s employees have a largely left-leaning bias, though he averred that none of that colors Twitter\u2019s content practices. (It should be noted that this is the same dubious argument made by news organizations like the New York Times and the Washington Post, when admitting that the overwhelming majority of their writers and editors are similarly left-leaning.)\n\nAt the White House summit on Silicon Valley\u2019s censoring of conservative voices, held in July of this year, the head of the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life organization, claimed that Facebook and Twitter have demonstrated their opposition to them in myriad ways, including the banning of paid ads and the censoring of two SBA List videos.\n\nAnd then there is the recently published book by Blake Harris. Titled \u201cThe History of the Future,\u201d the book is an account of the virtual reality headset company, Oculus, and its founding by a 21-year-old man named Palmer Luckey. It makes for a fascinating read as it recounts Oculus\u2019s rapid ascent from a crowd-funded startup to a company that was acquired by Facebook for the staggering price of $3 billion dollars \u2014 even before there was a product to market!\n\nInfuriatingly, however, the book also amplifies glaring evidence of political bias on the part of Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nAs reported, Palmer Luckey was a libertarian who fancied Donald Trump even before he declared his candidacy for the presidency. Which is why, in 2016, he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump nonprofit organization called Nimble America, which proposed to buy anti-Clinton billboards around the country.\n\nWhen the reliably tendentious Daily Beast got hold of this news they wrote a piece under the headline \u201cPalmer Luckey: The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump\u2019s Meme Machine.\u201d The piece went on to trash Nimble America and its founders, indirectly shaming Palmer Luckey for his contribution to it. And then the rest of Silicon Valley\u2019s politically correct minions piled on, leading to the result that, in March of 2017, Luckey was fired. This, even after being forced, according to the Wall Street Journal \u2014 by Facebook and Zuckerberg personally \u2014 to publicly deny his political support of Trump, and instead to say he was supporting the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, for president in 2016!\n\nWith such as this as their political and ideological baggage, it\u2019s clear that lots of Republicans and conservatives would like to see most of the social media get their heads handed to them by Congress, the FTC, or the Justice Department. And indeed, investigations are underway at all three venues, not so much on the subject of their political bias, but of their alleged antitrust violations.\n\nBut as many experts have opined, antitrust investigations are tricky, lengthy, expensive, and very hard to handicap. Which is why, much as they have it coming to them, it is by no means certain that any of the governmental investigations of the social media will amount to anything.\n\nAs prosaic as it sounds, the best result would come about if large numbers of people stopped using Google for search, and Facebook and Twitter for communication.\n\nPatrick Maines is the President Emeritus of The Media Institute, one of the country\u2019s leading First Amendment think tanks.", "description": "Though the gathering congressional criticism of the social media is marked by significant bipartisan agreement on issues like privacy, there\u0092s another issue that divides legislators along party...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/48/488879_5_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
