It booked \u20ac13m in the third quarter.\n\nFaury said in a statement: \u201cOur nine-month results are mainly driven by the performance in commercial aircraft, reflecting both the A320neo ramp-up and progress on the A350.\n\nREAD MORE: German firms at their most gloomy since 2008\n\n\u201cWe are focused on the A320neo ramp-up and improving the industrial flow while managing the higher level of complexity on the A321 ACF in particular.\n\n\u201cOur nine-month delivery numbers and the updated delivery outlook for the year reflect the underlying actions to secure a more efficient delivery flow in the next years as we progress to rate 63 per month for the A320 Family in 2021.\u201d\n\nIt comes a day after Indian budget airline Indigo ordered 300 A320neo jets worth a reported \u00a326bn ($33bn), in one of Airbus\u2019 biggest ever orders.", "description": "Europe's largest aircraft giant is reported to have been plagued by problems at a key German factory.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c1WS2PDqJ0JTPIn_1G9R2Q--~B/aD0yMTAyO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/44211510-faee-11e9-ae9f-d92982532366", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
