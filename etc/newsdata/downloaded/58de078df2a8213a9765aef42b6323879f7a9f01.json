Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrooklyn appeared poised to record its second win in three outings after Memphis rookie Ja Morant failed to connect with Kyle Anderson on an inbounds pass with 8.1 seconds left.\n\nSpencer Dinwiddie made one of two free throws to push the Nets\u2019 lead to 133-131, but Morant set up Crowder for the game-winning shot at the top of the arc. Morant scored 17 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter and pushed the game into overtime with a well-timed block of Kyrie Irving as time expired.\n\nDillon Brooks made 9 of 15 shots from the field for 21 points as the Grizzlies overcame an eight-point deficit with 3:20 remaining in the fourth quarter to record their first win of the season.\n\nTrail Blazers 121, Mavericks 119\n\nCarried by 35 points from CJ McCollum, 28 from Damian Lillard and 20 from Rodney Hood, Portland overcame a sluggish first half to pull out a clutch victory at Dallas.\n\nLillard\u2019s lefty layup with 26.8 seconds to go \u2014 after a Mavericks shot-clock violation \u2014 put the Blazers ahead for good.\n\nKristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 32 points, adding nine rebounds and five assists, while Luka Doncic had 29 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nTimberwolves 116, Heat 109\n\nAndrew Wiggins scored 16 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter \u2014 including three straight 3-pointers at one point \u2014 to lead Minnesota past Miami in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a span of just over four minutes, Wiggins scored 16 of Minnesota\u2019s 17 points, as the Wolves went from a 96-93 deficit to a 110-101 lead. Prior to that stretch, he had been 0-for-5 on 3-pointers in the game. Then, he made five straight shots, including four threes, during the 17-5 run.\n\nT-Wolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 11 rebounds. But he was fairly quiet after a 15-point first quarter. Miami was led by rookie guard Kendrick Nunn, who scored 25 points. He is off to the best three-game rookie scoring start in Heat history.\n\nThunder 120, Warriors 92\n\nDennis Schroder scored 22 points as host Oklahoma City blew out Golden State, which has averaged 130.5 points allowed in back-to-back losses to start the season.\n\nThe Thunder dominated from the start, scoring the game\u2019s first eight points. The margin was less than double digits for only about six minutes of game action. Oklahoma City led 70-37 at halftime.\n\nDanilo Gallinari added 21 points, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 19 in the win. The Thunder made 15 3-pointers, four by Gallinari. Stephen Curry led Golden State with 23 points but was just 2 of 9 from behind the 3-point line. The Warriors shot just 15.2 percent from behind the arc (5 of 33).\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Jae Crowder drained a 3-pointer as time expired in overtime to lift the host Memphis Grizzlies to a 134-133 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445710789&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R06J-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
