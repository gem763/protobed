It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\n\nIt\u2019s a different market than it was at the beginning of 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s a choppier, more cautious environment. That\u2019s not a bad thing, however. After a basically uninterrupted post-election rally, several stocks have seen pullbacks that provide more attractive entry points. Others simply haven\u2019t received their due credit from the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile there might be reasons for caution overall \u2014 inverted yield curve, trade war concerns \u2014 more opportunities exist as well.\n\nThis more and more looks like a \u201cstockpicker\u2019s market.\u201d For those stockpickers, here are nine stocks to buy that look particularly attractive.\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Stocks to Buy Now: Exxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nPast year performance: 5.6%\n\nHot Stocks to Buy Now: Exxon Mobil (XOM) More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019m as surprised as anyone that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) makes this list. I\u2019ve long been skeptical toward XOM. The internal hedge between upstream and downstream operations makes Exxon stock a surprisingly poor play on higher oil prices. Overall, that leads XOM to stay relatively rangebound, as it has been for basically a decade now.\n\nWith the dividend yield just below 5% and a 15.6 times forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple, Exxon Mobil stock looks like a value play. Meanwhile, management is forecasting that the company\u2019s earnings can double by 2025, adding a modest growth component to the story.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a risk that Exxon management is being too optimistic. Years of underperformance relative to peers like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and even BP (NYSE:BP) has eroded the market\u2019s confidence. If Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) can lead a true electric car revolution, that, too, could impact demand and pricing going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan\u2019s Famous (NATH)\n\nPast year performance: -18.8 %\n\nIn this market, recommending a restaurant owner, let alone a hot dog restaurant owner, might seem silly at best. But there\u2019s a strong bull case for Nathan\u2019s Famous, Inc. (NASDAQ:NATH).\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 2018 More\n\nSource: Flickr\n\nNATH, too, has mostly seen a steady decline since late 2018, although it\u2019s rebounded slightly in recent weeks. The stock touched a 52-week (and all-time) high just over $100 in July 2018. It\u2019s since come down about 30%, yet the story hasn\u2019t really changed all that much.\n\nRevenues grew by just about 8% in fiscal 2018. The company\u2019s agreement with John Morrell, who manufactures Nathan\u2019s product for retail sale and Sam\u2019s Club operations, offers huge margins, while its bottom line continues to grow. Food service sales similarly are increasing.\n\nThe restaurant business has been choppier, but it remains profitable. The \u201cmostly franchised\u201d model there is similar to those of Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), among others, all of whom are getting well above-market multiples.\n\nAll told, Nathan\u2019s has an attractive licensing model, which leverages revenue growth across the operating businesses. And yet, at 12x EV/EBITDA, the stock trades at a significant discount to peers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America (BAC)\n\nPast year performance: -2.3%\n\nBank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is still below its 2018 high and has gained well over 100% from July 2016 lows. Trading has been a bit choppier of late, and there\u2019s a case, perhaps, to wait for a better entry point.\n\nBank of America Stock Is One Catalyst Away From Moving Higher More", "description": "[Editor's note: \"9 Hot Stocks to Buy Now\" was previously published in August 2019.
