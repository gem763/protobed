The space agency issued a final call to the commercial space industry today, with proposals due November 1st.\n\nHuman lunar landers are a critical component of NASA\u2019s Artemis program, an initiative to send people back to the Moon\u2019s surface in less than five years. These landers are meant to live at a new space station that NASA wants to build in orbit around the Moon called the Gateway. Astronauts will supposedly travel to the Gateway in NASA\u2019s future rocket \u2014 the Space Launch System, or SLS \u2014 and from there, they\u2019ll travel in the landers down to the Moon.\n\nSpecifically, NASA is looking for landers that consist of two to three main pieces. First, the descent stage \u2014 hardware that will lower the vehicle down to the surface of the Moon. Second, the ascent stage, which is what astronauts will ride in when they take off from the lunar surface and return back to the Gateway. A third component is known as the transfer stage; this piece is basically a tug that can transport the other two elements from the Gateway to an orbit that\u2019s closer to the Moon, making it easier to get everything to and from the surface.\n\nNASA is looking for landers that consist of two to three main pieces\n\nCompanies will also need to specify how they\u2019ll get their lunar landers to the Gateway. They can use commercial vehicles, such as SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy or Blue Origin\u2019s future New Glenn rocket, or they can use NASA\u2019s future SLS rocket, slated to fly in 2021 at the earliest.\n\nFrom the proposals it receives, NASA eventually plans to select two of those companies to actually go through the process of making the landers and sending them to the Gateway. One company\u2019s lander will be tasked with doing the first coveted landing with people on board in 2024, while the second will do another crewed landing in 2025. NASA does not plan on doing any uncrewed test landings with these designs beforehand, though.\n\nA few companies have already given the public a sneak peek of their plans. Lockheed Martin unveiled a lunar lander design that\u2019s derived from the company\u2019s Orion capsule, which NASA astronauts will ride in on top of NASA\u2019s SLS. Jeff Bezos also showed off Blue Origin\u2019s Blue Moon lunar lander concept in May, which he claims the company has been working on for the last three years.\n\nThis finalized call to industry comes a few months after NASA posted two draft documents detailing what kind of landers and contracts it was looking for from the commercial space sector. During those months, companies provided NASA with feedback as it edited its request. NASA claims it removed language and requirements that companies thought might slow down the development schedule. The entire process \u2014 from drafts to final call \u2014 has been much speedier than many of NASA\u2019s other contract selections, which can take many months to years to be awarded. The expedited schedule has been necessary in order to meet Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s challenge to NASA from March of this year \u2014 to send people back to the Moon four years earlier than the agency had planned.\n\nWhile NASA has been speedy in getting out this call to industry, these lunar lander selections all hinge on what kind of budget the space agency is given next year. In order to get a jump-start on the Artemis program, the Trump administration requested an extra $1.6 billion for NASA for next year in a budget amendment, with $1 billion going toward the development of new lunar landers. However, it\u2019s not clear whether NASA will actually receive those additional funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently passed a funding bill for next year that gives NASA a big boost in its budget, but only provides $744.1 million for developing new lunar technologies for Artemis.\n\nThe final budget for 2020 is still being decided, but NASA says that money is key. \u201cFor this year, what we need is that budget amendment so that we can get the landing systems awarded \u2014 get those contracts out,\u201d Ken Bowersox, the acting head of NASA\u2019s human exploration office, testified before the House Science Committee this September. \u201cBecause that\u2019s our long pole for right now for getting to the lunar surface.\u201d", "description": "NASA is now officially accepting proposals for lunar lander designs that can carry humans to the surface of the Moon.
