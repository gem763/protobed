It\u2019s not everyday you get to see your sister win a world medal, let alone win one yourself. What made it even more special was knowing that my very first Worlds were at Stuttgart and, although I\u2019m not certain it\u2019s my last, it\u2019s nice to have possibly finished there too.\n\nIt\u2019s been a formative experience for us as a team - I think we\u2019ve bonded so much. We went to get the Olympic qualification and it\u2019s incredible that both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams have achieved it. Making a team final, for me, was incredibly special.\n\nSeeing Ellie go and perform so well took the pressure off for me ahead of my final on bars. I know hard she\u2019s been working, so to see it all come together was indescribable. Of course I wanted to watch her medal presentation, but this meant I only had 40 minutes to warm up ahead of competing myself. It was a bit of a rush, but I knew I was ready. I\u2019ve been training so hard for that moment.\n\nIt was the first time I put that routine at any kind of competition. Until that point we had played it safe, sticking to what I knew to get good results, but for the final I knew I could pull it off. Although my routine wasn\u2019t done as cleanly as I know I\u2019m capable of, I\u2019m grateful I managed to deliver it under that kind of pressure and environment. In the end I was just so happy I\u2019d done it.", "description": "I could not have asked for a better World Championships.", "authors": ["Becky Downie", "James Corrigan", "Maggie Alphonsi"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000195719711-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
