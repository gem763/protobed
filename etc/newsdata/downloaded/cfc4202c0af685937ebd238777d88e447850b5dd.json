A presidential election is to be held on Sept. 15.\n\n\u201cOur forces killed three terrorists after a clash that came after a 10-day follow-up as part of the pursuit of terrorist elements,\u201d Police Colonel Houssem Jbebli said.\n\nThe dead policeman was the head of a station in the town of Haidra, he added.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed told Reuters last week that Tunisia was still under threat from militant groups including Islamic State.\n\nTunisia suffered three major attacks in 2015: one at a museum in Tunis, one on a tourist beach in Sousse and one on presidential guards in the capital. All three were claimed by Islamic State.\n\nTourism has been recovering gradually from the effect of the attacks.", "description": "A Tunisian policeman and three Islamist militants were killed on Monday in a security operation in a remote area near the Algerian border, police said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
