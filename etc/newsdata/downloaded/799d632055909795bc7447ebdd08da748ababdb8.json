This grid design is no longer fit for purpose as the grid must now carry electricity from large-scale wind and solar farms (placed where such resources are readily available) to the cities. As part of the new market design, the grid is being reconfigured. A plan to rebuild it over time is in place, and work is under way on a number of projects. The investment in transmission is critical and urgent as the output of many renewable generators is constrained because the grid cannot cope with their connections and power flows.\n\nThe increase in rooftop solar in Australia is leading the way globally and our experiences are being closely monitored. In Adelaide and Brisbane, more than 30 per cent of homes have rooftop solar and one in eight of new installations this year has a battery for storage. This high penetration means that in the middle of the day the demand for power from the grid in some locations is close to zero. The pattern of demand across a 24-hour day resembles a duck curve, with near zero demand in the middle of the day and more \u201cnormal\u201d demand between 4pm and 10am. Not surprisingly, the distribution companies are struggling to maintain a secure system.\n\nWith rooftop solar there are bidirectional flows in the distribution network as customers seek to not only purchase power but also to sell the power they generate. The future market design in this area is particularly interesting as demand response mechanisms, along with smart meters and smart appliances, readily allow aggregation and significant participation in the wholesale market. Retailers in the market may need to change their business approach to that of a service provider to both households and commercial customers.\n\nCostly efforts to keep aged coal plants running for extended periods are also ill advised.\n\nThe obvious challenge for the networks is the technical integration and the development of a completely new business model. These companies are not known for their business agility and innovation, or for their IT and software capabilities. But this is likely to change as distribution networks become more like trading platforms.\n\nIn the new market design the role of the regulator also requires a major rethink. Regulation can no longer be simply a set rate of return based on the building-block approach. They must now check that inverters and batteries are compliant with the system . They will need to examine arrangements that restrict the activities of the distribution networks that are becoming service providers.\n\nCustomers will be able to offer and buy power and other services (probably managed through an aggregator). The consumer plan they choose will be more like a telco plan, reflecting the services they want from the system as well as the services they wish to sell and purchase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut first we must keep the system stable and reliable through the transition.\n\nGovernment interventions to cap prices and to effectively subsidise certain generation projects will not encourage the considerable new investment and innovation that is needed. Costly efforts to keep aged coal plants running for extended periods are also ill advised. This discourages firms from giving adequate notice of closure, and it discourages new investment in firm and flexible plants.\n\nWhat the government could usefully do is focus on industry adjustment policies to provide employment at locations where coal-fired generation and related mine closures are expected over the next decade. Australia has managed major industry changes well previously, and it is time to brush off these policy manuals again.", "description": "Government subsidies and costly efforts to keep old coal plants alive are doing nothing to bring investment and innovation into the long-suffering energy sector, writes Kerry Schott.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6241%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_51/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3a0b6a7c662b2949a10ff0f16cb9171228e662b5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
