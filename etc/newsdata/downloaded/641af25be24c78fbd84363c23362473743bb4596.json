Police knew she killed them.", "language": "en", "text": "Smith\u2019s allegation about what had happened to 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander on Oct. 25, 1994, was explosive. She said that a black gunman had jumped into her burgundy Mazda while she waited at a stoplight, made her drive several miles, forced her out of the car and driven away with her sons.\n\nThe truth about the boys\u2019 disappearance 25 years ago this week would come to light nine days later, when police pulled the car from John D. Long Lake in Union County, S.C., and found two small bodies in the back seat. Smith, 23, was charged with murder.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStories of other mothers who murdered their children, from Diane Downs in 1983 to Christy Sheats in 2016, have captured the nation\u2019s attention for decades. Smith\u2019s crime was another opportunity to obsess over an unimaginable case of filicide.\n\nThe tale she told about an anonymous gunman made her case particularly gripping. Hundreds of people scoured rural South Carolina, police analyzed thousands of tips from across the country, and students organized a prayer vigil, The Washington Post reported in 1994.\n\nBut investigators were immediately suspicious. They eventually discovered a letter from Smith\u2019s love interest \u2014 the son of the chief executive of the company where she worked \u2014 saying he wanted to be with her but didn\u2019t want a family.\n\nAD\n\nSmith strapped her sons into their car seats in the back of her Mazda and drove around the small town, thinking about ending her life, police said at the time. She eventually admitted that she made her way to Long Lake and sent her car off a boat ramp with Michael and Alexander inside.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery part of her world was falling apart, and one thing led to another,\u201d an unidentified police source told The Post in 1994. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to have been great plans aforethought in her actions. They just happened.\u201d\n\nNews that Smith had confessed to the crime angered the town\u2019s tightknit African American community, which found it suspicious that no one recognized Smith\u2019s description of the purported kidnapper. Locals compared Smith\u2019s case to that of Charles Stuart, a white man who in 1989 alleged a black man had fatally shot his pregnant wife. Stuart later killed himself when authorities indicted him for the crime.\n\nAD\n\nSmith led a complicated life before the killings. She worked as a secretary at a plant that made decorative trims for textiles. A local resident told The Post that people saw her as friendly and outgoing. She enjoyed shopping and going to Friday-night football games at a local high school.\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, the county sheriff at the time said she came from a \u201ctroubled background.\u201d She lost her father to suicide when she was young, was molested by her stepfather and tried to end her own life as a teenager. Her marriage to David Smith later ended in divorce, and she worried that her $17,000-per-year income wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nAs Smith\u2019s trial approached, popular magazines weighed in with dramatic headlines.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow could she do it?\u201d implored Time.\n\n\u201cDoes she deserve to die?\u201d asked People magazine.\n\nSmith declined to testify at her trial, where prosecutor Tommy Pope painted a picture of a selfish, manipulative actress who could make herself cry at will. He held photos of Michael and Alexander as he described for the jury what their deaths must have been like, The Post reported in 1995.\n\n\u201cThey were probably crying,\u201d Pope said. \u201cThey knew it was dark. They knew they were scared. They knew they were alone \u2026 but their mother ran with her hands over her ears.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe jury convicted Smith of murder.\n\nOn July 29, 1995, The Post reported that Smith closed her eyes after a court clerk read the sentence: life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years. She had been spared the death penalty that prosecutors were seeking.\n\nAD\n\nSmith\u2019s family members gasped with relief. Her former husband told reporters on the courthouse steps that his ex-wife had not received justice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget what Susan has done, and I\u2019ll never forget Michael and Alex,\u201d David Smith said. \u201cMe and my family, of course, are disappointed that the death penalty wasn\u2019t the verdict.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Despondent over a failed marriage, money troubles and a relationship with a man who didn't want kids, Susan Smith put her children in her car and pushed it into a lake.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VI7ELB5J5Djw5A-L9ljKGpIlIio=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6H4LPGXXKMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
