It became hard to imagine life without his new monitor, a device that lets him track the trends in his blood sugar 24 hours a day on his smartphone. And yet, he has spent weeks at a time without the device over the past year because of insurance restrictions. Physician groups and patients consider those rules burdensome, but insurers defend them as necessary.\n\nDiabetes activists and legislators have started to focus attention on the surging price of insulin, leading to legislative pushes, lawsuits and congressional hearings. But insulin isn\u2019t the only thing people with Type 1 diabetes are struggling to get. Managing the condition requires other essential, often lifesaving medical supplies. And patients frequently face hurdles in getting access to those supplies \u2014 hurdles put in place by insurance companies.\n\nA Life-Changing Device\n\nPeralta learned about the latest version of the Dexcom continuous glucose monitor from the mother of one of his patients. He visited the company\u2019s website and, within two weeks, the device was shipped to his front door.\n\n\u201cI still didn\u2019t 100% appreciate exactly how it was going to change my life,\u201d Peralta said. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d\n\nTypically, people with Type 1 diabetes check their blood sugar by drawing a drop of blood from a finger and placing it on a disposable test strip that\u2019s read by a blood glucose meter. Doctors suggest checking blood sugar this way between four and 10 times a day. These readings are crucial for helping people with diabetes manage their blood sugar \u2014 keeping it from getting too low, which can lead to sudden seizures and loss of consciousness, as well as from getting too high, which can cause vision loss and nerve damage and can even, over time, lead to amputations.\n\nInstead, Peralta\u2019s continuous glucose monitor gave accurate blood sugar readings every five minutes. That\u2019s 288 readings a day, or about 278 more readings than even the most conscientious patients get the old-fashioned way.\n\n\u201cWhen I had to do the old-fashioned finger prick test, I was only doing that right before I ate, so I could see how much [insulin] I was supposed to take,\u201d Peralta said. (People with Type 1 diabetes have to take multiple daily shots of insulin to keep their blood sugar within the normal range because their bodies stop producing the naturally occurring hormone.)\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I had rather severe [blood sugar] peaks and valleys in between my mealtimes,\u201d Peralta said.\n\nTighter control of blood sugar can reduce the risk of heart disease, kidney failure and nerve damage. For Peralta, it also offered peace of mind.\n\nThe monitor sounds an alarm when his blood sugar gets dangerously low; Peralta said his co-workers have started bringing him sugary snacks when they hear the alarm, to help him raise his blood sugar back to normal. When he takes his family on road trips \u2014 a favorite activity \u2014 he no longer has to worry about the possibility of passing out while driving.\n\n\u201cIt even syncs with my car so I can just say, \u2018Siri, what\u2019s my blood sugar?\u2019 And it will come over the car stereo system,\u201d Peralta said. \u201cI\u2019m safe for my family.\u201d\n\nPrior-Authorization Requirements\n\nWhen common chronic conditions such as diabetes are well controlled, it prevents worsening disease and saves money for the health system and the patient.\n\nBut Peralta said his efforts to use this new tool consistently to manage his diabetes have been stymied by insurance problems that began about a year ago.\n\nThe newest Dexcom continuous glucose monitor has three parts: a sensor that measures glucose levels, a transmitter that sends out the sensor\u2019s readings wirelessly and a receiver that displays those readings on a screen.\n\nAllison Zaucha for NPR via KHN\n\nFor each of these parts, Peralta needs \u201cprior authorization\u201d \u2014 a requirement that his physician get approval from his insurance company before prescribing the device.\n\nThe Dexcom sensors last about 10 days each, and Peralta\u2019s insurance allows him to buy a three-month supply at a time. But he also has to get prior authorization for each supply, meaning every three months his doctor needs to reconfirm with his insurance company that the sensors are medically necessary. Same goes for the device\u2019s transmitters \u2014 which last about six months each.\n\n\u201cI have to jump through hoops and they have to jump through hoops to get information from my insurance to get authorization,\u201d Peralta said in frustration, adding that \u201cfor the last year, basically every time there\u2019s been something that\u2019s gone wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior authorizations are in place to protect patients, to improve safety and to try to make sure that the care they receive is as safe as possible and also as affordable as possible,\u201d said Kate Berry of the trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Programs.\n\nBut to Ric Peralta, the requirement is a burden.\n\nThe most recent snafu happened in March. Peralta ordered a new supply of sensors directly from Dexcom but said the company submitted a request for approval of a new transmitter as well. And because his insurance approves the sensors and transmitters on different authorization timelines, the whole claim was denied. Peralta estimates he spent four hours on the phone with Dexcom and his insurer over the next month and a half to sort it all out. During that time he had to revert to finger-stick tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s maddening,\u201d Peralta said. \u201cIf I do not have my proper management of this disease, I\u2019m going to die from it. And they\u2019re making it as difficult as possible.\u201d\n\nA Burden On Doctors, Too\n\nPrior authorizations have become a major concern of physicians across the U.S. health care system, as evidenced by a December survey by the American Medical Association.\n\nOf the 1,000 physicians surveyed, 91% said prior authorizations \u201chave a negative impact on patient clinical outcomes\u201d; 75% said the requirements \u201ccan at least sometimes lead to patients abandoning a recommended course of treatment\u201d; and 28% said the prior-authorization process had \u201cled to serious or life-threatening events\u201d for their patients.\n\n\u201cIn my practice, we have five individual physicians, and we hired five full-time employees whose primary duty is obtaining prior authorization and dealing with insurance companies,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Scott, an otolaryngologist from Kentucky and speaker of the AMA House of Delegates.\n\n\u201cPrior authorization is a burden on providers and diverts valuable resources,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThe AMA has even created a website that catalogs stories of patients and providers who say they\u2019ve struggled to gain access to important medical products and procedures because of problems with getting prior authorization from insurers \u2014 everything from pain medication for a cancer patient to X-rays in the ER. Scott said the AMA doesn\u2019t expect insurers to completely do away with requirements for prior authorization, \u201cbut we believe that it should be focused and that it should be better planned.\u201d\n\nThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists \u2014 an organization of the physicians whose specialty is often associated with diabetes treatment \u2014 goes further.\n\n\u201cWe feel that physicians that are specialists in endocrine disease should not be required to fill out prior authorizations for endocrine treatments,\u201d said Dr. Scott Isaacs, an endocrinologist from Atlanta and a member of the board of directors of AACE.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge burden for the patients trying to get this sorted out. Sometimes it\u2019s red tape; sometimes it\u2019s a true denial,\u201d Isaacs said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge burden for the doctors as well, and the doctors resent it.\u201d\n\nBerry, of America\u2019s Health Insurance Programs, acknowledges there\u2019s room for improvement in the prior-authorization process. In fact, in January 2018, the AMA and AHIP signed a consensus statement identifying five areas for improvement. It was co-signed by the American Hospital Association, the American Pharmacists Association, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and the Medical Group Management Association.\n\nWho Bears The Greatest Burden?\n\nFor Ric Peralta, the ultimate burden of getting all these prescriptions filled falls on him and other patients like him.\n\nAfter his latest mix-up with the sensors in March, he discovered the battery in his transmitter had died.\n\nPeralta made another frustrated call to Dexcom, and recently got a complimentary transmitter to get him back on the system while his formal order goes through the approval process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite nervous about what\u2019s going to happen again in two months when I am needing to call in orders again,\u201d Peralta said.\n\n\u201cAm I going to have to go through this whole thing over again?\u201d\n\nThis story is part of NPR\u2019s reporting partnership with Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
