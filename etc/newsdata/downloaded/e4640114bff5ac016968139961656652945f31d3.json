Prosecutors said the first two bribes totaled approximately $520 in cash and the third bribe was approximately $5,500.\n\nPerez cooperated with FBI agents and conceded that he bought firewood from Delgado at inflated prices and on one occasion, gave the judge a pickup truck worth approximately $15,000 because Delgado asked for it and Perez wanted to establish \u201ccredit\u201d with the judge in his courtroom, the Brownsville Herald reported.\n\nDelgado was convicted by a federal jury on July 11 of conspiracy, federal program bribery, travel act bribery and obstruction of justice.
