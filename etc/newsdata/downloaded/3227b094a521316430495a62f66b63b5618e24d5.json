The June 2019 figure, however, is still down from the peak of 772 million users registered in February 2018.\n\nSee also: E-sportsman and drone pilot become officially recognised jobs in China\n\nMore than 320 mobile games in Tencent's WeChat -- the popular messaging app that has more than one billion active users globally -- each had over one million monthly active users as of June this year, according to the QuestMobile. For ordinary smartphone apps in China, only 140 of them had more than one million monthly active users during that month.\n\nUsers aged between 19 and 35 years old accounted for two-thirds of Chinese mobile game players as of June 2019. Meanwhile, the number of female players has increased rapidly, accounting for 47% of the mobile gaming population, according to QuestMobile.\n\nThe average Chinese mobile game player spent 18.5 hours on mobile games in June, down from 19.6 hours in June last year.\n\nThe United States is expected to overtake China's leading position as the world's top gaming market this year as China's nine-month ban on approving new games in 2018 continues to send chills throughout the entire market, market research firm Newzoo said in a research note in June.\n\nChina, which has been the world's largest gaming market for the past three years, is projected to register $36.5 billion in game revenue for 2019, lagging slightly of the United States' $37 billion. The revenue in the United States has primarily been driven by growth in the mobile and console market, according to the Newzoo report.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The overall mobile gaming market is showing an upward trend in China this year as incomes in June have increased by 21.5%, according to agency data.", "authors": ["Cyrus Lee"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/28/41bec2b2-8357-4f62-b0f4-25d8d3f89a80/thumbnail/770x578/b25f7b724a64b4570d04610a66396622/computerusermonitorsistock-1074642242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
