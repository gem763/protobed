(Will Newton/Getty Images)\n\nThere is a lot wrong with the Washington Redskins\u2019 defense. The front seven are not living up to expectations. The defensive play-calling has been \u201cvanilla,\u201d in the words of the head coach. The Redskins don\u2019t stop anyone on third down. And they turn struggling quarterbacks into monsters of the gridiron. One common thread to these issues is Josh Norman, the once-feared cover corner now performing like a mediocre defender who is grossly overpaid.\n\nNorman was unceremoniously cut by Carolina in 2016 after the Panthers decided to rescind the franchise tag on the all-pro cornerback. Two days later, he signed a five-year, $75 million deal with the Redskins, which carried a $14.3 million 2019 cap hit, a figure that remains the fifth highest at the position. And for that lofty sum, Washington is gaining the services of a subpar player.\n\n[Jay Gruden doesn\u2019t think Redskins\u2019 season is over, so Dwayne Haskins will continue to wait]\n\nPerhaps it is unfair to lay all of Washington\u2019s pass coverage problems at Norman\u2019s feet. But he has been the victim of four of the nine passing touchdowns against the Redskins this season and has the lowest pass-coverage grade on the team, according to Pro Football Focus. Fabian Moreau, a third-round pick in 2017, has earned the team\u2019s highest coverage grade and is Washington\u2019s only cornerback with a positive grade through three games, although he has played in just one game because of an injury. Quinton Dunbar, the fifth-year pro with a $4 million cap hit in 2019, has been the Redskins\u2019 second-best cover corner, per Pro Football Focus, although he also has played in just one game.\n\nMost troubling, Pro Football Focus ranks Norman 66th out of 83 NFL cornerbacks who have played at least half of their team\u2019s defensive snaps.\n\nGruden says he's a little bit surprised how much teams are going after Josh Norman \u2014 JP Finlay (@JPFinlayNBCS) September 24, 2019\n\nNorman has been targeted 20 times in coverage, yielding 13 catches for 225 yards and four touchdowns. He has just one interception. That means opposing quarterbacks have a passer rating of 121.9 when they throw in Norman\u2019s direction. To put that in perspective, the league average passer rating this season is 94.3; Drew Brees led the NFL in 2018 with a passer rating of 115.7. And only five cornerbacks, none with a cap hit higher than $4.2 million in 2019, have allowed a worse rate of yards per snap in coverage through three games.\n\nAnd Norman is getting victimized all over the field. In Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Alshon Jeffery caught four of five passes with Norman in primary coverage for 44 yards. Two of those completions were toward the left sideline, one was toward the right sideline, and one was down the middle.\n\nIn Week 2, Norman gave up receptions to Dallas wideouts Michael Gallup and Devin Smith plus tight end Jason Witten. The catch by Smith was a 51-yard touchdown down the middle of the field, with just eight of those yards coming after the catch.\n\nIn Week 3, Bears receivers Allen Robinson, Javon Wims and Taylor Gabriel each caught at least one pass against Norman. The cornerback did manage his first interception of the season in the third quarter, but by then the Redskins trailed by three scores.\n\nOpposing quarterbacks have been in on the joke for a while. In 2017, Norman was targeted fewer than four times a game, but he\u2019s now seeing almost seven passes per contest. And quarterbacks targeting Norman have been getting more efficient with each passing season. In 2016, Norman\u2019s first year for the Redskins, he held opposing quarterbacks to a respectable 74.3 passer rating against. The next year, that number ballooned to 114.1. It remained steady in 2018 (114.2) but has increased again this season. (The one season he allowed a higher passer rating against was 2013, early in his career, when he played just seven games.)\n\nNorman\u2019s decline perhaps shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Research by Jeff Essary has shown cornerbacks reach their peak at 27 years old and then endure a rapid decline soon after. Norman will be 32 in December, which suggests a turnaround isn\u2019t likely.\n\nPass defense isn\u2019t the only measuring stick for NFL team success, but it isn\u2019t a minor detail, either. Since 2002, the first year the league had 32 teams, defenses that held opposing quarterbacks to a passer rating of 70 or below for a full season averaged almost 11 wins a season. Those allowing a passer rating of 101 or higher averaged less than five wins. Washington has allowed a team passer rating of 122.2 through three games.\n\nFor his part, Norman seems to be attempting to find the bright side.\n\n\u201cWe just have to keep pushing, man. We just have to keep pushing. This thing is a sprint, not a marathon,\u201d Norman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first quarter of the season. Right now we\u2019re 0-3. \u2026 All we can do is look forward to is the Giants, go in there and get a win.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHail or Fail: Redskins can\u2019t spell, stir correctly or win in another Monday night debacle\n\nAfter a third lackluster loss, Redskins\u2019 defense has few answers for how to fix things\n\nThe NFL\u2019s search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense\n\nSvrluga: At 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears", "description": "Pro Football Focus ranks Norman, the fifth-highest paid player at his position, 66th out of 83 cornerbacks who have played at least half of their team\u2019s defensive snaps in 2019.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post", "September At Pm", "Neil Greenberg Is A Staff Writer With The Washington Post Whose Beat Is Sports Analytics.
