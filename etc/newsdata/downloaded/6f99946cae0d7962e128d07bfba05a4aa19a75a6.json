Hours after the House Intelligence Committee voted to publicly release the document written by committee chairman Devin Nunes and his staff, the ex-White House staffer went all out to hype up its importance.\n\n\u201cIt has to be put in the context of the history of our great nation,\u201d Gorka told host Sean Hannity. \u201cRemember, why was America created? It was created because of the use of power by a leader thousands of miles away. That\u2019s why America was created. It was about a tea tax and stationing troops on private property without permission.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis is 100 times bigger. This is our government spying on political adversaries. This is federal law enforcement officials obstructing justice. You listed all of the things Clinton and her team did. The FBI destroyed the laptops that were part of the Clinton investigation. Who gave that order?\u201d\n\nYep, that\u2019s right. The four-page document written by a member of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team that one GOP congressman already has said isn\u2019t an \u201cend-all smoking gun\u201d is \u201c100 times bigger\u201d than the abuses of power by Britain that led to the American Revolution.\n\nOK then.\n\nWatch the clip above, via Fox News.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "description": "\"It has to be put in the context of the history of our great nation,\" Gorka told host Sean Hannity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gorka-100-timesedited-650x383.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-30"}
