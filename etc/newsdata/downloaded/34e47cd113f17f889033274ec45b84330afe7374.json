There were already 10 people in custody in the case, and 11, including the two suspected top leaders, remained at large after being indicted.\n\nMexican kingpins smuggled the drugs to two Oregon distributors, who then spread it to stash houses, dealers, couriers and money launderers, authorities said.\n\nThe operation \u201cmarks one of the largest takedowns of a drug trafficking organization in the history of the District of Oregon,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe very large quantities of drugs trafficked and the possession of firearms will subject many of these defendants to very long prison sentences \u2014 up to life.\u201d\n\nAt one point, operatives in Portland were filling weekly orders from customers for more than 75 pounds (35 kilograms) of methamphetamine and 55 pounds (25 kilograms) of heroin, he said.\n\n\u201cThis amounts to roughly 600,000 individual user doses,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe organization would routinely change the location of stash houses, rotate vehicles and phones, and pay individual couriers to take time off if they were nearing detection by law enforcement, the prosecutor said.\n\nThe operation is also accused of shipping guns back to Mexico for use by associates.\n\nCourt documents allege the operation involved a sophisticated money laundering scheme that worked out of a Mexican mini-mart in a rundown strip mall next to a marijuana retail store.\n\nCouriers brought drug proceeds there to be wired in small amounts back to Mexico, with the knowledge and consent of its owners, Williams said. In that way, more than $1 million was laundered from drug proceeds in one year alone, he said.\n\nFederal authorities credited the police department in Gresham, Oregon \u2014 a large suburb east of Portland \u2014 with first bringing the drug ring to their attention. From there, the investigation expanded and lasted more than a year.\n\nGresham Police Chief Robin Sells said her detectives first learned of the international drug ring through a confidential informant. She declined to provide further details.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www .twitter.com/gflaccus", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
