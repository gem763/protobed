Talton, playing in his first ever collegiate game, crushed it.\n\nTalton hadn't even known if he'd won the starting kicker job until Friday morning. As a walk-on, he was in an ongoing competition with the other kickers on the roster before being informed just hours before the game that he would be making his debut under the lights.\n\nBy the end of the night, he had sent the home crowd into hysterics, kicked the third-longest field goal in school history, and helped the Wolfpack to just its second win ever against a Big Ten opponent, per ESPN.\n\nIf you thought Talton's night couldn't get better from there, you'd be wrong. As the Nevada locker room celebrated its comeback victory, head coach Jay Norvell gave Talton the game ball, and announced taht the walk-on would be getting a full scholarship.\n\nTalton and his Nevada teammates will face another huge test next week when they travel to Oregon to play a Ducks team ranked 11th in the nation. If they can keep things close enough, they now know they have a kicker that can hit one when it counts.\n\nOur 7 best bets for Week 1 of the college football season\n\nLSU's football team has a new $28 million locker room \u2014 complete with sleep pods, a pool, and a mini theater\n\nJerry Jones says he expects Ezekiel Elliott's holdout to last into the regular season, and there doesn't appear to be an end in sight\n\nBuffalo Bills kicker Stephen Hauschka offered to help Carli Lloyd make the jump to the NFL and believes she could succeed", "description": "Brandon Talton played hero for the Nevada Wolfpack on Friday night, nailing a 56-yard field goal to give the big underdogs the win.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6a92102e22af48e61b8ee3-1920-960.jpg"}
