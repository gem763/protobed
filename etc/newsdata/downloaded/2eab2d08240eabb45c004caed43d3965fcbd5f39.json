Sales in the U.S. grew by 4.8%.\n\nIt took offerings and promotions, along with menu price increases, to boost sales, the Chicago-based company said. Renovated stores offering digital kiosks and other features also helped, it said.\n\nMcDonald's said Tuesday it notched $2.11 in earnings per share in the third quarter and $5.4 billion in sales. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings per share of $2.21 adjusting for one-time items, and $5.5 billion in sales.\n\nCompany executives said the income miss was minimal, while they chalked up differing ways of calculating margins to the gap with analysts on earnings.\n\nWrite to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 22, 2019 08:16 ET (12:16 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
