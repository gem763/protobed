Two in three Americans doubt the results of the official autopsy, a high but perhaps unsurprising figure, considering America\u2019s generally paranoid mood these days, and the legitimately odd circumstances of Epstein\u2019s death. Why, following an alleged attempt to kill himself on July 23, was Epstein taken off suicide watch after just six days? How could he have hung himself from the top bunk when the prison\u2019s bedsheets are as thin as paper? And how did a camera outside his cell happen to fail at the same time that two guards in his unit fell asleep, providing an unobserved window for whoever killed Epstein to kill Epstein?\n\nSkepticism about the official cause of Epstein\u2019s untimely end isn\u2019t confined to Twitter or gossipy co-workers trying to avoid talking Trump. In court, Epstein\u2019s defense team said they have \u201csignificant doubts regarding the conclusion of suicide.\u201d They argued that resolving the questions surrounding Epstein\u2019s death is vitally important, both to ensure that conditions improve for inmates at Metropolitan Correctional Center and to bolster public confidence in the legal system. Plus, said attorney Martin Weinberg, \u201cwe deeply want to know what happened to our client.\u201d\n\nThat is no doubt true \u2014 but like all aspects of the Epstein case, this point is tangled and complicated, and there are lots of angles for insiders to play.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what factors \u2014 practical, strategic, and otherwise \u2014 might be motivating Epstein\u2019s attorneys to challenge the official story about his death.\n\nPossible Explanation No. 1: Epstein\u2019s Attorneys Truly Doubt That the Facts Point to Suicide\n\nDuring a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 27 \u2014 which was convened to consider the prosecutors\u2019 request to drop the sex-trafficking charges against Epstein, and give his alleged victims an opportunity to speak \u2014 defense attorneys Reid Weingarten and Martin Weinberg called for a court investigation into their client\u2019s death, citing several details that cast doubt on the suicide ruling.\n\nNoting that they had their own doctor observe medical examiner Barbara Sampson\u2019s autopsy, Weinberg said, \u201cWe are told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken bones in Mr. Epstein\u2019s neck, his larynx, are more consistent with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide if you will, than with suicide.\u201d (Pathologist Michael Baden, who testified for O.J. Simpson\u2019s defense, observed the autopsy for the defense, but he wasn\u2019t cited by name at the hearing.) Weinberg acknowledged that these findings don\u2019t \u201cexclude suicide,\u201d but he said they raise \u201cprofound issues\u201d about what happened to Epstein.\n\nThe lawyers also asserted that suicide doesn\u2019t square with their client\u2019s state of mind in the days before his abrupt passing. \u201cAt or around the time of his death, we did not see a despairing, despondent, suicidal person,\u201d Weingarten said. Epstein had reason to be hopeful: His attorneys were on the verge of filing what they considered an ace-in-the-hole motion, which would argue that his non-prosecution agreement in Florida was \u201cglobal\u201d and could override the new sex-trafficking charges in New York. \u201cWe had a significant motion to dismiss,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cThis was not a futile, you know, defeatist attitude.\u201d\n\nIn the New York Post, a source \u201cfamiliar with the case\u201d went even further, claiming Epstein was in \u201cgreat spirits\u201d in the week before his death and that he told a lawyer on Friday \u2014 the day before he was found in his cell \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll see you Sunday.\u201d The financier had so much confidence in his team\u2019s pending motion that he seemed \u201cdelusional,\u201d according to the source.\n\nPossible Explanation No. 2: Epstein\u2019s Attorneys See a Natural Partnership With Victim Representatives in Seeking an Investigation\n\n\u201cTalk about a yikes,\u201d Weingarten remarked in court on August 27, describing multiple reported failures by MCC staffers. \u201cWe have heard allegations that people at the time who had responsibility for protecting our client falsified information,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand that there were orders out there that Jeffrey Epstein was never to be left alone and that the orders were ignored by many employees of the prison.\u201d\n\nThe attorney said the \u201c800-pound gorilla\u201d for the defense is the lack of usable video footage from around Epstein\u2019s cell, and questions about how long this \u201cstunning incompetence\u201d had gone on. Had the system been out for six months, or did it fail shortly before Epstein arrived? And \u201cwhat if the tapes only broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he was killed or the day he died?\u201d Weingarten mused. \u201cThen we\u2019re in a completely different situation.\u201d\n\nWeingarten alleged that in general, conditions at MCC are \u201cdreadful\u201d \u2014 \u201cnot just for Jeffrey Epstein, but for many of the prisoners over there.\u201d\n\nThe defense argued that the court should step in to get to the bottom of these issues \u2014 whether by holding hearings or assigning a lawyer to look into them \u2014 though there are already several ongoing federal investigations into Epstein\u2019s death. Weingarten said that while the defense has \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d in prosecutors from the Southern District and the FBI, \u201cthese are allegations against serious components of the United States Department of Justice. Sometimes the appearance of justice is just as important as justice itself.\u201d Court supervision is key \u201cfor the public to have confidence in the ultimate findings.\u201d\n\nThis request was quickly shot down by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey, one of three lead prosecutors in SDNY\u2019s case against Epstein. (She is the daughter of James Comey, the former FBI director central to that other vast international scandal.) Maurene Comey argued that a separate investigation \u201cinto uncharged matters,\u201d like the manner of Epstein\u2019s death, is not in the purview of the court.\n\nBut the request for a court investigation is one of few points of agreement between the defense and some of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims. Gloria Allred, who appeared at the same hearing representing five women who claim to have been abused by the financier, told New York that such a probe is essential \u201cbecause the system has failed in such a glaring way to provide justice for the victims and real accountability for Epstein.\u201d Allred, whose clients include alleged victims of R. Kelly and 33 women who accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that it ends\u201d at the suicide determination. \u201cOrdinarily it might, but because of the massive breakdown in this system, I think that the only neutral option would be the court.\u201d\n\nPossible Explanation No. 3: Suicide Complicates the Epstein Attorneys\u2019 Legal Task\n\nEven though Epstein is dead, many of the legal cases against him are not, and his attorneys will continue to represent the interests of his estate. In this context, there could be a compelling legal reason for the defense to cast doubt on a suicide determination. NYU School of Law professor Stephen Gillers notes that suicide can be \u201cintroduced in court to show consciousness of guilt amounting to a confession.\u201d There is precedent in New York as well: In the 2016 case People v. Matthews involving an appellate opinion in which the defendant was convicted of sexual conduct against a child, the Court \u201cadmitted evidence concerning [the] defendant\u2019s suicide attempt, including his suicide note, as relevant to his consciousness of guilt in prosecution.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Epstein\u2019s accusers will pursue this avenue, arguing that his suicide equates to an awareness of his guilt. Overturning the suicide determination could preempt this strategy, leaving the attorneys tasked with defending Epstein (or, following his death, preserving what\u2019s left of his fortune) with a simpler \u2014 but still difficult \u2014 task.\n\nPossible Explanation No. 4: Challenging the Suicide Ruling Could Prove Profitable for Epstein\u2019s Attorneys (and Others)\n\nThe will Epstein signed two days before his death put the value of his estate at $577 million \u2014 not including his art collection. But the suicide ruling may be a factor in how much money is ultimately available to Epstein\u2019s currently unidentified heirs, people owed compensation, and his alleged victims. Epstein\u2019s attorneys, of course, are obliged and motivated to work in the interests of the estate, which includes maximizing its assets.\n\n\u201cSome life-insurance policies do not pay if the person has committed suicide \u2014 as opposed to if they were murdered,\u201d notes Elie Honig, a white-collar defense attorney, former federal prosecutor, and CNN legal analyst. There\u2019s no public information on whether or not Epstein had life insurance, but it\u2019s common for high-net-worth individuals to buy policies. According to one wealth management consultant, life-insurance policies are often required for the profoundly wealthy to obtain loans (although Epstein\u2019s path to riches didn\u2019t involve a lot of conventional borrowing). The ultrarich are not always liquid, so life-insurance payouts can help cover big-ticket postmortem costs \u2014 like, say, paying elite white-collar attorneys to defend one\u2019s estate against claims from scores of young women and children.\n\nGetting to the bottom of MCC\u2019s failures could have side benefits for everyone seeking payment from Epstein\u2019s estate. \u201cIt is possible that the Epstein estate may assert a claim against the jail for negligent supervision,\u201d Gloria Allred proposed. \u201cIf circumstances of death result in successful claims by the estate against the jail, that could result in additional funds going into the estate that in turn could be potentially available to victims to file lawsuits and prove claims.\u201d An eventual win in that motion could mean a handsome payday for Epstein\u2019s lawyers.\n\nBradley Edwards, the Florida attorney who has represented several Epstein accusers since as early as 2005, nodded at this possibility during the August 27 hearing, saying that while no one was pleased by the defendant\u2019s passing, if it\u2019s determined that \u201cthere is some civil-rights violation and there is some civil remedy for Mr. Epstein that goes into the estate, certainly the victims are interested in that as they might help to repair the damage done.\u201d\n\nMartin Weinberg acknowledged, in a statement to New York, that the defense could pursue such a suit, but he suggested it would be for moral, not just monetary, reasons. \u201cIf we bring a federal lawsuit against the MCC, it is as much about principle as money,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should die in jail, and any lawsuit would be seeking to determine who was responsible for Mr. Epstein\u2019s death as well as for the horrific conditions in which he was detained.\u201d", "description": "In court, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s defense team questioned the ruling that he died by suicide.
