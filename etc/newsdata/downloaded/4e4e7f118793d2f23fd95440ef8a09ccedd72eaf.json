There are 22 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU.\n\nDiscussions between EU and UK officials had been held almost daily since the prime minister and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, met for lunch in Luxembourg in mid-September.\n\nThe Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had earlier this week called for the talks to intensify to try to secure a deal for leaders to sign off at an EU summit on 17 October.\n\nBut after a tumultuous Tuesday, during which unnamed Downing Street sources accused the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of wielding a veto on the UK leaving the EU\u2019s custom\u2019s union, the talks appear to have hit a wall.\n\nParliament set for Brexit showdown on 19 October Read more\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Juncker will address the European parliament later on Wednesday to report on the state of play.\n\nMeanwhile, the Times reported on Wednesday that the EU could throw Johnson a last-minute, time-limited Northern Ireland-only backstop. Senior EU officials said such a proposal was not being discussed.\n\nA 700-word text message to a journalist at the Spectator from an unnamed Downing Street source on Monday, widely attributed to Johnson\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, had predicted such an offer, and warned it would be rejected.\n\nMuch of the focus is now on Johnson\u2019s expected meeting with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday, with Barclay expected to meet Barnier for a working lunch in Brussels on the same day.\n\nBoth sides are keen to avoid blame for what Johnson himself has warned would be a \u201cfailure of statecraft\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, Varadkar had told the Irish broadcaster RTE that he believed it would be \u201cvery difficult to secure an agreement by next week\u201d.\n\n\u201cEssentially what the United Kingdom has done is repudiate the deal that we negotiated in good faith with prime minister [Theresa] May\u2019s government over two years and have sort of put half of that now back on the table and are saying, \u2018That\u2019s a concession\u2019. And, of course, it isn\u2019t really.\u201d\n\nKit Malthouse, the policing minister, insisted in an interview with the BBC that there was still hope of a deal. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a critical point \u2013 if there\u2019s ever a time for jaw-jaw rather than war-war, this is it.\u201d\n\nMinisters are preparing to summon MPs for a special Saturday sitting of parliament after next week\u2019s crucial EU summit.\n\nMPs are expected to be called back to Westminster on Saturday 19 October regardless of whether Johnson has been able to secure agreement on a Brexit deal.", "description": "Sources from both sides confirm that no further negotiations are scheduled", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf2abde864598364d67f39901f937e37f31c8999/0_271_4618_2770/master/4618.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4595ac32f1d5cb550f591571a467c912", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
