The same policeman [allegedly] fired shots to his girlfriend's mother and injured her. She is currently receiving medical attention in the area.\"\n\nEastern Cape police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni confirmed the matter has been referred to the (IPID) for further investigation.\n\nProvincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga has described the incident as \"shocking and devastating\" and has urged all parties involved to allow the IPID investigation to be conducted with the accuracy it deserves.\n\nShock\n\nFollowing the incident, the boxing community has been left \"saddened\" and \"in shock\", according to a post by Boxing South Africa to their Facebook page.\n\nJegels has not fought since August 2017 and has an unbeaten record of 9-0 with 7 knockouts.\n\nShe was expected to make her comeback in July in Saudi Arabia, however the tour was cancelled after the kingdom \"revoked the move saying that women shouldn't be involved in boxing, wrestling or any aggressive sport\", the Daily Dispatch reported.\n\nAccording to a statement posted by Boxing South Africa, issued by chairperson Dr Malefetsane Peter Ngatane, Jegels was scheduled to make a comeback in October.\n\nJegels\u2019 professional boxing career took off in 2014 and in two years she was named the South African Junior Bantamweight Champion. She later also became the WBA Pan African Junior Bantamweight Champion.\n\nAccording to Boxing South Africa, before joining boxing Jegels was a talented karateka who had achieved a black belt.\n\n\"What is also sad is the manner in which she lost her life, more especially at a time when the entire nation is busy bracing itself to celebrate the last weekend of the month of women,\" Ngatane said.\n\nThe EFF in the province has also spoken out against the violent incident during Women's Month.\n\n\"It is disturbing that as we end the month that is supposed to honour women, we have seen more death, more abuse and more missing young women. It is also disturbing that violence has been normalised in this country due to lack of law [enforcement] and of the judicial system in playing their roles,\" the provincial EFF said in a statement.\n\nThe suspect is expected to appear in court on Monday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
