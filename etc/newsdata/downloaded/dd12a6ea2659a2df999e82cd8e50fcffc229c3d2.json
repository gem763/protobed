(Picture: Getty/Epic Games)\n\nLady Gaga clearly won\u2019t be racing to buy the latest Fortnite release today as the popstar actually had to ask her Twitter followers exactly what the game was.\n\nThe Shallow singer caught wind of all the Fortnite buzz on Tuesday due to the release of the game\u2019s Chapter 2, which has sent gamers around the world into a frenzy.\n\nBut perhaps Gaga, 33, isn\u2019t much of a gamer after all as she posed the following question to her 79.7 million followers: \u2018What\u2019s fortnight [sic].\u2019\n\nGuessing she doesn\u2019t have an XBox or PlayStation on her tour bus these days.\n\nNeedless to say, Gaga\u2019s Twitter followers were absolutely stunned that she had no idea what Fortnite was \u2013 erm, only the biggest game on the planet \u2013 but they quickly filled her in with some brilliantly witty responses.\n\nFirst up was Ninja, who has managed to accumulate an estimate net worth of $10 million (\u00a37.8 million) from playing the game on Twitch (and now Mixer).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Call me on the Telephone. I\u2019ll give you a Million Reasons to play. You and I,\u2019 the streamer tweeted adding in a cheeky pun at the end relating to Gaga\u2019s 2011 song.\n\nRapper Juicy J chimed in: \u2018A very addictive video game that you can\u2019t stop playing once you enter.\u2019\n\nStreaming platform Twitch teased: \u2018We have some friends that can show you.\u2019\n\nExplaining it in terms Gaga would understand, the Twitter Gaming account replied: \u2018It\u2019s the ARTPOP of video games,\u2019 referring to the singer\u2019s third album.\n\nHighly amused by Gaga\u2019s ignorance, one follower weighed in: \u2018This is just the funniest tweet to ever exist.\u2019\n\nAnother joker who is clearly addicted to the game, quipped: \u2018The length of my longest relationship.\u2019\n\nFortnite: Chapter 2 was released earlier today (Picture: androidcentral.com)\n\nAnd bringing it back to the music, one fan said in relation to Gaga\u2019s elusive next album: \u2018Did you just said FOR TONIGHT? like your new single is coming out TONIGHT???\u2019\n\nOf course, the singer could have just been trolling all those Fortnite fans as she previously admitted she was addicted to playing video game Bayonetta.\n\nLast November, the singer tweeted: \u2018When you beat Chapter IV of Bayonetta and then realize Chapter V is going to kick your ass secret #gamergirl THE SHADOW REMAINS TOUGH!!!!!!\n\n\u2018Ok so I had to step away from the game for a minute to collect myself and now I\u2019m in the middle of Chapter X and the battleships just WHHHHHY?!!!!!!!!! [sic]\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018Still playing #Bayonetta middle of chapter XIII and my hands hurt and I have to sleep and it\u2019s 4 In the damn morning but this damn dragon with the face that I have to kill with my weave. Smh. Give it another go in the morning #gamer respect to the experts I need emotional support [sic].\u2019\n\nJeez, emotional support?
