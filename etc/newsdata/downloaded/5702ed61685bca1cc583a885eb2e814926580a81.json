The agency is proposing an automated system to deal with collision risk.\n\nA crash could have sprayed thousands of pieces of debris across a wide area, greatly increasing the chances of further collisions between satellites and clouds of space junk.\n\nWhile satellites have to dodge each other from time to time, \"it is really the first time that we had to do it with one of these big constellations,\" said Klaus Merz of ESA's space debris office.\n\nStarlink 44, which was launched in May, is part of a so-called mega constellation that will grow to thousands of satellites and with which SpaceX plans to provide internet services around the globe.\n\nMerz noted that despite not hearing from SpaceX anymore, at least ESA engineers knew which course Starlink 44 was on and were able to dodge the satellite.\n\n\"In the end the key information we needed was there.\"", "description": "A European space probe has performed an evasive manoeuvre to avoid a possible collision with another satellite after its operator, private firm SpaceX, failed to receive a warning message.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5151286.1558973291!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/starlink-trail.jpg"}
