But the Giants simply couldn\u2019t keep up with a Dallas offense anxious to see what could happen at full strength.\n\nAs expected, Elliott didn\u2019t seem to be in peak form after spending almost all of training camp trying to stay in shape in Mexico while waiting for the $90 million, six-year contract extension that was settled on the morning of the first full workout of the regular season.\n\nThe two-time NFL rushing champion did find a seam for a 10-yard touchdown to put the Cowboys up 35-10 late in the third quarter. Elliott finished with 53 yards on 13 carries.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be mindful of how many reps we gave him in the game,\u201d said coach Jason Garrett, noting he thought it was more than 30, including one catch for 10 yards. \u201cI think now over time, he\u2019ll practice a little more, get a little more game experience, he\u2019ll get more and more comfortable.\u201d\n\nThis going-away win was all about Prescott in his second career 400-yard game, in the first game of his fourth season.\n\nPrescott\u2019s representatives and the Cowboys were still trying to reach a deal on a new contract in the days before the opener, but now the issue will linger into the season. Perhaps the NFL\u2019s best bargain ($2 million salary in the final year of his rookie deal) isn\u2019t getting any less expensive.\n\nThe 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year thrived in his debut in Moore\u2019s offense, making several perfect throws on his way to a perfect passer rating of 158.3.\n\nPrescott completed 25 of 32 passes without an interception, finding seven different receivers while two of them had 100-yard days: Michael Gallup (seven catches for 158 yards) and Amari Cooper (six for 106).\n\nOne of the on-the-money tosses was a 21-yard touchdown to Cooper, who\u2019s in his first full season with Dallas after a midseason trade that boosted a stagnant offense and helped send the Cowboys to their second NFC East title in three seasons with Prescott and Elliott.\n\nPrescott babied a throw to Blake Jarwin because the tight end was so open over the middle on a 28-yard score that was Jarwin\u2019s fourth touchdown in two games against the Giants. The other three were in last year\u2019s finale at the Giants, also Prescott\u2019s other four-TD game.\n\nJason Witten - back for a club-record 16th season for Dallas (Manning reached the exact same milestone with the Giants) after a year in retirement as a broadcaster - scored his 69th career touchdown on a 4-yard grab.\n\nThe career high-tying TD pass for Prescott was to the newcomer among his receivers, Randall Cobb, who was wide open over the middle on the\n\nA multitude of offseason changes on defense didn\u2019t help the Giants, last in the NFC East in 2018. After taking the early lead on Manning\u2019s 1-yard toss to Evan Engram, they gave up TD drives of 75, 93, 83, 75 and 89 yards on five consecutive possessions from the first through third quarters.\n\nEMPTY YARDS\n\nBarkley ended up with 120 yards on 11 carries after the huge opening run along with four catches for 19 yards. But most of those yards didn\u2019t matter much because the Giants couldn\u2019t get the Cowboys off the field in the first half until the outcome had been decided. Engram had 10 catches for 110 yards. New York ended up with 470 yards.\n\nJONES DEBUTS\n\nDaniel Jones, the sixth overall choice in the draft, made his NFL debut in the final two minutes. Jones had a strong preseason after facing criticism when the Giants made the surprising pick. The heir apparent to the 38-year-old Manning was 3 of 4 for 17 yards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGiants: Home opener against Buffalo next Sunday.\n\nCowboys: At Washington next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nCorrects previous version with Elliott\u2019s touchdown coming late in third quarter, not early in third quarter.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ezekiel Elliott's workload in the opener didn't matter much after the Dallas Cowboys running back missed the entire preseason in a holdout.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/giants_cowboys_football_35326_c0-244-4059-2610_s1770x1032.jpg?b3a269c621806e338f11bb68feab3f946b47a169", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
