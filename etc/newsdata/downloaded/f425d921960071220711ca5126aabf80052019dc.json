The latest police operation has cost police \u00a321million, it emerged today\n\nReinforcements were needed from around the country as it took up to eight officers each to arrest uncooperative demonstrators and hours to complete paperwork due to a policy of non-compliance encouraged by Extinction Rebellion.\n\nMet Police Commissioner revealed today that the bill for this month's protests currently stands at \u00a321million, and is rising. More than 1,800 people were arrested during the two weeks.\n\nAround \u00a36million of this month's sum was spent on officers from 38 other forces while \u00a33.5million was spent on overtime for officers.\n\nThe \u00a321million figure is on top of the \u00a316million needed to deal with April's protests, when more than 1,100 people were detained.\n\nThe \u00a337million figure is equivalent to the salaries of around 1,200 police officers. By contrast, the Met only receives \u00a315million a year from the Mayor for its violent crime taskforce.\n\nPolice have previously said the strain of having to cope with the protests meant that officers were having to spend less time with victims of real crime elsewhere in the capital.\n\nThe group unveiled a giant octopus near Trafalgar Square during last weeks demonstrations\n\nPolice have also had to find space for 80 tonnes of equipment, including stages, sound systems and placards which they seized from demonstrators over the two weeks.\n\nExtinction Rebellion protests: The numbers April protests saw 1,100 people arrested and cost police \u00a316million.\n\nThis month's protests saw 1,800 arrested and cost police \u00a321million.\n\nOf that \u00a321m, \u00a36million was spent on officers from other forces, \u00a33.5million was spent on overtime.\n\nThe money spent on policing could have paid for 1,200 new officers or trebled the budget of the violent crime taskforce.\n\nMet chief Cressida Dick said the amount spent on the protests meant other areas were getting a worse service. She added: This is placing horrendous strain on London and the Met.'\n\nAmong the stunts the group pulled was the occupation of bridges across the Thames, gluing themselves to banks in the City and government departments, unveiling a giant octopus and having an army of breastfeeding mothers sit in the street.\n\nPublic sympathy to the group's cause dropped after one protester was seen kicking a commuter who tried to get him off a tube train at Canning Town.\n\nExtinction Rebellion responded to the police announcement by tweeting: 'The IMF (International Monetary Fund) warns of potentially infinite costs if the climate emergency is not addressed urgently.'\n\nThe cost is expected to rise after the protests continued this week, with topless Extinction Rebellion activists covering themselves in fake oil at the National Portrait Gallery on Sunday.\n\nDemonstrators laid down plastic sheets and had a black liquid poured on them in protest against the gallery's sponsorship by BP.", "description": "The eco group shut down parts of London for more than a week in April and returned again this month, hitting transport routes, businesses and government offices in two weeks of mayhem.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20031194-0-image-a-69_1571741518631.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
