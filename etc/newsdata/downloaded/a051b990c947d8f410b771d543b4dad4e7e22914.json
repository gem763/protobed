It\u2019s a Fashion Week Bat Mitzvah!", "language": "en", "text": "The cast of Susan Alexandra\u2019s fall 2020 show. Photo: Jennifer Isicoff/BFA\n\nSusan Alexandra is farklempt. It\u2019s Saturday afternoon on the second day of New York Fashion Week, and in just a few minutes, hundreds of people will arrive to her fashion-themed bat mitzvah, or rather, her bat-mitzvah themed fashion show on the 17th floor of the Public Hotel. The pink balloon tunnel is inflated. The all-lesbian Klezmer band, the Klezbos, is warming up. The only thing left to do is sew the lady of the hour into her butterfly-shaped rainbow tank top, which is currently falling off her body. \u201cI\u2019m overcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy outfit doesn\u2019t fit!\u201d\n\nBenny Drama. Photo: Jennifer Isicoff\n\nBased on this information alone, you\u2019d think Alexandra was a 13-year-old Jewess on her way to becoming a woman. But in reality, her name is Susan Korn, and she\u2019s a 34-year-old from Columbus, Ohio. A bubbly, positive yente by nature (with a degree in fashion marketing), she founded her own hand-painted jewelry line in 2014 after moving to New York, having what she describes as a \u201cbreakdown\u201d on the subway, and picking up crafting. Three years later, while walking her dog in Chinatown, she stumbled upon a tiny storefront filled with intricate beaded figurines, and instinctively asked the shop\u2019s owner, Lisa Deng, to fashion her a bag shaped like a watermelon. When she shared the final product on her Instagram, she received more feedback than any jewelry she\u2019d ever posted. It was a hit. She and Deng went into business, and have now sold thousands of colorful, childlike beaded accessories for $300-something a pop to adult customers around the world, including Gigi Hadid. Suri Cruise, an actual child, owns two. A full team of local employees make each piece by hand, and they\u2019re stocked at retailers like Saks and Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nIn February, Susan Alexandra hosted its New York Fashion Week debut at Baz Bagel on the Lower East Side. But this season, Korn wanted to mark the growth of her brand, which is now dabbling in ready-to-wear, and thought: What better way to do that than with a bat mitzvah? \u201cThe clothes I\u2019m making now are what I wish I would\u2019ve worn,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a do-over.\u201d The irony, of course, being that Korn is an adult woman who still wants to dress like the ideal version of her teenage self. Clearly, she\u2019s not alone. Fashion has always fetishized youth, but today\u2019s designers like Simon Porte Jacquemus \u2014 and even television shows like Pen15 \u2014 are looking to preserve a shiny, candy-colored, na\u00efve sense of childhood nostalgia with bags that look like toys, or at least tchotchkes.\n\nCrystal Mesh (left) dancing with Macarena with other models.

Korn shook her head \u2014 the show was bigger, maybe because Korn was the one planning it this time.\n\n\u201cMom, is this like my first bat mitzvah?\u201d Korn\u2019s mother, who is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, suddenly emerged.\n\n\u201cYour first bat mitzvah was more over-the-top,\u201d she yelled from across the room. \u201cThe theme was passion for fashion!\u201d\n\nPhoto: Jennifer Isicoff/BFA\n\nIt\u2019s true. The theme was \u201cpassion for fashion.\u201d Party favors included T-shirts with Korn\u2019s initials in the shape of the Calvin Klein \u201ccK\u201d logo. Each table was named after a different designer she idolized, from Donna Karan to Isaac Mizrahi. Her bat mitzvah video was even spliced with scenes from Mizrahi\u2019s documentary, Unzipped. \u201cIt was very avant-garde,\u201d Korn said with a laugh.\n\nThis time around, Korn threw herself her \u201cdream\u201d bat mitzvah. She DM\u2019ed the comedians, writers, and artists she idolized on Instagram and Twitter, asking them to model in the show. New Yorker writer Naomi Fry agreed to wear a beaded bag on her head for three hours in the name of passion, fashion, and Jewish culture. Jazmine Hughes of the Times was approached by her \u201cbest friend\u2019s sperm donor\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d Todd Heim, a.k.a. Steak Diane, who designs Susan Alexandra\u2019s ready-to-wear. (\u201cI\u2019m incredible at the Horah,\u201d Hughes said.) Hairdresser Masami Hosono, who invented those Instagram bangs, wore a wig. Benny Drama donned a pink rainbow dress. It was all the mishegoss of your social media feed, come to life and set to the soundtrack of the \u201cElectric Slide.\u201d Even Caroline Calloway was there.\n\nCatherine Cohen, Natasha Pickowicz, Jazmine Hughes, Naomi Fry, and Susan Korn. Photo: Jennifer Isicoff\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in heaven,\u201d said comedian Catherine Cohen as she sipped from a can of Babe ros\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a bag on my head. Ever since I was a little girl, I was like, I hope I can move to New York one day and have a bag on my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most adorable thing I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life,\u201d said the drag queen and self-identified shiksa Crystal Mesh, who wore a cherry print from head to toe and carried a watermelon-shaped bag. \u201cI\u2019m a walking picnic.\u201d\n\nSusan Korn. Photo: Jennifer Isicoff\n\nActivist and community organizer Adam Eli played Rabbi for the afternoon, inviting guests to hug their neighbor and give them a friendly \u201cMazel!\u201d before kicking things off. \u201cSusan comes from a long line of creative Jewish women,\u201d he said, invoking Ruth Bader Ginsberg\u2019s name as well, and everyone cheered. Of course, there was a traditional Horah dance, and Korn was lifted by her friends on a chair above their heads.\n\nA Torah portion was scrapped, but Korn still remembers her first. \u201cIt was about a woman who goes off into the unknown to create a new life for herself,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom always reminds me that that\u2019s my destiny.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
