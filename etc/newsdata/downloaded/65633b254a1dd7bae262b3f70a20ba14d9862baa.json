Pharmaceutical companies that refuse to negotiate could face steep penalties. Additionally, drugmakers that hike prices beyond inflation would have to pay rebates to Medicare.\n\nThe plan would limit copays for seniors covered by Medicare\u2019s \u201cPart D\u201d prescription drug program to $2,000.

If a compromise can be reached among House Democrats, the Trump White House and enough GOP lawmakers in the senate, a drug pricing package could be added to year-end budget legislation.\n\nIf both parties fail to reach a compromise, they will have to take their fight into the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation appears to be tailored to Pelosi\u2019s Democratic majority in the House but it also incorporates ideas from the Trump administration and from Republican and Democratic senators. However, many Republicans oppose the Medicare negotiations that are at the forefront of her plan, with a group of House Republicans led by Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., calling it \u201ca socialist proposal to appease her most extreme members.\u201d\n\nAmericans across party lines say lowering prescription drug costs should be a top priority for Congress this year. According to a new Fox News poll released on Wednesday, health care was named as the most important issue voters were taking into consideration when sizing up presidential candidates for the 2020 election.\n\nIn the poll, 10 percent of people named the issue as a \u201cdeal-breaker\u201d when choosing between nominees. How to handle the challenge of health care is an issue that is not only dividing politicians \u2013 but voters, too. According to the Fox News poll, 68 percent of people said they support expanding the Medicare program so that everyone has the option to buy in \u2013 if they choose to. Twenty-four percent of respondents opposed that measure, which is generally supported by more moderate Democratic candidates.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled an long-waited ambitious plan to lower drug prices.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/06/0/0/nancy-pelosi-ap1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
