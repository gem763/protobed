'By the time modern humans arrived it was breaking up into smaller ones \u2013 creating a wetland.'\n\nAnd she claims 'green corridors' of vegetation grew out of the wetland, which developed from a lake twice the size of the 23,000-square-mile Lake Victoria in Tanzania and Uganda, allowing people to migrate north-east and south-west.\n\nProfessor Hayes and her colleagues suggest that, as the climate changed some 130,000 years ago and the wetlands where the humans lived began to dry out, they migrated to the north-east (blue and green arrows) and the south-west (deep purple arrow) of Africa. The L0a, L0k and L0d1'2 are different variations of the original ancestral genes known as L0\n\nPeople still live in the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, Botswana. It is groups like these whose DNA gave scientists an insight into how modern humans may have been born from populations in the south of Africa. (Pictured: A group of Basarwa hunter/gatherers depart together on a foraging expedition on the salt pan)\n\nThe researchers traced different populations of the KhoeSan people, who are known to be those most closely related to the first modern humans who emerged some 200,000 years ago in Africa\n\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT OUR ANCESTORS? Four major studies in recent times have changed the way we view our ancestral history. The Simons Genome Diversity Project study After analysing DNA from 142 populations around the world, the researchers conclude that all modern humans living today can trace their ancestry back to a single group that emerged in Africa 200,000 years ago. They also found that all non-Africans appear to be descended from a single group that split from the ancestors of African hunter gatherers around 130,000 years ago. The study also shows how humans appear to have formed isolated groups within Africa with populations on the continent separating from each other. The KhoeSan in south Africa for example separated from the Yoruba in Nigeria around 87,000 years ago while the Mbuti split from the Yoruba 56,000 years ago. The Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel study This examined 483 genomes from 148 populations around the world to examine the expansion of Homo sapiens out of Africa. They found that indigenous populations in modern Papua New Guinea owe two percent of their genomes to a now extinct group of Homo sapiens. This suggests there was a distinct wave of human migration out of Africa around 120,000 years ago. The Aboriginal Australian study Using genomes from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 Papuans from New Guinea, this study examined the genetic origins of these early Pacific populations. These groups are thought to have descended from some of the first humans to have left Africa and has raised questions about whether their ancestors were from an earlier wave of migration than the rest of Eurasia. The new study found that the ancestors of modern Aboriginal Australians and Papuans split from Europeans and Asians around 58,000 years ago following a single migration out of Africa. These two populations themselves later diverged around 37,000 years ago, long before the physical separation of Australia and New Guinea some 10,000 years ago. The Climate Modelling study Researchers from the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa used one of the first integrated climate-human migration computer models to re-create the spread of Homo sapiens over the past 125,000 years. The model simulates ice-ages, abrupt climate change and captures the arrival times of Homo sapiens in the Eastern Mediterranean, Arabian Peninsula, Southern China, and Australia in close agreement with paleoclimate reconstructions and fossil and archaeological evidence. The found that it appears modern humans first left Africa 100,000 years ago in a series of slow-paced migration waves. They estimate that Homo sapiens first arrived in southern Europe around 80,000-90,000 years ago, far earlier than previously believed. The results challenge traditional models that suggest there was a single exodus out of Africa around 60,000 years ago.\n\nWetland is one of the healthiest ecosystems for sustaining life and would have been abundant enough for the human species to become established.\n\nThe climate then changed, drying out the land and causing the wetland to become what is now a region of salt pans and desert \u2013 this forced people to migrate.\n\nProfessor Hayes said: 'The first migrants ventured northeast, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled southwest.\n\n'A third population remained in the homeland until today.\n\n'In contrast to the northeasterly migrants, the southwesterly explorers appear to flourish, experiencing steady population growth.'\n\nTheir success was most probably from adapting to marine foraging \u2013 even learning how to scoop up seafood, including fish, with their hands.\n\nProfessor Hayes learns how to make fire with Ju\u01c0\u2019hoansi hunters in the now dried homeland of the greater Kalahari of Namibia\n\nProfessor Hayes's research is based on DNA studies of people living in the south of Africa which allowed them to track how closely people were related.\n\nShe studied something known as L0 mitochondrial DNA, which people inherit from their mother.\n\n'Mitochondrial DNA acts like a time capsule of our ancestral mothers, accumulating changes slowly over generations,' she said.\n\n'Comparing the complete DNA code, or mitogenome, from different individuals provides information on how closely they are related.'\n\nHer international team collected blood samples from 1,217 people to establish a comprehensive catalogue of the 'L0' lineage.\n\nProfessor Hayes said: 'This enabled us to pinpoint the ancestral homeland of all humans. It is the first time the exact location has been identified.'", "description": "Scientists from Sydney University believe all modern humans came from a community which lived in the prehistoric Makgadikgadi-Okavango wetlands to the south of the Zambezi River.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20277946-0-image-a-40_1572278724326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
