Duckworth: With Syria drawdown, Donald Trump turns his back on America's credibility", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Who are the Kurds and what does less U.S. troops in the region mean for the war against ISIS? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nSyrian Kurds would take risks, spill their own blood. Now, what ally will be willing to follow in their footsteps, knowing the U.S. could betray them?\n\nIn the most fractious, war-torn countries in the world, victories are rare and allies you can truly count on even rarer. Yet over the past five years, the United States had found that kind of partner in the Kurds, who were willing to fight \u2014 even die \u2014 by our troops\u2019 sides to defend the free world against the Islamic State and the terror it spread.\n\nThe relationship was symbiotic. We were reluctant to use ground troops in Syria to wage war against ISIS. The Kurds were willing to take that risk. They didn\u2019t have the air support or reconnaissance capability to actually defeat the terrorist group. We did.\n\nSo we stood shoulder to shoulder, retaking ISIS\u2019 caliphate inch by inch \u2014 and in the process, they became our brothers and sisters in arms.\n\nThey bled for us. They died for us. They guarded facilities where our personnel was based and protected our convoys as we drove through the Syrian streets. They did the unimaginable on-the-ground work of fighting ISIS face to face \u2014 work no one else in the world wanted to do but everyone benefited from, as they made all of our homelands safer with every target they captured.\n\nRoughly 11,000 Kurdish fighters sacrificed their lives for our shared mission against ISIS, doing what we asked them to do. Yet now \u2014 maybe because of cowardice, maybe because of corruption, maybe both \u2014 President Donald Trump has broken our word to those who\u2019ve sacrificed so much on our behalf, choosing to pander to an autocrat and clear the way for a Turkish offensive that has already left more of our allies dead and destabilized the entire region.\n\nTrump causes a long trail of disasters\n\nIn the days since Trump\u2019s decision, Iranian-backedwar criminal Bashar Assad has been able to consolidate his brutal rule over swaths of northern Syria, while Russia has strode back into the region, filling the power vacuum we left behind. According to the Pentagon, our own troops have been shelled by our ostensible ally, Turkey, while we\u2019ve likely lost the trust of human intelligence assets in the region who once would\u2019ve worked with us.\n\nAbout 100 ISIS fighters have broken out of Kurdish prisons that Trump all but physically unlocked, leading to real fears of a resurgent ISIS and greater odds that we\u2019ll have to send troops back into northern Iraq to re-wage war over feet of sand that we had won, trying to beat back the resurgent group along with the newly emboldened Iranian proxies.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Trump handed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan everything he could have asked for, including lifting all sanctions on Turkey while turning a blind eye to the Kurdish families that Erdogan is forcing out of their homes.\n\nBetrayed again: I fought alongside the Kurds. The United States can't abandon our fierce allies to Turkey.\n\nAnd somehow all this happened in just a couple of weeks.\n\nNone of those outcomes makes America great again or put America first. Instead, the list of consequences for our nation goes on and on \u2014 just as the list of American fatalities will, as anyone who has ever commanded a military unit will tell you that troops outside of Syria will be in graver danger as well because of the president\u2019s incompetence.\n\nFor decades, the United States has implemented a \u201cby, with and through\u201d approach to employing force, which aims to limit U.S. military engagement by working more creatively with our global partners.\n\nSyria is a headache, not a boon: Donald Trump made a shameful withdrawal from Syria. But is it really a win for Russia?\n\nRather than remaking the mistakes of wars past and romping around in somebody else\u2019s backyard, this approach helps curb American risk. Instead of deploying an armored division, we send groups of advisers to train, advise and assist our partners, allowing us to interweave our goals with theirs and, as we saw with our Kurdish allies, take advantage of our individual strengths, combining U.S. logistical support and air power with a partner nation's local knowledge and manpower.\n\nSen.

After all, who would want to partner with us if they know that one phone call could persuade us to sell them out to their enemies? Who would want to follow in the Kurds\u2019 footsteps, losing thousands of their bravest only to be betrayed \u2014 left to die without a second thought? And how could American troops serving today \u2014 those about to go on a night raid with our partners in Somalia or Afghanistan \u2014 not worry that those allies will abandon them now, just as we did to the Kurds?\n\nIf I were a division commander or special operations commander today, I would have spent the past week brushing off my operational plans, because with no ally around to help shoulder our burden, we\u2019ll have no choice but to send more American troops when ISIS regroups and raises their black-and-white flag once again.\n\nWithout allies' trust, America is alone\n\nWith one decision, Trump shredded our credibility, wrecked our foreign policy and endangered both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s troops.\n\nIn a war zone, trust is sacred, and anyone who has served in this particular region can tell you the beyond-catastrophic consequences that are sure to arise if the bond between us and our local partners is severed.\n\nStarting from the second my unit landed in Iraq in March 2004 as part of Task Force Eagle, I was only able to complete my missions because of the support our allies gave and the human intel our sources provided.\n\nEditorial Board: Syria policy wasn't broke. Why is Donald Trump wrecking it?\n\nWhen we flew northwest toward the Syrian border to insert listening patrols to investigate smuggling routes, or when I delivered troops from one battlefield to the next, I did it with the backing of our partners, who believed that the United States military wouldn\u2019t forsake them once they served their purpose.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks away after speaking to the media on October 23, 2019 ,in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)\n\nBut because of Trump, those partners now have no reason to trust us, and our troops in harm\u2019s way will be in even greater danger as they\u2019ll have fewer friends to rely on in a region where enemies abound.\n\nSen. Rand Paul: President Trump moves to stop 'endless wars.' I stand with him.\n\nNow, we\u2019re at a turning point. Over the past couple of weeks, bipartisan congressional majorities have pleaded with Trump to reverse the course he set us on. But it\u2019s up to Trump to stop hiding the horrors of what he has allowed to happen and actually do the right thing.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take Trump setting aside his ego and actually working with Congress, our allies and the players in the region to come up with a long-term solution to piece back together the equilibrium he chose to shatter.\n\nBecause I\u2019m tired of Trump wrapping himself in the flag in the morning then abandoning our troops and our values by the afternoon. He has put our country, and our world, at a crossroads. In this moment, he\u2019d do well to show even an ounce of the bravery that our Kurdish partners show every day and start protecting American interests rather than ceding them to whichever autocrat calls him next.\n\nSen.
