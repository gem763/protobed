Here's the best way to get your 40 winks\n\nCLOSE Could taking a quick nap improve your health? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nNapping is not just for babies.\n\nHealthy adults can benefit from a quick 40 winks, too. Like our younger counterparts (aka our kids), adults see benefits such as increased alertness, improved mood, reduced fatigue, better performance and greater relaxation.\n\nBut there are some things to consider to get the most out of a nap. Poor napping habits include napping at the wrong time of day (too close to bed time) or for too long.\n\nTo make your nap time better, consider these tips:\n\nKeep naps short. Aim to nap for only 10 to 30 minutes. The longer you nap, the more likely you are to feel groggy afterward. Take naps in the afternoon. The best time for a nap is usually midafternoon, around 2 or 3 p.m. This is the time of day when you might experience post-lunch sleepiness or a lower level of alertness. In addition, naps taken during this time are less likely to interfere with nighttime sleep. Keep in mind, however, that individual factors \u2014 such as your need for sleep and your sleeping schedule \u2014 can play a role in determining the best time of day to nap. Create a restful environment. Nap in a quiet, dark place with a comfortable room temperature and few distractions.\n\nBelieve it or not, not everyone is suited for a nap. Napping too much or too long can cause nighttime sleep issues if someone is prone to restless sleep. Prolonged napping can also cause sleep inertia \u2014 that feeling of being groggy and disoriented after waking up from a nap.\n\nOf course getting an adequate amount of sleep at night is the best way to recharge, reenergize and stay on a healthy track. If you\u2019re not getting enough sleep or notice changes in your sleep patterns, please talk with your doctor.\n\nLois Krahn, M.D. is a psychiatrist and a sleep specialist at Mayo Clinic Arizona.\n\nLike All the Moms?
