Gov. Gavin Newsom pardons 3 immigrants facing deportation", "language": "en", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California\u2019s governor announced Friday that he is pardoning three more immigrants facing the possibility they will be deported, continuing a string of such actions that challenge the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigrants who committed crimes.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom also commuted the life sentences of two youthful offenders who can now seek parole.\n\nNewsom\u2019s office said the three facing deportation \u201cmade bad decisions\u201d while breaking the law as teenagers or young adults, but they served their sentences and transformed their lives. Deporting them now would be \u201can unjust collateral consequence\u201d harming their families and communities.\n\nThe three hail from Iran, El Salvador and Cambodia, but all now live in Los Angeles County. He also pardoned a fourth man, Curtis Reynolds, 59, of Sacramento County, who was convicted of six drug felonies between 1998 and 2003.\n\nPardons do not automatically protect someone from deportation because they don\u2019t erase the criminal convictions on which deportation orders often are based. But they do emphasize the person\u2019s rehabilitation. Superior court judges previously granted two of the three immigrants, plus Reynolds, certificates of rehabilitation and recommended that they receive pardons.\n\nNewsom and his predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, have granted several such commutations since Trump took office.\n\nThe three newly pardoned immigrants are:\n\n- Arnou Aghamalian, 42, who was convicted 20 years ago of helping his cousin set an unoccupied car on fire. The car belonged to a nightclub manager who had been arguing with his cousin. Aghamalian now owns a solar energy company and has a wife and twin newborns, according to Newsom\u2019s office. He legally entered the U.S. as a refugee from Iran with his family when he was 15.\n\n- Victor Ayala, 38, who was convicted of felony robbery in 2001 when he shoved a security guard after shoplifting items from an electronic store. He had four prior misdemeanor convictions for theft and a hit and run in which no one was injured. The father of three now runs a carpet cleaning business. He was 2 years old when he and his parents lawfully came to the U.S. from El Salvador.\n\n- Thear Sam, 41, who was convicted of robbing a man of his wallet and backpack when he was 18. He was later convicted of being an accessory after he separately gave a man a ride after the man stole a car, led police on a high-speed chase and escaped on foot. He has worked for more than 17 years for an aviation company, and his wife and daughter are both U.S. citizens. He was 4 when he lawfully entered the U.S. as a refugee from Cambodia fleeing the Khmer Rouge.\n\nSeparately, the two men whose life sentences Newsom commuted can now go before the state parole board, which will decide if they can be safely released into the community. They also are both from Los Angeles County:\n\n- Esdvin Flores, 44, has served more than 20 years for pointing a gun at a victim while his crime partner pulled a gold chain from her neck. Newsom\u2019s office said he has since been mentoring at-risk youth.\n\n- Jensen Ramos, 35, has served 17 years for attempted murder after shooting at a fleeing vehicle following a fight at a house party, though no one was injured. He is a lead trainer in the Paws for Life rescue dog training program, which says it has had the most commutations of life sentences of any program in the state.\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California's governor announced Friday that he is pardoning three more immigrants facing the possibility they will be deported, continuing a string of such actions that challenge the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants who committed crimes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Don Thompson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/california_governor_pardons_04504_c0-216-3000-1966_s1200x700.jpg?6b74682e74f9ee2f81a5c29fa0d3887532658157", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
