(University Archives Photo Collection / Library Special Collections / San Diego State University)\n\nWhat made Martin Bernheimer great? Let me count the ways . . .\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The below is an expanded version of a piece that appears in the current issue of National Review.\n\nEveryone is unique, we are taught in kindergarten. That is a fine sentiment. But can we acknowledge that some are uniquer than others? Martin Bernheimer was virtually the uniquest. He was a great critic, of music in particular. He had a first-class mind and a first-class pen. But he was also one of the most extraordinary personalities you\u2019ll ever meet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will supply some biographical information, before getting to the guts of Martin.\n\nHe was born in Munich in 1936 \u2014 a ticklish time and a ticklish place for such a boy. The family made it out. Martin grew up in Massachusetts. He went to Brown University, and then the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik in Munich, and then New York University. He had a particular love for, and expertise in, Richard Strauss.\n\n\u201cPossibly my fave opera,\u201d he once wrote me about Der Rosenkavalier. \u201cBut with age, I wish the last act would begin with the Trio.\u201d He wanted a shorter, less messy evening \u2014 and I know just how he feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a young man, he worked for the New York Herald Tribune and then The Saturday Evening Post, where he was an assistant to Irving Kolodin (one of the leading critics in America). He had his biggest tenure at the Los Angeles Times, where he worked from 1965 to 1996. (He wrote about dance, as well as music, in L.A.) In 1982, he won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I knew him, he was back in New York, writing for the Financial Times. I could keep going in a biographical vein, but let\u2019s get to the guts of the guy.\n\nRob Kapilow does a classical-music program for National Public Radio called \u201cWhat Makes It Great?\u201d In that same spirit, I ask, \u201cWhat made Martin Bernheimer great?\u201d And I will count the ways.\n\nFirst, he had a rare intelligence. Second, he had a deep and wide knowledge. Third, he had an understanding of criticism. He knew what it was (and wasn\u2019t). Fourth, he had taste \u2014 the sine qua non. Fifth, he could write, marvelously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe English language was his plaything. He could be straight, and formally elegant, and he was utterly strict about grammar, the meaning of words, etc. But he loved his puns and other wordplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout a static and boring opera production, he would write, \u201cThe inaction takes place in . . .\u201d Another line was, \u201cWhen all was said and undone . . .\u201d There is a type of singing voice called a \u201cbaryton-Martin\u201d (a light, tenorial baritone). Bernheimer once joked to me that he was a \u201cbase Martin.\u201d\n\nLike some other erudite and serious people, he tended to deflect things with jokes. Another late colleague of mine, Michael Potemra of National Review, did the same thing.\n\nAt the FT, Martin was given very little space \u2014 very little room for his reviews. He made the most of it. These little reviews were like cut gems. They were \u201clapidary,\u201d to use a Bill Buckley word.\n\nHere is one opening sentence: \u201cIt was an odd, though, at 95 minutes, a blessedly brief night at Carnegie Hall.\u201d Here is another: \u201cRemember A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Shakespeare\u2019s convoluted comedy of errors and eros, first performed around 1597? Forget it.\u201d Okay, that was two sentences. Same difference.\n\nHe could be very tough, famously tough \u2014 infamously so. A friend of mine nicknamed him \u201cMartin Slash-and-Bernheimer.\u201d The headline of an obit called him a \u201cprizewinning music critic with a lacerating pen.\u201d Yes, but he lacerated with a twinkle in his eye. And he was happy to give credit where it was due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce, I said to him, \u201cI hate to keep slamming these stupid opera productions. I feel repetitive, and I feel like a fuddy-duddy.\u201d He said, \u201cYou must keep slamming them. Then, when something is praiseworthy, you\u2019re all the more credible.\u201d\n\nI have not yet mentioned what was maybe Martin\u2019s most important quality: his honesty. His boldness. He had the boldness of honesty. Martin said what he thought, without pulling punches.\n\nMany of us say we write \u201cwithout fear or favor.\u201d Bernheimer actually did.\n\nHe did not feel the need to socialize with musicians. He did not have to be in the good graces of presenters, publicists, and others in the \u201cbusiness.\u201d He was allergic to hype, allergic to spin. He had no use for fads.\n\nAlso, he had no agenda. Let me illustrate what I mean. Many a critic feels he has to treat new music with kid gloves. New music is to be defended, nurtured, promoted. This was not Martin\u2019s view of his job. If he thought the music was good, he said so. And if not . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was a real critic.\n\nMartin had a constituency of one, so to speak: his readers. Not performers, editors, employers, colleagues, donors, or anyone else \u2014 his readers. He felt he owed them his best critical judgment, period.\n\nIt was not easy to have Martin Bernheimer in your employ, great as he was. In L.A., they howled for his scalp. The publisher, Otis Chandler \u2014 bless his name forever \u2014 stood by him.\n\nOnce, Martin sent me a review he had written for the FT (in manuscript form). I singled out a particular passage for praise. He answered, \u201cFT editors, suddenly hyper-cautious, junked the very line/paragraph you (and I) liked. Said I was too cruel. Moi? Cruel? Made me not sad, just pissed.\u201d That did not happen often, however.\n\nYou may wonder why I\u2019m not quoting the line/paragraph. It would take too long to place it in context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, there was a purity about Martin Bernheimer. If he heard me say this, he would snort and crack wise. A couple of years ago, I was worried about him, and said I was thinking about him. He replied, \u201cThink impure thoughts.\u201d But he was pure, certainly in his work.\n\nFor years, I would see him in the aisles of concert halls and opera houses. In an opera house, we would have a little game, or shtick. One of us would say something like, \u201cWhat are we reviewing tonight? The one about the Gypsy girl who gets buried alive with her lover?\u201d (That would be a conflation of Carmen and Aida.) \u201cNo,\u201d the other might say. \u201cIt\u2019s the one where the hunchback leaves his daughter in the ring of fire.\u201d (A conflation of Rigoletto and Die Walk\u00fcre.)\n\nOne afternoon, we were at a concert performance of Tristan und Isolde, which included a video, projected on a large screen. Young actors depicted the characters in the opera \u2014 full frontally. When he saw me at intermission, Martin said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Tristan was Jewish.\u201d\n\nFairly often, people would ask him at intermission, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he would reply. \u201cI haven\u2019t read the review yet.\u201d (Some people over-rely on reviews.) They did not ask him anything after the performance, however. He got out of there like a bat out of hell. His work was done \u2014 at least until he wrote \u2014 and he did not want to hang out or hold forth.\n\nFor many years, we corresponded by e-mail, and his side of the correspondence would be a literary hit, the world over \u2014 although it would have to be censored, if not banned, in a number of countries.\n\nWe sent each other our reviews, the day after. We did not always agree, far from it. He considered some of my views antediluvian. (Politically, too. He would be amazed to be f\u00eated in National Review.) But did we ever understand and appreciate each other.\n\nI would praise something he had written, and he\u2019d say, \u201cThat warms the old cockles.\u201d One of my reviews, I ended with some statement of his. I then told him, \u201cI think Bernheimer ought to have the last word, don\u2019t you?\u201d He wrote back, \u201cAnd the first and the middle and . . .\u201d\n\nOnce, he said to me, \u201cYou really nailed that lil\u2019 pekka.\u201d I had written a negative review of Esa-Pekka Salonen, the conductor (whom I generally esteem). Salonen had been the music director in Los Angeles. \u201cWe did not have a pleasant relationship,\u201d Martin told me \u2014 \u201cdespite my charm and his talent . . .\u201d\n\nIn late December 2006, we covered a new opera called \u201cThe First Emperor.\u201d Neither one of us was enchanted. I sent him my review on the 25th, as it happened. He wrote back, \u201c\u2018The First Emperor,\u2019 on this holy day?\u201d (He then said, \u201cI ain\u2019t got no holy days.\u201d) For some reason, this line struck me as hilarious, and I would quote it over the years: \u201cThe First Emperor, on this holy day?\u201d\n\nWe had other lines, regularly quoted \u2014 his lines, mainly. He would grin and tell me I was his \u201cbest Boswell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFighting ill health, I think \u2014 he was not too explicit, and I never pressed \u2014 he retired just before the 2017\u201318 season. I wrote an appreciation of him for The New Criterion. \u201cDid I get the biographical facts right?\u201d I asked him. He answered, \u201cEvery semidemihemiquaverette.\u201d He appreciated the appreciation. \u201cLinda joins me in awful awe,\u201d he said, referring to his wife Linda Winer, a distinguished theater critic.\n\nAbout himself, he added, \u201cPlease tell no one, but you actually inspired a furtive tear.\u201d (\u201cUna furtiva lagrima\u201d \u2014 \u201cA furtive tear\u201d \u2014 is a famous tenor aria, from The Elixir of Love.)\n\nAround this time, I said to him, \u201cYou were/are the best. Hands down.\u201d He did not contradict me. What he said was, \u201cWe are. 4 hands down.\u201d\n\nOver the next season or so, he would send me notes of the brightest, most encouraging kind: \u201cRight on. Write on.\u201d In one of our last exchanges, I wrote him from the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway. I ended my e-mail, \u201c. . . and greetings from Oslo, town of beautiful blondes and tasty fish.\u201d He replied, \u201cI\u2019ll take the blondes, u take the fish.\u201d\n\nEventually, he could not write at all, this glittering, glorious writer, and he passed away in late September 2019. (\u201cSeptember\u201d is one of Strauss\u2019s Four Last Songs. The final one is \u201cIm Abendrot,\u201d meaning, \u201cAt Sunset.\u201d) I loved him, as you can tell. Many of us did. He set an example for writers. And it was such a kick to know him, I tell you. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s gone, but he\u2019s not, really \u2014 gone, that is. I will often think of him, and grin, gratefully.", "description": "Martin Bernheimer was a great critic, of music in particular. He had a first-class mind and a first-class pen.
