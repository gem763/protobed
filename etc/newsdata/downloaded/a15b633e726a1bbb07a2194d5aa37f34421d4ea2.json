House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern (D-MA) said the resolution provides \u201ca clear path forward\u201d as the House begins a public phase of the impeachment inquiry, which has largely been conducted behind closed doors.\n\nThe resolution directs \u201ccertain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, president of the United States of America, and for other purposes,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe document gives House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) the lead role in the investigation, giving him power to organize the questioning of witnesses. The committee will take over the probe, which until now has been handled by three committees, including intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight and reform.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election. Following in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct,\u201d House Democrat leaders said in a joint statement.\n\nThe White House responded to the House Democrats\u2019 release of the text, calling the impeachment inquiry an \u201cillegitimate sham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote. It continues this scam by allowing Chairman Schiff, who repeatedly lies to the American people, to hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the President, the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House\u2019s rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written. This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, President Trump slammed the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe, calling recent developing nothing more than \u201cmade up garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nThe AP and UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "House Democrats posted the text of their impeachment resolution as a planned vote on the measure looks increasingly less certain this week.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1157611757-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
