We can't count on Rudy (Gobert) every game... He was huge. He wasn't scared by Bogut & Baynes... He was amazing tonight.\"\n\nFrance knocked the U.S. out of the knockout round by besting them in the quarterfinals. Poirier didn't play in that game, but has played a big role for France behind All-Star big man Rudy Gobert.\n\n\"It's clear that he's a center that can block shots and control the paint,\" Batum said. \"He's a terrific roller, can really catch a lob, and obviously has a lot of energy. It's a good pick-up for Boston, for sure.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Celtics responded to Horford's departure and trading Baynes to Phoneix by signing Poirier and Enes Kanter to join Theis and Robert Williams at the center spot. Boston will probably have to solve their hole at that position by committee, but if Poirier can play consistent defense, rebound and protect the paint as Batum describes, he could earn himself backup minutes behind Kanter.\n\nEither way, it should be an interesting training camp to say the least for this new-look Celtics team.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
