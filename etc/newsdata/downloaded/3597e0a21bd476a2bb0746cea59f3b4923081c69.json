We are still in the process of adjudicating and determining and, if I may, I'd like to leave it at that but with an assurance ... that the facts and circumstances have triggered an inquiry and an inquiry is under way.\n\n\"We are conducting it in the appropriate manner and it is being handled and coordinated by, amongst others, our general counsel, our people and development team and I am also involved.\"\n\nLabor senator Jenny McAllister asked Mr Shipton to take three further questions on notice, including whether Mr Saadat had had access to sensitive regulatory information.\n\n\"Mr Saadat was involved in high-level decision-making about regulatory policy and I wish to understand the protections that were in place during his employment in relation to his obligations to keep that information confidential,\" she said.\n\nSenator McAllister also wanted to know about Mr Saadat's access to commercially sensitive information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mr Saadat was helping lay the development of the position on the buy now, pay later sector and there were industry consultations as part of that process,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd like to understand whether Mr Saadat would have been given access to commercially sensitive information about buy now, pay later sector competitors.\"\n\nThe third question was about whether Mr Saadat was engaged in conversations about employment with Afterpay when he previously gave evidence to the Senate committee about the buy now, pay later sector.", "description": "Mr Saadat previously led an ASIC inquiry into buy now, pay later businesses and gave evidence on behalf of ASIC to the banking royal commission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1171%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2f2c99d51256b898cd9117b20b8cec488e828219", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
