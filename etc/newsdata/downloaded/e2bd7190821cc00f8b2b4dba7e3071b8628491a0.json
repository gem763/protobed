The adult children watching the loan transactions take place complain that their parents feel obligated to help or guilty if they don\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy 55-year-old sibling has repeatedly asked my parents for emergency loans, mostly to cover bills,\u201d a reader wrote to me recently. \u201cSometimes they have declined to assist, and sometimes they have helped. Some requests were for smaller amounts, like $2,000, and other times for larger amounts, like $25,000. So far, the loans have been paid back, but some money is still outstanding. What is your opinion on requiring some documentation or transparency on my sibling\u2019s financial affairs when loaning money? One parent says it\u2019s not worth it, especially for the smaller amounts. The other parent hasn\u2019t articulated an opinion. Any other thoughts on guidelines about loaning money like this?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHaving been in the position of being an ATM for various family members, I no longer lend any money to anyone. If the request is justifiable (more on this later) and I can afford it, I just give the person the money. By giving rather than lending, you avoid the possibility of a broken relationship when the broke relative or friend doesn\u2019t repay.\n\nBut if you do choose to lend money to someone, here are four basic rules to follow:\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d does not apply. Loans between friends and family can be awkward. The person asking may find it difficult to admit to needing a loan. And the family member providing the funds may not want to ask too many questions at the risk of embarrassing the person requesting assistance. So often there is very little exchange of financial information.\n\nAD\n\nBut if you\u2019re lending money, you should probe and require proof of need. Treat the request as an actual lender might. The bank would want to view the person\u2019s income, expenses and debt information to determine ability to repay \u2014 and so should you.\n\nIs this too invasive? It is not.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nUpon review of bank statements, you may find evidence that your adult child is living above his means, such as eating out a lot. Don\u2019t lend money to people who earn enough to cover their expenses, but can\u2019t because of mismanagement. That\u2019s not helping. That\u2019s enabling bad behavior. Why should they enjoy the fruits of your frugality while they are living it up?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSometimes people ask for money before exhausting other funding sources, such as trimming unnecessary expenses. If you\u2019re asking for $200, you\u2019d better not still be paying for cable or streaming services.\n\n\u25cf Assess the need for money. This is not about being hypercritical of their lifestyle. Just because there\u2019s a request doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a need. Perhaps your adult child is underemployed. Maybe your daughter and her husband bought too much house and need to downsize. If your adult child is constantly asking for loans, there\u2019s probably an underlying situation that needs to be addressed. Your handing over money all the time prevents this analysis.\n\n\u25cfThe loan should come with conditions. If you want to end a habitual cycle of borrowing, require your adult child to take a budgeting class or get credit counseling from a nonprofit agency. If the loan is needed for a bill, you should pay the creditor directly. By the way, do not lend money you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Make the loan legit. Get in writing all the loan terms, such as when you expect to be paid back and the consequences if you aren\u2019t.\n\nYou may feel uncomfortable treating a personal loan so businesslike, but if someone is borrowing money from you, that person \u2014 even if it\u2019s your adult child \u2014 owes it to you to be transparent.\n\n\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
