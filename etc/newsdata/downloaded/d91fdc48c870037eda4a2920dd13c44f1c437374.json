Nearly 150 Cambodian officials and seven volunteers continued searching the island and surrounding areas on Tuesday, the fourth day of large-scale searches.\n\nOfficers have been speaking to six Cambodian men. \u201cThey are being questioned,\u201d the provincial deputy police chief, Nop Panha, told AFP. \u201cWe are not drawing any conclusions yet.\u201d\n\nIt is believed the men were being interviewed as potential witnesses rather than as suspects in any crimes. On Monday a Koh Rong official working with police said that there had been no arrests related to the search.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amelia Bambridge, 21, who has gone missing in Cambodia.

On Monday Harry Bambridge, Amelia\u2019s brother, was accompanied by police as he searched the man\u2019s possessions in the hostel.\n\nHarry Bambridge has complained about a lack of support from the British government regarding the search. He said the family met police in their HQ in Sihanoukville on Tuesday morning. He wrote on social media: \u201cEveryone\u2019s [Cambodian officials] said that they\u2019re not going to stop until she\u2019s found, so I feel a little bit more positive.\u201d\n\nOn Monday Amelia\u2019s father, Phil Bambridge, said he was losing hope she would be found alive. Sniffer dogs from Phnom Penh were expected to arrive on Koh Rong on Tuesday to help with the search. Extra boats were being dispatched from Sihanoukville for the ocean search.\n\nOfficials and volunteers have placed added focus on checking fishing boats that may have been near Police Beach, where Bambridge went missing. Her backpack, containing items including her bank cards and phone, was found on rocks by the beach on Thursday morning.\n\nBen Warner, a leader of the volunteer search team, said: \u201cWe\u2019re running out of areas where we can look on land, so we\u2019re trying to look at ways that she could have got off the island.\u201d\n\nLaura Link, another leader of the volunteer search team, appealed for anyone with photos of boats around Police Beach to get in contact.\n\nA police spokesperson said: \u201cAt this point it\u2019s still an all-area search. They\u2019re searching under the rocks in the ocean and on top of the ocean, but now they want to get in the jungle. All departments are here today: police, navy, military.\u201d\n\nRyan Harris, 18, from Worcester, travelled to Koh Rong with Bambridge on 19 October after befriending her in Phnom Penh. He spent Monday with her family on the island and appealed for anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re appealing for information from anyone who was at the party then [Wednesday night] or in the last few months, anyone who might have seen anything sketchy or suspicious,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe family are doing well considering the circumstances. They just want to know what happened, same as everyone else.\u201d", "description": "Cambodian officials say six men have been interviewed about Briton\u2019s disappearance", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44230855e2fdd5281417b27ff37d81619ad8e309/0_166_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=62ca3e47a20b8d9439ae8f73296c025a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
