Abe will then lead three cheers for the new emperor, bringing the 30-minute ceremony to a close.\n\nAbout 16.1 billion yen ($148 million) has been earmarked for succession-related ceremonies throughout the year, including the enthronement ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIPLOMACY\n\nAbe has said representatives from more than 190 countries and international organisations will likely join the celebration.\n\nThose include Britain's Prince Charles, who along with Princess Diana also attended Akihito's enthronement ceremony, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon.\n\nDomestic media said Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will also likely attend, and that Abe will hold talks with some 50 foreign leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nBANQUETS\n\nA court banquet will begin at 7:20 p.m. with foreign dignitaries as well as the representatives of the Japan's executive, legislative and judicial branches and their spouses.\n\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, his Harvard-educated, ex-diplomat wife, will host a tea party for foreign royalty the following afternoon. Abe will then host a banquet for about 900 foreign leaders and other delegation members at Tokyo's Hotel New Otani in the evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nPARDONS\n\nThe Asahi Shimbun daily reported on Wednesday the government had told the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that it planned to grant pardons to about 550,000 people to mark Naruhito's enthronement.\n\nAnother daily, the Mainichi, said this month the planned pardon is targeted at petty criminals, and they will have restrictions on their legal rights lifted. In Japan, those who are convicted and fined are banned from obtaining physicians', nurses' and some other licenses for five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESSION\n\nThe government has postponed a procession due after the enthronement ceremony as the country grapples with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, which hit over the weekend and killed at least 77 people.\n\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako were due to ride in an open-top Toyota Century limousine through central Tokyo.\n\nAbe said a new date had not been picked but public broadcaster NHK reported it would be rescheduled to Nov. 10.\n\nSome 120,000 people, many waving national flags, lined the route to cheer Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko as they passed by in a Rolls-Royce Corniche III after his enthronement.\n\n(Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka Editing by Robert Birsel)", "description": "Japanese Emperor Naruhito is set to proclaim his enthronement to the world next week in a centuries-old ceremony attended by some 2,500 people, including heads of state and other dignitaries from nearly 200 countries.
