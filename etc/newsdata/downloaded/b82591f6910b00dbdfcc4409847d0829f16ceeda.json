We had an English week, he played everything,' Favre said after the 2-2 draw.\n\n'He is 19 years old and it is completely normal. He knows he's a bit tired and needs a little break. It's not easy to do the English weeks. It's part of it, it's our job.'\n\nDortmund took the lead through a stunning Axel Witsel volley, but the hosts equalised early in the second half with Luca Waldschmidt getting on the score sheet.\n\nDortmund were frustrated after a late own-goal meant they got their third draw of the season\n\nAfter taking the lead twice in the match and failing to get three points, Favre admitted his side could have done more to win.\n\n'You don't get many chances to score. We've made mistakes in pressing, in conquering the ball. There was no aggressiveness,' he said.\n\n'We go into the duels like this. They counter and we lose the ball unnecessarily. If we can't intervene, we come back, if we can intervene, we have to go into the duel. Then we have to be tough for 90 or 95 minutes.'\n\nBorussia Dortmund are currently seventh in the Bundesliga table, two points behind league leaders Bayern Munich.", "description": "Jadon Sancho made a cameo appearance in Borussia Dortmund's 2-2 draw with Freiburg.
