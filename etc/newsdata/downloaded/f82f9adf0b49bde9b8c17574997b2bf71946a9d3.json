Bunch III became the secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, he was the founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. When Donald Trump first became president, Bunch gave him a private tour of the museum - and what happened that day disappointed the then-director enough that he wrote about it in his upcoming memoir.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that, in Bunch's memoir, he describes how at first, the Trump administration requested that the president and Secretary of Housing and Development Ben Carson be given a private tour on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which would entail closing the museum to the public.\n\n\"The notion that we could shut out visitors on the first King holiday since the opening of the museum was not something I could accept,\" Bunch wrote in his memoir, the Post reported.\n\nUS President Donald Trump tours an exhibit about Dr. Ben Carson (2nd R), his nominee for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, alongside his wife, Candy (C), and US Senator Tim Scott (L), Republican of South Carolina, at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, February 21, 2017.

I was so disappointed in his response to one of the greatest crimes against humanity in history,\" Bunch wrote. \"Here was a chance to broaden the views and the understanding of the incoming president and I had been less successful than I had expected.\"\n\nBunch did note that he was enthusiastic when viewing a display about Carson's career as a neuroscientist, along with a display about Muhammad Ali. The president later wrote on Twitter that the day had been \"amazing.\"\n\n\"Very much enjoyed my tour of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture...,\" Trump tweeted on February 22, 2017. \"A great job done by amazing people!\"", "description": "The African American History Museum's founding director was unimpressed by Trump's takeaway when he toured it shortly before taking office in 2017.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6c1b8d2e22af408d168703-2732-1366.jpg"}
