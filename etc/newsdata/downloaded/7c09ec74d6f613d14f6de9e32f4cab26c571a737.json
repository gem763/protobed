The spate of measures taken by the government to revive growth, including the $20 billion tax break to companies, are too recent to be reflected in company report cards, although analysts have since raised their estimates for 12-month forward earnings.\n\n\u201cOverall, we expect a soft quarter and earnings revival could still take some time,\u201d Edelweiss Securities Ltd. analysts Prateek Parekh and Padmavati Udecha wrote in a note on Oct. 7. The brokerage\u2019s forecast for sales growth excludes banks and commodities-related companies.\n\nNSE Index earnings for the year to March will shrink by about 4% from a year earlier, according to Edelweiss and Motilal Oswal (NS: ) Securities Ltd. While commodities-related companies and corporate banks\u2019 deferred tax assets will drive the contraction, the \u201cearnings momentum is still soft and upgrades are likely to be modest\u201c even if they are excluded, Parekh and Udecha wrote.\n\nInformation technology and industrial companies\u2019 earnings growth probably fell below 5%, they analysts said, while they expect retail banks, oil marketing companies and consumer discretionary firms to post profit expansion topping 25%.\n\nEarnings risks continue to be tilted to the downside because of the slowing economy, uneven asset quality patterns seen in financial-services companies and depressed commodity prices, according to Motilal Oswal.\n\n\u201cAt this point, tax rate cuts will largely limit the downgrades rather than driving big upgrades on the earnings front,\u201d the brokerage said in a recent note.\n\nThe Leaders\n\nWhile Nifty index\u2019s pre-tax earnings are seen declining, banks led by Axis Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd . (NS: ) and State Bank of India (NS: ) Ltd. should post 34% growth, Kotak analysts led by Sanjeev Prasad wrote in Oct. 7 note.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are a top pick for the analysts, who estimate the domestic drug business could see 10-12% growth from a year earlier.\n\nWeaker Commodities\n\nPoor consumer demand and narrower margins for commodities-related companies will weigh on overall Nifty profits, according to Antique Stock Broking Ltd. The brokerage said it will its 13,100 year-end target for the index once the reporting season ends. The measure closed Monday at 11,126.\n\nMargins for steel companies are expected to narrow sequentially due to weak domestic demand, while upstream oil players\u2019 profitability will be eroded by lower oil prices, the analysts wrote.", "description": "Analysts Expect Contraction in Profits for India\u2019s Earnings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic95c2ba3e7fe70e427f166b493c6982d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
