Let's review two charts of DOCU to lay out a strategy.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of DOCU, below, we can see a mixed pattern between lagging indicators and coincident ones. Prices look like they have stabilized in August and could bounce to the underside of the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe shorter 50-day moving average line has a negative slope and last week it closed below the 200-day line for a bearish dead or death cross.\n\nTrading volume looks like it declined in August but the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has improved slightly into month end.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of DOCU, below, we can see that the consolidation in August gives us a potential upside price target of $52.90 which is at the bottom end of a large resistance area.\n\nBottom line strategy: Better than anticipated earning's for DOCU could generate a bounce to the $52 area, but with plenty of chart resistance in the $52-$58 area we look for prices to work lower in the weeks ahead.", "description": "DOCU reports quarterly earnings on Thursday....DOCU", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Docusign'S Charts Suggest A Bounce Before Further Declines", "Docu Reports Quarterly Earnings On Thursday.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Kevin Curran", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bbeaf780-4c9b-11e8-b047-f5b613ea48c5.png"}
