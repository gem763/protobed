Across the globe, new digital payment systems like WeChat Pay are taking off. Those who don't get involved now could find themselves left out of the upcoming digital payments revolution.\"\n\nFacebook's cryptocurrency would potentially allow billions of users around the world to make and receive payments through apps like WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.\n\nBut after it unveiled Libra in June, Facebook faced questions from lawmakers around the world about its motives in developing its own currency.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month that he would block any attempts to launch or develop Libra in Europe as it poses a threat to \"monetary sovereignty\".\n\nMPs in the UK expressed similar doubts, claiming Libra was an attempt by Facebook to \"turn itself into its own country\".\n\nThe Libra Association has consistently said that it announced the cryptocurrency months ahead of its planned launch in order to address concerns.\n\n\"We welcome this scrutiny and have deliberately designed a long launch runway to have these conversations,\" a spokesperson recently told The Independent\u200b.\n\nFollowing PayPal's withdrawal from the project, Libra said it would be meeting in Geneva next week to discuss the controversial cryptocurrency's future.\n\n\"This journey to build a generational payment network like the Libra project is not an easy path,\" the spokesperson said. \"We recognise that change is hard, and that each organisation that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises.\"", "description": "PayPal has withdrawn its support for Facebook\u2018s Libra cryptocurrency, following significant regulatory scrutiny of the project.
