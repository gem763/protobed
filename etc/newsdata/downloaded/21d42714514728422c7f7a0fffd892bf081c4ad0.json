Ralph Abraham and Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone, shifting in the second spot.\n\nIn Louisiana\u2019s \u201cjungle primary\u201d system, one of the three must win more than 50 percent plus 1 of the vote Oct. 12 to avoid a November runoff between the top two vote getters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been 34,000 new \u2014 yes, created \u2014 jobs,\u201d Mr. Edwards shot back in response to repeated claims Louisiana jobs have slipped.\n\nMr. Edwards was referring to his entire four years in office, and when his opponents tried to narrow the attack to the last 12 months the governor insisted \u201cthat\u2019s just a false statement.\u201d\n\nIn the 12 months ending last August, federal statistics showed Louisiana jobs had increased by 1,500.\n\nAt one point, in a segment where the candidates asked each other a question, squabbling broke out between Mr. Abraham and Mr. Rispone when the latter chided the representative for allegedly waffling in his support of President Trump before the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surrounded by one guy who was a superdelegate for Hillary Clinton and another guy who thought President Trump should drop out of the race,\u201d Mr. Rispone said. \u201cCan you imagine where we\u2019d be if Hillary Clinton was president?\u201d\n\nMr. Abraham said the feisty businessman was lying about what are bedrock conservative beliefs and said Mr. Rispone knew well \u201cthe target we should be working on is the one standing to your left.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour ads are lies,\u201d Mr. Abraham said.\n\nAs he did in the first debate, Mr. Edwards pointed to teacher raises and a state deficit when he took office that is now a surplus \u2014 a development Mr. Rispone says should be viewed skeptically because any government surplus consists of taxpayer money.\n\nDevelopments in the race that surfaced Thursday were largely absent from the debate.\n\nFor example, Mr. Edwards was not asked about revelations his ancestors were major slaveholders in the antebellum South and that his grandfather supported racist legislation as a Baton Rouge lawmaker.\n\nSimilarly, while Mr. Abraham was asked about the responsibility physicians like himself bear for the opioid crisis wracking swaths of rural America, Thursday stories about his ownership share in pharmacies, which ended in 2013, did not arise.\n\nOn the death penalty, Mr. Rispone said his Christian beliefs leave him no choice but to oppose it, while Mr. Edwards and Mr. Abraham offered a less concrete position in which they would allow carefully observed and comparatively merciful executions.\n\nMr. Rispone was also asked about why he has made immigration an issue in the campaign, given a governor\u2019s limited ability to deal with the issue and Louisiana\u2019s alleged lack of sanctuary cities.\n\nThe premise of the question was absurd, Mr. Rispone said, calling out New Orleans as a place where protests against ICE are conducted with the tacit support of City Hall.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Edwards argued the combined state and local tax burden on Louisianians is the 5th lowest in the nation \u2014 the exact spot it occupied when he took office in 2016 \u2014 and that \u201cnow is not the time to turn back; our best days are ahead of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Rispone stressed one of his top themes \u2014 his outsider status \u2014 saying that \u201cwe need a CEO over our operation.\u201d\n\nDrawing the final closing statement, Mr. Abraham referenced his repeated arguments the state\u2019s \u201ctax structure is such that there are too many \u2014 it\u2019s too complicated and it\u2019s too high. But help is on the way.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
