No one was on the island, and the fire was contained. County and National Park Service officials were continuing to monitor it on Wednesday.\n\nThe four-acre island is in the middle of the Potomac, between Great Falls Park and the Carderock Recreation Area, about three miles west of the American Legion Bridge. It is managed by the Park Service and accessible only by boat.\n\nPiringer said fire officials plan to let the fire burn, saying it poses no threat of spreading off the island. About two acres have burned, he said, and authorities believe the fire will burn out within the next week.\n\nPark Service spokeswoman Katelyn Liming said in an email the fire is \u201cburning slowly in steep, rocky terrain and is not at risk of moving off of the island.\u201d She said the cause of the fire is under investigation.\n\n\u201cSmoke may be visible over the next several days,\u201d Liming said.\n\nThe fire has caught the attention of residents nearby and those miles away.\n\nAndre Kristinus, who lives about eight miles away in the Wesley Heights neighborhood of Northwest Washington, said he awoke about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday when he noticed the odor of smoke, \u201clike those self-burning logs you put on a fire.\u201d When he left home later in the morning, the smell was still there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking: Is there something to be worried about? What is it? Why is no one talking about it?\u201d he said.\n\nHermit was in the news last in 2014, when a 25-year-old man was killed after becoming trapped beneath a large boulder when rocks gave way during a hike.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Officials first responded to a fire on the uninhabited island last week, but say it poses no threat.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
