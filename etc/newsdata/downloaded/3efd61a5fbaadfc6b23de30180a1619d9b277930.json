(She is working with a $100 budget for the entire campaign, so the Hanks cutout doesn't have legs, and the large piano keyboard was borrowed from her four-year-old.)\n\nDay 1 of our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomneedsgrinder?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomneedsgrinder</a> campaign. Welcome <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhanks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomhanks</a>. We have complied a few fun facts to entice you to Grinder during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIFF19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TIFF19</a> (see full list on Facebook or Instagram) 1) Life is better with Grinder. When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/idriselba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@idriselba</a> didn't show, Brexit happened. 2) really awesome coffee <a href=\"https://t.co/TkR2r0cYuP\">pic.twitter.com/TkR2r0cYuP</a> \u2014@GrinderCoffeeTO\n\nIt's not the first time the coffee shop has managed to lure a big name. Last year, staff and customers chose Ryan Gosling as their target, and the Canadian heartthrob did show up at the shop.\n\n\"It was very exciting. I didn't actually expect my plan to work and was very surprised when it did,\" says Murray with a laugh. \"But his mom had seen the campaign and they found it very funny.\"\n\nDay 2 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomneedsgrinder?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomneedsgrinder</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhanks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomhanks</a> Please see our, oops we mean <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ryangosling?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ryangosling</a> recommendation letter. <br>Tom, <br>Grinder Coffee is the best place ever. Joelle is a riot, the staff awesome and the coffee AMAZING .<a href=\"https://twitter.com/idriselba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@idriselba</a> is a shattered man after his no show. Don't be an Idris. Ryan <a href=\"https://t.co/x8VYX070SH\">pic.twitter.com/x8VYX070SH</a> \u2014@GrinderCoffeeTO\n\nIn 2017, the first year of the shop's TIFF campaign, Murray chose Idris Elba, but he was a no-show, which has led to relentless ribbing of the famed actor.\n\nOn day two of the current campaign, the shop released a tongue-in-cheek \"recommendation letter\" from Gosling.\n\n\"Tom, Grinder Coffee is the best place ever. Joelle is a riot, the staff awesome and the coffee AMAZING . @idriselba is a shattered man after his no show. Don't be an Idris.\"\n\nDay 3 of our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomneedsgrinder?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomneedsgrinder</a> campaign. We are really going <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/big?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#big</a> on our campaign. We recreated one of your movies to show our dedicatation. We included the original photo for reference so you can clearly see we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NailedIt?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NailedIt</a> . Never showed that kind of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/love?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#love</a> for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/idriselba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@idriselba</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIFF?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TIFF</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xJvMEjE9ko\">pic.twitter.com/xJvMEjE9ko</a> \u2014@GrinderCoffeeTO\n\nThis year, Murray was torn between Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, but staff and customers tipped the scale toward Hanks.\n\n\"I love both of them, and I really wanted Meryl,\" says Murray, \"but our joke has been that it's a lot easier to recreate Tom Hanks films than it is to recreate, say, Kramer vs. Kramer, or Silkwood, or Sophie's Choice.\"\n\nDay four of our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomneedsgrinder?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomneedsgrinder</a> campaign <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhanks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomhanks</a> we get always having to take out your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SQUAD?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SQUAD</a> , <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/costars?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#costars</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/friends?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#friends</a> can get very costly. So we just wanted to show you that our pricing is very reasonable. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/idriselba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@idriselba</a> must have thought we were in pounds) <a href=\"https://t.co/cvPh1Qu3o5\">pic.twitter.com/cvPh1Qu3o5</a> \u2014@GrinderCoffeeTO\n\n\"And Tom Hanks is hilarious. We've been following his social media feed, and he takes pictures with drunk people, he holds up wallets that people have lost,\" says Murray. \"So I feel like he'll really appreciate the humour behind it.\"\n\nMurray says her favourite Hanks films include Big, Splash, The Post and The Green Mile, and her four-year-old loves The Polar Express and Toy Story. Forrest Gump is also her husband's favourite film of all time. \"Every time it's on TV he stops and watches it,\" she says.\n\nDay 5 of our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomneedsgrinder?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomneedsgrinder</a> campaign. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhanks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomhanks</a> we thought you might like to commemorate your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIFF?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TIFF</a> visit to Grinder. Make sure you eat one our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/muffins?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#muffins</a> before you go, it helps with the pain. Don't forget to show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/idriselba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@idriselba</a> your ink he will be so jealous. <a href=\"https://t.co/y8euPfM2l6\">pic.twitter.com/y8euPfM2l6</a> \u2014@GrinderCoffeeTO\n\nMurray says she's hoping to get a few fun photos with the star, who is in Toronto to promote his new Mr. Rogers biopic, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. Until then, she's constantly devising new ways to draw him to her shop, including getting his cutout TIFF-ready at favourite neighbourhood spots, and rolling out a red carpet.\n\nSo what will Murray do if Hanks shows up? She says she's offering a free cup of coffee for Hanks and 15 per cent off for his entourage. And if Hanks wants to purchase a mug he'll get a paltry 10 per cent discount.\n\n\"We're a small business,\" says Murray with a laugh. \"But I talk a good game, and then I cave in the end because I get stars in my eyes.\"", "description": "Last year Grinder Coffee got a visit from Ryan Gosling.
