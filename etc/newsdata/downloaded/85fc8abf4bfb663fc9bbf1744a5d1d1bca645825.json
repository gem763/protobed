Technology has been the best performer among the major S&P 500 sectors so far this year.\n\n\"Right now, investors are more focused on an actual outcome from these talks, but a majority have become somewhat skeptical that there will be something concrete this week,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\nThe high-level negotiations are set to begin on Thursday.\n\nWall Street logged a choppy start to October as concerns fueled by a contraction in U.S. factory activity and weaker-than-expected services sector data were countered by rising bets of a third interest rate cut this year by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders see a 74% chance of a rate cut at the central bank's policy meeting later this month, up from about 40% a week ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nInvestors will now turn to the third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off next week with U.S. banks reporting, for more clarity on the impact of the trade war on Corporate America.\n\nAnalysts expect the lowest quarterly profit performance since 2016, with S&P 500 earnings seen falling nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAt 9:53 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 98.06 points, or 0.37%, at 26,475.66, while the S&P 500 was down 11.04 points, or 0.37%, at 2,940.97. The Nasdaq Composite was down 23.59 points, or 0.30%, at 7,958.88.\n\nAmong stocks, E*Trade Financial Corp rose 2.6% after UBS raised its rating on the online broker's shares to \"buy\".\n\nNvidia Corp gained 3.1% after RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on the chipmaker on improving gaming and data center demand. The stock was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500.\n\nGeneral Motors Co dropped 1%, after the UAW rejected the carmaker's latest offer of a four-year labor contract.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.53-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.98-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded nine new highs and 36 new lows.
