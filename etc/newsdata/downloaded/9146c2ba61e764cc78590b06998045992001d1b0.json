After Mrs Thatcher ceased to be PM, this ancient pottery, which was a gift, should have found its place at 10 Downing Street. It should certainly not be sold by her heirs. It was not a personal gift,\u201d Androulla Vassiliou, a former EU commissioner for education and culture, wrote on Twitter.", "description": "Cyprus is to seek an explanation from the UK as to how an ancient vase that was given as a gift to Margaret Thatcher when she was prime minister came to be sold at auction.", "authors": ["Nick Squires", "Charles Moore", "Juliet Samuel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214121691-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq51xurVIoqhqRAGUjnLq19ZA-rhDNXScMYkH8vRJ4jzw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
