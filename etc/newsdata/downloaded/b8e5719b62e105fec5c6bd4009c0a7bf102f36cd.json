The International Ice Hockey Federation already banned him from international competition for four years. The ban took effect on June 13, 2019.\n\nKuznetsov and NHLPA representatives met with commissioner Gary Bettman on Monday.\n\nIn a statement issued through the Capitals on Saturday, Kuznetsov said he will not appeal the league\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cI have decided to accept the NHL\u2019s suspension today. I am once again sorry that I have disappointed my family, my teammates, and the Capitals organization and fans. I promise to do everything in my power to win you back with my actions both on and off the ice,\u201d he said. \u201cI also understand that I am fortunate to have an opportunity to make things right.\n\n\u201cThanks to the Capitals, NHL, and NHLPA, I have taken many steps in the right direction and I\u2019m confident that I will continue on that path. I am grateful for everyone\u2019s support and I\u2019m looking to move forward from this point. While I can appreciate that people may have additional questions, I will not be commenting further on this matter.\u201d\n\nKuznetsov, 27, will be eligible to return to international play on June 12, 2023, meaning he cannot participate for his homeland, Russia, in the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe ban didn\u2019t apply to his status with the Capitals. Under the NHL and NHLPA\u2019s joint Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program, players are not suspended for positive tests for marijuana or cocaine.\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 first-round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, Kuznetsov played in 76 games last season and tallied 72 points (21 goals, 51 assists). In his career, he\u2019s played in 416 games, scoring 337 points (101 goals, 236 assists).\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The NHL suspended Washington Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov for three games without pay for what it termed inappropriate conduct.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429815927&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0HR-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
