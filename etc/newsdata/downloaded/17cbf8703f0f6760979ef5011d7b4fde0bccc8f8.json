NASA has a \"HERstory\" oral history project documenting the experiences of women who have contributed to the space agency.\n\nKoch and Meir both joined NASA in 2013, the year NASA's astronaut class was 50% female. Koch is also on her way to making history with a 300-day mission, which will be the longest single spaceflight by a woman.\n\nThe astronauts were asked in an interview from space earlier this month about whether they mind having their accomplishments qualified by their gender.\n\n.@Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica are scheduled for a spacewalk together on Oct. 21. They recently talked about how their accomplishments are viewed in terms of being female astronauts. pic.twitter.com/yTJ0kVH40f \u2014 Intl.

All the women that worked to get us where we are today. I think the nice thing for us is we don\u2019t even really think about it on a daily basis. It\u2019s just normal. We\u2019re part of the team.\"\n\nNASA via AP\n\nKoch and Meir's spacewalk comes seven months after NASA had to cancel its first attempt at making \"HERstory,\" because the space station did not have enough medium-size spacesuits on board.\n\nKoch and another astronaut, Anne McClain, were supposed to make the first all-women spacewalk back in March.\n\nWhen Koch and McClain, who is no longer on the ISS, discovered they both needed to wear a size medium in the \"hard upper torso,\u201d or the shirt of the spacesuit, the walk was canceled.\n\nNASA faced swift backlash from people who viewed the spacewalk cancellation as yet another sign of women being held back on the job.\n\nThe decision by NASA though was largely one borne out of logistics, as there are a limited number of spacesuits on the space station and NASA has lacked the funds to update its spacesuits in recent years.\n\nSince the cancellation of the female spacewalk in March, NASA has been preparing its spacesuits for a series of 10 spacewalks.\n\nThe International Space Station is now equipped to make four complete spacewalking suits, with two \"hard upper torso\" components of the same size to be available at any time, according to NASA.", "description": "U.S. astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will go down in the history books.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/nasa-ap-er-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
