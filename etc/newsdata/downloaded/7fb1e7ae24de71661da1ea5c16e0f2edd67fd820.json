Photo: 10News WTSP/Youtube\n\nWhen a staffer at an Orlando school grabbed the wrists of 6-year-old girl, the young student\u2019s first impulse was to kick back \u2014 a panicked reaction familiar to many parents. According to WKMG, the girl was handcuffed, arrested for battery, and sent to a juvenile prison.\n\nLast Thursday, Dennis Turner, the school resource officer at Lucious and Emma Nixon Academy, arrested a 6-year-old child, on a charge of misdemeanor battery after she had a tantrum at school. She was then handcuffed and transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, according to her grandmother Meralyn Kirkland.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Kirkland said she received a call after the incident, and that Turner told her on the phone that Rolle had acted out in class and landed herself in the office, where she tried to kick a school staffer who was holding onto her wrists. Upon learning these details, Kirkland told Turner that Rolle suffers from sleep apnea, and hadn\u2019t gotten enough sleep the night before. But at this information, Turner reportedly became combative.\n\n\u201cWell, I have sleep apnea, and I don\u2019t behave like that,\u201d Turner said to Kirkland, she told WKMG. (Neither the school, district officials, nor Turner responded to the Washington Post\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nIn an interview with WKMG on Friday, Kirkland was still in shock. \u201cHow do you do that to a 6-year-old child, and because she kicked somebody?\u201d she asked, holding back tears. Rolle, who sat alongside her grandmother during the appearance, said, \u201cI felt sad that my grandma was sad, and I really missed her.\u201d\n\nIn the days since Kirkland spoke out about her granddaughter\u2019s arrest, Turner\u2019s troubling record of disciplinary action has come under official investigation by the Orlando Police Department. According to officials, Turner arrested an additional child \u2014 an 8-year-old \u2014 the same day of Rolle\u2019s arrest; in both cases, Turner did not get approval from his watch commander, which is a breach of department policy. Furthermore, while working as a police officer he was issued a written reprimand for Tasering a nonresistant man five times, according to the Orlando Sentinel. As Lucious and Emma Nixon Academy awaits the outcome of the investigation, Turner is under suspension.\n\nRolle\u2019s arrest has also sparked conversation around the disproportionate punishment that students of color face, as well as the potentially harmful influence of in-school officers. As noted by the Washington Post, more and more schools have hired these officers in recent years to protect against mass shootings and other serious threats, but criminal-justice advocates says they instead end up criminalizing behavior that doesn\u2019t necessitate it.\n\n\u201cNo 6-year-old child should be able to tell somebody that they had handcuffs on them and they were riding in the back of a police car and taken to a juvenile center to be fingerprinted, mug shot,\u201d Kirkland said.", "description": "A 6-year-old Orlando girl was taken to the principal\u2019s office after suffering what her grandmother identified as a sleep apnea-related issue.
