Walmart\u2019s request came with an announcement that the nation\u2019s largest retailer would stop selling handgun ammunition and \u201cshort-barrel rifle ammunition.\u201d\n\nWalmart\u2019s decision came on the heels of a mass shooting inside an El Paso, Texas, store in early August that left 22 people dead. That same week, an employee who had been suspended shot and killed two co-workers in a Mississippi Walmart where he worked.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a memo to employees on Tuesday.\n\nThe week after the El Paso shooting, police arrested an armed man who caused chaos when he walked into a Walmart in Springfield, Missouri, while wearing body armor and military-style clothing. The same week, a man calling himself an \u201canti-gun activist\u201d was questioned by police after he asked a clerk in a Florida Walmart for a gun that would \u201ckill 200 people.\u201d\n\nHours after Walmart\u2019s announcement, Kroger, the nation\u2019s largest grocery chain, followed with its own request asking customers not to openly carry.\n\n\u201cKroger has demonstrated with our actions that we recognize the growing chorus of Americans who are no longer comfortable with the status quo and who are advocating for concrete and common sense gun reforms,\u201d Kroger said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, Walgreens, CVS and Wegmans made similar requests.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more important than the safety of our customers & employees. The sight of someone with a gun can be alarming, and we don\u2019t want anyone to feel that way at Wegmans. For this reason, we prefer that customers not openly carry firearms into our stores. \u2014 Wegmans Food Markets (@Wegmans) September 5, 2019\n\nWalmart said the policy would not be enforced, but that management is instructed to contact law enforcement if they feel threatened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a respectful request,\u201d Walmart spokesperson Ragan Dickens told HuffPost. \u201cAnd if they do not listen to the request, we\u2019ve asked management to evaluate each situation. If an individual is a potential threat, the manager on duty can contact law enforcement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how other stores will enforce the new policies, but Kris Brown of advocacy group Brady United told CNN that the move by Walmart is \u201ctelling the NRA that logic does not support what they\u2019ve been saying \u2014 this \u2018good guy with a gun\u2019 idea is patently false.\u201d\n\nHuffPost has reached out to all of the retailers for comment on how they plan to enforce the policies, if at all.\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from Walmart.\n\nLove HuffPost?
