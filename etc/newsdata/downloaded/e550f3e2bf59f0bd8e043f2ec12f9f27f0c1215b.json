'That's brutal that,' Nelson responded, before grabbing the interviewer's paper of questions out of his hand and throwing it away. 'Next question, sir,' Edwards added. YouTube/Fitzy and Wippa 2/11 In September 2018, Nelson shared a photo on Little Mix's official Twitter account which showed her wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan: 'Women are more than muses.' 'Shout out to all the amazing women past and present who fight for the rights and freedom of women,' she wrote in the tweet alongside the photo. Twitter/Little Mix 3/11 In November 2018, Pinnock spoke to People magazine about the sisterhood she and her fellow Little Mix band members have created. 'Little Mix wouldn't work without one of us. If one of us left, it would be over,' she said. 'We're friends. If anything, we're past friendship. We're sisters.'

Little Mix have responded to criticism over their 'sexy' outfits on multiple occasions, explaining that women should be able to wear what they want without fear of condemnation. Twitter/Little Mix 5/11 While speaking with Billboard in November 2018, Thirlwall spoke about the taboo still associated with the term feminist, explaining that the band had recently discussed the issue with singer Alexandra Shungudzo Govere, who wrote their song 'Touch'. 'I think we did actually talk about how there\u2019s a weird stigma attached to admitting you\u2019re a feminist and saying you\u2019re a feminist,' Thirlwall said. 'We never understood why, so we just put it in the song: 'Are you a feminist? Hell yeah!' There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.'

The video featured a number of inspirational women, including founder of charity CoppaFeel! Kristin Hallenga and body positivity influencer Megan Jayne Crabbe.

'People can sometimes be quick to judge women at face value and what they see on the outside,' she wrote. 'If everyone took the time to look a little deeper I think the world would be a better place.' Twitter/Little Mix 8/11 In March 2018, Little Mix won the accolade for 'Best British Artist or Group' at the Global Awards. During their acceptance speech, Thirlwall spoke to the audience about the scrutiny the band often find themselves under on account of their appearances or the way they dress. 'As a girl band, and as women, we do face a lot of scrutiny all the time, whether it's for the way we look, how much thigh we get out, how we dance, what we sing about,' she said. 'And we just want to say that, although one day we hope that does stop, right now we're really not arsed what people think.' YouTube/Capital FM 9/11 During a November 2018 interview with Attitude magazine, Edwards touched upon the sexism that remains rife within the music industry. 'When women have a voice, some people think that opinion is invalid,' she said.

She explained how during previous photo shoots, photos of her had been digitally altered to make her facial features look different and her skin look lighter. 'In one of our first magazine shoots we did, my nose was completely changed and my skin was whitened,' Thirlwall wrote. 'At 18, it gave me a complex and an insecurity I'd never had before and for years I was determined to get a nose job.' She continued, explaining that we are 'all unique and beautiful in our own way'. Twitter/Little Mix 11/11 The members of Little Mix have all spoken out about body insecurities among women on multiple occasions, such as when Edwards wrote on social media about accepting her freckles.
