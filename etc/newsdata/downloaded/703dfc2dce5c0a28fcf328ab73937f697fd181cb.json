As for Manu himself, in the early days he developed something of a bad boy, macho reputation which even threatened his career\n\nFew Britons have probably heard of Fatausi-Fogapoa.\n\nThe map tells us that it\u2019s a beachside community situated 10,000 miles from the UK on the island of Savai\u2019i in Samoa.\n\nYou might wonder, then, why they were cheering for England against the All Blacks at the weekend in this rugby-mad corner of the world.\n\nOr at least, they were in one crowded home in this Polynesian paradise.\n\nThe head of the household in question is a retired politician and deputy (in the Samoan government), as well as the high chief of the village council.\n\nHis name is Namulauulu Tuilagi Vavae Leo II, and he happens to be the father of England rugby star Manu Tuilagi, who wowed the World Cup crowds in Japan on Saturday by scoring a try in the second minute.\n\nIt was a moment that set the tone for England\u2019s 19-7 semi-final victory over the feared New Zealand team.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I cry when I see him on the field \u2026 because in my mind and in my heart he is still our baby,\u2019 Mr Tuilagi Sr told the Samoa Observer newspaper.\n\nIt sounds endearingly incongruous to call the 6ft, 17st wrecking ball who crossed the New Zealand try line after just 96 seconds his \u2018baby\u2019. But 28-year-old Manu, after all, is the youngest of his seven \u2014 yes, seven \u2014 boys.\n\nBehind that number is an extraordinary sporting, and family, story. Of Manu\u2019s six brothers, five have played rugby for his current English Premiership club, the Leicester Tigers.\n\nEngland rugby star Manu Tuilagi wowed the World Cup crowds in Japan on Saturday by scoring a try in the second minute. It was a moment that set the tone for England\u2019s 19-7 semi-final victory over the feared New Zealand team\n\nAt one point they shared a house in the Leicester suburb of Thorpe Astley, which doubled as a little piece of the South Pacific.\n\nMr Tuilagi Sr, 72, and his wife Aliitasi, who ran the local food shop in their village, watched Saturday\u2019s semi-final in Japan\u2019s Yokohama Stadium from their home in Samoa, we have been told, because they do not fly.\n\nThat is also where the only non-rugby playing member of the brotherhood lives. Olotuli Tuilagi is now known as Julie.\n\nIn Samoa, Julie is part of the deep-rooted Polynesian culture of the fa\u2019afafine, a third gender whose name translates simply as \u2018in the manner of woman\u2019.\n\nThe fa\u2019afafine are ubiquitous in the South Pacific nation and there is no stigma attached to their appearance or lifestyle.\n\nBoth Julie and other members of the family, including Manu, have spoken in the media about the fa\u2019afafine identity.\n\nJulie lived in Leicester as a woman with Manu and the rest of their siblings for a while before returning to Samoa.\n\nIt sounds endearingly incongruous to call the 6ft, 17st wrecking ball who crossed the New Zealand try line after just 96 seconds his \u2018baby\u2019. But 28-year-old Manu, after all, is the youngest of his seven \u2014 yes, seven \u2014 boys\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just the way he is,\u2019 Manu said in one interview. \u2018He was born like that and he wants to dress up as woman. But not just dress up, he lives the life of a woman. He has the eyelashes, eyebrows, has make-up done and wears a bra. It doesn\u2019t matter. He is our brother and a great guy. He\u2019s just different.\u2019\n\nManu has bought handbags and cosmetics as gifts for Julie, one interview reported.\n\nAs for Manu himself, in the early days he developed something of a bad boy, macho reputation which even threatened his career.\n\nPast misdemeanours include getting drunk one evening during a pre-season training camp (in 2017) and being involved in an incident in which two female police officers and a taxi driver were assaulted (in 2015).\n\nHe was also arrested after jumping off a ferry into Auckland Harbour following England\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign (in 2011).\n\nSuch a legacy has now been firmly consigned to history. These days he prefers strumming on his guitar for entertainment: the Bob Marley classic, Redemption Song, is a favourite of Manu\u2019s, apparently.\n\nHad it not been for his trailblazing brothers, however, things might have turned out very differently.\n\nJulie Tuilagi is pictured with her borther Manu. Every month, Manu sends money back to his family in Samoa\n\nFereti (or Freddie) was the first of the Tuilagi brood to leave Samoa, travelling halfway round the world to become a rugby league player before switching to rugby union and joining Leicester in 2000 as a winger.\n\nHenry, a hulking back-row forward, was next to arrive at Leicester, followed by Alesana (Alex), Anitelea (Andy) and Vavae.\n\nManu was just 13 when he joined them in 2004 and could barely speak English.\n\nThe brothers lived together and Manu accepted his role in the pecking order.\n\n\u2018It was expected of me to make the drinks, clear up, answer the door, in fact everything, and if I did something wrong one of my brothers would sort me out,\u2019 he explained.\n\n\u2018You always respect your elders, and it remains the same today.\n\n\u2018Not being able to speak the language made life really tough for me at first, especially at school. Samoa culture is so different to life in England that I found it hard to fit in.\u2019\n\nAlready a member of the Leicester Academy, he was in due course called up to the England Under-16s under the three-year residency rule that lets foreign nationals play for UK sports teams. His decision was the subject of a Tuilagi family conference.\n\nAfter all, his siblings had represented Samoa. \u2018It wasn\u2019t only my decision to play for England,\u2019 Manu would later recall. \u2018It was my family\u2019s.\u2019\n\nThe next hurdle in his path was bureaucratic and almost derailed his international career.\n\nThe Home Office discovered he had originally come to England on a six-month tourist visa, his application for \u2018leave to remain\u2019 here was turned down and Manu faced deportation as an illegal immigrant.\n\nHis family came up with a plan for Freddie, who had established himself in the UK, to adopt him before the deportation process got going. However, the plan was not completed in time.\n\n\u2018I was just waiting for the police to knock on my door and arrest me,\u2019 is how Manu has since described that traumatic time.\n\nIn the end, a campaign by his club, fans and MPs persuaded the Home Office to award him indefinite leave to stay on the grounds of family ties \u2014 and his flourishing rugby career.\n\nIt culminated in his first cap against the \u2018old enemy\u2019 \u2014 Wales \u2014 at Twickenham stadium in 2011. England won 23-19, and Manu started as he would continue, with a try.\n\nThe next generation of Tuilagis are already growing fast \u2014 including Manu\u2019s 18-month-old daughter Leilani, which translates as \u2018heavenly flower\u2019. \u2018Go Daddy,\u2019 Leilani told him on Instagram at the weekend, with a little help from her mum Chantelle Garrity, a business development manager for a construction company and Manu\u2019s fiancee\n\nYet many feared he would never achieve his true potential thanks to his laddish behaviour and a spate of injuries that kept him sidelined for long periods.\n\nOnce, in desperation, he returned to Samoa to seek the help of the \u2018Fofo Samoa\u2019, or witch doctor, to \u2018rebuild\u2019 him following persistent knee injuries.\n\nHe spent four days in the company of the Fofo Samoa, according to a report in the Mail on Sunday three years ago.\n\nShe told how she \u2018cast away\u2019 spirits and massaged his body with oils made from coconut, frangipani, sandalwood and rose. \u2018Now he is protected,\u2019 she declared afterwards \u2014 and certainly he has gone from strength to strength.\n\nEvery month, Manu sends money back to his family in Samoa. He signed an improved contract extension at Leicester Tigers earlier this year, where he was already on a reported \u00a3450,000 a year.\n\n\u2018I have been sending money since I started here,\u2019 he says. \u2018Most of the islanders do.\n\n\u2018It is a different culture: we support church and funerals and all those things that are different from over here.\n\n\u2018You know you\u2019re not going to play rugby for a long time, and you have to look at investing whatever money you have \u2014 but that comes after money you\u2019ve sent home.\u2019\n\nManu, of course, remains close to his brothers \u2014 the Unstoppable Tuilagis, you might call them. Freddie, Henry, Alesana and Anitelea are all retired from rugby now.\n\nFreddie runs after-dinner events in England and does charity work in Vietnam, while fellow Leicester star Alesana owns a taro (root vegetable) plantation in Samoa, where he and Anitelea help Julie look after their parents.\n\nThe other rugby-playing brother, Vavae, is with the Carcassonne club in France.\n\nAnd the next generation of Tuilagis are already growing fast \u2014 including Manu\u2019s 18-month-old daughter Leilani, which translates as \u2018heavenly flower\u2019.\n\n\u2018Go Daddy,\u2019 Leilani told him on Instagram at the weekend, with a little help from her mum Chantelle Garrity, a business development manager for a construction company and Manu\u2019s fiancee. \u2018So proud, Daddy.\u2019\n\nThe message, as we all know, seems to have done the trick.", "description": "PAUL BRACCHI: England rugby star Manu Tuilagi wowed the World Cup crowds in Japan on Saturday by scoring a try in the second minute.", "authors": ["Paul Bracchi For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20257896-0-image-a-23_1572215884713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
