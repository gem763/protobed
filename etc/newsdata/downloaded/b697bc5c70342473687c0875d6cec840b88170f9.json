I suffer from asthma and allergies. Using this particular one these last two weeks or so, I\u2019m totally feeling a difference. The air quality is very different in my room. Note that this will work best for smaller rooms. This also looks super futuristic and beautiful! The lighting on it is so cool! And in general it is quite simple to use...\u201d\n\nShop it: Airthereal Day Dawning Air Purifier ADH50B, $36 (was $50), amazon.com\n\nFor larger rooms up to 355 square feet, Airthereal\u2019s Pure Morning air purifier, $74 (was $130), will do the trick.

(Photo: Amazon) More\n\nSays a self-proclaimed customer for life: \u201cDue to water damage from the hurricane last year, which has been repaired, the air quality in my home seemed to be very poor. The last few months, anyone who came to visit complained about not feeling well while here or after they left, just like my family. I ordered two of the air purifiers and was shocked to see the readings. Air quality should be 12 or less to be in a healthy range. One area of my home was 116 and another was 59. Within 45 minutes, the 116 reading had dropped into the 20\u2019s and now, a few hours later, both machines are reading 8 or less! Needless to say I called a remediation company today! I\u2019m thankful to have the machines keep our home safer until the problem can be found, but I will continue to use them afterwards as well. I\u2019ll be a lifelong customer. Thank you Airthereal!\u201d\n\nShop it: Airthereal Pure Morning Air Purifier APH260, $74 (was $130), amazon.com\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
