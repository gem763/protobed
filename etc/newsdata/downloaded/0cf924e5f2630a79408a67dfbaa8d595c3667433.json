Quispe Collantes grew up speaking Quechua with her parents and grandparents in the Acomayo district of Cusco.\n\nHer seven-year investigation focused on the Quechua poetry of Andr\u00e9s Alencastre Guti\u00e9rrez (1909-84), a landowner from Cusco who wrote under the pen name Kilku Warak\u2019aq. She analysed his work and the combining of Andean traditions and Catholicism.\n\n\u201cQuechua doesn\u2019t lack the vocabulary for an academic language. Today many people mix the language with Spanish,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI hope my example will help to revalue the language again and encourage young people, especially women, to follow my path. It\u2019s very important that we keep on rescuing our original language.\u201d\n\nQuispe Collantes\u2019s doctoral adviser Gonzalo Espino said her presentation was hugely symbolic because the language \u201crepresented the most humble people in this part of the world: the Andeans, who were once called \u2018Indians\u2019. Their language and culture has been vindicated.\u201d\n\nPeru has joined a global effort to register indigenous names as part of the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages, which is trying to help revive 2,680 at-risk indigenous languages around the world \u2013 21 of which are native to Peru.", "description": "Quechua is still spoken by 8 million people across the Andes, but Roxana Quispe Collantes hopes she can give it added value", "authors": ["Dan Collyns"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/680a765db8e2bebf7a8efa2f95796c8536c63d31/0_257_3107_1863/master/3107.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f9721cf76494213ac6eb7994cdec9c1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
