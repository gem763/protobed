Their fundraising page, which can be found at helpthewhistleblower.org, went live Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cWe hope that Americans will stand up to and stand with this whistleblower and show the government and the president are not above the law,\u201d Tye said. \u201cWe are very proud to be supporting this whistleblower. It is a very stressful thing to be a whistleblower.\u201d\n\nIn new comments to Fox News, the whistleblower's lawyers said they were focused on communicating all relevant information to Congress.\n\nTRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES\n\n\u201cOur objective is to ensure that full disclosure of the information is obtained by the relevant oversight authorities,\u201d one of the whistleblower's lawyers, Mark Zaid, told Fox News. \u201cIn compliance with the law and to maintain the right of the whistleblower to remain anonymous.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the whistleblower's legal team, Charles McCullough III \u2013 a former intelligence community inspector general himself who was drawn into the Hillary Clinton email investigation \u2013 said early communications with lawmakers have been promising.\n\n\u201cThe focus is on the process,\" he said. \u201cThere is a law, and we are content that the process appears to be working \u2013 the focus is on the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been acting as counsel since the very beginning before the disclosure was made to ensure the law was followed by the client, the disclosure was lawfully made,\u201d Andrew Bakaj, also an attorney for the whistleblower, told Fox News. \u201cWe have complied with the law through this entire process.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower \u2013 a member of the intelligence community \u2013 wanted to testify before Congress and was waiting on possible guidance from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, the lawyers said. Maguire is set to testify himself on Thursday.\n\n\"It is a very stressful thing to be a whistleblower.\u201d \u2014 John Tye, CEO of Whistleblower Aid\n\nA bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate, who have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint, gained access to the document in a classified setting late Wednesday ahead of Maguire's testimony.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, citing the whistleblower complaint as possible evidence of Trump's \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office.\u201d\n\nWATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED\n\nTrump quickly pushed back forcefully. At a news conference in New York on Wednesday, the president dismissed the complaint from what he called the \u201cso-called whistleblower,\u201d and sought to turn the tables -- accusing Biden of possible corruption and Democrats of overt hypocrisy.\n\nThe White House also released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country. The transcript did not suggest that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a \u201cpromise\u201d on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed.\n\nZelensky, speaking across from Trump in New York on Wednesday, told reporters he did not feel \u201cpushed\u201d at all in his conversations with the president.\n\nAnd, the Justice Department \u2013 in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News \u2013 pushed back Wednesday on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of \u201curgent concern\u201d that would have to be turned over to Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe letter said the intelligence community inspector general found \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d but still said the allegations \u201cappeared credible.\u201d Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d of Trump's call with Zelensky.\n\nSources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump\u2019s request for an investigation did not qualify as a \u201cthing of value\u201d for his campaign \u2013 and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Lawyers for the whistleblower who has alleged possible wrongdoing by President Trump in his July call with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0worked with a nonprofit group to establish\u00a0a GoFundMe page seeking to raise an initial $100,000 for the whistleblower's legal defense, Fox News has learned.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "John Tye", "Ceo Of Whistleblower Aid", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
