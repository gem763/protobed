In those days, the student body at any of our Army's myriad schools typically included officers from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN).\n\nSince ARVN's founding two decades earlier, the United States had assigned itself the task of professionalizing that fledgling military establishment. Based on a conviction that the standards, methods, and ethos of our armed forces were universally applicable and readily exportable, the attendance of ARVN personnel at such Army schools was believed to contribute to the professionalizing of the South Vietnamese military.\n\nEvidence that the US military's own professional standards had recently taken a hit \u2014 memories of the My Lai massacre were then still fresh \u2014 elicited no second thoughts on our part. Association with American officers like me was sure to rub off on our South Vietnamese counterparts in ways that would make them better soldiers.\n\nSo we professed to believe, even while subjecting that claim to no more scrutiny than we did the question of why most of us had spent a year or more of our lives participating in an obviously misbegotten and misguided war in Indochina.\n\nUS soldiers and airmen read about the Apollo 11 moon landing in downtown Saigon. Hugh Van Es/Associated Press\n\nFor serving officers at that time one question in particular remained off-limits (though it had been posed incessantly for years by antiwar protestors in the streets of America): Why Vietnam? Prizing compliance as a precondition for upward mobility, military service rarely encourages critical thinking.\n\nOn the day that Saigon, the capital of the Republic of Vietnam, fell and that country ceased to exist, I approached one of my ARVN classmates, also a captain, wanting at least to acknowledge the magnitude of the disaster that had occurred. \"I'm sorry about what happened to your country,\" I told him.\n\nI did not know that officer well and no longer recall his name. Let's call him Captain Nguyen. In my dim recollection, he didn't even bother to reply. He simply looked at me with an expression both distressed and mournful. Our encounter lasted no more than a handful of seconds. I then went on with my life and Captain Nguyen presumably with his. Although I have no inkling of his fate, I like to think that he is now retired in Southern California after a successful career in real estate. But who knows?\n\nAll I do know is that today I recall our exchange with a profound sense of embarrassment and even shame. My pathetic effort to console Captain Nguyen had been both presumptuous and inadequate. Far worse was my failure \u2014 inability? refusal? \u2014 to acknowledge the context within which that catastrophe was occurring: The United States and its armed forces had, over years, inflicted horrendous harm on the people of South Vietnam.\n\nIn reality, their defeat was our defeat. Yet while we had decided that we were done paying, they were going to pay and pay for a long time to come.\n\nAP\n\nRather than offering a fatuous expression of regret for the collapse of his country, I ought to have apologized for having played even a miniscule role in what was, by any measure, a catastrophe of epic proportions. It's a wonder Captain Nguyen didn't spit in my eye.\n\nI genuinely empathized with Captain Nguyen. Yet the truth is that, along with most other Americans, soldiers and civilians alike, I was only too happy to be done with South Vietnam and all its troubles. Dating back to the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the United States and its armed forces had made a gargantuan effort to impart legitimacy to the Republic of Vietnam and to coerce the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to its north into giving up its determination to exercise sovereignty over the entirety of the country. In that, we had failed spectacularly and at a staggering cost.\n\n\"Our\" war in Indochina \u2014 the conflict we chose to call the Vietnam War \u2014 officially ended in January 1973 with the signing in Paris of an \"Agreement Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam.\" Under the terms of that fraudulent pact, American prisoners of war were freed from captivity in North Vietnam and the last US combat troops in the south left for home, completing a withdrawal begun several years earlier.\n\nPrimary responsibility for securing the Republic of Vietnam thereby fell to ARVN, long deemed by US commanders incapable of accomplishing that mission.\n\nMeanwhile, despite a nominal cessation of hostilities, approximately 150,000 North Vietnamese regulars still occupied a large swathe of South Vietnamese territory \u2014 more or less the equivalent to agreeing to end World War II when there were still several German panzer tank divisions lurking in Belgium's Ardennes Forest.\n\nIn effect, our message to our enemy and our ally was this: We're outta here; you guys sort this out. In a bit more than two years, that sorting-out process would extinguish the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nBeen there, done that\n\nA US soldier watches a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter prepare to land during an advise and assistance mission in southeastern Afghanistan, August 4, 2019. Alejandro Licea/US Army/Reuters\n\nThe course Captain Nguyen and I were attending in the spring of 1975 paid little attention to fighting wars like the one that, for years, had occupied the attention of my army and his. Our Army, in fact, was already moving on. Having had their fill of triple-canopy jungles in Indochina, America's officer corps now turned to defending the Fulda Gap, the region in West Germany deemed most hospitable to a future Soviet invasion.\n\nAs if by fiat, gearing up to fight those Soviet forces and their Warsaw Pact allies, should they (however improbably) decide to take on NATO and lunge toward the English Channel, suddenly emerged as priority number one. At Fort Knox and throughout the Army's ranks, we were suddenly focused on \"high-intensity combined arms operations\" \u2014 essentially, a replay of World War II-style combat with fancier weaponry. In short, the armed forces of the United States had reverted to \"real soldiering.\"\n\nAnd so it is again today. At the end of the 17th year of what Americans commonly call the Afghanistan War \u2014 one wonders what name Afghans will eventually assign it \u2014 US military forces are moving on. Pentagon planners are shifting their attention back to Russia and China. Great power competition has become the name of the game.\n\nHowever we might define Washington's evolving purposes in its Afghanistan War \u2014 \"nation building,\" \"democratization,\" \"pacification\" \u2014 the likelihood of mission accomplishment is nil. As in the early 1970s, so in 2019, rather than admitting failure, the Pentagon has chosen to change the subject and is once again turning its attention to \"real soldiering.\"\n\nUS paratroopers on patrol in Kandahar province in Afghanistan. US Army photo by Maj. Thomas Cieslak\n\nRemember the infatuation with counterinsurgency (commonly known by its acronym COIN) that gripped the national security establishment around 2007 when the Iraq \"surge\" overseen by Gen. David Petraeus briefly ranked alongside Gettysburg as a historic victory?\n\nWell, these days promoting COIN as the new American way of war has become, to put it mildly, a tough sell. Given that few in Washington will openly acknowledge the magnitude of the military failure in Afghanistan, the incentive for identifying new enemies in settings deemed more congenial becomes all but irresistible.\n\nOnly one thing is required to validate this reshuffling of military priorities. Washington needs to create the appearance, as in 1973, that it's exiting Afghanistan on its own terms. What's needed, in short, is an updated equivalent of that \"Agreement Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam.\"\n\nUntil last weekend, the signing of such an agreement seemed imminent. Donald Trump and his envoy, former ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, appeared poised to repeat the trick that President Richard Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger pulled off in 1973 in Paris: Pause the war and call it peace.\n\nAn adviser from the US Army's 2nd Security Force Assistance Brigade at a base in Afghanistan, June 13, 2019. Reuters\n\nShould fighting subsequently resume after a \"decent interval,\" it would no longer be America's problem. Now, however, to judge by the president's twitter account\u2014 currently the authoritative record of U.S. diplomacy \u2014 the proposed deal has been postponed, or perhaps shelved, or even abandoned altogether. If former National Security Adviser John Bolton has his way, US forces might just withdraw in any case, without an agreement of any sort being signed.\n\nBased on what we can divine from press reports, the terms of that prospective Afghan deal would mirror those of the 1973 Paris Accords in one important respect. It would, in effect, serve as a ticket home for the remaining US and NATO troops still in that country (though for the present only the first 5,000 of them would immediately depart).\n\nBeyond that, the Taliban was to promise not to provide sanctuary to anti-American terrorist groups, even though the Afghan branch of ISIS is already firmly lodged there. Still, this proviso would allow the Trump administration to claim that it had averted any possible recurrence of the 9/11 terror attacks that were, of course, planned by Osama bin Laden while residing in Afghanistan in 2001 as a guest of the Taliban-controlled government.\n\nMission accomplished, as it were.\n\nUS troops patrol at an Afghan National Army base in Logar province, Afghanistan, August 7, 2018. Reuters\n\nBack in 1973, North Vietnamese forces occupying parts of South Vietnam neither disarmed nor withdrew. Should this new agreement be finalized, Taliban forces currently controlling or influencing significant swaths of Afghan territory will neither disarm nor withdraw. Indeed, their declared intention is to continue fighting.\n\nIn 1973, policymakers in Washington were counting on ARVN to hold off Communist forces. In 2019, almost no one expects Afghan security forces to hold off a threat consisting of both the Taliban and ISIS. In a final insult, just as the Saigon government was excluded from US negotiations with the North Vietnamese, so, too, has the Western-installed government in Kabul been excluded from US negotiations with its sworn enemy, the Taliban.\n\nA host of uncertainties remain. As with the olive branches that President Trump has ostentatiously offered to Russia, China, and North Koea, this particular peace initiative may come to naught \u2014 or, given the approach of the 2020 elections, he may decide that Afghanistan offers his last best hope of claiming at least one foreign policy success.\n\nOne way or another, in all likelihood, the deathwatch for the US-backed Afghan government has now begun. One thing only is for sure. Having had their fill of Afghanistan, when the Americans finally leave, they won't look back. In that sense, it will be Vietnam all over again.\n\nWhat price peace?\n\nA uS Army carry team moves a transfer case containing the remains of Sgt. 1st Class Elis Barreto Ortiz, at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, September 7, 2019. Associated Press\n\nHowever great my distaste for President Trump, I support his administration's efforts to extricate the United States from Afghanistan. I do so for the same reason I supported the Paris Peace Accords of 1973. Prolonging this folly any longer does not serve US interests. Rule number one of statecraft ought to be: When you're doing something really stupid, stop. To my mind, this rule seems especially applicable when the lives of American soldiers are at stake.\n\nIn Vietnam, Washington wasted 58,000 of those lives for nothing. In Afghanistan, we have lost more than 2,300 troops, with another 20,000 wounded, again for next to nothing. Last month, two American Special Forces soldiers were killed in a firefight in Faryab Province. For what?\n\nThat said, I'm painfully aware of the fact that, on the long-ago day when I offered Captain Nguyen my feeble condolences, I lacked the imagination to conceive of the trials about to befall his countrymen.\n\nIn the aftermath of the American War, something on the order of 800,000 Vietnamese took to open and unseaworthy boats to flee their country. According to estimates by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, between 200,000 and 400,000 boat people died at sea. Most of those who survived were destined to spend years in squalid refugee camps scattered throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nBack in Vietnam itself, some 300,000 former ARVN officers and South Vietnamese officials were imprisoned in so-called reeducation camps for up to 18 years. Reconciliation did not rank high on the postwar agenda of the unified country's new leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, for the Vietnamese, north and south, the American War has in certain ways only continued. Mines and unexploded ordnance left from that war have inflicted more than 100,000 casualties since the last American troops departed.\n\nOperation Resolute Support forces remove a damaged vehicle after a car-bomb explosion in Kabul, September 5, 2019. Associated Press\n\nEven today, the toll caused by Agent Orange and other herbicides that the US Air Force sprayed with abandon over vast stretches of territory continues to mount. The Red Cross calculates that more than one million Vietnamese have suffered health problems, including serious birth defects and cancers as a direct consequence of the promiscuous use of those poisons as weapons of war.\n\nFor anyone caring to calculate the moral responsibility of the United States for its actions in Vietnam, all of those would have to find a place on the final balance sheet. The 1.3 million Vietnamese admitted to the United States as immigrants since the American War formally concluded can hardly be said to make up for the immense damage suffered by the people of Vietnam as a direct or indirect result of US policy.\n\nAs to what will follow if Washington does succeed in cutting a deal with the Taliban, well, don't count on President Trump (or his successor for that matter) welcoming anything like 1.3 million Afghan refugees to the United States once a \"decent interval\" has passed. Yet again, our position will be: We're outta here; you guys sort this out.\n\nNear the end of his famed novel, \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald described two of his privileged characters, Tom and Daisy, as \"careless people\" who \"smashed up things and creatures\" and then \"retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness\" to \"let other people clean up the mess they had made.\"\n\nThat description applies to the United States as a whole, especially when Americans tire of a misguided war. We are a careless people. In Vietnam, we smashed up things and human beings with abandon, only to retreat into our money, leaving others to clean up the mess in a distinctly bloody fashion.\n\nCount on us, probably sooner rather than later, doing precisely the same thing in Afghanistan.\n\nAndrew Bacevich, a TomDispatch regular, now serves as president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
