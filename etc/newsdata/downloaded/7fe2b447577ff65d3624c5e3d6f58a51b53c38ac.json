Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for being \u201cextremely evasive\u201d about explaining how to pay for her \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 plan while he outlined his new own \u2018Medicare for All Who Want It\u2019 health care plan on CNN.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question.
