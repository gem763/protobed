Breaking away from your 9-5, reading copious amounts of books and eating all. the. food. Sometimes, though, things can get a little stressful. Whether that's because your spreadsheet itinerary isn't working out, you're struggling with budgeting, or because you can't find a decent place for dinner.\n\nWhich is where the best travel apps come in. Because yep, there's an app for that. The likes of Packing Pro, Zagat and Hopper have all been created with making your holiday easier in mind. Here are our best pick of the bunch.\n\nTripIt\n\nTake all the stress out of creating your own complicated itinerary with TripIt: the trip planning app that does all the fiddly bits for you. Ahead of your holiday, the app will give you an email address to send all of your booking confirmations to. Whether that's flights, hotels, dinners or even excursions, TripIt will then chronologically order them so you know what you're doing each day. This is a game-changer if you're going on a road trip, or have lots of different things planned on the same days.\n\nLime\n\nIf you haven't seen Lime bikes and scooters all over your own city, it won't be long before you visit somewhere that does have them. The electric public transport options are popping up in Paris, Los Angeles and the like, offering a quick and easy way to see the sights - without having to go underground. The app works on wifi or mobile data, giving you a map of all the scooters and bikes nearby. You scan the scooter to unlock it, read the safety instructions, and then pay the equivalent of \u00a31.00 and 15p/m to ride it. Brilliant.\n\nPacking Pro\n\nEver feel like you've forgotten something? You won't if you use Packing Pro, the handy app that takes all the stress out of going on holiday thanks to its handy lists and packing reminders. It breaks your packing down into essentials, clothes, accessories and more, and even has an 'Expert List', which will suggest items for you based on the weather at your location, length of trip and so on.\n\nRevolut\n\nOK, so this is an app you've probably heard of, but it's still worth mentioning. In a similar way to Monzo, Revolut allows you to transfer money abroad in 150 currencies, with a real-time rate, without any markup on all currencies. This means you get a real time comparison of what your money is worth in different currencies, allowing you to transfer your money at the time you think the exchange rate is best.\n\nFree WiFi Finder\n\nWhether you're short of data or are in a far flung time zone, the Free WiFi Finder app does exactly what is says on the tin. You don't even need an internet connection to make it work (helpful), because all the hotspots are stored locally on you device. Whether it's a Starbucks or an Apple Store, if it can offer you a free WiFi connection? We're interested.\n\nZagat\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the best things about experiencing a different culture is the food. With the Zagat app, you're given clear and concise reviews of local restaurants, without having to trawl through hundreds of options. They also offer lists collated by their food editors and give you the option to set price limits depending on what you're after.\n\nHopper\n\nSo we've all heard of Skyscanner and Kayak, and while Hopper is indeed a platform for booking flights and hotels, it features a clever little bit of technology that sets it apart. The app predicts when prices will be the lowest, and uses this prediction to advise you on when the right time to book your flights and hotels is - sometimes saving customers up to 40%. All you have to do is show interest in the booking you're after, and the app will use push notifications to make you aware of price drops.\n\nDuolingo\n\nThe Duolingo app might be a helpful download before you head on holiday, because its purpose is to be a handy guide to learning another language. Once you've chosen the language you hope to learn, the app creates games which aim to teach you words, phrases and grammar techniques. Users earn points for correct answers, race against the clock, and eventually level up to harder phrases and words.\n\nTimeshifter\n\n\n\nDon't let jet lag ruin your holiday - or make coming back from travels even worse. Timeshifter creates personalised plans for you to beat lag and promises to help you \"arrive at your best\". Developed by world-renowned scientists and based on the latest sleep and circadian neuroscience, they say its even used by astronauts and elite athletes.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The budgeting one is GOLD", "authors": ["Dusty Baxter-Wright"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N8sMdGkqtWOCpnAzN7WCrA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/5e3fd60a91e778b0648c3c53d2d4365f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
