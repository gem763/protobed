TMZ reports the reality star was at his home in Colorado when he suffered what the website describes as a \"heart emergency.\" The Blast posted a similar report, noting that Chapman remains hospitalized while doctors perform tests to determine what happened. He may have suffered a heart attack and need corrective surgery.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 28:TV personality Duane Chapman aka Dog the Bounty Hunter visits \"FOX & Friends\" at FOX Studios on August 28, 2019 in New York City.

Thank you for all of your well wishes- keep 'em coming. \u2014 Richard Moore (@remva777) September 16, 2019\n\nThe news comes nearly three months after the death of Chapman's wife, Beth. The Dog's Most Wanted star and his family have had a hard time coping since the matriarch passed away. He recently told People Now that some of the kids are \"barely making it\" without their mom.\n\n\"Each one copes differently, there is a few that really barely making it,\" the 66-year-old bounty hunter said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. We haven\u2019t read, we weren\u2019t prepared. I lost my mother first, and when my mom passed away, I\u2019m like, \u2018I wish dad would have died first, you know, \u2019cause I love my mommy.\u2019 So I went to them and said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry that I didn\u2019t die first and mom did.\u2019\"\n\n\u201cAnd they were like, \u2018Yeah dad, why?\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Oh my god, I know what that feels like, I should\u2019ve been the one. The guy goes first.\u2019\"\n\nThe Chapmans raised a family of 12 children together, many from prior relationships. Beth and Duane had two children, Bonnie, 20, and Garry, 18. He adopted Beth's daughter, Cecily Barmore-Chapman, 26, whom she shared with her ex-husband. Duane also helped his late wife locate and reconcile with a son she had when she was a teenager, 34-year-old Dominic. Beth was 51 when she passed away in June after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of throat cancer.\n\nChapman, whose Twitter and Instagram accounts have been active Monday, has yet to address the health scare.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
