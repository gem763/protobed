He had cut Linamar\u2019s forecast by 20 per cent in an Oct. 2 report after the company issued a profit warning last week in part because of the strike.\n\nShares of Canada\u2019s auto parts makers have slumped since the start of the U.S. strike last month: Linamar has dropped 13 per cent, Martinrea lost 12 per cent and Magna fell 6 per cent. General Motors slipped as much as 1.8 per cent Monday, extending its decline since the strike started to 11 per cent.\n\nNegotiations between GM and UAW have \u201ctaken a turn for the worse\u201d after the union made an offer on Saturday evening, a union official said. The strike that took effect Sept. 16 has cut GM production by more than 8,000 vehicles a day, according to calculations by analysts at Credit Suisse and IHS Markit. The cost to the automaker has exceeded US$1 billion, with GM losing about US$82 million of potential profit in North America every day of the strike, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote last week.\n\nScotiabank\u2019s Neville cut Magna\u2019s quarterly earnings per share estimate to US$1.40, with the average consensus at US$1.42, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Martinrea\u2019s forecast was reduced to $0.50, with the street average at $0.54.\n\nGM is Magna\u2019s largest customer, making up about 15 per cent of its sales and it\u2019s a \u201ctop customer\u201d for Martinrea, Neville said. \u201cWhile the strike is limited to U.S. workers/facilities, the impact has started to ripple through the North American supply chain,\u201d he said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Bank of Nova Scotia analyst slashed third-quarter profit estimates by about 5.5 per cent on Magna and Martinrea International", "authors": ["Divya Balji", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
