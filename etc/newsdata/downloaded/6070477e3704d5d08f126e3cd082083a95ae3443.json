The book, which is scheduled to come out in November, will focus on interviews with dozens of Democratic political strategists, including Donna Brazile, David Axelrod, Amanda Renteria, James Carville, Jennifer Granholm, and Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nJudith Regan, the head of Regan Arts, is scheduled to release the following statement upon the announcement of the book\u2019s upcoming release, according to Politico: \u201cI do not in any way, shape, or form condone any harm done by one human being to another. I have also lived long enough to believe in the power of forgiveness, second chances, and offering a human being a path to redemption. HOW TO BEAT TRUMP is an important, thoughtful book, and I hope everyone has a chance to read it.\u201d\n\nThe news came as a shock to accusers, including one who described the development as a \u201cslap in the face to all the women that he has victimized.\u201d\n\nReached by phone, Eleanor McManus, cofounder of Trident DMG, who came forward with her own story about Halperin in 2017, said the book deal comes before an apology to his alleged victims.\n\n\u201cHe leveraged his position as a prominent journalist to prey on women. He has yet to take responsibility for his actions by apologizing to his victims or demonstrating genuine contrition,\u201d McManus said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cGiving him a book once again puts him in a position of authority and that is a slap in the face to all the women that he has victimized.\u201d\n\nAs for the more than 75 Democratic strategists Halperin reportedly spoke with to write the book (many of whom have not responded to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment), their contribution to his resurgence has been duly noted by those in the media industry.\n\nBrazile, a veteran Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor, told The Daily Beast that her decision to speak with Halperin has \u201cdisappointed\u201d friends but that she felt her voice on the book\u2019s subject was needed.\n\n\u201cMuch has been said or written about Mark Halperin\u2019s failures. We have condemned him, disgraced him and shoved him away. We are still angry at him and will never cease to admonish him,\u201d Brazile said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cAfter a lot of emails, tough times for sure, I wanted to go on the record with my answers about how to defeat Trump. Many of my friends today are disappointed that I answered Mark\u2019s call, but I did so after he understood where I was coming from.\u201d\n\nAxelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, addressed the backlash in a tweet Sunday evening, writing that he had not given enough thought on how his \u201cparticipation would be used or interpreted.\u201d Reiterating Brazile\u2019s sentiments, he added: \u201cBy answering Halperin\u2019s questions, I did not in any way mean to excuse his past, egregious behavior and, in retrospect, I regret responding at all.\u201d\n\nOne America News Network correspondent Emily Miller, one of the numerous female journalists to have accused Halperin of sexual harassment, thanked Axelrod for apologizing but echoed other victims\u2019 distress over learning about the book this late in the game. \u201cThank you for saying you regret it,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cI wish someone had told us - the victims - this was happening so we could at least prepare emotionally.\u201d She then tagged the Press Forward foundation, a non-profit established to create safer workplaces in media by many of Halperin\u2019s accusers.\n\n\u201cShould Mark Halperin, along with others whose detrimental behavior was credibly exposed through the hard work of journalists, be allowed back in the arena without demonstrating the standards we expect of our kids?\u201d Press Forward said in a statement \u201cThere can be no talk of redemption without even a semblance of atonement.\u201d\n\nRenteria, formerly the national political director for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, similarly told the The Daily Beast that her involvement in Halperin\u2019s book should not indicate his absolution. \u201cAs my record shows, I have no sympathy for people with a history of sexual harassment in the workplace and I\u2019m not interested in rehabilitating anyone\u2019s career,\u201d Renteria said. \u201cAt the same time, women and people of color are worse off when our voices and experiences are left out of campaign histories like this.\u201d\n\nAnother former Clinton senior adviser who spoke to Halperin, Adrienne Elrod, told The Daily Beast that her \u201csingular professional focus is defeating Donald Trump in 2020\u201d and said she has spoken to \u201ca number of people\u201d about the 2016 election\u2019s relevance to winning back the White House. But added, \u201cif I had to do it again I would have been more thoughtful and respectful to the women who have been affected.\u201d\n\nBen LaBolt, a spokesperson in the Obama administration and political strategist, also told The Daily Beast that his participation was not intended to help Halperin personally. \u201cI treated it as a normal reporter call but I should have revisited the accusations against him before taking the call,\u201d LaBolt said. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to appear to excuse his past behavior or be part of a PR campaign.\u201d\n\nThe Halperin book is far from the first time Regan has courted controversy. Back in 2006, she infamously agreed to publish O.J. Simpson\u2019s sort-of tell-all on the murders of his ex-wife and her friend, If I Did It. Following a firestorm of outrage, both the book and a Fox TV special were canceled, and she was eventually fired by News Corporation. (Regan would later receive a reported $10 million settlement after she sued News Corp. for defamation.)\n\nRegan and Regan Arts did not immediately respond to a call and email for comment.\n\nFollowing the wave of allegations that Halperin had groped several female colleagues and made unwanted sexual advances toward them, he found himself dropped from the numerous projects he was working on at the time. He was fired from Showtime\u2019s The Circus, a planned book with longtime partner John Heilemann was nixed, and HBO canceled an upcoming series based on that canceled book.\n\nOver the past few months, however, Halperin has reemerged in an attempt to jumpstart his once lucrative career\u2014all with the help of some friends in the media. While starting up a new political newsletter, Halperin has made several appearances on Michael Smerconish\u2019s SiriusXM radio show.\n\nOn top of that, MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have been offering Halperin moral support behind the scenes and even attempted to collaborate with Halperin on an online-only program focusing on the 2018 midterms before that was scrapped by the network.\n\nPrior to the accusations coming to light and his dismissal from NBC News as a political analyst, Halperin was a fixture on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. The alleged sexual misconduct took place during his time at ABC News.", "description": "News of the \u201cGame Change\u201d author\u2019s deal with Regan Arts came as a shock to his accusers, and prominent Democrats interviewed in the book have been scrambling to explain themselves.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona", "Audrey Mcnamara", "Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1396,w_2483,x_329,y_118/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1566145646/GettyImages-678145752_vr1eat", "published_at": "2019-08-18"}
