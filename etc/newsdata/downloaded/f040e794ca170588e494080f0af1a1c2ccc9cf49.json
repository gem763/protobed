The next is not scheduled to happen until 2022.\n\nBut Johnson has been trying to secure an early vote to try to win a majority to allow him to push through legislation to enact Brexit.\n\nHis third attempt to get parliament to agree to disband early and hold a general election on December 12 ended in failure on Monday after he fell well short of the required support of two-thirds of MPs.\n\nBut he was making a fresh bid for the same date on Tuesday using a different parliamentary procedure that would only require a simple majority.\n\nHe consulted his cabinet ministers to plot strategy in advance of another gruelling session of the lower House of Commons that could stretch into the night.\n\nJohnson's new attempt amends existing laws requiring a two-thirds majority by proposing a simple bill with an election date.\n\n\"This house cannot any longer keep this country hostage,\" Johnson told lawmakers after they defeated Monday's election attempt.\n\n- Date debate -\n\nJohnson's election push received a big boost when the leader of the main opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, indicated his support.\n\nVeteran socialist Corbyn has been torn between rival camps within his own party and is facing poor polling numbers that show the Conservatives in a strong lead.\n\nHe has argued he cannot back an election until Johnson promises not to take Britain out of the EU without a new trade deal when the post-Brexit transition period ends in December 2020.\n\nBritain would be following EU rules until that time.\n\nBut he said the latest delay to Brexit agreed by EU leaders on Monday meant \"for the next there months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met\".\n\n\"We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen,\" he added.\n\nThe sides must now settle on an election date.\n\nJohnson insists on December 12. A rival plan proposed by the pro-European Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP) proposes December 9.\n\nThe second option is also preferred by Labour.\n\nSome in the party say the later date reduces the number of more liberal students voting because it comes after they finish their semesters and return home for the winter break.\n\nLabour's trade spokesman Barry Gardiner told BBC radio \"the first thing\" for Johnson to do to get his party's backing was \"to ensure that students are not going to be disenfranchised by an election on December 12\".\n\nCorbyn did not specify a date in his statement.\n\n\"It will be a December election,\" a Labour source told AFP.\n\nThe last election to be held in December was in 1923, when Labour's Ramsay McDonald lost to the Conservatives led by Stanley Baldwin.\n\nThe debate appears to be one of principle.\n\nThe SNP's parliamentary leader Ian Blackford urged Labour to not \"be the handmaidens to the prime minister's Brexit\" and to fight for the earlier date.\n\nJohnson is mainly concerned about amendments that could be attached to his bill.\n\nOne proposed option would extend voting rights to EU citizens -- a group that strongly opposed Brexit.\n\nAnother would lower the voting age from 18 to 16.", "description": "Britain looked set Tuesday for a pre-Christmas election after the main opposition Labour party backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's push for an early vote to try to overcome the lengthening political deadlock caused by Brexit.
