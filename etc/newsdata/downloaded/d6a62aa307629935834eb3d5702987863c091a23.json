Three men died during construction of the Arena Amazonia in Manaus and now nobody uses it.\n\nThere are similar stories to be found elsewhere, just without the deaths.\n\nIn the capital, Brasilia, a \u00a3625m World Cup stadium has occasionally been used as a bus depot. In Natal \u2014 where Luis Suarez bit Italy\u2019s Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder \u2014 the Arena das Dunas tries to make money by hosting weddings, while Cuiaba\u2019s 42,000-seat Arena Pantanal has been found to have homeless people living in the dressing rooms.\n\nGianni Infantino and his ugly travelling FIFA circus do not appear to care much about the huge, horrible footprints left by their increasingly vainglorious projects\n\nSo when FIFA president Gianni Infantino says, as he did last week, that the proposed 24-team Club World Cup \u2014 planned for three weeks in China in the summer of 2021 \u2014 is designed to grow the game in Asia, do not be tempted to believe him.\n\nInfantino and his ugly travelling circus do not appear to care much about the huge, horrible footprints left by their increasingly vainglorious projects. If they did care, they would have recognised the millions of pounds lost by economies in South Africa and Brazil in the wake of hosting their World Cups. They would have recognised that neither tournament did anything for the long-term good of the sport in those nations at all.\n\nThey would have worked with Russia last time around to do things differently. But they didn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, they chivvied the hosts of World Cup 2018 into spending the best part of \u00a311bn on what became the most expensive football tournament in history. And so it goes on.\n\nThree men died during construction of the Arena Amazonia in Manaus and now nobody uses it\n\nA revamped and extended Club World Cup, crowbarred in to an already overcrowded schedule, is a preposterous concept. It is born of FIFA self-interest, designed to satisfy sponsors, corporate guests and television while stretching the loyalty of the football public and the endurance and fitness of its players to the very limit.\n\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with the future good of the game in China any more than it has in Greenland.\n\nIt is an Infantino vanity project and the Premier League\u2019s big clubs must stand firm against it. If they don\u2019t, then coaches and managers should never again expect us to listen to problems caused by domestic fixture congestion. Members of the European Club Association have already indicated they are opposed to the new format and its executive board \u2014 on which Manchester United\u2019s Ed Woodward and Peter Moore of Liverpool sit \u2014 must take the lead now.\n\nLiverpool, as Champions League winners, will play in the competition in its current annual form in Qatar in December.\n\nFIFA\u2019s plan to turn Club World Cup into a three-week tournament would be much more invasive\n\nThat is a seven-day trip that could involve two games and already feels like an inconvenience to Jurgen Klopp. It may directly affect Liverpool\u2019s chances of winning the Premier League.\n\nFIFA\u2019s plan to turn the competition in to a three-week summer tournament every four years would be much more invasive. It would leave top European players with only one summer off in four and really is as ridiculous as it sounds.\n\nChina was the only bidder for the 2021 event and that tells us much. Football neither wants nor needs this tournament and we can only hope the clubs with real influence \u2014 the superpowers of England, Germany, Italy and Spain \u2014 make good on their threat of reducing its relevance by simply not turning up.\n\nEight days on and Victor Lindelof\u2019s kick to Divock Origi\u2019s calf in the build-up to Manchester United\u2019s goal at Old Trafford still looks like a foul.\n\nOrigi didn\u2019t help himself by exaggerating his fall but a dive after contact should not necessary preclude the first offence from being punished.\n\nI have long thought there is no reason, for example, why a foul in the penalty area that is followed by a dive should not result in the referee awarding both a spot-kick AND a yellow card for the attacker. It sounds illogical but it is not.\n\nVictor Lindelof\u2019s kick on Divock Origi\u2019s calf at Old Trafford still looks like a foul\n\nWHERE WOULD CITY BE WITHOUT SUPER SERGIO?\n\nIt is extraordinary to think that only the intervention of Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak prevented Sergio Aguero leaving the club for Chelsea in the summer of 2017.\n\nHaving endured a difficult first season under Pep Guardiola, Aguero feared he was about to lose his place to the Brazilian Gabriel Jesus.\n\nThat Mubarak used his personal friendship with Aguero to intervene was smart. And here we are \u2014 72 goals later \u2014 with Aguero leading the City line and young Jesus (right) in his shadow.\n\nAguero is a private man \u2014 good to his friends but unfussed about publicity. He doesn\u2019t do big interviews and hides behind problems with his English that are nowhere near as great as he says.\n\nThe Premier League\u2019s greatest ever foreign striker? Henry, Drogba and Van Nistelrooy would have a say but Aguero\u2019s legacy is already profound.\n\nIf City were to win the Champions League, they should let him take the trophy home.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN: In the Brazilian rainforest, the stadium used for England's first game of the 2014 World Cup cost \u00a3235million of public money to build.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20258440-0-image-a-99_1572216604526.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
