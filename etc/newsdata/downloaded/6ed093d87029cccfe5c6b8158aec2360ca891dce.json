I have not discussed anything,\" Tahir Al Amri, executive president of the central bank, told reporters in Kuwait ahead of a banking conference this week.\n\nThe Gulf state's finances have been hurt by a slump in oil prices in recent years.\n\nThe central bank estimates real gross domestic product growth at 1.1% this year, down from an estimated 2.2% last year, it told Reuters in a statement late on Sunday.\n\nDespite its access to financial markets - with a well received $3 billion bond issuance in July - Oman's fiscal position remains weak and its debt is rated junk by rating agencies.\n\nBut Amri said the deficit was decreasing, partly thanks to more control on spending.\n\n\"The deficit has gone down. There is a little bit of control on spending and we've got a little bit more money from the excise tax.\"\n\nAmri also reiterated Oman's commitment to the rial's peg against the U.S. dollar, saying it provides stability.\n\n\"There are no plans to change the monetary policy with regards to the exchange rate. We believe we can support it.\"", "description": "Oman not in talks with Gulf countries for financial aid, sees growth at 1.1%", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
