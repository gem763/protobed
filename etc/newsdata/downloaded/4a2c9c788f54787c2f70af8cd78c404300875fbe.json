It\u2019s important for it to be announced today, because otherwise there will no option except \u2018no deal,\u2019 which is not the solution we prefer,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinesses and markets on both sides of the Channel fear a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, where Britain severs ties with its closest trading partner with no new plans in place after 46 years of integration.\n\nJohnson said that if MPs backed his bill, he would immediately \u201cde-escalate\u201d preparations for no deal.\n\n\u2013 More hurdles ahead \u2013\n\nBut even if Johnson wins the two votes on Tuesday evening, MPs could still derail his bill.\n\nSome lawmakers want to secure much closer future trade relations with the EU after Brexit, seeking to amend the bill to demand Britain stay in the bloc\u2019s customs union.\n\nAfter tens of thousands of people demonstrated in London on Saturday for a second referendum, some MPs will also seek to attach plans for a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d to the bill.\n\nIf the Brexit withdrawal bill passes the Commons unscathed, it must still be approved by the unelected upper House of Lords \u2014 and then the European Parliament.\n\nThe deal is the second of its kind, after a Brexit text agreed by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May was rejected three times by MPs earlier this year.\n\nIt covers EU citizens\u2019 rights, Britain\u2019s financial settlements, a post-Brexit transition period until at least the end of 2020 and most controversially, new trade arrangements for Northern Ireland.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened Tuesday to abandon ratifying his Brexit deal and instead seek an early election if", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/8c0a17_parliament-has-forced-johnson-request-month-extension-european-leaders-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
