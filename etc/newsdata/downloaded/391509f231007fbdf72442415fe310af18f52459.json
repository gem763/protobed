REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nSterling traded near a six-week high versus the dollar as some speculators scaled back bearish bets on the pound, but sentiment remained weak due to uncertainty over how Britain will exit the European Union.\n\nWith investors largely pricing in a quarter-point rate cut by the Fed, the focus will be on how much more easing it signals for this year and next.\n\nSome analysts warn that the dollar could bounce if the Fed does the minimum that markets expect.\n\n\u201cSpeculators are already excessively short the dollar,\u201d said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cIf there are no surprises from the Fed, the speculators will have to give up their dollar shorts. The biggest reaction would be in dollar/yen.\u201d\n\nThe dollar traded at 108.20 yen JPY=EBS on Wednesday, close to a seven-week high of 108.37 yen.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 was quoted at $1.2487, holding onto a 0.6% gain from Tuesday, when it briefly touched the highest since July 19.\n\nOil prices edged lower in Asia, extending a 6% tumble on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said the kingdom has tapped inventories to restore oil supplies to where they stood before drone attacks over the weekend shut around 5% of global oil output.\n\nJUMP IN U.S. BORROWING COSTS\n\nA surge in overnight U.S. borrowing costs also supported the dollar.\n\nOvernight borrowing costs in the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement market spiked to 10% on Tuesday as lending dwindled due to huge corporate tax payments and the settlement of $78 billion of Treasuries sold last week.\n\nThe repo market allows banks and Wall Street dealers use\n\nsecurities as collateral to obtain cash from money market funds\n\nand other cash investors.\n\nThe New York Fed responded by injecting $53.15 billion into the financial system with overnight repos, a money market operation it has not used in more than a decade.\n\nThe New York Fed later said in a statement it will conduct another repo operation on Wednesday for up to $75 billion.\n\nThe spike in short-term rates shows there is a shortage of dollar liquidity in the U.S. repo market, but some investors and analysts are also worried about a shortage of dollars in the offshore market.\n\nSome traders say are monitoring cross-currency basis swaps JPYCBS3Y=, which are starting to widen in a sign of higher costs for dollars.\n\n\u201cThis problem will come up again in a week or two because there will be strong demand for dollars at the end of September, which is the end of the third quarter,\u201d said Akira Takei, a global fixed income fund manager at Asset Management One in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWe better prepare for a rainy day. Difficulty in funding dollars could lead to another sell-off in Treasuries.\u201d\n\nThe chaotic moves in money markets and late-day swings in U.S. federal funds futures mean the CME\u2019s FEDWATCH tool shows about a 51% chance that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, which is at odds with economists\u2019 and market expectations.\n\nElsewhere in the currency market, the euro stood at $1.1065 EUR=EBS, little changed in Asian trade.\n\nThe Australian dollar fetched $0.68485 AUD=D3, down 0.27%.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY measuring the greenback against a basket of six major currencies fell 0.03% to 98.288.\n\nAfter the Fed releases its policy decision, traders will turn to the Bank of Japan\u2019s meeting ending on Thursday to see if it follows its global peers by easing policy.\n\nDeepening negative rates will be the key option if the BOJ were to ease, although the central bank may accompany that with measures to mitigate the pain on financial institutions, sources have told Reuters.", "description": "The dollar traded near a seven-week high versus the yen on Wednesday as oil markets slowly recovered from a supply shock, but markets were cautious ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later in the day that is expected to deliver another interest rate cut.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431040094&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H041", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
