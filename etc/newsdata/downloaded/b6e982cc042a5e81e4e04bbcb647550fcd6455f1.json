From fear and anxiety to hope and healing, BBC Future\u2019s Climate Emotions series examines our complex responses to climate change, and how those responses will shape our ability to deal with the environmental challenge we face.\n\nI was leaving my home in London and taking a flight across the Atlantic to join my partner in Costa Rica. The last time I flew was in 2014, while living in Bordeaux, France. Getting to my sister\u2019s hen party in Scotland by train, my usual option, would have taken days that I didn\u2019t have, so then too I bit the bullet and took a flight.\n\nThe reason I have avoided flying for so long is its hefty carbon footprint. Since I was a teenager I\u2019d had a growing niggling guilt about the emissions from flying, as I found out more and more about climate change and its impacts. After all, flying is probably the most carbon-intensive activity you can do, on an hour-to-hour basis. Eventually this led me to vow only to do it if absolutely necessary.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not alone. Over the past year or so, an anti-flying movement known as \u201cflight shame\u201d \u2013 or flygskam in Swedish, where the movement began \u2013 has been gathering pace in Europe.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nThe term speaks of the guilt of taking flights at a time when the world needs to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions. For me, it points to a painful contrast between the happy-go-lucky indulgence of a weekend flight and the devastating real world impact of climate change. Others have referred to it as the embarrassment of flying despite being environmentally \u201cwoke\u201d.\n\nThis growing resistance to aviation has reinvigorated rail travel, with some rediscovering the attraction of night trains, and it is increasing pressure on politicians to address aviation\u2019s climate impact.\n\nBut it is also changing our ideas of how, why and where we travel.\n\nSlow travel\n\nAlthough \u201cshame\u201d is a very negative term, the goals are positive \u2013 for people who take part in the movement as well as for the environment. Importantly, it is less about \u201cshaming\u201d other people who fly than changing your own travel patterns.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the aim of many promoting less flying is by no means to discourage people from exploring the world. \u201cNot flying doesn\u2019t mean not travelling,\u201d says Anna Hughes, who runs the Flight Free 2020 campaign in the UK. \u201cThere are so many places that we can access by other means.\u201d\n\nThe movement is instead about revelling in the slow, deliberate journeys that are possible without aviation. One of the obvious choices is train travel, which has one-10th the emissions of flying, Hughes notes. \u201cAnd, from my point of view, it\u2019s way more enjoyable,\u201d she adds.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that a plane is not always the fastest or cheapest option, as train travel typically brings you from the centre of one city to another. In particular, high-speed trains have huge potential as an alternative: new high-speed lines have been shown to reduce aviation transport on the same routes by as much as 80%.\n\nAnd even if it does take more time, other forms of transport can be more rewarding. Like Hughes, I have experienced the joys of slow travel in my five earthbound years, from late-night conversations with a couple of Iranian travellers on an overnight train to Verona, to sipping a whisky in the bar of the Caledonian sleeper to Edinburgh.\n\nI\u2019ve seen some incredible things that you just wouldn\u2019t see getting on a plane\n\nSlow travel needn\u2019t be limited to short distances, either. Roger Tyers is a climate sociologist who recently returned from a \u201cno-flying fieldtrip\u201d to China, which took him two weeks by train each way. It might sound like a daunting expedition, but he is glowing about his train trip. \u201cIt was a fascinating journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some incredible things that you just wouldn\u2019t see getting on a plane.\u201d He lists a slew of other advantages: digital detox, reading, talking to different people, no jetlag. \u201cAnd just appreciating the size of our planet and how diverse it is.\u201d\n\nClimate impacts\n\nTo put the difference between train and plane in perspective, it only takes a return flight from London to Moscow to use up one-fifth of your \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for the whole year. This budget is the amount of carbon each person can emit in 2030 while still avoiding dangerous levels of global warming. Making the same journey by train would use roughly one-50th of your yearly budget.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the impact of plane emissions is thought to at least double if you include the warming effect of emissions other than CO2, such as water vapour in contrails and nitrogen oxides being released at high altitudes. It triples yet again if you take business not economy class, due to the larger seats \u2013 a less efficient use of valuable cabin space.\n\n\u201cThe more you understand about the climate impact of flying, the more you feel guilty whenever you get on a plane,\u201d says Hughes.\n\nSwedish roots\n\nThe flight shame movement first emerged in 2017, when Swedish singer Staffan Lindberg announced his decision to give up flying. Other celebrity advocates include biathlete Bj\u00f6rn Ferry, who has committed to travelling to competitions by train, and opera-singer Malena Ernman, mother of 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nSo far, the idea has gathered most momentum in Sweden. Hashtag #jagstannarp\u00e5marken, which translates as #stayontheground, has become a buzzword. An instagram account calling out celebrities promoting trips to far-flung destinations has 60,000 followers. Thunberg\u2019s own efforts to avoid flying have raised the profile of the movement yet further, as well as bringing fierce disdain from some quarters.\n\nThe no flying movement is also gaining traction elsewhere\n\nThe idea appears to have already made a measurable impact on traveling patterns in Sweden. Airport operator Swedavia AB saw year-on-year passenger numbers drop across its 10 airports in the first three months of 2019. Swedavia says the climate debate is one reason behind a 3% fall in domestic passenger numbers in 2018. In total, 23% of Swedes reduced their air travel in 2018 due to its climate impact, according to a WWF survey.\n\nThe no flying movement is also gaining traction elsewhere. In addition to the UK\u2019s Flight Free 2020 campaign, other countries such as Canada, Belgium and France are starting their own initiatives. In each case, signatories are only technically committing to staying on the ground if 100,000 other people from their country sign up, although some may choose not to fly regardless.\n\nMaking a choice to cut back or cut out flying in your personal life is one thing, but work poses another problem for people who fly for their jobs. Some organisations are already getting behind the movement, though. The Danish broadsheet newspaper Politiken, for example, has outlined plans to stop domestic flying by its journalists, offset the flights which are taken and refocus its travel section to trips accessible by train.\n\nI can imagine a world in 20 years\u2019 time where people laugh about the fact that we used to fly halfway around the world to have a meeting\n\nAcademia is another flight-heavy industry where people are making changes. Several noted climate scientists are already very public about their efforts to fly less both for work and their personal lives, while 650 academics are supporting a campaign to greatly reduce flying. Larkin, who has not flown for over a decade, argues that institutions need to change their expectations of how often their staff fly.\n\n\u201cI can imagine a world in 20 years\u2019 time where people laugh about the fact that we used to fly halfway around the world to have a meeting \u2013 it\u2019s like, why would you do that?\u201d she says, adding that good virtual connections could go a long way towards reducing flights for meetings.\n\nLarkin thinks it is particularly important for academics working in climate change to set the example by reducing their flying. \u201cIf you go to your GP and they are sitting there smoking and they are telling you to give up smoking,\u201d she says. \u201cThen you think, \u2018Well, I'm not sure I believe that it\u2019s actually bad for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nSystemic change\n\nSo where is the flight shame movement leading? Can individuals giving up flying really quell the huge rise in flights that is projected, especially when much flying tends to be done by a select few \"binge fliers\"?\n\nThe sociologist Tyers argues that the social effect of personal choices such as not flying goes much further than the emissions saved from that one flight. \u201cI think that people waste a lot of time talking about individual action versus collective action,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting everybody to do what I\u2019ve done. But I think if anything the kind of extreme nature of my journey has raised certain awareness of this issue. I would say the people who I\u2019m hoping the message gets to are the people who could substitute flights for something else.\u201d\n\nThis view is backed up by research. In a set of interviews, Steve Westlake, a doctoral candidate at Cardiff University, found that the choice to avoid flying had social knock-on effects. The interviewees indicated that it was the commitment shown by people who don\u2019t fly that influenced them to try and fly less too.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s difficult, that has quite a strong communicative effect,\u201d says Westlake. \u201cSo people go, \u2018Wow, you've given up flying completely?\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s very understable that not everyone will be willing or able to cut out flying in this way. Cutting down as much as possible can still reduce your carbon footprint by a huge amount. I have never made a hard rule never to fly again, but to try only to do it rarely and when it really seems essential \u2013 such as my move this year to Costa Rica.\n\nFeeling shame for something in the right proportions can actually be really positive \u2013 Anna Hughes\n\nVoluntary reductions can only go so far. The bigger goal, argues Westlake, is for flights to be taxed and regulated appropriately for their climate impact. Proposals for how to do this include taxing jet fuel and frequent-flyer levies. The Swedish government, for example, has introduced an \u201ceco-tax\u201d on aviation and said it will invest in night trains.\n\nLeveraging something as seemingly negative as shame to aid climate action could have its pitfalls, though. \u201cAs a way of trying to push [going flight-free] I don\u2019t really like it,\u201d says Westlake. \u201cBecause all the language around shaming, and guilt-tripping and virtue-signalling has got a lot of sort of negative connotations.\u201d\n\nHughes agrees, but says campaigns like hers also have to be hard-hitting. \u201cFeeling shame for something in the right proportions can actually be really positive,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to feed into that niggling knowledge that this is not actually the greatest thing I should be doing, maybe I should stop doing it.\u201d\n\nThe answer, again, might come from Sweden and another climate buzzword \u2013 tagskryt, which translates as the rather more positive and proactive \u201ctrain bragging\u201d.\n\n--\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
