On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values which include 'we respect each other and celebrate our diversity' and 'we take pride in delivering quality and value for money'. I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.\"", "description": "BBC presenter Samira Ahmed has questioned why she was paid considerably less than a high-profile male colleague in \"a very similar job\" on the eve of her employment tribunal over claims of unequal pay.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Telegraph View", "Tim Stanley", "Benedict Spence", "Nick Timothy"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000177157372-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXei15FauaEeO0gB33cFGgPxyuMdnUrFBZ2WuWJz0XM8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
