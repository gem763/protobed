Your Queen?\u201d\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a92017 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.

This is complicated for him.\n\n\u201cHe loves her. He disapproves strongly of what she\u2019s doing. He lusts after her. He fears her. She feels his ambivalence.\"\n\n(Image: Helen Sloan/HBO)\n\nIn a moment that was cut from the final edit, Daenerys says to Jon: \"It disgusts you.\u201d\n\nIt is then that her expression \"hardens\" and she says to Jon: \"All right then, let it be fear.\u201d\n\nThe deleted words would have shown how Dany was becoming increasingly isolated from all around her before she lost her patience before attacking Kings Landing.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
