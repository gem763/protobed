The National Weather Service has warned winds could reach 75 miles per hour, leading to \"erratic fire behavior\u201d and downed power lines.\n\nPG&E has said the outages will affect approximately 940,000 homes and businesses in 36 counties for at least 48 hours, although they said San Francisco itself is not projected to be affected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing people reporting that they\u2019re going to stay and fight this fire,\u201d Essick said. \u201cYou cannot fight this. Please evacuate.\u201d\n\nGusts are expected to peak early Sunday in the strongest such wind event in several years, according to PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel, who said there is also a high probability of breaking branches and falling trees.\n\nPG&E\u2019s approach to the shutoffs has come under major criticism, particularly from disability advocates who warn that power could mean life or death for people who rely on medical equipment. A northern California man in El Dorado County who relied on an oxygen tank died earlier this month after PG&E cut power to his home.\n\nLast week, San Jose, the third-biggest city in California and the largest served by PG&E, proposed turning the private utility into a publicly owned cooperative.\n\n\u201cThis is a crisis begging for a better solution than what PG&E customers see being considered today,\u201d Mayor Sam Liccardo (D) said.", "description": "Broad swaths of Sonoma County in Northern California were evacuated Saturday amid a major fire that led Pacific Gas & Electric to cut electricity to millions of homes, according", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/northerncaliforniafire_102718getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
