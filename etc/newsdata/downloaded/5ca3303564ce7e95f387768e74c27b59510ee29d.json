The account inserts shark terms into his tweets to mock Trump\u2019s hatred of sharks. \u201cTrump apparently hates sharks, so this bot does some word replacement on his tweets to make them about sharks,\u201d the account explains.\n\nScreen Shot/Twitter/@RealDonaldTrump Screen shot of Trump's retweet of message attacking \"pro shark media\"\n\nNo wonder Trump hates the \u201cpro shark media.\u201d In a 2013 tweet, he classified sharks with the \u201closers and the haters of the World!\u201d\n\nTrump got triggered Sunday after conservative talk radio host Mark Levin exploded when Fox News reporter Ed Henry pressed Levin if it was \u201cokay\u201d for Trump to ask the Ukrainian president in a July phone call \u201cto dig up dirt\u201d on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. The call has become the focus of a formal House impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhat happened in the Oval Office on that call, was it illegal or not?\u201d Henry asked Levin.\n\nTrump posted a clip of the confrontation on Fox \u2014 and retweeted multiple attacks on Henry and praise for Levin. But many Twitter followers enjoyed the president\u2019s retweet about the pro-shark media.\n\nI can\u2019t believe Trump retweeted this bot account about turning his tweets into stuff about sharks without even noticing the unflattering profile picture. pic.twitter.com/d8o4dMRGrq \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 29, 2019\n\nTrump retweeted this account?
