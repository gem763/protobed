Plants that require humidity in addition to water \u2014 such as ferns, calatheas, and philodendrons \u2014 benefit most from misting, but almost all plants could use a good spritz. Particularly plants kept indoors, because \u2018most plants like a higher than average humidity level,\u2019 according to Marc Hachadourian, director of Glasshouse Horticulture and senior curator of orchids at New York Botanical Garden, who says that humidity levels in most homes and apartments tend to be quite low (especially in the winter when the heat is blasting).\n\n\u2018Mist is so important, and just generally increasing the humidity around plants will yield so many benefits,\u2019 agrees Rebecca Bullene, owner of the plant store, Greenery. To find the best misters (and misting techniques), we spoke with Hachadourian, Bullene, and five more plant experts about their favorites \u2014 all of which we suggest supplementing with a humidifier, to maintain that higher than average humidity plants thrive in.\n\nBest overall plant mister\n\nFlairosol Clear Spray Bottle, 5 Ounces The most recommended mister was actually this generic-looking hair salon staple. Bullene uses it, as does interior plant designer Lisa Mu\u00f1oz, founder of Leaf and June, who says that while it\u2019s \u2018typically something you\u2019d see in salons,\u2019 it\u2019s her favorite mister for plants. \u2018It\u2019s small and lightweight, even when full of water, and it creates a gentle, steady mist.\u2019 (She likes the 5-ounce bottle for \u2018easier storage,\u2019 but it also comes in a larger 24-ounce size.) The mist this bottle creates is very fine, too \u2014 a consistency Bullene says is essential: \u2018The problem with a lot of traditional misters is the droplet size is actually fairly large. The goal isn\u2019t to wet the leaves or wet the stems; it\u2019s to change the air quality around the plant, so a finer mist is really what it\u2019s all about.\u2019 Mu\u00f1oz adds that misting is \u2018also helpful for cleaning the dust off plant foliage,\u2019 which helps leaves photosynthesize more efficiently. She also recommends \u2018keeping a mister with a neem oil or insecticidal soap solution on hand\u2019 if you\u2019re looking for a way to combat mites and other plant pests. \u00a39 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest stylish plant mister\n\nHaws Brass Mister, 10 Ounces If you\u2019re looking for a mister you can proudly leave out in the open, Igor Josifovic and Judith de Graaff, authors of Urban Jungle: Living and Styling With Plants, recommend this brass model from famed gardening-tool brand Haws. They love the mister (which also comes in copper and nickel) for its simplicity: \u2018The press plunger is easy to use and the size of water droplets is really nice and small.\u2019 And because it \u2018looks really good paired with plants.\u2019 Josifovic and de Graaff recommend using misters on tropical plants (ferns, orchids, Calathea, Maranta, banana plants, and air plants), and misting them in the early morning, because sunlight can help the moisture evaporate. \u00a315 at Haws Buy\n\nBest basic plant mister\n\nClay Roberts Water Spray Bottles, 750ml Hachadourian recommends \u2018a simple pump sprayer you\u2019d get at a hardware store\u2019 as another utilitarian mister. \u2018They\u2019re adjustable, so you can use a fine mist for the foliage, or switch to a stream if you want to knock off an insect or something.\u2019 He also notes that plants themselves can be natural humidifiers because they \u2018release moisture into the air through respiration and perspiration,\u2019 and suggests grouping indoor plants together in one area to create a sort of microclimate in whatever room they\u2019re in. \u00a39 for 3 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest hand-pump plant mister\n\nSolo One-Hand Pressure Sprayer, 1 Liter If you have a lot of plants, Hachadourian suggests considering a pump-style pressurized sprayer so you don\u2019t need to squeeze over and over again. \u2018No one wants to get carpal tunnel from spraying plants,\u2019 he says. Bullene says this Solo \u2018air pump\u2019 mister creates a \u2018continuous spray\u2019 that\u2019s great for misting multiple plants or a larger area (its one-litre tank holds roughly the same amount of water as the 32-ounce spray bottle on our list.) \u00a314 at eBay UK Buy\n\nBest heavy-duty plant mister\n\nSprayers Plus FH10 Hand-Held Compression Sprayer, 1 Gallon \u2018I\u2019d suggest this for plant owners who have very large plants, or for serious tropical plant people,\u2019 says Christan Summer, co-founder of Brooklyn\u2019s Tula Houseplant shop and Tulita plant truck. \u2018Our bird-of-paradise and Dracaena marginata are both over 12 feet tall, so I can\u2019t reach the top foliage anymore.\u2019 This sprayer is a \u2018lifesaver\u2019 because it allows her to \u2018keep the top foliage clean and hydrated,\u2019 says Summer, who also likes that it \u2018holds a lot of water.\u2019 But her favorite feature is that it creates a continuous mist and allows users to \u2018change the style from a wide spread to a strong stream, which really helps with the big/tall guys that we have at home and in the shop.\u2019 Summer, who uses the larger FH20 at her shop, recommends the smaller F10 model for home. \u00a328 at eBay UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
