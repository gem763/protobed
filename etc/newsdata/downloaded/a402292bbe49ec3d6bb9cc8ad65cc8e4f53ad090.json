He expected criticism soon if Jess Phillips, another popular guest, became leader of Britain\u2019s Labour Party. \u201cIf in 10 years' time, the country is falling apart due to the fact Jess Phillips has moved violently to the left and totally screwed everything up, there will be people who\u2019ll say, \u2018She\u2019s only popular because she was on \u201cHave I Got News for You,\u201d\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nJimmy Mulville, co-founder of Hat Trick Productions, the company behind the show, said he didn\u2019t lose sleep over Johnson\u2019s or Rees-Mogg\u2019s rise. If anything \u201cgives me cause for concern\u201d about the show, he said, it was when politicians have used it to rehabilitate their public image. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctor who was accused of beefing up the case for Britain and America to invade Iraq, had done just that, Mulville said.", "description": "The prime minister\u2019s early appearances on \u201cHave I Got News For You,\u201d a comedy show, helped endear him to the British public.", "authors": ["Alex Marshall"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/arts/24haveigotnews1/24haveigotnews1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
