He suffered the injury swatting at the ball midway through the first quarter.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old had maintained good health in the two seasons prior to 2018-19, appearing in 75 games in both campaigns. However, he was limited to 56 games last year because of injuries and an ongoing trade saga with the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nHe missed three games early on with a sprained right elbow and nine games midseason with a sprained left index finger. When healthy, though, Davis is one of the best big men in the league.\n\nA six-time All-Star, Davis had been the Lakers' top target since he demanded a trade out of New Orleans. While the Lakers were unable to get a deal done during last season, they landed him during the offseason, adding a co-star alongside four-time MVP LeBron James.\n\nAlthough the Lakers spent the summer trying to fill out a roster to complement the James-Davis duo, they do not have much size. Should AD miss time, Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee would see more action.\n\nThe addition of Davis instantly brought championship-or-bust expectations for the purple and gold. Now, the top priority in L.A. is making sure Davis is healthy for the pursuit of banner No. 17.", "description": "Los Angeles Lakers  star Anthony Davis\u00a0 suffered a sprained right thumb in the first half of Saturday's preseason game against the  Brooklyn Nets  in  Shenzhen,\u00a0 China, and didn't return...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/821/605/hi-res-c5e5444ceef79c5312fbe5f163f896b6_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
