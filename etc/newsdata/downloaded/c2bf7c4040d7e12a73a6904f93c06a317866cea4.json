Probably not,\" he added. \"Let's let this play out a bit and see what happens.\"\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was less impressed.\n\n\"Other than giving Kurds a chance to leave so they don't get slaughtered, it doesn't sound like a change of any of the other dynamics I'm concerned about,\" Rubio told reporters.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former special presidential envoy on fighting the Islamic State group, was also less than enthused.\n\nThe United States \"just ratified Turkey's plan to effectively extend its border 30 kilometers (18 miles) into Syria with no ability to meaningfully influence facts on the ground,\" said McGurk, who quit in December, the first time Trump raised the prospect of pulling US troops out of Syria.\n\nDemocratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, issued a scathing statement saying Erdogan had \"given up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything.\"\n\n\"The president's decision to reverse sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America's foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike that our word cannot be trusted,\" they said.\n\nNicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, took issue with Trump's characterization that it was a great day for the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\n\"The United States just agreed to try to force the SDF to surrender its homeland along the Syrian-Turkish border to Turkey,\" Heras said.\n\n\"This deal was made between President Trump and Erdogan, and for all intents and purposes, it cut the SDF out of the discussion.\"\n\n\"The terms of the deal are exactly what Turkey most desired, which is the forced expulsion of the SDF from its border,\" Heras added. \"Erdogan could not have asked for more from Trump in this situation.\"\n\nHe expressed incredulity at Pence's assertion that the SDF could still be expected to wage operations against the Islamic State group, calling it \"surreal.\"\n\n\"The Americans are putting their head in the sand if they expect the SDF to willingly abide by these terms,\" he said.", "description": "Turkey's agreement to suspend military operations against the Syrian Kurds may give President Donald Trump a reprieve from accusations he abandoned the US allies but it is also being seen as a capitulation to the Turks, analysts said.
