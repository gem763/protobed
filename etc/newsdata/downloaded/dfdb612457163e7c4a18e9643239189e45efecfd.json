The Communist party of China (CPC) has understood the power of history ever since it seized the reins in 1949: in its earliest days, it encouraged citizens to \u201crecall past bitterness\u201d, to make the New China all the sweeter. Xi Jinping understands history\u2019s importance better than any leader since Mao Zedong. Not long after taking power, he warned his colleagues that \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d was an existential threat to the party\u2019s rule on a par with western democracy.\n\nThe tanks, planes, troops and missiles tell a story: in 1949, the republic\u2019s 17 aircraft were ordered to fly over twice, to make the display look more impressive. This time the west will watch closely as the People\u2019s Liberation Army unveils new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. The PRC has outlived its big brother, the Soviet Union, and outgrown western economies. Yet it now faces new challenges.\n\nMany in China are grateful for the party\u2019s rule. It enjoys a level of support that many democratically elected governments would envy, and not only because of its mammoth propaganda and censorship apparatus. The last 70 years have seen extraordinary progress in lifespan, literacy and incomes: hundreds of millions are no longer living in poverty. Yet people were not lifted out of poverty; they worked their way out. The party banned the family tyranny of forced marriages, but brought the official tyranny of the one-child policy, and even now polices the womb. The advances came at a terrible and wholly unnecessary cost. The famine sparked by Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward took tens of millions of lives. Tens of millions more people were hounded in the Cultural Revolution.\n\nEven some of those worst affected see cause to celebrate today. Yet many in China are angry, cynical or despairing. The party-state\u2019s cruelties are both vast and petty. In Xinjiang, perhaps 1.5 million Muslims are locked up in camps which the party euphemistically calls vocational training centres. Meanwhile a six-year-old boy is forced out of school because his father has sought to use China\u2019s own law to uphold basic rights.\n\nThe party-state\u2019s embrace of pomp and majesty itself has a remarkably brittle quality. The military parade is by invitation only; nearby residents are under order to keep their curtains closed. Elderly \u201cTiananmen mothers\u201d who lost their children in the brutal crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in 1989 have police guarding their homes today.\n\nSince the massacre, the CPC has doubled down on \u201cnational education\u201d, and the construction of a history in which its central role is not class struggle but putting an end to \u201cnational humiliation\u201d. This narrative grows all the more important as the costs of spectacular economic growth \u2013 fractured families, grotesque corruption, inequality and environmental devastation \u2013 are succeeded by its slowing, and as conflict with the US looms large.\n\nMeanwhile in Hong Kong, a huge swathe of the population has shown that not everyone is grateful for the party-state\u2019s rule. The 17-week-long protest movement, and the reaction to it, has in turn has boosted support for Taiwan\u2019s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, in the upcoming elections \u2013 undermining Beijing\u2019s hopes.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the party is promoting its historical message more assiduously than ever, at a time which, though very different from the past, bears distinct echoes of it. The \u201cpeople\u2019s leader\u201d has overseen growing repression, a resurgence of ideology, and is increasingly invoking the idea of struggle. China is seeking to reshape the international order once more. Xi is already looking ahead to the republic\u2019s centenary, 30 years hence. Might another story be told by then?", "description": "Editorial: Seven decades of Communist rule have seen notable advances but at horrific cost", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1452ac1bfa6c3f7746341599f588649ef209f31a/278_275_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a657845cfe66ff6a1d1e91d1a8b44861", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
