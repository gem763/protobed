Bowden interviewed some of the highest-ranking military officers who served under Trump, as well as present and former Pentagon officials, to complete an alarming picture of how the current commander in chief prefers to operate.\n\nRead Bowden\u2019s full story here.\n\n\u2014Christian Paz\n\n*\n\nEditor\u2019s note: In The Atlantic\u2019s October print issue, McKay Coppins reported on Ivanka and Don Jr.\u2019s fight to succeed their father and rule the MAGA empire.
