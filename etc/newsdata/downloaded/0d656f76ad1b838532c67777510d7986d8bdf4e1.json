They brought order to TV setups everywhere by communicating with your cable box, game consoles, streaming devices, and everything else, and more recent Harmony remotes could control smart home devices as well.\n\nBut as the world moves to streaming services, the number of TV devices you need to control is shrinking. Everything might already be built into your smart TV already, or you might just have one streaming box. Voice commands make getting to your favorite Netflix or Prime Video show much faster as Alexa and Google Assistant get better at controlling TVs. In fact, Logitech\u2019s most recent Harmony remote actually has Amazon Alexa built right in, which is as direct an acknowledgment of the shifting landscape as you\u2019re going to get.\n\n\u201cOver time, you\u2019ll have fewer and fewer people who feel like they really need that universal remote.\u201d\n\nAnd that means the Harmony remote line might not have a particularly rich future. During an interview on The Vergecast, Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell discussed Harmony\u2019s shrinking relevance at the company. \u201cIt\u2019s a small business,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s a stat that really puts it in perspective: according to Darrell, the remote business is \u201cabout\u201d 6 percent the size of Logitech\u2019s keyboard business.\n\n\u201cIf you want to really simplify a complex living room stack of stuff and get it down to a single remote... [Harmony] does that better than, I think, anything else,\u201d Darrell said. But he also suggested that smart TVs and voice assistants have changed where Harmony fits in.\n\n\u201cI think over time, you\u2019ll have fewer and fewer people who feel like they really need that universal remote,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you have a different problem: you have 10 different streaming services, and I want to watch Friends. Where do I watch it? So it\u2019s less about different devices and more about different streaming services. How do I get to the one that\u2019s either the cheapest or the fastest or the one that I like the most or whatever it is?\u201d Helping you pick what service to use on a streaming box isn\u2019t something Harmony will push into, according to Darrell, who said, \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the domain of other people.\u201d\n\nLogitech has also occasionally riled some of its loyal Harmony customers over the last couple of years as features have come and gone, which is a lot of drama for a small business line in the ever-growing Logitech portfolio. So you can see why Darrell is eager to move on from the days when a Harmony remote was the central brain and conductor of a living room entertainment system. But other companies aren\u2019t leaving the market: Amazon\u2019s got a whole team of people working to improve the IR blaster in its Fire TV Cube and Alexa Voice Remote, and Caavo and Sevenhugs have both released innovative new riffs on the universal remote to solid reviews.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll always take care of them.\u201d\n\nThat said, Darrell promised that Logitech isn\u2019t going to leave Harmony customers behind or abandon support. \u201cThe cool thing about [Harmony], and the thing that we appreciate, is that the users of that business love it. I mean, really love it. And it\u2019s so rare to have users that love something as much as a lot of our Harmony users do. We\u2019ll always take care of them because we really believe that that\u2019s part of the responsibility of the brand. So we do love Harmony for that reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long it will be out there, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "description": "Logitech CEO and president Bracken Darrell says the smart home and streaming wars have made the company\u2019s Harmony universal remotes less necessary than they once were.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKSPeB7aELqp7npPLaAJZGcRPpQ=/0x21:2040x1089/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6940451/jbareham_160729_1150_0031.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
