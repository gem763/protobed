His White House is pissed.", "language": "en", "text": "For Trump\u2019s political and campaign team, efforts by congressional Democrats to drive the president from office are being treated internally with political euphoria. Within minutes of news that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would back impeachment proceedings, the Trump campaign was plumbing its base for money and Republican campaigns were tagging opponents who endorsed the effort as do-nothing radicals.\n\nInside the White House, an entirely different reality is now being confronted, one that involves actually dealing with the likelihood of a painful, cumbersome, intrusive battle that brings what remains of its legislative agenda to a standstill\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat are they gonna do?\u201d a senior Trump administration official mockingly told The Daily Beast late last week. \u201cEvery investigation, everything\u2014it\u2019s been a joke.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the same official took a far more dour tone, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s impeachment at the hands of the House Democratic majority was now far more likely and that this would be a colossal pain for the White House to deal with, in part because of how it will invariably affect the president\u2019s focus, actions, and mood.", "description": "", "authors": ["Suebsaeng"], "top_image": ""}
