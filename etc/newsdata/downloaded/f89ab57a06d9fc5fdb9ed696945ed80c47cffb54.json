Pictured is Chernobyl, a destination that also made the top 50 list\n\nA spokeswoman added: 'This study demonstrates how much Britons want to see, experience and soak up other cultures and sights.\n\n'Sometimes real life, and in particular a lack of money, can get in the way of making these holidays happen.\n\n'For some, having an exotic trip miles away can seem like a pipe-dream.'\n\nTo find out more about the Passport to Paradise prize draw visit www.lottoland.co.uk/passport", "description": "A 'travel dreams' poll also revealed Driving Route 66, walking along the Great Wall of China and paying respects at Auschwitz as top bucket list items.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20325392-0-image-a-16_1572353696929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
