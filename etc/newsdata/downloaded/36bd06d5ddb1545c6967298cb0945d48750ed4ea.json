But that\u2019s a skewed misconception of what social credit actually is. The social credit system, at its core, is perhaps better described as a data-sharing service; the more technical among you could reasonably think of it as a massive national API.\n\nChina\u2019s central government doesn\u2019t see its own role in the SCS as an assigner of scores, but rather as a record keeper, whose job is to consolidate government files into a central database of social credit records, and then through that database, provide state agencies, city governments, banks, industry associations, and the general public with data on individuals and companies so they can make their own evaluations.\n\nThe master database of social credit records has already been built: it\u2019s called the National Credit Information Sharing Platform (NCISP), and a significant amount of the data it contains is open for public sharing.\n\nThough the central government has yet to put out its own flagship social credit app, it has actively encouraged local governments and private developers to build mobile applications that incorporate NCISP data in innovative ways.\n\nEarly this year, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state body responsible for the implementation of China\u2019s social credit system, held a credit-app awards event designed to provide a platform where the public and private sectors could learn from each other\u2019s innovations. A similar event, the Xinhua Credit Cup, ran from September 24-25, recognizing outstanding achievements in urban credit development projects.\n\nWe took a look at several of the winning mobile platforms from both of these conferences, as well as some interesting platforms that didn\u2019t make the cut. Taken as a whole, these apps paint an interesting picture of the mobile ecosystem springing up around social credit.\n\nWho\u2019s been naughty? Behavioral apps\n\nChengxin Chunyun \u8bda\u4fe1\u6625\u8fd0\n\nGovernment agencies: NDRC, Ministry of Transport, Public Security Bureau, Civil Aviation Administration, China Railway Company, and others\n\nDevelopers: Tianxia Credit, Pengyuan Credit\n\nOnce every year, China is home to the world\u2019s largest annual human migration, chunyun, when hundreds of millions of Chinese return to their hometowns to celebrate the Spring Festival. The 2019 holiday season saw 3 billion passenger journeys within 40 days. National transport services become severely overloaded during this time, and with so many people packed together in such tight quarters, the public behavior of travelers becomes a yearly focus of discussion.\n\nThe social credit system has tied disruptive or illegal behavior on planes and trains to the personal credit records of transport passengers. Fighting, breaking equipment, smoking, boarding without a ticket, opening emergency exits, and other violations can result in being banned from future rides. These incidents are typically reported by aviation and rail staff, but Chengxin Chunyun, an app released in 2017 by a consortium of national state agencies and credit companies, allows users to upload reports of their own. A corresponding WeChat mini-program was launched in 2019.\n\nChengxin Chunyun: Choose report type to submit\n\nThe app accepts both positive and negative reports on transport service quality and passenger behavior. Users can upload photographic evidence, and once incidents have been investigated and verified, reports will be logged in the target\u2019s social credit file.\n\nChengxin Chunyun: Report submission screen\n\nThere are no statistics available on user numbers or how many reports were investigated and actually landed in social credit records, but the program has been employed for three consecutive years, pointing to some measure of perceived efficacy.\n\nLaolai Checker \u2013 \u8001\u8d56\u67e5\u8be2\n\nDeveloper: Xiamen Tuoke Network Company (\u53a6\u95e8\u62d3\u5ba2\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8)\n\nBlacklisting is one of the key elements of China\u2019s social credit system (read more about blacklisting here). The largest blacklist in China is the Defaulter Blacklist, managed by the Supreme People\u2019s Court, which keeps a record of laolai \u2013 individuals and companies who fail to fulfill court-ordered obligations.\n\nBlacklist data is a matter of public record, and there are at least a dozen apps that allow users to search the court\u2019s dataset. Laolai checker is one of these \u2013 a search app for debtors that have landed on the Defaulter Blacklist.\n\nLaolai checker: search results\n\nUsers can search by debtor name, view details of the legal case history, and see current fulfillment status.\n\nLaolai checker: case details screen\n\nPersonal credit apps: Checking citizen social credit data\n\nOne of the most pervasive myths about the social credit system is that China\u2019s central government is issuing social credit scores to every individual. The typical story goes something like this: every Chinese citizen will receive a social credit score from the central government based on their behavior. Those with low scores will be socially ostracized, and those with high scores will be the new upper class.\n\nThe problem with this story is that it\u2019s simply not true. As of September 2019, the central government has not issued a social credit score to any Chinese citizen.\n\nThat said, some citizens are receiving social credit scores. That\u2019s because city governments are being encouraged by the central government to use social credit data to develop their own scoring systems for local residents. Several cities in China have already rolled out such systems on a trial basis, and many more cities are gearing up to follow suit.\n\nThese city-based scoring systems give residents a (usually) numerical credit score based not only on financial factors, like their debt repayment history, but on social factors, like whether or not they\u2019ve received awards for good citizenship, whether or not they\u2019ve engaged in fraud or plagiarism, and whether or not they\u2019ve defaulted on child support payments, donated blood or volunteered for charity.\n\nBut before the \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d references start rolling, it bears pointing out that cities are developing these scoring systems independently. Though this may change, there\u2019s currently no nationally-mandated standard for individual social credit scoring, so every city scores its residents on a different scale. In Suzhou, social credit scores can range from 0-200. In Hangzhou, from 0-1000. And even in cities where the actual scoring ranges are the same, the algorithmic models used to determine those scores differ.\n\nIn many of the places that have launched scoring systems, developers have partnered with local governments to release a series of apps that allow citizens to check their city scores. Each city is taking a slightly different approach: some, like Fuzhou and Nanjing, are rolling social credit features into existing city services apps, while others are creating dedicated apps for social credit management. We\u2019ll take a look at one example of each.\n\nMy Nanjing \u6211\u7684\u5357\u4eac\n\nGovernment agency: Nanjing NDRC, Nanjing Information Office\n\nDeveloper: Nanjing Zijin Digital Cloud Information Technology Company (\u5357\u4eac\u7d2b\u91d1\u6570\u4e91\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8)\n\nOfficial site: mynj.cn\n\nIf you really want a look into the future of China\u2019s mobile government services space, look no farther than My Nanjing, an all-in-one city life management platform. This app is crazy ambitious, and despite the feature-stuffing, well-executed.\n\nIt ties together city transportation, environmental data, hospitals, utility providers, scenic spots, civil affairs bureaus, courts, schools, local financial institutions, and charitable organizations into a one-stop-shop for citizen services.\n\nMy Nanjing App: city services landing screen.\n\nThrough the app, residents can:\n\nCheck the status of their driving record and outstanding traffic violations\n\nView traffic alerts\n\nRent city shared bicycles\n\nPay parking bills\n\nCheck tax payments\n\nCheck their social security payments\n\nMake hospital appointments and pay medical bills\n\nSee how money is in their housing provident fund account\n\nCheck and pay utility bills (water, electric, phone and gas)\n\nMake investments and take out loans\n\nFind local volunteering opportunities\n\nFind local legal services\n\nSign up to donate blood\n\nRegister for social/medical insurance card\n\nRegister new births\n\nAnd a whole bunch of other stuff\n\nMy Nanjing App: Personal points management and city accounts screen.\n\nOnly a small part of the app is actually tied to social credit data, and Nanjing doesn\u2019t issue social credit scores (yet). Instead, once users log in, they\u2019re able to view certain aspects of their social credit files, including:\n\nRecords of any state-issued awards and honors\n\nRecords of unpaid bills\n\nRecords of traffic violations\n\nRecords of legal violations and administrative penalties received\n\nMy Nanjing app: social credit records view screen\n\nThat\u2019s not to say scoring doesn\u2019t play a role in the app: the My Nanjing app does include a point system which gamifies environmental protection. \u201cGreen points\u201d are assigned to users based on their public transportation choices, with points earned for walking, biking, taking the bus or riding the subway. Citizens can earn double points for not driving on heavily-polluted days.\n\nMy Nanjing App: Environmental credit points\n\nXiamen Egret Points App \u53a6\u95e8\u767d\u9e6d\u5206\n\nGovernment agency: Xiamen City Credit Office\n\nDeveloper: Xiamen Information Group Big Data Operation Company (\u53a6\u95e8\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u56e2\u5927\u6570\u636e\u8fd0\u8425\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8)\n\nIn contrast, the Xiamen Egret Points app centers entirely around citizen social credit. Xiamen is among several key SCS demonstration cities and has already launched a city-wide scoring system based on NCISP data, which issues numerical scores on a 0-1000 scale. As of mid-2018, Xiamen pegged Egret Points enrollment numbers at 2.25 million \u2013 about half the city\u2019s population.\n\nRegistered user numbers on the app, however, are significantly smaller, with a reported 173,000 in August 2018, jumping to 210,059 the following year \u2013 not a major increase in a 12-month period.\n\nEgret Points App: city social credit point checker and rewards program\n\nThe low app adoption rates may have something to do with the fact that the app is functionally just a loyalty rewards program, where users can view scores and discover perks for high credit. But as with Nanjing, the benefits of having a high Egret Points aren\u2019t particularly exciting. They include:\n\nFree borrowing of up to 40 library books\n\nDeposit-free city bike rental\n\nDiscounts on parking\n\nThat said, about half of the registered users are taking advantage of the perks. Dev Lewis of Harvard\u2019s Berkman-Klein Center finds that:\n\nIn Fuzhou, more than 64% of registered users have used their score at least once to avail themselves of a benefit. In Xiamen the number is slightly lower at 53% \u2014 which includes 55,562 people that have borrowed books from the public library deposit free. Borrowing books at the public library is popular in Xiamen and according to data from Jiming library, the number of readers who borrow books has grown by 370% since the introduction of the score.\n\nThe point algorithms are actually inspired by western financial credit rating mechanisms. Dev Lewis again:\n\nXiamen uses the FICO score model \u2014 used in the United States by mainstream credit rating agencies to assess financial credit worthiness, but remixed with a different set of variables.\n\nCorporate social credit: apps for market regulation\n\nAs we\u2019ve harped on elsewhere, although western commenters are mostly focused on social credit as it relates to citizens, the primary purpose of SCS data collection is to regulate the behavior of businesses in the market, and force corporations to comply with existing operational rules.\n\nAs far as Chinese lawmakers are concerned, a big part of enforcing compliance is giving the public access to data about the credit history of enterprises and service professionals, so the market can do the work of weeding out bad actors. Some of these apps are industry-specific, while some focus on all enterprises within a certain city.\n\nYiwu Market Credit \u4e49\u4e4c\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u7528\n\nGovernment agency: Yiwu Municipal Market Supervision Administration\n\nYiwu has been a major focal point for the development of corporate social credit, and no wonder: the city is home to the world\u2019s largest small commodities wholesale market. Covering a floor area of 5.5 million square meters and housing 75,000 vendors, Yiwu International Trade City is a central hub for many a global supply chain.\n\nIn a move designed to help buyers assess the legitimacy, operational soundness and product quality of Trade City suppliers, market supervision authorities have launched a credit search portal profiling vendors based on NCISP data, including:\n\nCompany registration data\n\nRegistered legal representative\n\nShareholders\n\nCivil and criminal case history\n\nAdministrative or operational penalty history\n\nOperational irregularities\n\nAnnual report\n\nTrademark licensing\n\nThe app includes features that allow users to search by business owner, company credit rating or the store\u2019s brick-and-mortar stall number.\n\nYiwu Market Credit: search landing screen.\n\nThe platform goes overboard on rating systems, issuing corporate credit grades from AAA-D, as well as star-ratings and point-based ratings. Since the whole idea behind issuing credit grades is to make it easy to predict how much risk is involved in doing business with a particular supplier, the profusion of point systems strips the grades of any real meaning.\n\nYiwu Market Credit: Business listings/data page.\n\nThe app is also uniquely patriotic, with a major set of features focused on pushing forward Communist Party-building initiatives within the Yiwu business environment. Companies with ties to Communist Party members are tagged with special icons in the search results screen, and a major segment of the app is dedicated to displaying statistics on how many CCP branches and members are active locally. Slogans abound.\n\nYiwu Market Credit: Communist Party affiliation indicators on business search results screen\n\nYiwu Market Credit: Party-building slogans\n\nParty-building within the market is one of President Xi Jinping\u2019s pet causes, and from where we sit, the inclusion of this feature set comes across as a local bid to curry favor with national higher-ups. It seems to be working: the app has received several national accolades.\n\nYunmanman \u4e91\u6ee1\u6ee1\n\nDeveloper: Jiangsu Manyun Software Technology Company (\u6c5f\u82cf\u6ee1\u8fd0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8)\n\nOfficial site: ymm56.com\n\nOver the last several decades, China\u2019s road logistics industry has been plagued with problems from overloaded vehicles to late or abandoned deliveries, from damaged cargo to breaches of contract and fraudulent shipments.\n\nEnter Yunmanman, a trucking logistics platform that is part matchmaker and part escrow service. Two separate apps \u2013 a driver-facing app and a shipper-facing app \u2013 pair a user base of 1.6 million shippers with 6.5 million registered freight drivers. Shippers pre-pay transport costs and the platform releases funds to drivers once shipments are complete.\n\nYunmanman App\n\nYunmanman has also sunk significant development time into the creation of an on-board credit system for both drivers and shippers. Like the national social credit system, Yunmanman\u2019s system addresses \u201ccredit\u201d from both the financial and ethical perspectives. Both angles make for interesting case studies.\n\nIn a 2017 talk, CEO Zhang Hui outlined the difficulties long-distance truck drivers face in obtaining loans and building personal credit histories:\n\nTruck drivers are a special demographic: many have not attended high school and they work in a high-risk occupation. \u2026 They spend most of their time on the highway and in service stations, so their consumption patterns are difficult to track \u2026 so it\u2019s difficult for [financial] institutions to make evaluations based on traditional credit models. But they actually make decent salaries and have stable spending power.\n\nYunmanman tackles this by serving driver data to partnered lenders, allowing drivers to apply for loans while on the road, and receive immediate access to funds via the app.\n\nIn terms of the behavioral aspects of credit, Yunmanman maintains a blacklist of drivers and shippers by tracking incidents of cargo damage, payment defaults, vehicle overloading, delivery times, and other issues.\n\nIt is understood that the current blacklist of drivers on the platform accounted for 0.31% [of users], while the blacklist of shippers accounted for 0.16%.\n\nYunmanman\u2019s approach to credit has received significant praise and support from the NDRC, and there\u2019s a strong possibility that app data may be fed into government platforms in the future, and / or pull data from the NCISP. In June 2017, Shen Jianrong, director of the Nanjing Development and Reform Commission, made a visit to the Yunmanman offices, and expressed hopes:\n\n\u201c\u2026 that [Yunmanman\u2019s] fully operational credit system will be paired and shared with government data\u201d.\n\nJiafu E \u5bb6\u670dE\n\nDeveloper: Zebra Software Technology Company (\u6591\u9a6c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8)\n\nDomestic services is another industry getting a mobile credit-based makeover. The Jiafu E app consolidates NCISP data, employer reviews, and other metrics into a rating and booking platform for nannies, home cooks, exterminators, repairmen, locksmiths, private nurses, and cleaning service providers.\n\nJiafu E: Landing screen \u2013 domestic service booking portal\n\nJiafu E, first launched in March 2019, predominantly operates in southern cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing, and Shanghai, but has immediate plans for expansion across 60 cities, and eventual national coverage. The app has enjoyed backing from the NDRC, and in certain areas, like Nanjing, the app integrates with local government credit platforms (My Nanjing and the Women\u2019s Federation credit system).\n\nThe platform enables potential employers to access the social credit records of domestic service companies, displaying the usual corporate SCS data sets:\n\nCompany registration data\n\nRegistered legal representative\n\nShareholders\n\nCivil and criminal case history\n\nAdministrative or operational penalty history\n\nOperational irregularities\n\nAnnual report\n\nTrademark licensing\n\nJiafu E corporate social credit records view screen\n\nFor freelance service providers, like nannies and nurses, users can view:\n\nName\n\nAge, height, weight, and zodiac sign\n\nEducation\n\nWork history\n\nRegistered professional qualifications\n\nHometown\n\nDriver\u2019s license status\n\nLanguages and dialects spoken\n\nEducation\n\nJiafu E rolls all of this data into its own credit scoring system, assigning points to service companies and freelance service providers.\n\nJiafu E: In-app credit scores\n\nThis score shouldn\u2019t be confused with a national social credit score; it isn\u2019t issued by the government, but rather by the app\u2019s algorithm. Still, the support for the development of apps like these comes straight from national policies that encourage tighter industry supervision.\n\nWhile domestic services might seem, at first glance, like a trivial place to focus resources, the whole thing makes more sense in the context of China\u2019s rapidly aging population, which is likely to increase demand for services like private nursing and hire-in home cooks.\n\nJust the beginning\n\nThis is by no means a complete list of apps that draw on NCISP data: there are at least a couple hundred out there. Seventy-seven total apps were submitted to the NDRC\u2019s app awards event in April, over 300 platforms and projects to the Xinhua Credit cup, and considering the central government\u2019s continuing push to create a digitized credit-based market, we expect to see the data applied in an increasing range of applications.\n\nGoing forward, what will perhaps be most interesting to watch is not necessarily how many apps use the central government\u2019s database, but whether or not these apps end up feeding data to government bodies in the future, and if so, how that data is incorporated into social credit\u2019s data ecosystem.", "description": "", "authors": ["Trivium Ub"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fsynd12.jpg&signature=027910cdbb95bc5e0c53541190fb0f82", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
