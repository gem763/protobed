A former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member, he has starred in more than 35 films. He hosts Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cLights Out With David Spade.\u201d He spoke to Marc Myers.\n\nI was a bit of a pipsqueak until high school, when I grew enough to be considered normally tiny. Back then, I had no way to get attention. I wasn\u2019t even a class clown with the confidence to yell out crummy jokes.\n\nInstead, I\u2019d make remarks under my breath. It was safe, low-talking sarcasm. In a jam, I could always deny saying something. I kept that going into adulthood, when it became my comedic style.\n\nBefore high school, I was a supernerd. I was in the chess club, spelling-bee tournaments and the math club, and I read the most books in fifth grade. In high school, it all went away somehow.\n\nI was born in Birmingham, Mich. We moved to Scottsdale, Ariz., when I was 4. I remember grabbing rattle snakes, tarantulas and scorpions with my brothers and putting them in cages in the house. All stuff my mom, Judith, hated but let us do. My parents had divorced when I was 4, so she let us be boys. We didn\u2019t have much money, but didn\u2019t know it. Everyone in our neighborhood was the same.\n\nDavid Spade, in back, with his brothers, Bryan, left, and Andy, right; his mother, Judith; and their dog, Princess, in Scottsdale, Ariz., around 1970. Photo: David Spade\n\nMy older brother, Andy, and I spent a lot of our free time skateboarding. My oldest brother, Bryan, wasn\u2019t a skateboarder. He was four years older than me and had to be the man of the house at 10.\n\nWhen I was 8, my mom remarried, and we moved to Casa Grande, a small mining town about an hour south. My stepfather was a doctor and made $36,000 a year. Everyone else\u2019s dad made $10,000 a year at the local copper mine. We were the fancy ones. It made us hated.\n\nAndy, Bryan and I were pushed around a lot. It was four scary years. Then we moved back to Scottsdale. When I was 15, my stepdad killed himself. He had been a medic in Vietnam, and his depression never went away.\n\nMy mom had trained to be a magazine writer but was able to write only in her spare time. To put food on the table, she had to work two jobs\u2014at a clothing store and at a temp agency. I spent a lot of time with neighbors when she wasn\u2019t home. The experience made me independent. Despite the struggles, she\u2019s still the greatest mom and was always there for us.\n\nFortunately for me, both of my brothers were cool. When I got to high school, I was cool by association. I had long blond hair, I was a skateboarder and I wore OP shorts.\n\nMy longtime classmates weren\u2019t buying it. They told kids from other schools, \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. He\u2019s a geek, he\u2019s a nerd.\u201d But coolness was like wildfire. It spread and was unstoppable.\n\nI embraced my new life and reputation, eased up on studying all the time and enjoyed having lots of friends. I liked gymnastics\u2014especially the parallel bars. I did it mostly to get in shape. I also was in school talent shows.\n\nIn my junior year, I told my counselor I wanted to go to Princeton or maybe UC Santa Barbara. She goes, \u201cIf I pull all my strings, I can get you into the community college across the street.\u201d\n\nI thought I was Stephen Hawking, that I could always turn on the smarts. But I didn\u2019t have the grades. I was devastated. After a year, I got into Arizona State University. The rumor is I majored in business, but I actually dropped out in 1985. I was doing stand-up then and earning a decent living.\n\nMy first stand-up experience was at Chuckles in Phoenix. It didn\u2019t go well. The manager said, \u201cI didn\u2019t really like your material but you can come back. What you were saying in between was funnier than your act.\u201d\n\nChris Farley, left, and David Spade in the film \u2018Tommy Boy\u2019 (1995).

When I was 20, I looked 15. It set me apart.\n\nToday, I live in the Truesdale section of Beverly Hills. I moved in 15 years ago and renovated so it\u2019s now entirely modern and very homey. I can see Century City, but I probably should say someplace cooler. I also can see the Pacific. I\u2019ve never had views like this.\n\nAs a kid, I was a busboy and valet parker, worked all the jobs teens hate. Now when I work on a TV show or movie, I\u2019m amazed.\n\nMy mother says, \u201cI love that you can do a 16-hour day now and not complain.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to love my job. I\u2019m getting paid to say stuff under my breath.\n\nSpade\u2019s Upgrades\n\nSteve Martin in the film \u2018Parenthood\u2019 (1989).
