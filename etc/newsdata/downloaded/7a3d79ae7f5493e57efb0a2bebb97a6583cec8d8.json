Do I want to look artsy and minimal? Do I want to look like Edna Mode? The opportunities are endless. But if you truly can\u2019t decide, Warby Parker has a new hybrid answer for you. The glasses brand, a favorite among anyone that wants trendy frames, just released the new Super Concentric collection. It uses three different acetate colors layered on top of each other for an artsy look.\n\nThe Super Concentric comes in three slightly different variations: The more square Francis shape, the more angular Darrow shape, and the rounder Percey shape. Yes, that\u2019s three options to choose from, but you can\u2019t go wrong with any of them, really.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Warby Parker just released the new Super Concentric color.
