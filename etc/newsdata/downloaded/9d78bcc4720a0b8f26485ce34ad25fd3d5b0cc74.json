Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson also sees the tariffs having an impact on the U.S. economy as businesses are forced to pass the higher costs on to consumers.\n\n\u201cWe think the latest increase in tariffs on the remaining $300B of Chinese imports will end up hitting consumer goods directly, which could lead to some demand destruction, particularly for low end shoppers who are more price sensitive,\u201d Wilson wrote.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that last year\u2019s first round of tariffs happened when companies were still enjoying a massive profits/margins windfall from the tax cuts. With that windfall now gone, the ability to eat the tariffs is much lower today.\u201d\n\nDemand destruction wouldn\u2019t be the first sign of a slowing U.S. economy. On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management said the U.S. manufacturing sector in August contracted for the first time in three years.\n\nThe report came just days after the second estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product was 2 percent, down from the first quarter\u2019s 3.1 percent print.\n\nThe weaker data comes a few weeks after the spread between the U.S. two-year and 10-year yields turned negative for the first time in over a decade, sparking concerns that a recession was on the horizon. An inverted yield curve has occurred ahead of the last seven U.S. recessions, sometimes leading by as much as 24 months.\n\nStill, the Trump administration remains confident that the U.S. economy is strong, and that recession fears are overblown.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the yield curve reflects a recession,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI think the yield curve reflects the fact that it anticipates the Fed is going to lower short-term rates.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nHe added that a number of trade deals are still in the works and that they'll \u201cadd significantly to growth.\u201d", "description": "UBS says the new tariffs will cause U.S. GDP to fall to 0.3 percent by the second quarter of 2020.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trumo-Xi-JinPing-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
