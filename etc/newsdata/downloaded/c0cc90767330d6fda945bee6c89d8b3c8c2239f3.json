It has a culture crisis.", "language": "en", "text": "America does not just have a gun crisis; it has a cultural crisis. America will not stop experiencing the effects of gun violence until we\u2019re ready to face the many ways that our culture is riddled with violence.\n\nOur environmental policies are violent toward the Earth. Our criminal justice system is violent toward people of color. Our economic system is violent toward the poor. Our entertainment media is violent toward women. Our video games are violent in their effect on the minds of children. Our military is violent in ways and places where it doesn\u2019t have to be. Our media is violent in its knee-jerk shaming and blaming for the sake of a better click rate. Our hearts are violent as we abandon each other constantly, breeding desperation and insanity. And our government is indirectly and directly violent in the countless ways it uses its power to help those who do not need help and to withhold support from those who do.\n\nThe darker truth that Americans must face now is this: Our society is not just steeped in violence; we are hooked on violence. And in area after area, there are those who make billions of dollars on deepening the hook. Until we see that, we will just have more violence. Our minds must awaken so we can see all this. Our hearts must awaken so we can change all this. And our politics must change so we can discuss all this.", "description": "", "authors": ["Marianne Williamson", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Marianne-Williamson-Us-Needs-Department-Peace"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
