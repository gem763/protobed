People are hungry. Neuquen is the richest province in the country, and yet we\u2019re living like this? It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nMr Macri started well - attempting to peel back 20 years of Peronist economic illusion by resuming the publication of financial data, stripping away subsidies, and resolving long-standing feuds with international financial organisations.\n\nBut that soon stalled, due to both bad luck \u2013 the worst drought in 40 years, the US raising interest rates \u2013 and arrogance. Mr Macri seemed to believe his pro-business rhetoric was enough.\n\nBy 2018 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved the largest bailout package in its 73-year history \u2013 a $57 billion loan designed to shore up the country\u2019s faltering economy and end its pattern of cyclical crises. The cash injection has not worked and Argentina\u2019s annual inflation rate is the highest in the region at 54 per cent.\n\nThe Peronists have a new face in Alberto Fernandez, a 60-year-old former Cabinet secretary, but Mrs Kirchner still looms large as his running mate.", "description": "When Andrea Espinosa began offering food from her home in the Argentinian district of Neuquen eight years ago, it was just to hungry school kids.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Simon Heffer", "Daniel Hannan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/09/02/TELEMMGLPICT000207877021-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
