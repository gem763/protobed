We create opportunities through our defence to attack,\" said England coach Eddie Jones, who has masterminded the turnaround.\n\n\"I'd like to pay the greatest compliment to New Zealand. They've won two World Cups in a row. They've been a really great team and we had to dig really deep to beat them.\"\n\nEngland, world champions in 2003 when they beat an Australia side coached by Jones in the final, will now face the winners of Sunday's match between South Africa and Wales in next week's showpiece clash.\n\nTheir victory ended the tenure of All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, who is stepping down after overseeing a sensational run when they lost only 10 of 106 Tests.\n\n\"I'm really proud of our team. They've done a tremendous job for their country and tonight we just weren't good enough,\" said Hansen.\n\n\"So we have to take that on the chin and so does everybody back home and our fans.\"\n\nEngland led 10-0 at the break thanks to Tuilagi's converted try and the first of Ford's penalties after a superb forward effort led by locks Courtney Lawes and Maro Itoje saw them dominate territory and possession.\n\nAnother Ford penalty early in the second half made it 13-0 but the All Blacks eventually broke a defence coached by former New Zealand boss John Mitchell in the 57th minute, when Ardie Savea crashed over for a converted try.\n\nBut Sam Underhill's tackle on the recalled Scott Barrett led to a simple penalty in front of the posts that Ford duly kicked.\n\nJones had recalled Ford at flyhalf following the 40-16 quarter-final win over Australia, moving Farrell to inside centre.\n\nBefore kick-off England, unusually, lined up in an inverted 'V' formation, crossing the halfway line as the All Blacks performed their traditional pre-match haka.\n\nAnd there were fewer than two minutes on the clock when England scored a brilliant team try.\n\nFullback Elliot Daly made a fine break down the right that was carried on by wing Anthony Watson before the ball was worked across field, with hooker Jamie George charging forward.\n\nFord then found prop Kyle Sinckler and he in turn released Lawes, who took the ball to the All Blacks' line.\n\nFrom the ensuing ruck, powerhouse centre Tuilagi - one of England's try-scorers when they last beat the All Blacks seven years ago - forced his way between guard props Joe Moody and Nepo Laulala for a fine try.\n\nFarrell converted and England led 7-0.\n\nThey almost had a second try minutes later when Tuilagi intercepted and found Farrell who passed to Jonny May.\n\nBut great corner-flagging by recalled flank Scott Barrett stopped the wing in his tracks.\n\nEngland made several more early visits to New Zealand's 22 only for their own errors to cost them the chance of further points.\n\nUnderhill, who had a try against New Zealand last year controversially disallowed, went over in the 25th minute but referee Nigel Owens correctly ruled out the score for crossing by fellow flank Tom Curry in the build-up.\n\nFord's drop goal attempt sailed well wide of the right post but he made no mistake with a 45-metre penalty after a limping Farrell was unable to take the shot.\n\nEngland thought they had their second try when, following a drive off an attacking lineout, scrumhalf Ben Youngs went over after selling centre Anton Lienert-Brown a dummy.\n\nBut Owens ruled it out for a knock-on in the maul.\n\nAnother Ford penalty extended the lead but George's overthrown lineout near England's line was collected by Savea, with flyhalf Richie Mo'unga converting.\n\nThat, however, was as close as New Zealand got as two more Ford penalties created an unbridgeable gap for the defending champions.\n\nEngland will face the winner of Sunday's second semi-final between Wales and the Springboks (11:00 SA time) in the final next Saturday in Yokohama.\n\nThe All Blacks will take on the loser of Sunday's clash in the playoff for third place in Tokyo next Friday.\n\nScorers:\n\nEngland\n\nTry: Manu Tuilagi\n\nPenalties: George Ford (4)\n\nConversion: Owen Farrell\n\nNew Zealand\n\nTry: Ardie Savea\n\nConversion: Richie Mo'unga\n\nTeams:\n\nEngland", "description": "England were well-deserved winners of their Rugby World Cup semi-final against defending champions New Zealand in Yokohama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7449/f4c46fbc4737425283429417fc273a61.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
