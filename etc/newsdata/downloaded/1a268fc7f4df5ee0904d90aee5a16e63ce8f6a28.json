And just at the right time.\"\n\nSeverino struck out nine over five scoreless innings for his first win this season, and the New York Yankees followed an emotional tribute to CC Sabathia by beating the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 on Sunday in their regular-season home finale.\n\nAfter watching Severino stretch his scoreless streak to nine innings over two games in his return from a lat injury that had sidelined the pitcher since spring training, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Severino (1-0) will be part of the AL East champions' post-season rotation, which also includes Masahiro Tanaka and James Paxton.\n\nAnd without a full workload of 30-plus starts, Severino may be stronger than usual.\n\n\"I feel fresh and I feel good to go,\" he said. \"The velocity is there.\"\n\nSabathia and J.A. Happ are being moved to the bullpen for the final week of the regular season, making it likely the Yankees will use a three-man rotation for much of October and combine relievers for some games.\n\nTanaka is being skipped for his Tuesday turn at Tampa Bay to give him extra rest but will start the regular season finale at Texas next weekend, lining him up for the Division Series opener on Oct. 4. Paxton will start Friday against the Rangers and Severino on Saturday.\n\nSeverino allowed three singles and hit a batter while walking none. He threw 54 of 80 pitches for strikes, including his first 11.\n\n\"I think he's going to play a huge role for us,\" Boone said. \"If we're going to get far in this thing, he's going to have to pitch well.\"\n\nWATCH | Yankees go yard in win over Blue Jays:\n\nNew York hits 3 home runs en route to a 8-3 victory over Toronto. 1:31\n\nSeverino induced 13 swings and misses, 11 on fastballs and two on sliders.\n\n\"He looked like his old self today,\" said Toronto's Billy McKinney, who homered twice off New York's bullpen.\n\nServerino threw 46 fastballs that averaged 96.5 mph and topped out at 98.7 mph. He mixed in 18 sliders and 16 changeups.\n\n\"I thought his fastball command was good \u2014 maybe had a little more life to it,\" Brett Gardner said. \"His slider seemed to really have an extra gear to it when he needed it, with two strikes especially.\"\n\nJudge, Gardner and DJ LeMahieu homered , giving the Yankees a big league record 298, one more than Minnesota.\n\nNew York (102-55) moved 47 games over .500 for the first time since its record-setting 114-victory season in 1998. The Yankees clinched home-field advantage in the AL Division Series starting Oct. 4 and are competing with Houston (102-54) for the top record in the AL.\n\nAfter losing their first three home series this season, the Yankees went 20-0-3 the rest of the way and finished with a 57-24 home record.\n\n\"We're set up in a lot of ways with our power for this ballpark,\" Boone said.\n\nJudge put the Yankees ahead two batters in with a 420-foot homer to left-centre that went off the end of his bat, and Gardner hit a three-run drive later in the inning off Wilmer Font (2-3). LeMahieu made it 6-0 with a two-run homer in the second against Trent Thornton. Giancarlo Stanton added a sacrifice fly in the fifth and is 4 for 10 with three RBIs since returning from a nearly three-month layoff caused by a knee injury.\n\nLeMahieu (26 homers, 99 RBIs) and Gardner (27, 72) have set career bests. Judge has hit 14 of his 26 homers in his last 29 games, sparking a competition with Gardner.\n\n\"Every time I seem to get a home run, he seems to answer right back,\" Judge said, \"and he gives me a little look in the dugout.\"", "description": "Luis Severino struck out nine over five scoreless innings for his first win of the season, and the New York Yankees hit three home runs as they beat visiting Toronto 8-3 on Sunday in their regular-season home finale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293353.1569185658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/judge-aaron-190922-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
