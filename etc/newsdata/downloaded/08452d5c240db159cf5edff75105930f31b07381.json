(The network has continuously denied this.) The investigative reporter claims he discovered secret nondisclosure agreements and settlements NBC made with Lauer accusers years before his 2017 firing. Farrow also alleged that the network quashed his story about Weinstein despite what he said was solid reporting.\n\nOn The View, Farrow and the co-hosts discussed the rape allegation against Lauer by NBC News producer Brooke Nevils. (Lauer denied the allegation in a statement last week, say it was \u201cconsensual.\u201d) Farrow also said Ann Curry \u2014 who publicly supported Nevils \u2014 detailed to him in the book how she reported Lauer to NBC brass for another allegation of workplace sexual misconduct involving a different colleague. (Curry was pushed out as Lauer\u2019s Today co-host in 2012.) Farrow also talked about the \u201cseven-figure settlement\u201d he said Nevils made with NBC earlier this year \u201cto ensure that she can never speak about NBC executives and what they did or didn\u2019t know about this.\u201d\n\n.@RonanFarrow discusses the allegations against former \u2018Today Show\u2019 host Matt Lauer he details in his new book #CatchAndKill: \"I will let the facts stand on their own.\" https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/Secd4Sm6lC \u2014 The View (@TheView) October 14, 2019\n\nHours earlier on CBS This Morning, Farrow said that while NBC execs deny any payouts to Lauer accusers prior to his firing in 2017, he uncovered what the company called \"enhanced severance,\u201d which he said were \u201carrangements to shut up women with allegations of misconduct within this company. And that's something we saw at CBS, [and] other media companies.\u201d\n\nHe said that many of the sources in the book are NBC journalists and that they are \u201canguished over what's happening right now and some of the lies that are being put out by their own corporate leadership,\u201d referring to Oppenheim and NBC News chairman Andy Lack. He insisted that his book is \u201cmeticulously fact-checked work,\u201d adding, \"we're very confident in it.\"\n\nA new statement from Lauer was read during the segment. Through his lawyer, Lauer said, \u201cRonan Farrow continues his attempt to monetize the #MeToo movement, using salacious allegations as promotional trinkets to sell his book. Matt never exposed himself to anyone. This ridiculous story has been shopped around for years. Many allegations that are being circulated were never raised during any fact-checking process. And despite repeated requests for an advance copy of this book, we have not been provided one, while many media outlets have. Matt will have more to say at an appropriate time, but he will not take part in the marketing circus for this book.\u201d\n\nView photos Matt Lauer has released a new statement about Ronan Farrow's book Catch and Kill, which comes out Oct. 15. (Screenshot: CBS This Morning) More\n\nAlso read on CBS This Morning was part of a new rebuttal from Oppenheim. Yahoo Entertainment has since obtained the entire memo that Oppenheim sent to the NBC News organization this morning.\n\nIt started with, \u201cDear Colleagues: Matt Lauer's actions were abhorrent, and the anger and sadness he caused continue to this day. As we've said since the moment he was fired, his abuses should never have happened.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say, \u201cRonan Farrow's book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie \u2014 alleging we were a \u2018company with a lot of secrets,\u2019\u201d he wrote before adding, \u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nIt continued, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve read Farrow\u2019s book, it\u2019s clear \u2014 his smear rests on the allegation that NBC\u2019s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory \u2014 that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer.", "description": "Lauer says Farrow is \"using salacious allegations as promotional trinkets to sell his book\" while NBC News's president says it has \"nothing to hide.\"", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GQo2QkStgPuj9KPLWyEL2w--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/77d9fba0-eeb0-11e9-81f6-fbfc298be959", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
