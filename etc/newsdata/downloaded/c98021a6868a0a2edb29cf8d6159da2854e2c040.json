Mr Trump\u2019s suspicious view of Ukraine set the stage for events that led to the impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nThe visit by Mr Orban, who is seen as an autocrat who has rolled back democracy, provoked a sharp dispute within the White House. John Bolton, then the president\u2019s national security adviser, and Fiona Hill, then the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Eurasian and Russian affairs, opposed a White House invitation for the Hungarian leader, according to the people briefed on the matter. But they were outmanoeuvred by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who supported such a meeting.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

His government has accused Ukraine of being \u201csemi-fascist\u201d and sought to block important meetings for Ukraine with the European Union and NATO.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.

Getty\n\nTen days after his meeting with Mr Orban, Mr Trump met on 23 May with several of his top advisers returning from the inauguration of Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The advisers, including Rick Perry, the energy secretary; Kurt D Volker, then the special envoy for Ukraine; and Gordon D Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, reassured Mr Trump that Mr Zelensky was a reformer who deserved US support. But Mr Trump expressed deep doubt, saying that Ukrainians were \u201cterrible people\u201d who \u201ctried to take me down\u201d during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr Orban\u2019s visit came up during testimony to House investigators last week by George P Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine policy. The meeting with Mr Orban and a separate 3 May phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Putin are of intense interest to House investigators seeking to piece together the back story that led to the president\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nMr Kent testified behind closed doors that another government official had held the two episodes up to him as part of an explanation for Mr Trump\u2019s darkening views of Mr Zelensky last spring, according to a person familiar with his testimony. A third factor cited to him was Mr Giuliani\u2019s influence.\n\nMr Kent did not have first-hand knowledge of either discussion, and it was not clear if the person who cited them did either. But two other people briefed on the matter said in interviews that Mr Orban used the opportunity to disparage Ukraine with the president. The Washington Post first reported on the meeting with Mr Orban and the call with Mr Putin.\n\nIt would not be surprising that Mr Putin would fill Mr Trump\u2019s ear with negative impressions of Ukraine or Zelensky. Mr Putin has long denied that Ukraine even deserved to be a separate nation, and he sent undercover forces into Crimea in 2014 to set the stage to annex the Ukrainian territory. Mr Putin\u2019s government has also armed Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, fomenting a civil war that has dragged on for five years.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Bolton and Ms Hill believed that Mr Orban did not deserve the honour of an Oval Office visit, which would be seen as a huge political coup for an autocratic leader ostracised by many of his peers in Europe.\n\nMr Mulvaney, however, had come to respect Mr Orban from his time as a member of Congress and his involvement with the International Catholic Legislators Network, according to an administration official close to the acting chief of staff. Mr Orban has positioned himself as a champion of Christians in the Middle East, a position that earned him Mr Mulvaney\u2019s admiration, the official said.\n\nAnother official pushing for the Mr Orban visit was David B Cornstein, the United States ambassador to Hungary, who sidestepped the State Department to help set up a White House meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter. An 81-year-old jewellery magnate and longtime friend of Mr Trump\u2019s, Mr Cornstein told The Atlantic this year that the president envied Mr Orban. \u201cI can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr Cornstein said.\n\nThe Oval Office meeting with Mr Trump took place just four days after Mr Giuliani told The New York Times that he would travel to Ukraine to seek information that would be \u201cvery, very helpful to my client\u201d and three days after Mr Giuliani cancelled the trip in response to the resulting criticism.\n\nIn moves that have disturbed democracy advocates and many US and European officials, Mr Orban\u2019s government has targeted non-governmental organisations, brought most of the news media under control of his allies, undermined the independent judiciary, altered the electoral process to favour his party and sought to drive out of the country an American-chartered university founded by billionaire George Soros.\n\nMr Orban\u2019s government has pressured Ukraine over what it says is discrimination and violence against ethnic Hungarians living in the western part of the country.\n\nMr Orban\u2019s efforts to undermine Ukraine in Europe drew enough concern among US officials that Mr Volker, while the State Department special envoy, visited Budapest and other places to meet with Hungarian officials to encourage them to talk with their counterparts in Kiev to resolve their differences.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Just 10 days before a key meeting on Ukraine, President Donald Trump met, over the objections of his national security adviser, with one of the former Soviet republic\u2019s most virulent critics, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and heard a sharp assessment that bolstered his hostility towards the country, according to several people informed about the situation.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/09/trump-orban.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
