I usually do this when the freezer is full,' she wrote in a Mum's Who Facebook group.\n\nA mother-of-two has incorporated 'no spend' weeks into her family's life to save hundreds of dollars a year - and she's still able to prepare three meals a day\n\nOften she can see more than 20 meals worth of meat ready and waiting in the freezer.\n\nThey are purchased when there are 'good deals' - which for meat is at 9.45am - and she's doing her regular weekly shop.\n\n'I don't actually track my spend as I just spend from grocery account so there's no real need to do more than check my account balance before I shop,' she said.\n\n'I spent $220 last week but that doesn't really bother me as I know I won't do that every week.'\n\nThey are purchased when there are 'good deals' - which for meat is at 9.45am - and she's doing her regular weekly shop\n\n'We had quite a bit of random stuff so I had a loose mental meal plan,' she said\n\nAfter a 'big weekend' and a general lack of motivation to shop, the Melbourne mum decided to look in the fridge to sort through any leftovers.\n\n'We had quite a bit of random stuff so I had a loose mental meal plan,' she said.\n\nDishes included meat and vegetables, a slow cooked chicken meal, steak and vegetables and a roast lamb.\n\n'Another important aspect to consider is having staples,' she said.\n\n'I keep my staples up to date even if I don't think I'll need flour one week. If it's empty or close to, I buy it.

If we do spend it's small and usually just stocking up on what we ran out of or school snacks, maybe $50-$80 a week,' one woman said.\n\n'Love it.
