The world's largest crude oil processing facility and the heartbeat of Saudi Arabia's energy industry was targeted in drone and missile attacks early Saturday morning that knocked out more than half of the OPEC kingpin's global daily exports. Fifty percent of the crude production cut from the attack has been restored in the past two days, bin Salman said, adding that production capacity would reach 11 million barrels of crude per day (bpd) by the end of September and 12 million bpd by the end of November.\n\nThe kingdom's crude exports won't decrease, the minister said \u2014 rather, inventory stocks will be drawn down in order to meet export commitments. \"We are in the process to bring back oil refining to full capacity,\" bin Salman said. \"The company will honor all of its commitments to its customers this month by drawing from its reserves of crude oil and further modified some of its oil until the production capacity of the country is up to 11 million barrels a day by the end of September and up to 12 million barrels in November.\" Preparations for Saudi state oil giant Aramco's highly anticipated initial public offering will also continue apace, Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan said, sitting beside the energy minister. \"The IPO is a commitment by the shareholder, the government of Saudi Arabia, and we think the IPO will continue as is, we are not going to stop anything,\" al-Rumayyan said. \"This would make us even be firm when it comes to taking the company public, so I think anytime in the coming 12 months we'll be ready as per the market opportunity.\" The kingdom reportedly plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020 as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company, which is the largest in the world.\n\nAttacks threaten global oil supply\n\nAbqaiq in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province and the nearby Khurais oil field, Saudi Arabia's second largest, suffered fire damage on Saturday that shut off 5.7 million barrels of daily crude production. That represents more than half of the kingdom's global daily exports and around 5% of the world's daily crude oil production. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, speaking at the news conference, emphasized that despite the oil attack being \"huge,\" the company was able to restore capacity. \"We have enough oil products to supply the local market,\" Nasser said, adding that Aramco would compensate local refineries with additional feed in the next few days. Abqaiq is the world's largest oil processing facility and crude oil stabilization plant with a processing capacity of more than 7 million bpd. Khurais has capacity to pump around 1.5 million bpd. Ten fires at the Abqaiq facility were put out in seven hours, Nasser said. \"Where would you find a company in the whole world that went through such a devastating attack and came out like a phoenix?\" bin Salman asked the audience. He was met with applause.", "description": "Half of Saudi Arabia's crude production cut during Saturday's attack has been restored in the past two days, the kingdom's energy minister said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104175170-GettyImages-626239388.jpg?v=1532563957", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
