REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nFacebook said it also had suspended three separate networks operated from Iran. The Russian network \u201cshowed some links\u201d to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency (IRA), Facebook said, an organization Washington has said was used by Moscow to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\u201cWe see this operation targeting largely U.S. public debate and engaging in the sort of political issues that are challenging and sometimes divisive in the U.S. right now,\u201d said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy.\n\n\u201cWhenever you do that, a piece of what you engage on are topics that are going to matter for the election. But I can\u2019t say exactly what their goal was.\u201d\n\nFacebook also announced new steps to fight foreign interference and misinformation ahead of the November 2020 election, including labeling state-controlled media outlets and adding greater protections for elected officials and candidates who may be vulnerable targets for hacking.\n\nU.S. security officials have warned that Russia, Iran and other countries could attempt to sway the result of next year\u2019s presidential vote. Officials say they are on high alert for signs of foreign influence campaigns on social media.\n\nMoscow and Tehran have repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nGleicher said the IRA-linked network used 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account to gather 246,000 followers, about 60% of which were in the United States.\n\nThe earliest accounts dated to January this year and the operation appeared to be \u201cfairly immature in its development,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey were pretty focused on audience-building, which is the thing you do first as you\u2019re sort of trying to set up an operation.\u201d\n\nBen Nimmo, a researcher with social media analysis company Graphika who Facebook commissioned, said the flagged accounts shared material that could appeal to Republican and Democratic voters alike.\n\nMost of the messages plagiarized material authored by leading conservative and progressive pundits. This included recycling comments initially shared on Twitter that criticized U.S. congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting in this set is so much of what they were doing is copying and pasting genuine material from actual Americans,\u201d Nimmo told Reuters. \u201cThis may be indicative of an effort to hide linguistic deficiencies, which have made them easier to detect in the past.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC have denied any wrongdoing. U.S. prosecutors say the firm is controlled by Russian catering tycoon Evgeny Prigozhin and helped orchestrate the IRA\u2019s operations.\n\nGleicher said the separate Iranian network his team identified used more than 100 fake and hacked accounts on Facebook and Instagram to target U.S. users and some French-speaking parts of North Africa. Some accounts also repurposed Iranian state media stories to target users in Latin American countries including Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico.\n\nThe activity was connected to an Iranian campaign first identified in August last year, which Reuters showed aimed to direct internet users to a sprawling web of pseudo-news websites which repackaged propaganda from Iranian state media.
