The purpose of the operation is yet to be announced although sources close to the issue say officers have been searching for documents related to some Bulgarian referees.\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin also spoke out on Tuesday, urging the 'football family' to 'wage war on the racists' following the abuse suffered by the likes of Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford on Monday.\n\nPolice in Bulgaria mounted a dramatic raid on the headquarters of the Bulgarian FA after Monday night's racist chants shame\n\n30 officers from the country's police force entered the FA HQ less than an hour after president Borislav Mihaylov resigned\n\nEngland player's were subjected to horrific racist abuse by Bulgaria fans during their 6-0 win in Sofia on Monday evening\n\nThere were two breaks in play in Sofia after racist chanting was reported to the match officials.

A statement from the BFU read: 'Today the Bulgarian FA president Borislav Mihaylov has resigned from his position \u2013 his letter of resignation will be presented to the members of the FA's Executive Committee at this Friday's meeting.\n\n'It comes after the pressure that has been generated over the past few days; a situation that is not positive for Bulgarian football or the Football Union itself. After so many years in the position and because of his network of international contacts, Mr Mihaylov has said he is ready to continue helping Bulgarian football to develop in any way possible.'\n\nUEFA president Ceferin, meanwhile, also provided a robust response to the racism in Sofia in a statement of his own.\n\nHe blamed a rise in nationalism across Europe for fuelling racism at matches and said the governing body was committed to eradicating the 'disease' from football.\n\n'Believe me, UEFA is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football.

Governments too need to do more in this area.'\n\nBack in the UK, British PM Boris Johnson condemned the racism as 'vile' and called on UEFA to conduct a swift investigation with tough penalties to follow, Downing Street said.\n\nBulgarian football officials including Mihaylov had spent the run-up to Monday night's match accusing England players of being 'offensive' in suggesting they could face racist abuse in Sofia and described branding Bulgarian fans as potential racists as 'unjust'.\n\nMihaylov's bizarre statements before the match were followed by Bulgaria's manager Krasimir Balakov, selected by their FA, claiming not to have heard any chanting and saying in his post-match press conference: 'the unacceptable behaviour was by England fans.'\n\nThe match was stopped twice by the referee over the Bulgarian fans racist chants\u2013 with England eventually running out comfortable 6-0 winners.\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov insists he did not hear any racist chanting from his nation's fans\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 IN FULL \ud83c\udfa5\n\n\n\n'For three weeks all we've heard people talking about is anything else but football'\n\n\n\nBulgarian boss Krasimir Balakov gives his reaction to the reported racist abuse during the England game#BULENG #ThreeLions #ITVFootball #EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/NDiu7zBywG \u2014 ITV Football (@itvfootball) October 14, 2019\n\nFans in black wore clothes which had 'ultras' and 'hooligans' printed on them, before a mass walk-out before half-time\n\nOn Tuesday morning, in comments reported by Bulgarian news site sportal.bg Bulgarian minister for sport Krasen Kralev said: 'A little while ago, the prime minister called me urgently. You know that in the last four years, the government has done a lot for the development of Bulgarian football.\n\n'But after the recent events, having in mind the whole state of football, after yesterday's incidents, the Prime Minister has ordered me from today to suspend any relations with the football union, including financial ones, until the resignation of Borislav Mihaylov.'\n\nEngland forward Raheem Sterling responded to the prime minister's words on Tuesday morning, saying: 'A good move - credit to you Mr Borissov.'\n\nThe events of England's 6-0 win over Bulgaria on Monday night:\n\nThe game was halted TWICE as home fans abuse black players, brandish 'No Respect' shirts and make Nazi salutes in planned racist onslaught\n\nTyrone Mings reveals vile chants started before kick-off in Bulgaria\n\nMarcus Rashford praises 'courage' of Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for appealing to fans at half-time to stop racist taunting of England players\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate considered taking his players off the pitch against Bulgaria as FA chairman Greg Clarke condemns racist taunting\n\nIan Wright says England players taking action against racism made him 'feel really good'\n\nRaheem Sterling calls out Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov for saying England have a bigger racism problem than his own country and posts funny Ainsley Harriott meme in response to Piers Morgan hailing his performance in face of vile racist abuse\n\nUEFA will use evidence from specialist 'spotters' in the crowd and TV footage to prosecute after Bulgarian fans' appalling racist taunts\n\nBulgaria's prime minister called on the president of their FA to quit over the racist incidents\n\nFA president then handed in his resignation and has stepped down from his position as football chief\n\nBulgarian football is in a state of crisis after manager Balakov insisted he did not hear any racist chanting from his nation's supporters and slammed England fans for interrupting the Bulgaria national anthem.\n\nThat was despite monkey noises aimed at England defender Tyrone Mings and Sterling being clearly heard at the ground and on television - to the extent where the game was twice brought to a halt.\n\nBalakov told ITV: 'I personally did not hear the chanting you are most probably referring to. I saw that the referee stopped the game.'\n\nA fan holds up a No Respect jumper, a reference to UEFA's Respect campaign which encourages equality in football\n\nHordes of Bulgarian fans in black hoodies and shirts which said 'hooligans from Sofia' left the stadium after warnings over their behaviour\n\nGareth Southgate and his players spoke to the referee about the offensive chants they heard from the stands\n\nSelf-described 'hooligans from Sofia' dressed in black and had their faces covered during the match\n\nUEFA'S THREE-STEP PROTOCOL 1 - The referee will speak to the stadium announcer and demand the halting of racist behaviour. 2 - If it continues, the referee can take the players off the field into the dressing rooms for a period of time and the stadium announcer will make another address. 3 - If it still continues, the match will be abandoned.\n\nBalakov added: 'But I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on behalf of the Bulgaria fans but also the England fans who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgaria national anthem and during the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.\n\n'To be honest this has not happened to us before. The disciplinary measures by UEFA were not because of racist chanting but because of a banner from an organisation which is not forbidden by Bulgarian law.\n\n'We have had this problem since England were going to come to Bulgaria. For three weeks I have heard anything else but football and I don't think this is the proper manner to prepare and play a football game because over three weeks everybody was talking about one thing.\n\n'If this turns out to be true, we are truly sorry.

'I absolutely applaud Gareth and the England team dignity that they showed. There may have been less in the second half, but it was still there. 'If its zero tolerance its zero tolerance. That's absolutely flouting to UEFA their own campaign. 'I think there has to be a massively thorough investigation. Expulsion, not enter tournament. There has to be a clear message, it's 2019. 'You wouldn't expect it in your workplace.'\n\nAfter the first-half incidents, the players spoke in the changing room at half-time, with Kane praising the fortitude of his colleagues for wanting to continue the match despite the issues.\n\n'I'm definitely proud of my team-mates and my friends and everyone involved with our nation tonight,' he added.\n\n'It wasn't easy for anyone, we made a decision as a team to carry on playing, you saw us come together before half-time and we said we would play until half-time, get together and decide what we wanted to do.\n\n'Everyone wanted to carry on and do their talking on the pitch, which I am extremely proud of.\n\n'It is not easy to play in circumstances like that but the 6-0 victory and the way we played, the manner in which we played I'm extremely proud of for sure.\n\n'There was a discussion in the changing room and everyone wanted to carry on playing.
