This photo shows her five hours after surgery. (Submitted)\n\nWudwud is expected to make a full recovery, but a few months ago, her parents were scared she wouldn't make it to her third birthday.\n\nHailey began having difficulty breathing, sleeping and eating last summer.\n\nPayne said doctors were puzzled. After tests, scans and X-rays, they eventually found out she had choked on the plastic eye of a stuffed animal.\n\nThe plastic eye that Hailey swallowed was the size of a nickel. (Tyler Pidlubny/CBC)\n\nIt was there so long it became embedded in her flesh and cut a hole in her airway. It took two surgeries to remove and Wudwud's throat started to collapse.\n\n\"We never believed that this would happen,\" said Payne. \"I'd never feared a stuffed animal would do anything like this. It's just not something that you pay attention to.\n\n\"I wish that was different, but unfortunately I just trusted the toys.\"\n\nThe doctors used about one third of Wudwud's stomach to create a new throat, leaving her stomach much smaller in size.\n\nShe often becomes ill and vomits after eating because she doesn't know how much food her stomach \u2014 which is stretching back out \u2014 can handle.\n\nWudwud 48 hours after surgery. (Submitted)\n\nHer parents said she still requires constant attention because the valves in her throat don't always close properly so she can't have liquids or mushy foods, like pudding.\n\nPayne said it's difficult because her siblings always want to share whatever they are eating and drinking. Being able to eat real food again has been exciting for the little girl.\n\n\"She got to try Cheerios and some fruit and she was pretty ecstatic about it,\" said Payne. \"She was just shaking the whole time; it was really awesome for her.\"\n\nWudwud's doctors did a contrast test with an X-ray to determine that there are no holes in her throat. Her progress with swallowing will be reassessed in a couple months.\n\n\"Since this procedure started when she was so young, and she hasn't had to swallow in such a long time, those muscles have actually relaxed. Same as any muscle we don't use, it just starts to soften,\" said Payne.\n\nThe family is optimistic she is getting close to making a full recovery.\n\nWudwud is now home with her parents and five siblings. She still can't have liquids or mushy foods while she regains full ability to swallow. (CBC News/Alex Soloducha)\n\nPayne said they are looking forward to eating Thanksgiving dinner together, with Wudwud at the table and enjoying the meal. And since she had a surgery on her second birthday, he said he wants to spoil her at Christmas.\n\nHe said Wudwud's five brothers and sisters consider her to be a super hero.\n\n\"This has brought us together so much more than I think anything else could have. I'd rather it was something else. She is just so precious now you just look at her differently.\"\n\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe to help cover the costs of their trips to Saskatoon for Wudwud's treatments. Payne said the entire ordeal has cost them upwards of $20,000.", "description": "A two-year-old from Regina is learning how to swallow again following throat surgery.", "authors": ["Alex Soloducha Is A Reporter For Cbc Saskatchewan."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299131.1569539127!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hailey-wudwud.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
