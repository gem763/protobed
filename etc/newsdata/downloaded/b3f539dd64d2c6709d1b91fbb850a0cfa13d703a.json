Oil prices spiked by 2% on the news. Iranian state television said the explosion damaged two storerooms aboard the unnamed oil tanker and caused an oil leak into the Red Sea near the Saudi port city of Jiddah.\u201d AP\n\nTHE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE was awarded to Ethiopian PM ABIY AHMED ALI.\n\nNEW \u2026 People close to President DONALD TRUMP tell us that TREY GOWDY\u2019S ascendance into the president\u2019s circle is an attempt to supplant RUDY GIULIANI as a presence on cable television and Sunday shows. One person close to Trump said White House aides have been \u201cpulling their hair out\u201d every time Rudy opens his mouth on TV.\n\n-- BUT \u2026 TRUMP said before departing for Minneapolis on Thursday that \u201cTrey Gowdy can't start until sometime after January because of the lobbying rules and regulations.

Giuliani pressed for help in securing the release of a jailed client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe request by Mr. Giuliani provoked an immediate objection from Mr. Tillerson, who argued that it would be highly inappropriate to interfere in an open criminal case, according to two people briefed on the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe gold trader, Reza Zarrab, had been accused by federal prosecutors of playing a central role in an effort by a state-owned Turkish bank to funnel more than $10 billion worth of gold and cash to Iran, in defiance of United States sanctions designed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u2026 In the end, no such prisoner swap took place. But the episode has opened a new chapter in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to interject himself into the Trump administration\u2019s diplomacy while at times representing clients with a direct interest in the outcome.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WAPO, by Josh Dawsey, Carol Leonnig and Matt Zapotosky: \u201cSometime in mid- to late 2017, Giuliani showed up at the Justice Department and requested a meeting with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein about the Zarrab case, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of the people said that when Giuliani, who did not have an appointment, called to say he was coming by, he said he was coming from the White House.\n\n\u201cHis request to meet with Rosenstein was denied, the people said, though they said it was possible Giuliani then met with lower-level officials. The department, the people said, was not particularly receptive to Giuliani\u2019s advocacy that the case be dropped.\u201d WaPo\n\nIMPEACHMENT CLIP PACKET \u2026\n\nHAPPENING TODAY, MAYBE \u2026 MARIE YOVANOVITCH, the ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, is scheduled to talk to members of the House Oversight, Foreign Affairs and Judiciary panels today. ...

In the U.S., their flashy style and propensity for name-dropping raised eyebrows. Their business deals at times ended in lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe Soviet-born Florida businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman -- indicted Thursday on campaign finance violation charges that include channeling foreign money into U.S. politics -- boasted on social media and to associates about their close ties to American politicians, including President Trump.\n\n\u201cMr. Parnas made his first-ever federal political donation two weeks before the 2016 election, giving about $100,000 to Mr. Trump and his Republican Party allies, Federal Election Commission records show. He and Mr. Fruman were the first two in a long line for a photo with the president-elect at a donor thank-you event in Florida a few weeks after he won, according to a person familiar with the event.\n\n\u201cSince then, they have sought to expand their political and business portfolios, making about $1 million in campaign contributions in recent years as they attempted deals in the liquefied natural gas market and Nevada\u2019s legalized marijuana trade, according to FEC records, interviews and the indictment.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- VIDEO DU JOUR: \u201cGiuliani in 2018 video with embroiled associates: \u2018Can't wait to come back\u2019 to Ukraine\u201d (hat tip: Ben Jacobs)\n\nSARAH FERRIS and ANDREW DESIDERIO with a New Hartford, N.Y., dateline: \u201cThe holdout, the reluctant supporter, and the impeachment die-hard\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The deal being discussed would at least stop an increase in the tariff rate on the $250bn of goods to 30 per cent, which was planned for October 15.\n\n\u201cA more ambitious deal might also prevent the imposition of 15 per cent tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese goods set to hit on December 15. In that scenario, some are also hoping for a partial or full rollback in the 15 per cent tariffs on $110bn of goods that took effect September 1.\n\n\u201cChina purchases: In exchange for easing tariff pressure, China would drop its own retaliatory tariffs, but also agree to boost its purchases of US agriculture and energy products. US farmers in particular have borne the brunt of the pain from the trade war with Beijing, and Mr Trump has been keen to given them some relief, especially since they are a core part of his political base.\n\n\u201cCurrency: During the talks over a bigger trade deal in April, the US and China had settled on a provision committing Beijing to refrain from any competitive devaluation of its currency. This has been put back on the table in the context of a smaller deal. \u2026 Intellectual property \u2026 Huawei.\u201d FT\n\nNYT\u2019S MAGGIE HABERMAN and KATIE BENNER: \u201cTrump Lashes Out at Fox News Poll as Barr Meets With Murdoch\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT UNLOADS \u2026 NOT MINNESOTA NICE \u2026 STAR TRIBUNE\u2019S PATRICK CONDON: \u201cPresident Donald Trump descended into the heart of politically liberal Minneapolis on Thursday night, delivering a sprawling and at times vulgarity-laced campaign speech that attacked political opponents in withering terms, mocked Democrats for trying to impeach him, and predicted he\u2019d carry Minnesota on his way to a second term next year.\n\n\u201cThe marathon, 102-minute speech capped a boisterous rally of cheering supporters who filled the 19,356-seat Target Center, surrounded by thousands more anti-Trump protesters, some of whom clashed with police as tensions rose amid a rainy chill.\n\n\u201cBesides repeatedly bashing the impeachment inquiry \u2014 he at one point called it \u2018a brazen attempt to overthrow our government\u2019 \u2014 Trump took aim at other targets. He called U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis an \u2018America-hating socialist\u2019 and labeled Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey \u2018rotten.\u2019 He mounted several lengthy rants against former Vice President Joe Biden, whom he said \u2018was a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cOmar\u2019s office said she would not be in Minnesota for Trump\u2019s visit and would not disclose her location.

Whether it be the wholesale elimination and prohibition of private insurance and imposition of socialized medicine in the form of Sen. Sanders\u2019 $32 trillion Medicare for All plan, or Speaker Pelosi\u2019s glidepath toward the same goal with her prescription drug pricing plan, these misguided proposals pose grave threats to the quality and availability of every single Americans\u2019 health care, to the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow, and to our nation\u2019s economy. Single payer health care schemes and drug price controls have been tried abroad with the same results: access restrictions for patients, decisions made by bureaucrats rather than patients and doctors, stifled innovation, and crippling taxes. This is not the policy prescription for health care in America.
