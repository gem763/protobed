Peter Braig\n\n\u201cWe have evidence that customers can save considerable money by switching providers, and we want to fully understand what the barriers are that stand in their way, particularly barriers created by the banks.\u201d\n\nWhile the banks provided cautious support for the latest inquiry, the potential for it to create broader awareness about the savings that can be gained from switching will provide a major headache to an oligopoly that has for decades profited from customer ignorance.\n\nAs data sharing becomes more widely accepted, we expect the competitive landscape to intensify. \u2014 Victor German, Macquarie analyst\n\nThe ACCC reckons an existing borrower with an average-sized residential mortgage of around $340,000 who negotiated to pay the same interest rate as the average new borrower, could initially save up to $850 a year in interest, and this would compound to tens of thousands of dollars less over the full term of a residential mortgage.\n\nNew competitors in the market, from a bevy of neobanks to global technology giants, are planning on taking advantage of the arrival of new technologies to encourage switching, using policies such as the consumer data right (CDR).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA key plank of the government's microeconomic reform, the CDR is being rolled out to the banking sector in the form of \"open banking\" and will make it easier for customers to compare offers and switch. It's a big disruptive risk to the majors that is triggering a new round of paranoia among senior executives in the incumbents.\n\nBank watchers are alive to the rising risks that the profits of the major banks will be dis-intermediated from rising competition when open banking comes into effect for residential mortgages and other lending products from February 1 next year. The policy will give borrowers the ability to safely access data about them held by their lender, and direct that it be transferred to accredited third parties to use to offer cheaper or better products and services.\n\nMacquarie analyst Victor German wrote in a recent report that \"banks\u2019 ability to access customer data at scale theoretically provided them with a significant advantage over competitors\", but \"as data sharing becomes more widely accepted, we expect the competitive landscape to intensify\".\n\nHigh-returning business lines like foreign exchange, mortgages and payments are set to be targeted and \"customers are more likely to choose products that offer convenience and price as opposed to often selecting sub-par products offered by their current main financial institution\", German predicts. Open banking \"will result in better transparency and more seamless movement between providers\".\n\nThe drivers of customer switching has also been examined in detail by the Productivity Commission, which first called for the introduction of the consumer data right. In a comprehensive report on competition in the financial sector released last August, it made 23 findings and 34 recommendations to enhance competition \u2013 with many based around enhancing the disclosure and quality of data to give more power to customers to make decisions on who they want to bank with.\n\nLast week, former PC chairman Peter Harris said the government should get on with legislating more of these rather than delay action by holding another mortgage price inquiry proposed by the competition watchdog.\n\nLike the ACCC, the Productivity Commission found consumers \u201clack meaningful transparent information and face switching barriers\u201d and they \u201cperceive insufficient ongoing difference between providers and product offerings to make the process worthwhile\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFinancial service providers are able to selectively offer products, prices or terms to different customers, using the information they have about individual consumers,\u201d the PC said. \u201cThis curtails the ability for an active subset of consumers to drive increased competition in the broader market.\u201d\n\nConsumer behaviours are anchored in behavioural biases and the level of information customers seek. \u2014 Paul Wiebusch, Deloitte partner\n\nIn addition to its call on open banking, the Productivity Commission has made other recommendations to pry open what was once considered proprietary data to put it in the hand of consumers to encourage more switching.\n\nThis includes a call on the prudential regulator to collect more granular data from banks to provide customers with details of actual mortgage pricing, not just the headline standard variable rates that few borrowers actually pay due to rampant discounting. (It is understood the Council of Financial Regulators is examining how to implement this and there are plans for a customer tool to be rolled out in the first half of next year via ASIC\u2019s MoneySmart website.)\n\nBut it's the rollout of open banking that has banks scrambling to adjust. \"Banks are working night and day to prepare for the consumer data right to empower customers to more easily shop around for the financial service that best meets their needs,\" Australian Banking Association chief executive Anna Bligh said on Monday.\n\nA new report by Deloitte, which will be released on Wednesday, shows just how disruptive accelerating levels of switching could be to the majors. It suggests that well-heeled and younger customers will be the most likely to be aware of and take advantage of open banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been lots of discussion that banks are gouging or profiteering but this misses the point that fundamental consumer behaviours are anchored in behavioural biases and the level of information customers seek,\" says Deloitte partner Paul Wiebusch, lead author of the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeloitte has found that about 20 per cent of bank customers changed providers of at least one of their banking products in the last three years. But the majority of Australians have been with their primary bank for more than a decade, with 76 per cent having had a relationship of over five years.\n\nA positive for banks is the report suggests the lack of switching reflects that many customers are satisfied with their bank. But this creates a circularity that supports the oligopoly, Deloitte suggests.\n\n\"Because customers perceive that they are satisfied with their current banking product or provider, they do not gather information about other banking products or offerings. And because they have not gathered information, they are not aware of the benefits of these alternative financial services products from other providers, and so lack the information to re-assess their level of satisfaction with their current provider.\"\n\nMore ominously for the majors, Deloitte says it's highly sought after Millennial customers, and those who are technology savvy, well-educated and on higher incomes, who are more likely to search for better deals and ultimately to switch \u2013 that is, the higher quality customers.\n\nUltimately, increased shopping around will depend on the degree to which customers become confident they have control over their financial outcomes and their capability to understand their finances and the options available to them.\n\n\u201cIf consumers are going to take advantage of the benefits of open banking or make informed choices about banking products, they will need to understand the differences in financial value between different products \u2013 they will need to be financially literate, financially capable and financially conscious,\" Deloitte says.\n\nHard task to educate\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ACCC knows it has a hard task to educate bank customers to not be passive consumers of financial services. For example, it found last year that only 11 per cent of borrowers with a variable rate residential mortgage obtained a reduced interest rate or reduced fees as a result of asking their bank for a better deal or accepting a bank-initiated offer.\n\nBut as it embarks on another inquiry to explain to Australians how bank pricing works, it is likely to emphasise again that the power to get a better deal comes from being proactive, and the CDR provides a tool for action.\n\n\"It will improve consumers\u2019 access to competitive offerings and new and innovative services,\" the ACCC says.\n\n\"It will facilitate the ability to compare and switch between products and services, including residential mortgages. It will encourage competition between service providers, leading not only to better prices for consumers, but also more innovative products and services.\u201d", "description": "The big banks profit from a lack of customer switching, so moves to accelerate shopping around could come at a big cost.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_131/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6117b89d2d148f96a08d2c594c41edafba1c5215", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
