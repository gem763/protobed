Two civilians had been killed and two others injured in Misharrafa, west of Ras al-Ain, the SDF said.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia - the dominant force in the SDF - an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.\n\nThe Turkish government plans to create a \"safe zone\" without Kurdish militias - regarded by Ankara as terrorists - which will also accommodate two million of Turkey's 3.6 million Syrian refugees.\n\nAn agonisingly long war\n\nBy BBC's Orla Guerin in Akcakale on the Turkish-Syrian border\n\nPolice vehicles have been telling civilians to leave the area, and there were sounds of artillery fire and mortar rounds. There has been incoming mortar fire from just across the border but it has not reached Turkish territory.\n\nPresident Erdogan says this is the beginning of Operation Peace Spring. There is no doubt that for the Syrian civilians who are just across the border this is going to be seen as another round of battling in an agonisingly long war.\n\nThe Kurdish forces have emphasised almost frantically in the last few days that the hard-won gains in their long battle against IS are now being put at risk. The SDF have lost an estimated 11,000 fighters in battling IS. They succeeded with American help.\n\nBut they point out, for example, that they may have to withdraw their forces from prisons where they are holding IS fighters or from cities that have been liberated from IS. The Kurds are basically saying to the West: the war that we fought on your behalf is now at risk because of what Turkey wants to do.\n\nWhat has the international reaction been?\n\nThe UK and France planned to request an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the situation, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged Turkey to \"halt its military operation\".\n\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Turkey had \"legitimate security concerns\" but that he expected the country to \"act with restraint and to ensure that any action... is proportionate and measured.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Syrian town of Ras al-Ain came under attack\n\nUS Senator Lindsay Graham, a close ally of Mr Trump, said he would lead an effort in Congress to \"make Erdogan pay a heavy price\", adding: \"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration.\"\n\nIn his statement, Mr Trump also said Turkey would be responsible for ensuring that suspected IS fighters being held captive remained in prison and that IS did not regroup.\n\nHow would an incursion affect the IS situation?\n\nThe SDF says it is detaining more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been not revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the camp of IS families in Syria\n\nTwo camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the \"safe zone\". On Wednesday, IS militants reportedly carried out three suicide attacks in their former de facto capital of Raqqa. There was no confirmation of casualties.\n\nAre you in the affected area?
