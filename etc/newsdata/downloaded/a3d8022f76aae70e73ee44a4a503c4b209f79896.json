REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - BP\u2019s (BP.L) third-quarter profit dropped sharply, but still beat expectations, hurt by weaker oil prices, lower production and one-off charges linked to large divestments.\n\nLondon-based BP reported on Tuesday third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company\u2019s definition of net income, of $2.3 billion, exceeding forecasts of $1.73 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts.\n\nThat compared with $3.83 billion a year earlier and $2.81 billion in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThe sharp drop will not come as a surprise to investors after BP indicated earlier this month that it would take a non-cash charge of $2 to $3 billion in the quarter as it gets closer to divestments worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule.", "description": "BP's third-quarter profit dropped sharply, but still beat expectations, hurt by weaker oil prices, lower production and one-off charges linked to large divestments.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446097919&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0E6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
