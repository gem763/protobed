The ARTICLE ONE Act would stipulate that a national emergency would expire within 30 days unless Congress votes to continue the national emergency through a simple majority in each chamber of Congress.\n\nThe legislation would invert the current proceeding for Congress to nullify a national emergency.\n\nAfter a president declares a national emergency, Congress can terminate the declaration by passing a resolution of disapproval against the national emergency. Congress has passed resolutions to end Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration; however, the president vetoed the legislation, and Congress failed to override the veto.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sponsored the Article ONE Act in March and passed through the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs by voice vote in July.\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border in the wake of Congress\u2019 inability to pass significant border wall funding. The ARTICLE ONE Act would not eliminate Trump\u2019s ability to declare a national emergency; although, the bill would make it easier for Congress to terminate the emergency, especially with a Democrat-led House.\n\nThe 15 senators that sponsored the ARTICLE ONE Act include:\n\nMike Lee Ron Johnson (R-WI) Gary Peters (D-MI) Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) Roy Blunt (R-MO) Maggie Hassan (D-NH) Roger Wicker (R-MS) Tom Udall (D-NM) Rob Portman (R-OH) Brian Schatz (D-HI) Chuck Grassley (R-IA) Mitt Romney (R-UT) Ben Sasse (R-NE) Johnny Isakson (R-GA) Tom Carper (D-DE)\n\nSen. Sinema said in a statement Monday, \u201cIt is Congress\u2019s constitutional duty to appropriate funds, and we must protect that power regardless of who is president.\u201d\n\nRead the senator\u2019s letter to Schumer and McConnell here.", "description": "15 senators urged McConnell them to take up legislation that would grant Congress more oversight over Trump's national emergency authority.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173659340-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
