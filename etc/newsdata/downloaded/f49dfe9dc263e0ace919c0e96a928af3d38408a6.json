Footage showed him gingerly returning to his saddle before drafting behind his team car to return to the peloton, a rule which is inconsistently enforced across the top of the sport where leeway is generally given to riders who have crashed.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe sport\u2019s governing body, the UCI, came in for criticism from several quarters, including current professional riders. \u201cIf this is the new standard going forward then every puncture or crash will spell a DSQ or us missing the time limit,\u201d tweeted New Zealander George Bennett. \u201cSome people take the piss with the cars in the convoy at times but coming back from a crash when the jury haven\u2019t made barrage means they are fair game in my book.\u201d\n\nHowever, the UCI released further video on Saturday to clarify the reason for Eekhoff disqualification, which revealed a segment of two minutes in which the 21-year-old used his team car to make significant time gain.\n\n\u201cThe rider was disqualified for sheltering behind a vehicle for over two minutes,\u201d said the UCI in a statement. \u201cThe maximum sanction was considered appropriated due to the time spent sheltering.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\n\u2019World champion! That feeling... But it only lasted for 15 minutes\u2019\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Friday night Eekhoff released his own statement. \u201cWORLD CHAMPION! That feeling\u2026 But it only lasted for 15 minutes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m proud [of] my performance\u2026 Although I suffered serious pain from a dislocated shoulder, the crash early in the race never stopped me from fighting for my ultimate goal. To hear they DQ me, was/is a big shock to me. I understand the rules of cycling, but truly think this decision is inappropriate. What means consistency to the UCI is a question I want to find out. But for now; I will never ever forget these best 15 minutes of my life\u2026 I\u2019ll be back!\u201d\n\nThe Italian Samuele Battistella was promoted to the gold medal. Yorkshire\u2019s Tom Pidcock, who finished fourth, was upgraded to bronze.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more \u2019World champion! That feeling...
