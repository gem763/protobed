On Sunday, Mulvaney told Wallace and the Fox News audience not to believe what they heard him say.\n\nAfter Wallace asked Mulvaney why he said an investigation into the Democratic Party was included in the quid pro quo, the acting White House chief of staff insisted that he did not say that while admitting \u201cpeople are saying that is what I said.\u201d\n\nMulvaney went on to claim that he only mentioned two conditions for the release of military funds. But, as Wallace pointed out, Mulvaney cited \u201cthree reasons\u201d on Thursday, one of which included an investigation into the Democratic Party.\n\nWallace said, \u201cYou were asked by [ABC News\u2019] Jonathan Karl, was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aid \u2014 was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, \u2018It happens all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nMulvaney then asked Wallace to watch what he said again and tried to muddy the waters with an extended explanation about what he supposedly meant to say. But an exasperated Wallace was having none of it, telling Mulvaney, \u201cI hate to go through this, but you said what you said.\u201d\n\nWallace then pointedly told Mulvaney that what he said in the press conference on Thursday wasn\u2019t hard to understand. \u201cThe fact is after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aid was held off,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWhat were the conditions for the aid? And you didn\u2019t mention two conditions you mentioned three conditions.\u201d\n\nWallace then showed Mulvaney the video of his contradicting statements, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s listen to all three of them because you stated it very clearly.\u201d\n\nWhen the clip ended, Wallace said, \u201cNot only did you say that investigating the Democrats was one of the three conditions, not two, that you had just said that you had talked about investigating the Democrats was part of the quid pro. You also said it was part of the Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.\u201d\n\nWallace further drove home his point by noting that the Justice Department released a statement after Mulvaney\u2019s press conference that stated those claims were \u201cnews to us.\u201d\n\nWallace then told Mulvaney, \u201cEverybody thinks that is what you said. And you said right there [in the video clip] three points, not two.\u201d\n\nIn response, Mulvaney repeatedly said he never used the term quid pro quo \u201cbecause there isn\u2019t,\u201d totally ignoring that he had confirmed that it was a quid pro quo when reporters clearly spelled it out during their follow-up questions in the press conference.\n\nWhat Mulvaney is trying to achieve by denying that he did not say what he clearly said seems to be for the benefit of himself and Trump only. There were reports after his trainwreck of a presser that his job was in jeopardy. And it\u2019s a longstanding Trump strategy to double and triple down on lies, in the hope that someone will buy what he\u2019s selling. Plus, Trump has rarely seen an upside with admitting a wrong. So, at the very least, the president likely respects the game Mulvaney is playing, even if it sounds nonsensical to most.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
