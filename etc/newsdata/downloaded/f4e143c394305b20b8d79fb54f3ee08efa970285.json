He spoke in support of Morey during a pregame show ahead of the NBA\u2019s Opening Night on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOne of our best values here in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak up about injustices and that\u2019s just how it goes,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cDaryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say, \u2018That\u2019s not right\u2019 and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nWhile Morey\u2019s tweet, which included an image that said \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d was quickly deleted, the Chinese government interpreted it as a challenge to its sovereignty over Hong Kong. The controversy has put the NBA\u2019s business in China at risk, with Chinese stations halting broadcasts of pre-season NBA games and many Chinese companies cutting ties with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe fallout has also affected NBA games back in the United States \u2014 fans have appeared at pre-season games wearing t-shirts in support of the Hong Kong protestors. Earlier in October, a Philadelphia 76ers fan was escorted out of a pre-season game after he held signs and chanted in support of the protestors.\n\nO\u2019Neal is not the only basketball icon to weigh in on the NBA-China rift. LeBron James stirred a controversy of his own when he criticized Morey for speaking out, saying the Rockets general manager was \u201cmisinformed or not really educated on the situation.\u201d\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver also spoke in support of Morey during the TIME 100 Health Summit on Oct. 17, and said the league is willing to handle the business consequences of his tweet.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial. Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next,\u201d he said. \u201cThe financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nAlthough the NBA had initially distanced itself from the issue, Silver defended Morey while speaking at the event during an interview with Robin Roberts. \u201cWe made clear that we were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV said Silver would face \u201cretribution\u201d over his statement that China wanted him to fire Morey, CNBC reports. The state broadcaster said Silver \u201cfabricated lies out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnti-government protesters in Hong Kong have taken to the streets for months, first with demonstrations against now-withdrawn extradition legislation. In the months since, protesters\u2019 grievances have grown in scope and scale, with some calling for independence for Hong Kong.\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "Shaquille O'Neal has defended Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in the NBA-China controversy.", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shaquille-oneal-nba-china-protests.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
