When my lawyers protested, they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nOne of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great, the best ever! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nIt made me laugh to think of lawyers threatening a pollster. With what? Bad Sampling in the First Degree?\n\nThere\u2019s one true thing in those two tweets: ABC did briefly have Trump falling 12 points behind Hillary in October 2016 \u2014 from October 20 to 23, to be exact. Other pollsters saw Clinton\u2019s lead balloon around the same time, though. The AP had her up 13, Suffolk had her up 10, and so on. That\u2019s not because of data-rigging or FAKE NEWS!, it\u2019s because Trump was getting battered at the time by fallout from the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and the women coming forward to accuse him of various forms of sexual misconduct. Not long after, though, Comey released his letter to Congress announcing that he was reopening the Emailgate probe. And late deciders began weighing whether to sign up for another four years of Clintonism or to try to something different in a big way. The very next ABC poll taken, from October 21-24, found Hillary\u2019s lead slipping to eight points. The ABC/WaPo poll conducted from October 23-26 found it shrinking to five points. The next tracker, from October 27-30, after the Comey letter was issued, had it down to one.\n\nThe final poll they published before Election Day put the race at 49/46 for Hillary. That turned out to be the closest match of any major pollster with the national popular vote, which went 48/46. Which was no surprise: Contra Trump, ABC/WaPo actually has a sterling record of polling in presidential contests.\n\nBut we needn\u2019t dwell on this. Anyone who doesn\u2019t understand yet that Trump cries \u201cfake!\u201d at any news that\u2019s bad for him to try to convince people not to believe it isn\u2019t going to be swayed at this point. Besides, I can understand why today\u2019s ABC/WaPo poll is especially irritating to him. It\u2019s not the job approval number in it, which is bad at 38 percent (down six points from June) but nothing he hasn\u2019t seen before. The ominous numbers are the ones associated with the economy, particularly the trade war with China.\n\nWhile a 56 percent majority of Americans rate the economy as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d that figure is down from 65 percent in November. A separate question finds 6 in 10 say that a recession is either \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d in the next year. That fear compares with 69 percent who said a recession was likely in fall 2007, shortly before the recession began later that year\u2026 The Post-ABC poll finds 43 percent of Americans say Trump\u2019s trade and economic policies have increased the chance of a recession in the next year, more than double the 16 percent who say his policies have decreased the likelihood of a recession. Another 34 percent say Trump\u2019s policies have not made a difference\u2026 But sizable shares of Trump\u2019s core supporters say they are worried about price increases because of tariffs, including 55 percent of whites without college degrees, 54 percent of people living in rural areas and 45 percent of white evangelical Protestants. Concern rises to about 6 in 10 political independents and people living in the suburbs, two key swing voting groups.\n\nHis approval rating on the economy was in majority territory in June at 51 percent. Now it\u2019s at 46/47.\n\nIf we do end up in a recession, POTUS will use every rhetorical weapon available to him to shift the blame. It\u2019s Jerome Powell\u2019s fault for not lowering interest rates; it\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 fault for not moving their businesses out of China quickly enough; it\u2019s Democrats\u2019 fault for not agreeing to a payroll tax cut to stimulate the economy; it\u2019s China\u2019s fault for stubbornly resisting American pressure to end its intellectual-property banditry and play fair economically. Those arguments will work for fans but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll work for swing voters. A separate poll taken late last month showed most Americans will blame Trump if the economy goes south:\n\nThe Harvard CAPS/Harris poll of 2,531 registered voters at the end of August found that 57 percent would blame Trump more than the Federal Reserve or anyone else should America enter recession by the end of the year. Moreover, 62 percent said they were somewhat or very concerned that there will be a recession in the next six months amid the China trade war, a global economic slowdown, and the waning impact of federal stimulus from early on in the Trump administration\u2026 The Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found that 63 percent believe the tariffs are hurting the U.S. more than China. Moreover, 74 percent said U.S. consumers, not China, pay the cost of the tariffs.\n\nThe good news for him is that Americans do see the point of this war. Fifty percent approved of his tariffs on China despite the economic pain and fully 80 percent thought it was better to reckon with China\u2019s chicanery now than to keep postponing it. That\u2019d be an interesting electoral pitch if Trump tried it \u2014 \u201cI know it\u2019s tough right now but it\u2019ll be tougher if we let China keep stealing. And unless you elect me to a second term, the next president will let them off the hook.\u201d I don\u2019t think he\u2019d try that message, though; it\u2019s too close to accepting responsibility for a negative development, something to which his ego is deathly allergic. He\u2019ll try a combo of insisting that things really aren\u2019t so bad and, to the extent that they are, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault.\n\nOne other ABC/WaPo detail via Charlie Sykes: Trump\u2019s approval is at 30/64 among women, abysmal numbers that are way off his pace of 41 percent of the female vote in 2016. Obviously he\u2019ll do better than 30 percent next November as some right-leaning women decide he\u2019s the lesser of two evils, but you can see why I thought yesterday that a third-party run by a woman candidate could be dangerous to him. If a Carly Fiorina type pulled more women voters from him than from the Democrat, it could cost him a second term. Fiorina says it won\u2019t be her, though, luckily for POTUS.", "description": "\"Internal polling looks great, the best ever!\"", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
