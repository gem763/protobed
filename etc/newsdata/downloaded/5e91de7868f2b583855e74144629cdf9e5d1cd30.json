Can you feel it?\u201d asked an expectant Fallon Snr, hoping his son had instantly connected to that invisible string through which flows the indefinable understanding between horse and jockey. \u201cFeel what, Dad?\u201d replied the son.\n\nIf he was not feeling it then, he is now.\n\nThis time 12 months ago, Fallon Jnr had just ridden his first winner. Now he is one shy of a half-century of winners for the turf season, and has a lead of seven over title rival Sean Davis going into the last five days of the season.", "description": "All things being equal, Cieren Fallon will be crowned champion apprentice jockey at Ascot\u2019s Qipco British Champions Day on Saturday, a remarkable feat given that, despite his name and racing heritage, he had never sat on a horse until two years ago.", "authors": ["Marcus Armytage", "Racing Correspondent", "Charlie Brooks"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000212998296-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZSjr1VTyGY1lPfWGN6AOYWmVn5oEANmp2vRNtImNJPw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
