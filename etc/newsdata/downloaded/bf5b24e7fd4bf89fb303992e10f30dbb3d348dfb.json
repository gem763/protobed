USA TODAY\n\nKelechi Osemele is no longer with the Jets. But his injury dispute with the team is not over.\n\nThe Jets announced Saturday that they released Osemele, a day after he had surgery on his right shoulder that the team did not authorize.\n\nThe dispute emerged eight days ago. Osemele said his shoulder injury was too severe to play through. The Jets, according to a source, believed that Osemele's injury was pre-existing and he could have waited to have surgery until after the season.\n\nThe Jets have been fining Osemele the maximum amount of $570,000 \u2014 his full game check \u2014 since the dispute emerged last week for conduct detrimental to the team, and could try to keep him from collecting the more than $5 million remaining on his contract.\n\nKelechi Osemele has not played for the New York Jets since Week 3. (Photo: AP)\n\nBut Osemele has filed a grievance against the team and his agent, Andrew Kessler, said in a statement Saturday that the veteran offensive lineman will seek his full pay for 2019.\n\n\"They owe him the balance of his contract both under the Standard Injury Guarantee Provision of the Player Contract and under Termination Pay,\" Kessler said in a stament.\" \"We will pursue through that and all Fines to be rescinded through Grievances.\u201d\n\nThe Jets have not commented on the Osemele situation and did not explain the release. They acquired Osemele earlier this year, in a trade with Oakland, in the hopes that he'd upgrade their offensive line depth. In the end, it was another failed trade from former GM Mike Maccagnan and a major headache for new GM Joe Douglas.\n\nOsemele has not played since Week 3 and said that he's incapable of playing through the pain caused by a torn labrum. He had surgery in Boston on Friday, and his agents told ESPN on Saturday that the damage to his shoulder was \"more extensive than anticipated. His representatives and NFLPA are now considering specific action against the Jets\u2019 team doctor for violations of State Medical Board Regulations.\"\n\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com.", "description": "After arguing against Jets' team doctors for weeks regarding the need for shoulder surgery, Kelechi Osemele was released on Saturday.", "authors": ["Andy Vasquez", "Published P.M.
