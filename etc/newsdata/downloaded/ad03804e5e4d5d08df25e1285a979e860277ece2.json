Subscribe here .\n\nI\u2019ve been banging on for a while now that Android tablets are done for and will be replaced \u2014 someday \u2014 by Chrome OS tablets. Over the past couple of years, it\u2019s gone from a weird theory that enraged Android partisans to conventional wisdom. This is despite some fairly decent, yet ultimately not very popular, Android tablet offerings from Huawei and Samsung.\n\nThat\u2019s all fine in theory \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s great, in theory. Chrome OS has the advantage of running a full, true desktop-class browser that is much more capable than Safari on an iPad (or even Edge on a Surface). Combining that power with Android applications and other conventional Android subsystem bits seems like it should be easy. And if you add in the fact that Chrome OS is already dominant in education markets, it\u2019s a slam dunk.\n\nSo this is supposed to be a review of the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, a tablet that was designed explicitly and exclusively for the education market. Acer and Google say teachers really wanted a tablet form factor for the classroom, and they really don\u2019t want to have to figure out how to manage an entirely new operating system when they\u2019re already all in on Chrome OS. And so here it is, finally: an honest-to-goodness Chrome OS tablet.\n\nHere\u2019s the review: it\u2019s a good thing you can\u2019t buy this tablet everywhere because you wouldn\u2019t love using it anywhere. For $330 apiece (hopefully less with bulk purchasing), schools will get a straightforward device that is guaranteed to work well with Google Docs and other web applications. They\u2019ll get the benefits of a tablet form factor without having to refactor their entire device management stack. It will run Android apps in a pinch and do some cool Google Expeditions AR stuff with its laughably bad cameras. It will come with a stylus docked in for drawing and marking things up.\n\nIt\u2019s about as good as any low-end Chromebook, but without a keyboard and costs more\n\nThe Acer Chromebook Tab 10 can do all those things, but it can\u2019t do too many of them at one time. With an underpowered Rockchip processor, it struggles to multitask. As a piece of hardware, it\u2019s thicker than you\u2019d think but also doesn\u2019t feel too precious. It feels durable; you can knock this thing around.\n\nCompared to other sub-$300 education Chromebooks, it\u2019s probably about on par. (But those devices have a keyboard.) I don\u2019t want to forgive this device\u2019s faults because it\u2019s \u201cjust for students,\u201d but I\u2019m also cognizant that it\u2019s much easier for a lot of schools to deploy this thing than the superior iPad.\n\nIt\u2019s not a consumer device, and it\u2019s not meant to be. So I wanted to use it for my own nefarious purposes: see if it offers a glimpse into what some future consumer Chrome OS tablet might be like. Unfortunately, what I saw is that the future is still awfully murky.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Chrome OS, you should know that there are three different tracks you can run Chrome OS on. There\u2019s \u201cStable,\u201d which is what most people should use. It\u2019s the build I mostly used while testing this device and coming to the conclusions you see above. Then there\u2019s \u201cBeta,\u201d which is a little on the edge but has been pretty solid for me. Lots of people run it to get slightly earlier access to new features. But because I wanted to see what the future of Chrome looks like, I also looked at the \u201cDeveloper\u201d build. Most people shouldn\u2019t do this. It\u2019s buggy and maybe a little less secure. Here be monsters.\n\nOn a tablet, Chrome OS looks and feels a lot like it does when you have a keyboard. There\u2019s a button to get to your apps, a task bar along the bottom, and a system menu in the lower-right corner. In the Developer build, you\u2019ll find more squarish tabs and a system menu that\u2019s been \u201cAndroid-ified,\u201d so it looks like the Quick Settings you\u2019d see on an Android phone.\n\nAndroid apps on Chrome OS have come a long way \u2014 they\u2019re good now\n\nBy default, all apps in Chrome OS go to full screen in tablet mode. Recently, however, split screen was rolled out. You tap the multitasking button on the lower right, drag one window to the left, then pick another open window to fill the right (or vice versa). You can then drag the divider to set up a one-third / two-thirds split screen if you like.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but it\u2019s the next steps that make this whole thing feel not quite baked. If you rotate the tablet 180 degrees, everything flips. So if you had a notepad open on the left and Chrome open on the right, when you flip it, the notepad ends up on the right. I found it disconcerting, but perhaps that\u2019s just a matter of it being different instead of it being broken. Different UX strokes for different OS folks.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t forgive is the lack of predictability when you hit the multitasking button a second time. When you do, it brings up all your open windows in half of the screen while leaving the other half \u201cdocked.\u201d Which half? Why, the half you \u201cdocked\u201d second, of course! Do you remember which is which?\n\nOne of the remarkable things about Chrome OS is how much insight we all get in its development through these developer builds. We\u2019re watching the sausage get made right before us \u2014 and sometimes eating it at the same time.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be too harsh on the lagginess I experienced because it\u2019s unfair to judge software that\u2019s still in development. But I did experience a lot, even on the more stable builds. That\u2019s a particularly egregious problem when there\u2019s no physical keyboard. If there\u2019s one thing that will drive a user crazy, it\u2019s input lag. And I saw much too much of that, even on the Stable build, which is what most educators will experience with this tablet. I also felt at times that I was struggling to hit buttons with my finger that would have been no problem if I had a mouse.\n\nChrome OS still works best with a keyboard\n\nThis experience of using a still-in-development operating system can mess with your head. It can color how you feel about it, especially when you run into bugs. I wonder if that\u2019s a particularly acute problem with Chrome OS, which struggled with Android apps through a prolonged beta period before they quietly slouched their way into some semblance of stability in the past year or so.\n\nThat extended period of weirdness didn\u2019t do the operating system\u2019s reputation any favors, which is too bad because the experience of using Android apps on a laptop is pretty good now. They still don\u2019t compete with full-fledged desktop or web-based apps, but they successfully do a thing that Microsoft has struggled with and Apple is just beginning to grapple with: transplant a vibrant mobile app ecosystem onto a desktop operating system.\n\nIt\u2019s such a good idea, in theory. But before Chrome OS can be ready for consumer tablets, it needs a little more practice.", "description": "Android tablets are on their way out, and everybody expects Chrome OS tablets to replace them.
