They were poisoned by a chemical weapon named VX.\n\nThe US hasn\u2019t been known to actively use VX in combat. In fact, it\u2019s begun destroying its stockpile of chemical munitions as part of a UN treaty. But it\u2019s just one of many strange and secretive experiments that happened within these walls. Experiments on sheep, mosquitoes, and even civilians.\n\nAbout 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City is the US government\u2019s top-secret bioweapons lab. It\u2019s called the Dugway Proving Ground. The 77-year-old facility covers about 800,000 acres. That\u2019s just a little larger than the entire state of Rhode Island. And it tests some of the deadliest chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive hazards on Earth.\n\nLess famous than Area 51, Dugway dates all the way back to 1942. Right in the middle of World War II.\n\nClip: The decisive battle of war has begun.\n\nNarrator: The government needed a large area to test powerful weapons, eventually settling on this stretch of land in the Utah desert. Back then, the site was used to test everything from chemical sprays and flamethrowers to various antidotes and protective equipment, and even fire-bombing.\n\nAfter World War II, Dugway mostly shut down. Until the Korean War began in 1950. That\u2019s when the proving ground turned into what it is today: a permanent military base. In Dugway\u2019s first few decades, the base worked mostly on offensive weaponry: biological and chemical munitions designed to directly attack enemies.\n\nClip: Sampling devices, positioned throughout the test area, yield valuable information to chemical core researchers.\n\nNarrator: The 1950s, for example, saw the launch of Operation Big Itch, an experiment that was testing weaponised fleas. The fleas weren\u2019t infected with any type of disease or agent, but experimenters were working with thousands of them. And the fleas were dropped in cluster bombs, to gauge if they would survive the fall from an aeroplane. And this was only part one. Dugway launched a second experiment, called Project Bellwether, in the 1960s. Only this time, mosquitoes were injected with inert diseases, inert bacteria, and inert viruses. But get this: Those mosquitoes were released upon several groups of human volunteers, who were bitten again and again during the trials.\n\nAnd there are records dating back to the late 1950s, which describe experiments that used infected mosquitoes. And those are just two experiments known to the public. Exactly what goes on at Dugway is, well, pretty unclear. And that\u2019s not by accident.\n\nThe area is intensely guarded. Everything that comes in and out is carefully monitored, guards are on constant patrol and actively armed, and the perimeter is lined with tall, barbed-wire fencing. There are even signs that authorise \u201cdeadly force\u201d when necessary.\n\nSince the 1940s, officials say operations have shifted from offensive to defensive tactics. Case in point, most of the current known work prepares agents to defend against potential biological and chemical attacks. For example, a multitude of training programs are held on-site for the armed forces.\n\nHere\u2019s one in which Army Reserve soldiers are tasked with checking the radiation levels of artillery rounds. And here\u2019s another where soldiers were tasked with identifying substances in a simulated chemical lab.\n\nDugway\u2019s main operations include the \u201cBRAUCH\u201d training facility, constructed from various shipping containers. It simulates underground environments for military training. There are also various buildings and rooms that serve specific purposes. Like the decontamination testing chamber, the wind-tunnel testing room, and the material test facility.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting room of all is this: the Smartman Laboratory facility, which houses the Smartman dummy, a model that\u2019s used to simulate human contact with chemical agents, including the infamous VX nerve agent. Specifically, the Smartman helps the lab develop more effective individual protection respiratory equipment,- essentially, gas masks and the like.\n\nA variety of chemists, chemical analysts, and technicians work on-site. And the use of airtight chambers and gas masks is not only common, but mandatory. Despite all of this dangerous experimentation, the work done at Dugway hasn\u2019t always been properly contained.\n\nRemember that sheep incident? That marked the start of a worrisome track record. It happened when overhead planes spewed out the nerve agent into the wind, accidentally sending it into nearby farmland in Skull Valley. Within the next couple of days, farmers found thousands of sheep dead in their fields. The Army compensated the farmers and lent them bulldozers to bury the sheep. But the accident sparked a whole debate on the use of chemical weapons in warfare.\n\nAdding on to these questionable practices, a 1994 Senate hearing on veterans\u2019 health focused specifically on Dugway veterans and civilians. A report found that people at Dugway were exposed to biological and chemical simulants believed to be safe at the time, but that the Army had later stopped using many of them because \u201cthey realised they were not as safe as previously believed.\u201d\n\nOne veteran, who was accidentally sprayed in the face with the chemical DMMP in 1984, found himself wheezing and coughing the next day \u2013 symptoms that ended up lasting several weeks. Despite this, he was given only cough medicine and antibiotics by the Dugway Army Hospital. The Dugway Safety Office assured him that the chemical was safe. But by 1988, officials at Dugway had reevaluated the simulant\u2019s danger and were concerned it could cause cancer and kidney damage.\n\nIn 2011, the facility slipped up again: It went on lockdown after workers lost a vial containing the VX nerve agent. Nobody was permitted to enter or exit the facility, not even the employees.\n\nAnd in 2016, the CDC and the Department of Defence launched a major investigation when a review team found that Dugway had been operating dangerously for several years without the government\u2019s knowledge. USA Today reported \u201cegregious failures\u201d by the facility\u2019s leadership and staff. The reports singled out the head colonel in command at Dugway, Brig. Gen. William King.\n\nThe Army\u2019s accountability investigation recognised King as unqualified, lacking the education and training to effectively oversee biosafety procedures crucial to Dugway\u2019s operation. The report admonished him, saying he \u201crepeatedly deflected blame\u201d and \u201cminimized the severity of incidents.\u201d It even says King \u201cfails to recognise\u201d how serious the incidents truly were. And how serious were the incidents, exactly? Well, under King\u2019s command, the facility mistakenly shipped live anthrax to other labs. And not just once, but multiple times. For over a decade.\n\nThat same report revealed that workers had been regularly and deliberately manipulating data in important records. Records meant to verify that pathogens being transported elsewhere were killed and safe for researchers to handle without protective gear. Still, the facility\u2019s shady past, secretive operations, and intense surveillance have captured the attention, and scepticism, of some closer observers, including several conspiracy-theorist groups.\n\nThere are suggestions that the facility is the \u201cnew Area 51.\u201d And the local community has raised their own questions about the facility\u2019s operations. Dugway was even featured in an episode of The History Channel\u2019s \u201cUFO Hunters,\u201d in which local residents and UFO watchers were interviewed and footage from the area was examined. It\u2019s hard not to wonder, when you live in close proximity to such a restricted landscape.\n\nDespite these theories, Dugway has expressed a desire to be \u201cmore transparent.\u201d And representatives have said the facility wants to be \u201cmore a part of the local community\u201d by better informing citizens about what exactly goes on there. So far, they have delivered some on that. The facility has its own events page, which lists several events open to the general public and the local Utah community. This year, they\u2019re hosting a trail race on the facility grounds.\n\nCertainly, today\u2019s Dugway is a far cry from the 1940s Dugway, which was entirely closed off to the public. But despite the shift in the level of secrecy, much of Dugway\u2019s testing remains classified, preserving the scepticism and mysteriousness surrounding the facility.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
