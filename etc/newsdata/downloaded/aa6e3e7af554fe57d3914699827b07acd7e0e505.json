That avoided a costly investor roadshow and the challenge of selling shares in such a company likely to be perceived as high risk by many.\n\nThe new entity climbed 5.1% to $12.40 at 12:34 p.m. in New York on Monday, its first day trading under the ticker SPCE. The shares rose 11% Friday after the combination was completed, handing Virgin Galactic more than $450 million in primary proceeds. The free float comprises about 40% of total stock, with the rest owned by Branson and backers from Abu Dhabi.\n\nVirgin Galactic is one of a trio of billionaire-backed space startups, each tapping different technologies. Branson is using an aircraft to carry a spaceship to high altitudes, where it blasts away. Blue Origin, controlled by Amazon.com Inc. founder Bezos, relies on more-conventional rockets. Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. deploys reusable launchers.\n\nWhile transporting satellites has been a focus for SpaceX, Branson is chasing the tourism market, planning a first commercial flight next year. Blue Origin plans to take payloads and tourists to the edge of space on an 11-minute flight, while Musk has pledged to send passengers to the moon, Mars and beyond.\n\nBranson said last week that Virgin Galactic also is interested in developing hypersonic airline flights after Boeing Co.\u2019s future-technologies arm pledged $20 million for a minority stake. That could mean linking U.S. cities in a matter of minutes and, ultimately, the U.S. and U.K. with Australia in just a few hours.\n\nSocial Capital Hedosophia founder, Sri Lanka-born Chamath Palihapitiya, will contribute $100 million to the venture and become its chairman. Virgin Galactic has raised more than $1 billion since it was founded in 2004, initially from Branson, with an Abu Dhabi investment company taking a stake in 2010.\n\n(An earlier version of this story was corrected to show the market value based on company comment.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Jasper in London at cjasper@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net, Brendan Case, Tony Robinson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. became the first space-tourism business to go public as it began trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.The listing, carried out through a merger with shell investment company that was already trading, secures vital new funding for", "authors": ["Christopher Jasper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
