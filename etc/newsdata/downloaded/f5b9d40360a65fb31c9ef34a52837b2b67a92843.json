Chicago racked up some 450 murders that year.\n\nBut the 9-year-old\u2019s murder stood out for its brutality. \u201cAn act of barbarism,\u201d then-Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said at the time.\n\nWhat sort of person, Chicagoans wondered, would be vicious enough, pathological enough and depraved enough to lure a child from a basketball court, shoot him in the head and leave him to die in an alley? All allegedly because of a gang rivalry and retribution for another murder?\n\nEditorials\n\nEvery weekend\u2019s count of shootings and homicides provides fresh evidence of our city\u2019s plague of gun violence.\n\nTyshawn\u2019s murder reminds us of the worst that can happen when that violence spirals out of control. He was shot at close range \u2014 close enough to leave gunpowder residue on his face.\n\nProsecutors at the Leighton Criminal Courts Building began making their case Tuesday in the trials of Dwright Boone-Doty and Corey Morgan, the reputed gang members accused of murdering Tyshawn.\n\nEventually, jurors will weigh the evidence for and against their guilt and do their best to render justice.\n\nOne trial will end. The fight against gun violence must go on.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot recently took a step in that direction by creating a new Office of Public Safety to focus on reducing violent crime.\n\nEveryone in the new office should remember Tyshawn.\n\nHouse Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, took a step, too, by announcing a new, bipartisan House Firearms Public Awareness Task Force to determine whether state laws should be changed to help curb gun violence. The task force will also examine bond reform and the role, if any, that it plays in fueling gun violence.\n\nThose task force members should remember Tyshawn.\n\nMayor Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle must put aside their differences and work to create a more peaceful city. Both of them should remember Tyshawn.\n\nEvery victim of gun violence deserves to be remembered, of course.\n\nBut especially a 9-year-old, playing in a park.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.", "description": "Tyshawn Lee\u2019s murder reminds us of the worst that can happen when gun violence spirals out of control.", "authors": ["Cst Editorial Board", "David Struett", "Sun-Times Wire", "Abigail Van Buren", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI3E6ktfJkYKRBTLsN9Ey1uA-d8=/0x247:2992x1813/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208616/tyshawn_111115_30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
