She said it\u2019s \u201cexactly the fight\u201d she wanted, and could barely contain her excitement when speaking about it.\n\nFor a good while, Barber has been touted as someone with massive potential. She carries the nickname \u201cThe Future,\u201d but Robertson plans to bring a reality check. The Canadian considers herself a major step up in competition for Barber, and plans on finding out how good she really is.\n\n\u201cI feel like she needs to be tested and I\u2019m really that first test she\u2019s had in the UFC,\u201d Robertson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at Wednesday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 media day. \u201cI feel like my fighting skills speak more than her\u2019s do. I feel like she hasn\u2019t been tested by tough opponents. This is my (sixth) fight in the UFC, this is her third. I really feel like this is the first time she\u2019s going to get tested.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN 6 takes place at TD Garden. The entire event airs on ESPN2, with Robertson vs. Barber set for the main card.\n\nFrom early on, Barber has been identified as someone with a bright future. The often-reserved Robertson said she feels somewhat overlooked in that regard despite more UFC wins and finishes, but she sees UFC on ESPN 6 as the moment the narrative changes.\n\n\u201cI think her mouth gets her a lot of places,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cI feel like she talks herself out there, which I\u2019m not saying is a bad thing. Good for her, she\u2019s getting her name out there, but I feel like I deserve that spot.\u201d\n\nRobertson said she thinks Barber\u2019s past opponents have been largely one-dimensional, whereas she is \u201clethal from everywhere.\u201d She\u2019s been focused on sharpening those weapons in the lead-up to fight night, and questions whether Barber has had that attention to detail.\n\nBarber has made a lot of noise about a future matchup with Paige VanZant ahead of Friday\u2019s event, and Robertson said she feels somewhat slighted.\n\n\u201cI 100 percent feel she\u2019s overlooking me,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAll I\u2019ve heard about is Paige VanZant this camp. Like, talk (expletive) about the person you\u2019ve got a contract with, not some random girl that doesn\u2019t mean anything right now. Paige is just making her comeback and you\u2019ve got an important fight in front of you Friday, so focus on that.\u201d", "description": "Gillian Robertson doesn't think Maycee Barber is giving her the appropriate amount of respect going into UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Blue Corner", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gillian-robertson-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
