The judge set bail at $500,000 each.\n\nThe congressman was ordered to surrender his diplomatic passport. All three men were ordered to surrender firearms to local authorities.\n\nCollins orginally denied the charges brought against him.\n\n\"I believe I acted properly and within the law at all times with regard to my affiliation with Innate,\" Collins said at the time. \"The charges that have been levied against me are meritless.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.
