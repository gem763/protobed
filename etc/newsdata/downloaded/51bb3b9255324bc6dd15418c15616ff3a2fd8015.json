It Leaves a Giant Void for Democrats on Impeachment.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings\u2019 death is an emotional blow to his Democratic congressional colleagues who, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, saw him as \"our North Star.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether it\u2019s a loss for their impeachment efforts as well.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat was at the center of nearly every major House investigation into the Trump administration, and he chaired one of the four committees responsible for investigating whether President Trump committed impeachable offenses by pressuring Ukraine to do his political bidding. Cummings\u2019 sharp legal mind, moral heft, and ability to work across the aisle may be impossible to replace.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this such a big blow is that there is just no replacement for Elijah Cummings,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.), who serves on the House Oversight Committee, told VICE News Friday morning. \u201cThis is a very, very sensitive and intense time. We're not just talking about picking a new chair in-between two terms. We're talking about who can carry this in the middle of the impeachment proceedings. This is the time for oversight.\u201d\n\nStill reeling from their longtime colleague\u2019s death Thursday morning, Democrats have yet to grapple any plan to fill Cummings\u2019 huge shoes. Democrats on the committee were in mourning Thursday and Friday after his sudden death, and most weren\u2019t ready to discuss next steps publicly.\n\nCummings has been fighting health issues for years, and he came back from the last congressional recess with an oxygen tank. But he\u2019d continued to work up until the end and participated in committee phone calls as recently as last Friday. Even his closest allies were stunned at his death.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), one of Cummings\u2019 closest friends on the committee, was too emotional to speak as he entered the Capitol on Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to absorb this loss, which is a great loss\u201d\n\n\"I can't talk about it,\u201d he said, his voice quavering as he choked back tears. \u201cHe's been sick.\u201d\n\n\n\nConnolly was more composed later in the day \u2014 but batted away questions about who might head the committee in the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into that. Today is a day for Elijah Cummings. I\u2019m not going to discuss what happens,\u201d he said Thursday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to absorb this loss, which is a great loss.\u201d\n\nHouse leadership hasn\u2019t announced when it will happen, but at some point soon the full House Democratic caucus will take a vote on who should be the next chairman of the powerful committee.\n\nCommittee members say Connolly would be one of the two most likely Democrats to fill Cummings\u2019 role. A close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and a loquacious speaker with a strong political sense, he chaired the committee while Cummings was out battling health issues for a few months last year.\n\nThe other person Democrats say would have a strong shot is Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). She is now the acting chair based on her seniority on the committee, has chaired other committees, is well liked by her peers and has a history of effectively reaching across the aisle.\n\nRead: The White House Just Admitted That There Was a Quid Pro Quo With Ukraine. What the Hell Happens Now?\n\nBut some members privately raised concerns about whether the mild-mannered congresswoman had the fighting instinct necessary to chair a committee that will be in the national spotlight in the coming months. Some also worried that having three of the four committees involved in impeachment headed by New York City members was too much, since the Foreign Affairs Committee is headed by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and the Judiciary Committee is run by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cLook at the ranking minority member,\u201d one committee Democrat told VICE News, referring to the pugnacious Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). \u201cWho best is capable of taking that person on?\u201d\n\nNeither member was ready to discuss whether they would consider running for the chairmanship, however. And most of Cummings\u2019 former committee colleagues were in the same boat, grappling with the loss of a friend and hero.\n\n\u201cIt's a devastating loss. For me personally, he was a mentor and someone with unmatched integrity, someone who I, who I and others should forever try to emulate,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who blinked back tears as she discussed her longtime colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of loss that you\u2019re not sure can be replaced. For his community, for his colleagues. At a time when integrity and values and patriotism are in short supply this loss is felt even more deeply.\u201d\n\nThe other senior members on the committee seem less likely to run. Reps. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) and Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) aren\u2019t favorites of House leadership. Few on the committee expected that Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) would run. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the second-most senior Democrat on the Committee, told VICE News that she wouldn\u2019t run against Maloney but would \u201cconsider\u201d a bid if Maloney opted not to run.\n\nStill, whoever Democrats choose, they know how crucial it is to find the right person to replace Cummings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) told VICE News Friday morning. \u201cOversight is playing an important role [on impeachment]. You need a chairperson who is both a capable legislator but also someone who can run an investigation.\u201d\n\nGreg Walters contributed reporting to this story.\n\nCover: Rep.
