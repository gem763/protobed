John Swinney, the education secretary, told Holyrood he had now scrapped it entirely.\n\nTwo days ago, Jeane Freeman, the health secretary, announced an independent public inquiry into the handling of contracts to build the Queen Elizabeth super-hospital in Glasgow, where two children died earlier this year, and the new Royal Hospital for Sick Children, which will open several years late next year.\n\nWith both measures, the temporary pain of a climbdown neutralises two potentially damaging lines of opposition attack in an election.", "description": "Rolling coverage of the day\u2019s political developments as they happen, including the final day of the supreme court hearing to determine if Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension of parliament was lawful", "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow", "Severin Carrell", "Lisa O'Carroll", "Shaun Walker", "Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32e6b4e63bc17017207cdd86fb3138abfc5111d1/0_171_4772_2862/master/4772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9786406f6eabcd7c36ec2643690f80c4"}
