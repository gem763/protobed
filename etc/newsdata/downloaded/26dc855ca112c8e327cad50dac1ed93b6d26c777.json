Trump\u2019s twist makes these all the sweeter for conservatives because they pretend to address problems Democrats care about, like providing affordable housing and creating good jobs for the people who live in low-income communities. The results to date show that the outcomes are more likely to be luxury apartments and sparse jobs, not affordable housing and employment opportunities.\n\nHere are the basics: Investments in politically designated (not market-defined) opportunity zones in all 50 states are tax-advantaged (investors pay less, little or no taxes on their capital gains depending on their stakes). There is a scant and inadequate legal framework for what is and is not acceptable under the program, and nothing in the law or the regulations that implement it require investment managers to care about the communities they are investing in.\n\nRead: How to invest in real estate and pay nothing in capital gains\n\nAs a result, investors \u2014 particularly very wealthy investors \u2014 love it. Many \u201care poised to reap billions in untaxed profits on high-end apartment buildings and hotels in trendy neighborhoods, storage facilities that employ only a handful of workers or student housing in bustling college towns,\u201d reports David Yaffe-Bellany of the New York Times.\n\nFollow the CDFI Fund approach instead\n\nThe Trump administration has chosen to bypass an unusually successful model that is already in place and puts under-resourced communities\u2019 needs first. It\u2019s called the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Operated by the Treasury Department, the CDFI Fund uses strict selection criteria for fund managers (known as Community Development Financial Institutions) that work for and not against the communities they serve based on market expertise.\n\nA typical CDFI borrower is an affordable housing developer, a small business owned by an entrepreneur of color, or a child-care facility that is critical to its community but difficult for mainstream banks and others to finance. Almost by definition, CDFI investments are low-profile. It\u2019s impossible to point to one that everyone knows, but the residents of Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota could not live and work without a CDFI, and residents of supportive housing in scores of cities are benefiting from them every day.\n\nData released in June shows the $185 billion CDFI industry has financed \u2014 in low-income and low-wealth markets \u2014 more than 1.3 million jobs, 300,000 businesses, 2 million affordable housing units, and 11,000 child care and other community facilities. Their financial results since 1995 are comparable to mainstream banks.\n\nUnfortunately the CDFI Fund has only a small, passive hand in the administration of opportunity zones but no voice.\n\nThat makes it all the more disappointing that the president labeled Opportunity Zones the \u201chottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment and job creation in distressed communities,\u201d according to the New York Times. As with so many other Trump statements, the opposite is true.\n\nAnd it does not take much looking to see what\u2019s really going on. The Times named four very wealthy Trump allies who are reaping what he has sowed: Anthony Scaramucci (former White House communications director), Richard LeFrak (a \u201clongtime confidante of Mr. Trump\u2019s\u201d), Chris Christie (Trump\u2019s buddy), and the Kushner family (Trump\u2019s son-in-law and his billionaire family) all are cashing in by creating funds, making investments, or using the tax-advantaged (and therefore lower-cost) financing for their projects.\n\nGee. Is anyone surprised?\n\nSam Mestrich, left, and Mark A. Pinsky\n\nMost of the people living, working and struggling in designated opportunity zones will see little if any benefits. \u201c[I]n booming cities like Denver,\u201d concludes an analysis by Sophie Quinton for Pew Charitable Trusts, \u201cthe federal government may end up spending more money on tax relief for pricey apartment buildings, offices and hotels than on tax relief for community-focused but less profitable assets, such as affordable housing.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, this new tax break reduces government revenue, leaving less for efforts that really do address those problems.\n\nApplying the CDFI Fund\u2019s approach to opportunity zones would transform them without requiring fresh Congressional action.\n\nCDFIs enjoy broad, near-unanimous bipartisan support in Washington, D.C., and in many states. They combine private means and public purpose. And CDFIs have earned surprising support from Wall Street and Main Street. Investors \u2014 including Goldman Sachs GS, -0.20%, Bank of America BAC, -0.21% and a growing number of others \u2014 are putting steadily increasing amounts into CDFIs. Bank of America alone \u2014 the largest CDFI investor \u2014 has more than $1 billion invested.\n\nFixing what is wrong with opportunity zones is not as difficult as fixing what goes wrong when wealth holders are incentivized to reward themselves at the expense of the people and communities they are supposed to be helping. What is legal is not always laudable.\n\nMark A. Pinsky is a financial professional, writer, organizer, and president of Five/Four Advisors.
