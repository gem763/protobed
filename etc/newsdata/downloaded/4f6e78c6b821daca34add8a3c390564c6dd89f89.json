(Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\nYou might think that pugs are the most adorable dogs going, but not be able to finance the care that may come with having a brachycephalic pet. You may want a dog similar to the German Shepherd your nana had, but are unable to accommodate the huge amounts of activity you need. Chihuahuas might be your favourite dog to watch videos of online, but you have to leave your pup at home during the day which is at odds with their needy nature.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s about understanding that any dog you get will be a brand new household companion and has a mind of its own. They\u2019re not there for your entertainment, and have a wide variety of specific needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, get to grips with that beforehand in the form of a doggy date, and you can ensure you\u2019ll have a long and happy pairing.\n\nYou can find out more about the right breeds for you on the Blue Cross website.\n\nQuestions to ask (about) your dog\n\nDo you prefer long walks on the beach or cosy nights in?\n\nWhat hobbies do you have?\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for another needy relationship, how much attention do you need?\n\nWhat sets you apart from all these other studs?\n\nI can\u2019t deal with a pup who takes longer in the bathroom than me\u2026 What\u2019s your grooming routine?\n\nAre you a fussy eater?\n\nThey say you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks, do you think this is true?\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite toy?\n\nAnger issues are a no from me. Can you promise our postman will be safe?\n\nWould you say you\u2019re more of a social butterfly or a lone wolf?\n\nThe dog park\u2026 Come here often?\n\nDoes it bother you that I\u2019m a cat person, or could you learn to live with it (the cat, that is)?\n\nYou won\u2019t go crazy and start chewing everything whenever I leave the house will you?\n\nAre you a crier?\n\nWe may only be on our first date but I need to know, how do you feel about kids?\n\nAnd what about road trips?\n\nAre you food motivated?\n\nWhere do you sleep at night time? And how do you feel about snuggles?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: 6 easy scary, funny and rude pumpkin carving ideas for Halloween 2019\n\nMORE: KFC is selling an 80-piece popcorn chicken bucket for less than \u00a36\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "the Blue Cross organised Fur-st Dates, an event to show that you really need to know the breed of dog you're rescuing.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-402c_1572013747.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
