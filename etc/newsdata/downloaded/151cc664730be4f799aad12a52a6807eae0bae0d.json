He relied on 17 players, and his managing underscored the reality of his team. It is top-heavy, so he limited the exposure of his weakest link \u2014 the front end of the bullpen \u2014 by experimenting with extremes to give his best pitchers the most innings. He stitched together outs with the two relievers he trusted, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson, as well as one of the other starters from his high-paid, high-performing rotation.\n\nThe starters are this roster\u2019s backbone, and now they\u2019re a key to why the Nationals once-historically bad bullpen has transformed into a strength this postseason (22\u2153 innings, 0.81 ERA, excluding Games 1 and 3 of the National League Division Series).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis drastic tactic is reminiscent of the 2018 Boston Red Sox, and Martinez signaled he would deploy it in the NL wild-card game. He used his two best pitchers, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg (in his first career relief appearance), to plow through 24 outs. The strategy only seemed viable in a one-game playoff \u2014 starters need rest, right? \u2014 until Martinez doubled-down in Game 2 of the NLDS. He surprised the Los Angeles Dodgers by tapping Scherzer to hold a two-run lead in the eighth. His perfect inning helped send the series back to Washington tied at 1 and set the team\u2019s template for the rest of the playoffs.\n\nThe thought process behind starters-as-relievers was simple: The best pitcher available in the moment should take the mound and give the team the best chance to win. The strategy might have strained those arms if they had been asked to cover too many innings. But they never were, because the starters stayed dominant at their day jobs.\n\nFrom Game 4 of the NLDS to Game 3 of the NL Championship Series \u2014 the Nationals\u2019 most critical stretch of the season as they staved off elimination in one series and built an insurmountable lead in another \u2014 the rotation dominated. Those outings: seven innings, one run; six innings, three runs; 7\u2154 innings, no runs; seven innings, no runs; seven innings, no runs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose showings bridged the dangerous middle innings and handed the relievers a small lead to protect with a reasonable number of outs left. The one night the Nationals didn\u2019t have both trusted relievers \u2014 Hudson missed Game 1 of the NLCS to be with his wife for the birth of their third child \u2014 fourth starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez carried a no-hitter for 23 outs before Doolittle secured the final four.\n\nEven when the strategy failed \u2014 starter Patrick Corbin allowed six runs in two-thirds of an inning in relief during Game 3 of the NLDS \u2014 Martinez stuck with it. He went back to Corbin in Game 5, and the left-hander rewarded him with 1\u2153 scoreless innings.\n\nThe Nationals have recorded 219 outs in their eight wins, and 208 have come from the team\u2019s top six pitchers (four starters, two relievers). The other 11 came from two relievers: Tanner Rainey (eight), a hard-throwing right-hander Martinez is gaining trust in, and veteran Fernando Rodney (three) at the end of a blowout win.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals maintain this strategy in the lineup. Their bench isn\u2019t a weakness, but they don\u2019t pinch-hit often (outside the pitcher\u2019s spot twice in 10 games). The starters\u2019 dominant outings have prioritized keeping them in the game, and the team wants its best hitters taking the most at-bats. The Nationals only really have two situational, late-game moves: Brian Dozier replacing Howie Kendrick at second base for defense and, now that center fielder Victor Robles has returned from his right hamstring strain, Michael A. Taylor entering the game as a pinch runner and defensive replacement. The other three reserves \u2014 outfielder Gerardo Parra, first baseman Matt Adams and infielder Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera \u2014 are mainly pinch hitters who have each pinch-hit three times this postseason.\n\nIf situations get out of hand, as they did in Games 1 and 3 of the NLDS, the Nationals\u2019 approach shifts. The deficits grew too sizable to stopgap with elite arms, so the Nationals used the front end of the bullpen, the relievers Martinez otherwise shies away from. In the World Series, this probably means Austin Voth, Javy Guerra and Roenis El\u00edas (none of whom appeared in the NLCS), plus Rodney. Martinez used Cabrera at second to finish that Game 3, too, to keep the former starting second baseman in rhythm.\n\nBut this situational tinkering only underlines the truth of October. Postseason play prioritizes the top of the roster. This favors one like that of the Nationals, and Martinez won\u2019t forget that. Perhaps the most telling example came in Game 2 of the NLCS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals held a 3-1 lead headed into the ninth inning, with the game going exactly according to plan. Scherzer dealt for seven innings, and Doolittle navigated around a one-run double in the eighth. Martinez didn\u2019t want to send Doolittle back out because he had thrown 21 pitches, but he wanted a left-hander to face the Cardinals\u2019 Kolten Wong, a left-hander who is effective against right-handers. Wong was dangerous if he reached base, as evidenced by his walk and steal of second base earlier in the game.\n\nMartinez called in his only other viable southpaw, Corbin. The move might have seemed over-aggressive \u2014 Corbin was due to start Game 4 \u2014 but it worked. Wong bounced out to second. Hudson entered and retired the next two batters, and the same strategy they had used to avoid a 2-0 deficit in the NLDS now gave them a 2-0 lead in the NLCS. It\u2019s an approach they wouldn\u2019t mind repeating.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington's improved bullpen and timely hits are coming because Manager Dave Martinez has shrunk the roster.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Os_jOrM6XFSgK5286xBNhB8j4FU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5WD4HV654I6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
