Seoul houses giants such as Samsung and LG, and its startup ecosystem is seeing amazing growth. The city\u2019s food culture is also to die for (I mean, who doesn\u2019t love kimchi?), so it\u2019s the perfect place to check out innovation in the food industry.\n\nWatch the video above and follow TNW\u2018s trip to Seoul where we visited the kitchens at Seoul Startup Hub and the robot restaurant, Merry Go Kitchen.\n\nThe hub\u2019s kitchens are not your typical corporate cafeteria backend, as it\u2019s actually a high-tech food startup incubator. Then tag along to check out Woowa Brothers\u2019 experimental robot-service project at Merry Go Kitchen (their robot is really cute).\n\nWant to see more videos from Seoul? Check out how Seoul will become one of the world\u2019s best startup cities.", "description": "TNW visited Seoul Startup Hub where the cafeteria is its very own food startup incubator, and then we checked out Merry Go Kitchen's robot waiters.", "authors": ["M\u00e1r M\u00e1sson Maack"], "top_image": "https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/10/image.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
