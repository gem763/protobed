According to China, the ranking system seeks to reinforce the notion that \"keeping trust is glorious and breaking trust is disgraceful.\"\n\nThe plan, which has already been implemented in some cities, will be fully implemented in 2020. Blocking the sidewalk, jaywalking, fare evasion, and even loitering can lower your social credit score.
