(AP) - The Patriots have signed tight ends Ben Watson and Eric Tomlinson and released quarterback Cody Kessler.\n\nNew England announced the moves on Tuesday. Watson rejoins the team less than a week after being released. Tomlinson joins the Patriots after stints with the Eagles, Texans, Jets and Giants. He played three games with the Giants this season before being released last month.\n\nThe signings of Watson and Tomlinson come after tight end Matt LaCosse injured his knee during the Patriots\u2019 win over the Giants on Thursday.\n\nWatson was a surprise cut last week. He became eligible to make his season debut just days earlier after serving a four-game suspension for a positive banned substance test following the 2018 season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Patriots have signed tight ends Ben Watson and Eric Tomlinson and released quarterback Cody Kessler.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
