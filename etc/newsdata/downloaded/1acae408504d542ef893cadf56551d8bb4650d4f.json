They arrested her and put the girl in jail.\n\n\u2018But there was nothing on her, so in order not to look totally stupid they gave her, fixed her up, with an 18-month sentence to show that she was guilty of something.\u2019\n\nThe Russian Embassy in the United States tweeted on Friday that \u2018more and more\u2019 US politicians \u2018understand the absurdity of the charges made against her\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
