The Townhall Media family is going to Disqus.\n\nInstead of going back to Facebook comments which you all despised, we are going to a new platform that was requested many times, Disqus. You\u2019ll be able to block trolls and have the comment features you want.\n\nIf you have any issues signing up for Disqus, email [email protected].\n\nThank you for being loyal readers of HotAir, we love you all.", "description": "After rolling out the new commenting system for HotAir recently, and after receiving all of your much-needed, honest feedback on the Spot.IM...", "authors": ["Hot Air Staff", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HotAir.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
