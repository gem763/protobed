GRAPHIC-Global spare oil capacity in U.S. hands after Saudi outage\n\n* OPEC oil production: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LArZY3\n\n* U.S. oil production: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVVEiv\n\n* OPEC spare capacity (EIA): https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVkYFd\n\nLONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - An attack on Saudi oil\n\nfacilities on Saturday is believed to have disrupted half the\n\ncountry's production capacity, making the United States the only\n\nreal holder of the global supply cushion via its ability to\n\nraise own output or to soften sanctions against other major oil\n\nproducers.\n\nSaudi Arabia has yet to comment on the extent of damage on\n\nits oil production but industry sources have said some 5-6\n\nmillion barrels per day (bpd) or 5-6% of global supply have been\n\naffected. Saudi Arabia, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\n\nCountries' de-facto leader and largest producer, has been long\n\nseen as the custodian of the world's spare oil capacity.\n\nSpare capacity is the extra oil a producing country can\n\nbring onstream and sustain at short notice, providing global\n\nmarkets with a cushion in the event of natural disaster,\n\nconflict or any other cause of an unplanned supply outage.\n\nIndustry sources have said Saudi Arabia will be able to\n\nrestore supply within days. A prolonged supply outage will have\n\na major bullish impact on oil prices, which in turn will spur\n\nfurther gains in U.S. shale production.\n\nThe United States has briefly overtaken Saudi Arabia as the\n\nworld largest crude exporter this year, only a few years after\n\nremoving a ban on oil exports because of large needs at home as\n\nthe world's largest oil consumer.\n\nAnalysts have repeatedly underestimated U.S. output growth\n\ngains with the country now producing around 15% of global\n\nsupply.\n\nBesides the United States, the only countries which have\n\nsignificant spare capacity are Iran and Venezuela.\n\nBoth are subject to U.S. sanctions and have seen their\n\nexports reduced to a trickle over the past year as U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has tightened sanctions.\n\nIran has seen its exports falling by over 2 million bpd\n\nsince the sanctions have been imposed and Venezuela have seen\n\nits exports plummeting too.\n\nWhile analysts expect Venezuelan production to more or less\n\nstabilise at current levels of around 700,000-800,000 bpd for\n\nthe rest of the year, Iranian oil production is forecast to fall\n\nfurther.\n\nEnergy Aspects has said it expects OPEC spare capacity to\n\nfall to below 1 million bpd in the fourth quarter from two\n\nmillion bpd in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nWILDCARDS\n\nOPEC member Libya is in the middle of a civil war, which\n\nthreatens its ability to continue pumping oil. Another big\n\nLibyan disruption would add to the shocks and highlight the\n\nspare capacity problem.\n\nNigerian exports have also suffered big from disruptions.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. crude oil production is expected to rise to\n\nnew records.\n\nHowever, large U.S. crude output gains and slowing global\n\ndemand because of a weaker global economy have contributed to a\n\nrise in oil stocks worldwide.\n\nThe International Energy Agency, which coordinates energy\n\npolicies of industrialised nations, said on Saturday the markets\n\nwere still well supplies despite the Saudi disruptions.\n\n\"We are massively oversupplied,\" said Christyan Malek, head\n\nof oil and gas research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at\n\nJ.P. Morgan, adding it would take five months of a 5 million-bpd\n\noutage to take global crude supply levels back to a 40-year\n\nnormal average.\n\n\"Having said that, this attack introduces a new,\n\nirreversible risk premium into the market,\" he added.\n\nOPEC Oil Production https://tmsnrt.rs/2LArZY3\n\nOPEC Oil Production png https://tmsnrt.rs/2VXGPMh\n\nU.S. Oil Production https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVVEiv\n\nU.S. Oil Production png https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wzk9yX\n\nSpare Capacity -GS https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wz3H1H\n\nOPEC oil production capacity interactive https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVkYFd\n\nOPEC oil production capacity png https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVl0wP\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Reportin by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ron Bousso; Writing by\n\nDmitry Zhdannikov;\n\nEditing by Marguerita Choy)", "description": "GRAPHIC-Global spare oil capacity in U.S. hands after Saudi outage", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBT0BW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
