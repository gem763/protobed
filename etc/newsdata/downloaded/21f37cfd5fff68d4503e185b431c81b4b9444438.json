As with any fried rice, you can add raw or cooked vegetables according to what you have on hand (though you\u2019ll want to add cooked vegetables a little later in the cooking process). If you don\u2019t have brussels sprouts, you could use any type of cabbage. Broccoli or cauliflower would be great substitutes for broccolini, and butternut squash can replace the carrots. The fried egg on top makes it feel like a more substantial meal, but you can leave it out for a lighter dinner. If you are a vegetarian, leave out the sausage, or add some smoked tofu. The dish is endlessly customizable.", "description": "This crunchy, tasty, not-really-fried rice gets a big umami punch from gochujang, the fermented Korean red-pepper paste that\u2019s worth keeping in your fridge to perk up all sorts of dishes As with any fried rice, you can add raw or cooked vegetables according to what you have on hand (though you\u2019ll want to add cooked vegetables a little later in the cooking process) If you don\u2019t have brussels sprouts, you could use any type of cabbage", "authors": ["Susan Spungen", "Alison Roman", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell", "Kiera Wright-Ruiz", "Sam Sifton", "Jennifer Steinhauer", "Sarah Digregorio", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/dining/ss-fried-rice/ss-fried-rice-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
