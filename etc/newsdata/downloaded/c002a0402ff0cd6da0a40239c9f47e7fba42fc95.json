Because as a bigger woman, it always made me feel bad about my body,\u201d tweeted one person. \u201c@SavageXFenty and @rihanna changed that today\u2026 someone finally gets it. Bravo to this team of amazing people.\u201d\n\nAnother added: \u201cReal women with REAL women bodies were in the show and I LOVE that. Show these girls it\u2019s okay to have different bodies and stop letting society tell you different.\u201d\n\nThe show also featured models with disabilities, prompting fans to label Rihanna the \u201cqueen of diversity\u201d.\n\n\u201cRihanna had somebody with AMPUTATED LEGS walking her show. Queen of inclusiveness,\u201d tweeted one person.\n\nComparisons to Victoria\u2019s Secret came in thick and fast, with many people describing Savage x Fenty as \u201cway cooler\u201d and putting the former to shame.\n\n\u201cAfter watching this Savage x Fenty fashion show I never want to see another Victoria\u2019s Secret one again,\u201d tweeted one person.\n\nAnother added: \u201cThe Victoria\u2019s Secret show seems to be about men looking at beautiful women. Savage x Fenty show seems to be about women feeling beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe Victoria\u2019s Secret Show, which Rihanna performed at in 2012, has been dogged by controversy in recent months. In August, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer,. Ed Razek resigned almost one year after he was vilified for saying that Victoria\u2019s Secret would never cast transgender models in its runway show because the event is a \u201cfantasy\u201d.\n\nRazek made the comments in an interview with US Vogue last November, stating: \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don\u2019t think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Jan Singer, the brand\u2019s female CEO at the time, left the company shortly after the Vogue interview was published.\n\nThe show usually takes place every year in November, but it\u2019s unclear whether 2019\u2019s event will go ahead. Earlier this summer, Victoria\u2019s Secret model Shanina Shaik claimed it would not be happening this year.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the Victoria\u2019s Secret show won\u2019t be happening this year,\u201d she told Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m not used to because every year around this time I\u2019m training like an angel.\u201d", "description": "After weeks of anticipation, fans can finally watch\u00a0Rihanna\u2019s Savage x Fenty show from New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/10/gettyimages-1169782996.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
