When Klay Thompson was blocked at the rim by the Raptors\u2019 Danny Green in game 6 of the NBA finals, it was clear that something was seriously wrong from the moment he landed awkwardly. You could see from Steph Curry\u2019s anguished pounding of the ball into the floor and the ashen looks on the face of fans in the stands of the Oracle Arena, where the Golden State Warriors were grimly hanging on to their title against Toronto.\n\nIncredibly, Thompson came back out to shoot \u2013 and score \u2013 both free throws. That was his last contribution and the banged-up Warriors, with Kevin Durant having ruptured his Achilles tendon in game 3, had run out of miracles as the title went to Canada for the first time in the league\u2019s history.\n\nWhat it did show was that the team who won three out of the previous four titles retain that champion grit, even if they face a transitional season after a slew of important departures. Those include star forward Durant (to the Brooklyn Nets) and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, traded to Memphis to make cap space for the arrival of D\u2019Angelo Russell, brought in from Brooklyn in a sign-and-trade to salvage something from Durant\u2019s exit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nStill, it does have the feeling of a dynasty being over. Tipping a title favourite in the last couple of seasons was an exercise in futility \u2013 the Warriors weren\u2019t just the best, they were one of the best of all time. Now that the playing field has been dramatically levelled, the only thing we can be sure of is that Los Angeles is once again the epicentre of the NBA.\n\nIn any normal season, LeBron James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers would probably be the heavy favourites. Stung by criticism of how they managed (or perhaps wasted) the King\u2019s first season in Hollywood, general manager Rob Pelinka has re-tooled around him, finally managing to snare another superstar in Anthony Davis, while adding some shooting and defence via the likes of Green \u2013 fresh from winning his ring with the Raptors \u2013 and Avery Bradley. Their depth is still highly questionable.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 biggest sports contracts on the planet Show all 12 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

He\u2019d never sat out as many games through injury and having missed out on the playoffs for the first time since 2005, he doesn\u2019t have any time to waste. His desire to pass the torch to Davis is clear. In fact, he even tried to give his own fabled No 23 shirt to the new arrival though the league denied the request, with the application to change numbers not having been made in time. Pointedly, James has been wearing his old Miami No 6 in training sessions, and in scenes from the currently-filming Space Jam 2.\n\nYet the Lakers will have far from a clear run, even in their own city. After years of being the punchline to jokes, this season\u2019s Clippers are serious. They have signed their own superstar duo in Kawhi Leonard, fresh from guiding the Raptors to the title as Finals MVP, and Paul George, who finished third in the overall MVP running and was handpicked by Leonard to join him in a title push. Added to a strong existing unit, full of character and well coached by Doc Rivers, who pushed the Warriors to six games in the opening round of last season\u2019s playoffs, the Clippers are now heavyweights.\n\nThis injection of star power into LA is only the top line in a Western Conference teeming with quality. The Houston Rockets might be more in the news for their general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet sparking crisis in the NBA\u2019s relationship with China \u2013 and as even LeBron found out in recent days, it\u2019s a case of react quickly, repent at leisure in respect of that situation \u2013 but they are the only team to have pushed Golden State to the limit in the last two seasons. Morey has taken another big risk in trading away Chris Paul to the Thunder for Russell Westbrook, meaning the MVPs of 2017 and 2018 are on the same team as Westbrook reunites with James Harden. Setting up the two most ball-dominant players in the league will either equal boom or bust.\n\nElsewhere the Utah Jazz are now a genuine contender, having added point guard Mike Conley to play with the explosive Donovan Mitchell. Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray will seek to build on last year\u2019s promise for the Denver Nuggets. The Western Conference has such depth that Kristaps Porzingis\u2019 return from injury, meaning the Dallas Mavericks have a star European tandem to build around in the shape of the Latvian and reigning Rookie of the Year Luka Don\u010di\u0107, has almost been overlooked.\n\nThe intensity of the competition out West means that the East certainly risks being overshadowed. The inspirational Leonard\u2019s exit after his glorious one-and-done means that the Raptors have little chance of defending their crown. The Nets made the most sensational splash of free agency in luring Durant and Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving from under the noses of their neighbours, the New York Knicks, but Durant isn\u2019t expected to play in the coming season, leaving Irving to lead this good young team \u2013 a role in which he plainly failed with the Celtics last term.\n\nMilwaukee and Philadelphia are widely expected to battle it out for top spot in the East, with reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo aiming to go one better and make it to the Conference Finals with the Bucks. In Philly, the 76ers have a formidable \u2013 quality-wise and size-wise \u2013 line-up led by Joel Embiid, with good additions in Al Horford and Josh Richardson, but the loss of their clutch man from last year\u2019s playoffs, Jimmy Butler (the small forward has joined Miami Heat), could hurt.\n\nPerhaps the East\u2019s most intriguing story will come in the shape of the much-anticipated NBA debut of the New Orleans Pelicans number 1 pick, Zion Williamson. Though that will have to wait for a few months after the rookie had surgery on a torn meniscus this week.\n\nA heroic return from Thompson, who is on track to come back after February\u2019s All-Star break, to propel the Warriors back into contention would be the ultimate twist. The season promises to be full of them.", "description": "It is quite impossible to think of a more heroic way to go.
