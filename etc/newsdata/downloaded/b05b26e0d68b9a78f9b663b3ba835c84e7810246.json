And it\u2019s not just the App Store that they\u2019re trying to squeeze \u2014 it\u2019s also artists, musicians and songwriters,' the company said in a statement.\n\n'Apple\u2019s approach has always been to grow the pie...'\n\nApple Music has struggled to keep pace with Spotify which now has more than 200 million subscribers worldwide, more than 100 million of which pay to use the service.", "description": "With a Spotify update released today, anyone using the newest iOS 13 can play music by song, album, or artist on the iPad or iPhone by activating Apple's voice assistant Siri.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/11051236-0-image-a-6_1570462591634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
