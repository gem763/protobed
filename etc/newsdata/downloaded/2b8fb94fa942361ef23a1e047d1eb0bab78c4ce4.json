Sequoia\u2019s presentation quickly became the talk of Silicon Valley, which did not fall into as deep an economic funk as other parts of the United States.\n\nYet other alarms about the state of the start-up economy fell on deaf ears.\n\nIn 2015, as unicorn start-ups sucked in billions of dollars in funding and soared to stratospheric valuations, Mr. Gurley of Benchmark bemoaned \u201cthe complete absence of fear\u201d in Silicon Valley and said \u201cdead unicorns\u201d would soon appear. In 2016, Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist who was an early Facebook investor, also predicted \u201cblood in the water\u201d for the unicorns.\n\nBut the money continued to flood into tech start-ups from overseas investors, private equity firms, corporations and SoftBank\u2019s behemoth Vision Fund. That allowed founders to command higher valuations and delay going public. By the end of 2018, start-ups in the United States had raised a record $131 billion in venture funding, surpassing the amount collected during the late 1990s dot-com boom, according to Pitchbook and the National Venture Capital Association.\n\nMr. Gurley gave up on his warnings of excess. \u201cYou have to adjust to reality and play the game on the field,\u201d he said in an interview last year.\n\n(Complaining about high valuations is a longstanding pastime among venture capitalists, of course, since most prefer to invest their money in cheaply priced start-ups rather than expensive ones.)", "description": "Start-up investors are warning of a reckoning after the stumbles of some high-profile \u201cunicorns.\u201d Now turning a profit is in.", "authors": ["Erin Griffith"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/business/08valley/08valley-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
