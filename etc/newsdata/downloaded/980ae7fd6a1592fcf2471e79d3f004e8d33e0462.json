The water was casting out the demon, Martinez told investigators.\n\nAD\n\nMichael Areinoff, a public defender representing Martinez, declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nAD\n\nBelief in demonic possession is not a fringe idea. Slightly more than half of Americans polled in a YouGov survey in 2013 said they believed in it, and 46 percent reported that they believed exorcisms could drive out demons. Demand for Catholic exorcisms has been growing in recent years, the Atlantic reported.\n\nThe story of Bobby Jindal and an apparent exorcism you probably haven\u2019t heard\n\nThe 6-year-old boy, his adoptive mother, Romelia Martinez, and his biological mother are members of the Pascua Yaqui tribe, according to a criminal complaint. Pablo Martinez, who is believed to be in his 30s, is not a member. It was not clear Tuesday if he and Romelia Martinez were married.\n\nAD\n\nRepresentatives for the Pascua Yaqui tribe could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nWhile Martinez held his son\u2019s face under the faucet, his other child left the bathroom crying, according to the complaint. Romelia Martinez heard gurgling coming from the bathroom, unlocked the door and saw Pablo Martinez holding the boy down under the faucet, the complaint says.\n\nAD\n\nRomelia Martinez screamed at him to stop several times, she told investigators, but Pablo Martinez told her that \u201che had to do it.\u201d She allegedly tried to call a pastor, but he did not answer the phone, so she called 911. Pablo Martinez then attempted CPR on the boy and poured cold water on him, the complaint says.\n\nAD\n\nPolice arrived at the home to find the Martinezes standing outside. When officers asked what had happened, Romelia Martinez allegedly said something along the lines of, \u201cHe can tell you,\u201d referring to Pablo. Pablo Martinez told police they would not understand what had happened because they were not of the right mind-set or belief, the complaint says.\n\nWhat do old tales of exorcism and murder say about how men see women now? Not much. Add to list\n\nAs police kept questioning him, Pablo Martinez allegedly turned his back to them, raised his hands in the air and said something to the effect of \u201cI did it.\u201d He allegedly told police there was a demon inside his son and that he \u201cneeded to save him.\u201d Romelia Martinez also told police the boy had been acting demonic, the complaint says.\n\nAD\n\nPolice found the boy, who was naked and did not seem to be breathing, propped up on a pillow on top of a bed, the complaint says. He was brought to Banner University Medical Center in Tucson and was pronounced dead about 5:30 p.m. The boy had burns on 15 percent of his body, including on his forearms, elbows and head, according to the complaint.\n\nAD\n\nPablo Martinez was detained after his first court appearance Friday and held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, court records show.\n\nIn addition to the Pascua Yaqui Police Department, the FBI also responded to the scene. The FBI has investigative responsibilities for major crimes committed on about 200 Native American reservations across the country.\n\nRead more:\n\nA lawmaker was fixing up a house for a needy family when the structure was torn down.
