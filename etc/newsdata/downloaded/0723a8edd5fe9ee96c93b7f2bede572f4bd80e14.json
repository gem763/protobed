Property is often too scarce, too shoddy, too expensive or in the wrong place. Estimates suggest a shortfall of around 4 million homes in England alone.\n\nEnter the garden communities \u2014 an effort to rethink British residential land development from the ground up, establish a constellation of economical, walkable, green communities and provide some 25,000 properties in 28 new communities by 2050. The number is envisioned to increase further as the planned developments take root.\n\nPlanners say they\u2019re responding not just to the current housing crunch, but to the country\u2019s longer-term needs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re delivering a brand-new community, it\u2019s not just about recognizing what people want now,\u201d said Philip Drane, planner for Dunton Hills, a \u201cgarden village\u201d to be located near the existing town of Brentwood not far from London.\n\nDrane\u2019s brief is to envision a new residential utopia on what is currently some fields and a golf course. \u201cThis needs to be flexible and adaptable enough to meet the needs of people well into the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re delivering a brand-new community, it\u2019s not just about recognizing what people want now\u201d \u2014 Philip Drane, planner for a \u201cgarden village\u201d near London\n\nThe opportunity, and the rare hectares of blank canvas, are exciting and challenging, he said \u2014 but not new. The quest for the perfect community has a rich history in Britain.\n\nThe English statesman and philosopher Thomas More coined the term \u201cutopia\u201d in 1516. Meaning \u201cgood place,\u201d the idea isn\u2019t an abstraction for British planners, who have spent centuries seeking to create a blueprint for it.\n\nThe first examples of utopian model villages emerged in the 19th century, when a few philanthropic industrialists and social reformers sought alternatives for workers living in that era\u2019s coal-choked cities. Chocolate maker George Cadbury founded the village of Bournville near Birmingham in 1879. Soap makers the Lever brothers founded Port Sunlight near Liverpool in 1888.\n\nDrane and his 27 counterparts planning new garden communities are drawing heavily on studies of the town of Letchworth, north of London. Dubbed the first \u201cgarden city,\u201d it was founded in 1903 by the utopian thinker Ebenezer Howard.\n\nHoward envisaged Letchworth, first described in an 1898 book, as a planned community where the best of town and country combined. Large green areas were interspersed with wide boulevards. The town\u2019s economic model stressed allowing gains from the then-agricultural local economy to remain in the community. Letchworth remains a successful town of more than 30,000 today.\n\nThat\u2019s the thinking Drane is being told to revive. \u201cWe want to encourage more local areas to come forward with ambitious locally-led proposals for new communities that work as self-sustaining places,\u201d the U.K. government said in a 2016 prospectus calling for projects like Brentwood\u2019s. \u201cThey should have high quality and good design hard-wired in from the outset \u2014 a new generation of garden villages.\u201d\n\nBlueprint for utopia\n\nSounds lovely, right? But building 28 utopias, amid a modern real estate market facing shortfalls for millions of people, remains just a plan, yet to face the reality of hiring masons, contracting plumbers and, crucially, swaying local councils.\n\nPlanned for up to 4,000 residents, Drane\u2019s Dunton Hills project is set to be constructed in phases, delivering a minimum of 2,700 homes by 2033. The first phase, a series of public meetings with the surrounding communities, began recently.\n\nThey included a recent session at the nearby Brentwood library. Library employee Barry O\u2019Brien said the garden village scheme received a cautious welcome at the session.\n\n\u201cPeople understand we need more houses here, and they seemed happier that it would be in a separate undeveloped area away from the town, so it doesn\u2019t pressure the infrastructure here so much,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, local critics have emerged, often raising concerns strikingly similar to those raised against classic suburban development.\n\nThe Dunton Hills site is on what is known as London\u2019s green belt, an area where building has been restricted in order to stop urban sprawl. Critics worry garden village plans will allow development on previously preserved open space, eroding the green belt.\n\nA group of residents of the village of Marden in Kent have formed a protest group to challenge the building of 2,000 homes in a garden community close to them. \u201cIt seems to be a way for developers to get approval via the backdoor for high-density housing on sites where they would not normally receive approval,\u201d the group said in a statement on its website.\n\nTraffic and infrastructure is also a concern.\n\nWhile locating the garden village away from Brentwood is popular with residents there, that moves it closer to two other neighboring communities, Thurrock and Basildon. Councillors there have already voiced worries that their towns\u2019 infrastructure might come under pressure as Dunton Hills develops.\n\nEnvironmental groups believe higher density accommodation would have less of an impact on the landscape than the lower-density housing typical of garden community schemes. The concept has also been accused of lacking ambition and trafficking in nostalgia for village life.\n\n\u201cHoward\u2019s real genius was not the garden city idea \u2014 it was his ability to find a new answer to a seemingly intractable set of problems,\u201d wrote Frances Holliss, an academic at the school of architecture at London Metropolitan University, after the garden community idea resurfaced. \u201cWe should be following his method, not adopting his out-of-date idea.\u201d\n\nNo Two Towns the Same\n\nThough many garden community master plans remain at a very early stage, some shared ideas are emerging.\n\nThe communities are envisioned for a more flexible workforce, with broadband and accessible working spaces. Commercial activity will be included to allow residents to work closer to home, and transit will be designed to encourage the use of public transport, as well as cycling and walking, rather than private cars.\n\nMulti-use buildings with occasional tenants, such as a doctor\u2019s surgery open a couple of days a week, are also being studied, with the goal of making the communities independent and reducing the likelihood that the garden villages will evolve into typical dormitory settlements.\n\nPlanners also aim to preserve any historical or geographical features. At Dunton Hills, a historic farmhouse is expected to be maintained as part of the design, which will also seek to exploit the unique topography of the site, local council head Chris Hossack said. \u201cIt has a nice vantage point with natural lakes and hill space that we are looking to retain,\u201d he said.\n\nThough the 28 projects will share a planning philosophy and some infrastructure ideas, local planners have been given significant leeway to address local concerns. Garry Legg, who is working on St. Cuthberts, a planned garden community near the northern English city of Carlisle, said water management would likely be a key part of that village\u2019s design.\n\nThe English statesman and philosopher Thomas More coined the term \u201cutopia\u201d in 1516. Meaning \u201cgood place,\u201d the idea isn\u2019t an abstraction for British planners, who have spent centuries seeking to create a blueprint for it.\n\nCarlisle city center suffered significant damage in devastating 2015 floods \u2014 the council offices are still not fully repaired. Located upstream, St. Cuthberts\u2019 design may incorporate a run-off area for the river that will also function as new wildlife habitat.\n\nHousing styles are still under discussion at both Dunton Hills and St Cuthberts but a key element for both planning teams was variety, they said. As inspiration, they cited an area of new development called Graven Hill in the town of Bicester in England, where the planning process has been rewritten to make it easier for plot owners to build homes according to their own designs.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, if I saw any one of those designs on its own, I might have concerns, but when you look at them all together it just works,\u201d Legg said.\n\nWhether \u201cgarden cities\u201d prove to be Howard\u2019s paradise, or just suburbs wrapped in Brexit-era nostalgia, won\u2019t be clear for a while.\n\nBecause of the long lead times of the garden villages, planners have spent time visiting schools to get the input from the children who might eventually live in them. \u201cRealistically, by the time these projects are delivered, they are going to be for people who are in primary schools now,\u201d Drane said.", "description": "UK\u2019s new Garden Communities take inspiration from original utopias.", "authors": ["Charlie Duxbury", "Omar Marques"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/housingcrisisfinal-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
