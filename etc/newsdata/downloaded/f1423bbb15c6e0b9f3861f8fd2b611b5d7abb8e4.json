It usually involves adding an extra cornerback to prevent the opposing team from completing the long bomb. It\u2019s a strategy only employed when your team is winning and the clock is running out.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump decided against a military strike to punish Iran, which the United States says is certainly behind the attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure. \u201cGoing into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before, it would be very easy, the easiest thing,\u201d Trump said at a news conference with Australia\u2019s prime minister. Instead, he said, \u201cI'm showing great restraint,\u201d which he says \u201ca lot of people respect.\u201d\n\nEXPANDING THE SHIELD: Later on Friday, after returning to the Pentagon from a national security meeting at the White House, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced that the United States would be beefing up missile defenses in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \u201cThe president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe attack on two Saudi oil processing facilities by drone and cruise missiles exposed glaring deficiencies in Saudi air defenses, which rely largely on U.S. technology, including Patriot missiles. \u201cNo single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that, but a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran,\u201d said Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford.\n\nDunford said he would make specific recommendations this week after conferring with U.S. Central Command head Gen. Frank McKenzie, but added that the dispatch of U.S. troops would be \u201ca moderate deployment,\u201d in the hundreds, \u201cnot thousands.\u201d\n\nMAXIMUM PRESSURE IS WORKING: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in New York for this week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, was on ABC and CBS yesterday vigorously defending the Trump approach against criticism it shows weakness and is emboldening Iran.\n\n\u201cThe strategy is working,\u201d Pompeo said on Face the Nation. \u201cThe sanctions that we've put in place that ultimately will cause the Iranian regime to shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year ahead only went in place in May of this year. They're five months on. We're at the beginning of that sanctions campaign.\u201d\n\nIRAN INSISTS US WANTS WAR: While the United States is emphasizing it wants to deter Iran and stressing diplomacy, Iran continues to threaten \u201call-out war\u201d if attacked.\n\n\u201cI'm not confident that we can avoid a war,\u201d said Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on CBS. \u201cI'm confident that we will not start one, but I'm confident that whoever starts one will not be the one who finishes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently, the Iranians are bloodthirsty and looking for war. President Trump and I, we're looking for a diplomatic resolution to this,\u201d responded Pompeo later in the program. \u201cBut make no mistake about it. We're prepared to do the things we need to do to try to deter Iran from this kind of behavior.\u201d\n\nAs for Zarif\u2019s continued denials that Iran had anything to do with the attack: \u201cI don't know why anybody listens to the Iranian foreign minister. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. And he's lied for decades. And then he resigned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not even worth responding to him. It's beneath the dignity of anyone in the world to listen to someone who repeatedly makes the claim that the Houthis launched this attack.\u201d\n\nNO TALKS AT THE UN: President Trump says while \u201cnothing is ever off the table completely,\u201d he has no plans to meet with Iran\u2019s president at the United Nations this week. \u201cThat doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I'm a very flexible person. But we have no intention,\u201d Trump said yesterday. \u201cWe're meeting with a lot of leaders. We have about 15 meetings set up, but Iran is not one of them.\u201d\n\nLOST OUR LEVERAGE: On CNN yesterday, former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk argued that while Trump has rightly pointed out that America\u2019s newfound energy independence means it no longer needs to rely as much on Saudi oil, that also sends a message to Iran that the United States will not go to war to protect world oil supplies.\n\n\u201cIf he keeps on upping the pressure with more sanctions, the Iranians will keep on retaliating especially because they see now that he will not use force against them,\u201d said Indyk, who is a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cMaximum pressure isn't working, it's only driving him into a situation where he has to choose between a retaliation that he doesn't want to undertake, military retaliation, or capitulation to Iranian demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he needs to get back to the negotiating table, he needs to use the sanctions as leverage, he needs to offer waivers in order to get back to the table,\u201d Indyk said.\n\nGood Monday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre\u2019s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre ( @jamiejmcintyre ) and edited by Kelly Jane Torrance ( @kjtorrance ).

Experts have long believed North Korea has uranium enrichment capabilities in addition to the declared Yongbyon facility, which produced nuclear material for six of the Kim Jong Un regime's weapons tests.\n\nUS STRIKES LIBYA: U.S. Africa Command has revealed the United States struck ISIS fighters in Libya last week.\n\n\"U.S. Africa Command conducted this airstrike to eliminate terrorist leaders and fighters and to disrupt terrorist activity,\" said U.S. Africa Command chief Gen. Stephen Townsend in a release.\n\nThe United States says it believes the airstrike killed eight ISIS members but that no civilians were killed or wounded.\n\nTHE DREADED CR: As Congress appears to be moving inexorably to passing a short-term continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown at the end of the month, the Pentagon keeps trying to make the case that delaying full funding for the military until at least Nov. 21 will hurt national security.\n\nAsked by reporters what would be affected by the six-week delay, the Pentagon said a CR would \u201cdisrupt major exercises and training events, affect readiness and maintenance, curtail hiring and recruitment actions, and adversely impact contracting negotiations.\u201d\n\nIt also gave these examples of new technology whose procurement would be harmed:\n\nLong-Range Hypersonic Weapon: A CR \u201cdelays critical long lead purchases, putting planned delivery at risk; adversely impacting the ability to deter and defeat near-peer adversaries.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Helicopter Training System: The \u201cnew start procurement\u201d of 32 AHTS aircraft (24 Navy, 8 Marine Corps) scheduled to award in November 2019 would be delayed.\n\nB-52 Global Positioning System Interface Unit Replacement: A CR \u201cdelays procurement of critical processing chips/circuit cards; creating 18 month slip, impacting mission capable rates.\u201d\n\nQUOTH THE MAVEN EVERMORE: In his book Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead, former defense secretary Jim Mattis lives up to his reputation as the \u201cmaven of maxims,\u201d liberally sprinkling his battlefield parables with quotable quotations and homespun aphorisms.\n\nI picked out 50 of the best lines from the book, which I have compiled here . Here are 10 to get you started\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t send a grunt with a rifle when a five-hundred-pound bomb will do the job. Everyone has a plan, Mike Tyson said, until they get punched in the mouth. Doctrine is the last refuge of the unimaginative. I can appear brilliant if I fight enemy leaders dumber than a bucket of rocks. Engage your brain before you engage your weapon. I had lance corporals who could better express the nobility of our methods than U.S. government spokespeople in Washington. The most important six inches on the battlefield are between your ears. PowerPoint is excellent when displaying data; but it makes us stupid when applied to critical thinking. It is better to have a friend with deep flaws than an adversary with enduring hostility. I come in peace. I didn\u2019t bring artillery. But I\u2019m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I\u2019ll kill you all.\n\nThe Rundown\n\nNew York Times: Iran Says British Tanker Is Free to Go After 2 Months of Detention\n\nWall Street Journal: For Trump, Long Odds on Securing New U.N.
