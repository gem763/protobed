Immediately after his release from prison, the illegal alien allegedly hunted down his rape victim and attacked her, as Breitbart News reported, and he remains wanted by police.\n\nLegislation filed in the Senate, supported by Angel Families, would allow Americans and legal immigrants to sue sanctuary jurisdictions when they or their loved ones are victimized by illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest sanctuary jurisdictions, Los Angeles County, California and New York City, release thousands of criminal illegal aliens every year. Last year, New York City officials released close to 3,000 criminal illegal aliens back into communities. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County officials release up to 100 criminal illegal aliens every day.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
