Even when you put your money in the bank, there\u2019s a risk of losing it if the bank goes under and the FDIC collapses. The better question to ask is how likely are you to lose money with CEFs?\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the data tells us there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nOf the near 500 CEFs tracked by CEF Insider, 338 have been around for a decade or more. That\u2019s over 300 funds with long track records that have been through everything, from recessions to bear markets to recoveries.\n\nOver that decade, only three of those funds have lost money on a total-return basis (including dividends).\n\nAnd these funds are easy to spot, because they\u2019re all in the energy sector: the Voya Natural Resource Equity Fund ( ), the Cushing MLP Total Return Fund ( ) and the GAMCO Global Gold Natural Resources & Income Fund ( ) are all down in the last decade due to the collapse in oil prices.\n\nWhere Oil Goes, Oil CEFs Follow\n\nWTI CEF Chart\n\nIf you remember 2014, oil prices tanked (pardon the pun), and they haven\u2019t recovered. This has been a big problem for all energy funds, but it\u2019s particularly difficult for energy CEFs, which tend to be income vehicles. In other words, these CEFs\u2019 need to distribute cash while oil crashed became a vicious circle.\n\nThe takeaway? Avoid energy CEFs for the long term.\n\nIf you do that, every single CEF has had a positive total return in the last decade. So, according to the data, your odds of losing money are pretty low.\n\nBut How Much Can I Earn?\n\nIf you\u2019re not likely to lose money, how much could you make?\n\nBack to the data. The average CEF has earned a 7.5% annualized profit over the last 10 years. So if you\u2019d put $100,000 in a basket of random CEFs and ignored the portfolio for a decade and let the dividends reinvest automatically, you\u2019d come back to $206,000 in your account.\n\nTo put that in perspective, over the long term, the stock market has earned a 7% annualized return, so CEFs are within that ballpark. This is despite the fact that many CEFs invest in even safer investments that generally return less than stocks\u2014things like preferred stocks, municipal bonds and so on.\n\nA more tactical approach can boost those returns more. A total of 20% of CEFs that have been around for a decade or more have earned double-digit returns over that period. In other words, these funds have made 10% or more, on average, per year. If you\u2019d put $100K in them, you\u2019d have come back to over $260,000 after a decade.\n\nHow Much Income Can I Make?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the real appeal of CEFs is their income. With an average 7% yield, CEFs give you much more passive income than an index fund that focuses just on stocks, which right now yields about 1.8%.\n\nThat\u2019s the difference between poverty and a sustainable retirement. A $500,000 investment in CEFs gives you $2,916 per month. That same amount in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( )? Just $750 per month.\n\nGood luck living on that! But CEFs make it not only possible to retire on half a million, but easy. Remember, while you hold your CEFs, you\u2019re earning not just income but, in many cases, capital gains, as well. That will grow your nest egg while your dividend checks keep rolling in.\n\nThat\u2019s why CEFs are a powerful secret in the investment world\u2014and they\u2019re a secret that unwarranted fears are keeping far too many investors away from.\n\nNew: The 5 Best CEF Buys for 8% Dividends, 743% Returns\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, I\u2019m guessing you think the 7%+ dividends (and upside) you can get from the regular CEF just might be for you.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to make it easy.\n\nI\u2019ve just released a free special report outlining 5 of my top CEFs for buying right now. These 5 powerhouses have three things in common:\n\nThey\u2019re cheap! In fact, their discounts to NAV (or the gap between their market price and portfolio value) is so wide I\u2019m calling for 20%+ price upside in the next year.\n\nThey give us a valuable hedge in a crash, thanks to their bargain valuations, and \u2026\n\nThey throw off a life-changing cash stream: I\u2019m talking an 8% yield, on average!\n\nHere\u2019s something else you should know: these funds are still cheap, despite putting on massive runs since inception, like Pick No. 1, which has returned 743% and yields an amazing 9.3% now:\n\nThis 743% Gainer Is Just Getting Started\n\nCEF SPY Total Returns Chart\n\nAnd now, thanks to this fund\u2019s unusual 9% discount, we\u2019ve got a short window to jump in before it makes its next move higher!\n\nThis is the kind of income and upside CEFs offer, and these 5 income (and growth) powerhouses are your perfect starting point.\n\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.
