Mr Clements told a Corruption Watchdog hearing he accepted the cash in 2015 during a difficult time in his life. The 100-dollar notes were hidden in a wine box. Mr Clements told the ICAC he believed it was a gift, not an exchange for favours, and he never deposited it in a bank. The commission is investigating claims banned donor Huan Xiangmo was the source of a $100,000 cash donation which was handed over in an Aldi bag in 2015.
