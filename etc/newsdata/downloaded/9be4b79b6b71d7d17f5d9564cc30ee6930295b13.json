[YONHAP]\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s top nuclear envoy on Monday said it was up to the United States to decide whether the two sides will hold further denuclearization talks, pending sufficient change from Washington on its position.En route home to Pyongyang after much anticipated working-level discussions with the United States fell apart on Saturday, North Korea\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator Kim Myong-gil told reporters at Beijing\u2019s Capital International Airport that his recent exchange with the U.S. delegation was \u201csickening,\u201d making clear his dissatisfaction with the United States\u2019 unchanged position on denuclearization.When asked whether negotiations would resume in Sweden within two weeks, as alluded to in the U.S. State Department\u2019s official statement on the talks Saturday, Kim retorted by saying he did not know of such plans to return to Stockholm in that period.\u201cThe United States has failed to arrive at any [acceptable] calculus after the Panmunjom meeting. What makes you think they will be able to create one within two weeks?\u201d Kim said, referring to the abrupt rendezvous between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the inter-Korean border in late June, which put talks back on the books.Kim Myong-gil also took a page out of the North Korean playbook of brinksmanship tactics, reminding Washington of what was at stake with the present negotiation process.\u201cIf the United States is not properly ready, who knows what horrible disasters can occur,\u201d Kim said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201dThese ominous remarks tie into an earlier warning delivered by Kim following the talks on Saturday, in which he said the North could rethink its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests if the United States failed to pivot from its current position.Analysts have pointed out that the breakdown of Saturday\u2019s discussions makes another North Korean weapons test highly likely and imminent, given that Pyongyang tested what is believed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile ahead of the talks last Wednesday in a move that was widely interpreted as an attempt to shore up its negotiating position.Only 15 minutes after the talks fell apart in Sweden Saturday evening local time, Kim delivered a visceral statement on the steps of the North Korean Embassy in Stockholm, saying Washington bore the \u201centire responsibility\u201d for the talks\u2019 failure due to its \u201cinability to abandon its outdated position and attitude.\u201dA statement from the U.S. State Department released just three hours later said Kim\u2019s comments did not \u201creflect the content or the spirit of [Saturday\u2019s] 8 1/2 hour discussion,\u201d adding its delegates \u201cbrought creative ideas and had good discussions\u201d with their North Korean counterparts.On Sunday evening, however, North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry fired back at the U.S. response, with its spokesperson accusing the U.S. envoys of taking a \u201ctrite stance\u201d on the talks that made its own delegate question \u201cwhether the United States truly has a stand to solve the issue through dialogue.\u201dMirroring Kim\u2019s remarks in Beijing almost verbatim, the statement also called the United States\u2019 reference to a resumption in talks in two weeks \u201ccompletely ungrounded\u201d since it was not likely Washington could produce an acceptable proposal within a fortnight.\u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as what happened this time before the United States takes a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK, a policy that threatens the security of the country and hampers the rights to existence and development of its people,\u201d the statement added, using the acronym for the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.Calling once again for a \u201cnew calculation method\u201d from Washington, the statement ended with an ultimatum of sorts, threatening that all bilateral dealings may come to an end if the United States\u2019 attitude does not change by the deadline of the end of this year.The South Korean government, which had high expectations for the talks, responded to the breakdown with some dismay, but its presidential office stressed it was too early to make a judgement on the process. Seoul\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, Lee Do-hoon, left for Washington Monday to discuss the issue with the top U.S. envoy to the talks, Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/07201645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
