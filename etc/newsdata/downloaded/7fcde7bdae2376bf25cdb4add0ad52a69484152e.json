Instead, Mulvaney assured us, the White House deployed \u201can advance team\u201d to examine multiple locations in several states. That scrutiny produced a list of four finalists the crack team pored over before deciding, against the odds, that Doral was the one.\n\n\u201cDoral was, by far and away \u2014 far and away \u2014 the best physical facility for this meeting,\u201d Mulvaney said at the press briefing. \u201cIn fact, I was talking to one of the advance teams when they came back, and I said, \u2018What was it like?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Mick, you\u2019re not going to believe this, but it\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat means, presumably, that Mulvaney never had a conversation in the Oval Office about the selection process that might have gone like this:Mulvaney: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at several sites and \u2013\u201dTrump: \u201cDoral.\u201dMulvaney: \u201cBut Mr. President, if you hold the G-7 at your own place that means that the government is using taxpayer funds to fill your wallet and \u2013\u201dTrump: \u201cDoral.\u201dMulvaney: \u201cI just want to remind you about the grief we got when the vice president stayed at your hotel in Ireland and \u2013\u201dTrump: \u201cDoral.\u201dMulvaney: \u201cAnd the grief we got about the our military personnel staying at your golf club in Scotland because \u2013\u201dTrump: \u201cDoral.\u201dMulvaney: \u201cThere\u2019s also been lots of chatter about all of the diplomats who stay at your Washington hotel and \u2013\u201dTrump: \u201cDoral.\u201dMulvaney: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget the Kushners used your image and name for product marketing in China, Jared\u2019s maneuvers with 666 Fifth Avenue, the trademarks China suddenly awarded you and Ivanka, taxpayer funds used to help Don Jr. and Eric make overseas business trips or to help you golf all the time at your own clubs, or questions about why you keep appeasing guys like Putin and Erdogan, and why you haven\u2019t really distanced yourself from your businesses or released your tax returns and \u2013\u201dTrump: \u201cDoral.\u201dMulvaney: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve thought about it, and I\u2019d like to recommend Doral to you, Mr. President.\u201dTrump: \u201cThank you Mick, that\u2019s a great idea.\u201dNope, a conversation like that never could have happened and Mulvaney held his press conference to make sure reporters could take his word for it. And sure enough, a reporter did ask if Trump personally intervened to get Doral on the short list of G-7 venues. Yep, he did, Mulvaney answered.\n\n\u201cWe sat around one night. We were back in the dining room and I was going over it with a couple of our advance team. We had the list, and [Trump] goes, \u2018What about Doral?\u2019 And it was like, \u2018That\u2019s not the craziest idea. It makes perfect sense.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of answer that could convince skeptics Trump is violating \u201cemoluments\u201d provisions in the Constitution that bar presidents from accepting payments from foreign governments (since lots of foreign governments attending the G-7 will be spending money at Doral).\n\nMulvaney tried to get in front of that by asking and then answering the most obvious question about hosting the G-7 at Doral.\n\n\u201cIs the president going to profit from this? I think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he\u2019s got here that he doesn\u2019t profit from being here. He has no interest in profit from being here,\u201d he allowed. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that he\u2019s not taken a salary since he\u2019s been here. He\u2019s given that salary to charity. Will not be profiting here.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you\u2019re wondering how the White House decided a Miami golf resort owned by President Donald Trump was the best venue for a major diplomatic gathering, the Group of Seven summit, the U.S. will host next June, Mick Mulvaney has answers.In a\u00a0press briefing on Thursday, Trump\u2019s acting", "authors": ["Timothy L.
