I suspect he could be.\n\nI see a centre back in the 20-year-old and that is where his future could lie for club and country, rather than being used solely in midfield.\n\nIn the modern game, players are being told to pass it out from the back, and Rice is capable of executing that.\n\nDeclan Rice could be the answer to England's problems in central defence going forward\n\nHe'd be more than happy to get on the ball and has the intelligence needed to form an effective centre back partnership.\n\nWatch West Ham and you'll see this young man is excellent at what he does. In the Premier League this season, only two midfielders have made more tackles than Rice.\n\nHe also ranks fourth for interceptions and seventh for ball recoveries. I believe he could apply those talents to central defence, too, while being the proficient passer Gareth Southgate wants.\n\nThe tough-tackling youngster is versatile and has a wide-ranging skill set across the field\n\nThe England boss will have spent this weekend trying to figure out what the best balance is.\n\nAfter being stunned by the Czech Republic in Prague, and after conceding three goals against Kosovo at St Mary's in a 5-3 win last month, there are big question marks surrounding Southgate's defence.\n\nRice is likely to miss out against Bulgaria on Monday night due to illness, but using him at the back could be the long-term answer.", "description": "JAMIE REDKNAPP: Is Declan Rice the answer to England's problems in defence?
