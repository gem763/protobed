[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nAs a veteran news reporter with more than 10 years of experience covering political news, I have witnessed many big events, both domestically and internationally. But I have never seen a ceremony as grand and solemn as the one on Sunday recognizing individuals for their contributions to the nation.\n\nIt is the first time China has awarded medals and honorary titles in the name of the People's Republic of China. The medals and titles, specified in the Constitution, are the highest granted by the State to an individual.\n\nWhen the awardees left Jingxi Hotel and the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for the Great Hall of the People, their buses were escorted by an honor guard of motorcycles riding in formation along Chang'an Avenue.\n\nUpon their arrival, they were greeted by an honor guard and hundreds of schoolchildren holding flowers on the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall. A red carpet welcomed the honorees.\n\nSome elderly and disabled honorees who had difficulty walking up the stairs were carried in wheelchairs by three guards.\n\nOn the first floor of the Great Hall, they were greeted one by one by six deputy national-level officials, all members of the national award committee.\n\nThe ceremony was held in the Golden Hall on the third floor, where the country's most prominent events are often held.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by President Xi Jinping and the six other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and other officials.\n\nAt the beginning of the ceremony, all participants stood and sang the national anthem. Wang Huning, the host of the ceremony, read a presidential decree signed by Xi to honor 42 individuals with either the Medal of the Republic, the Friendship Medal or national honorary titles.\n\nHonor guard soldiers then brought the medals to the stage, where Xi conferred the medals and shook hands with the recipients.\n\nHeroes demonstrate that greatness comes from the ordinary, and ordinary work can lead to extraordinary achievements, the president said.\n\nThe honorees, including scientists, war heroes and workers, were the brightest stars of the country at that moment.", "description": "As a veteran news reporter with more than 10 years of experience covering political news, I have witnessed many big events, both domestically and internationally.
