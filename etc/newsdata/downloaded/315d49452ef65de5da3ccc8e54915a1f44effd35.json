The chief justice [of the Supreme Court] will be in the chair. We will have to convene every day, six days out of seven, at 12:30 or 1 o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\u201d McConnell told reporters Wednesday. \u201cSenators won\u2019t be allowed to speak, which will be good therapy for a number of them. We intend to do our constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nMcConnell previously said he'd have \"no choice\" but to conduct an impeachment trial if the House passes articles of impeachment, but he hadn't laid out how that process would work. He's also run Facebook campaign ads declaring that \"the way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\"\n\nThe senators also discussed whether they\u2019d be able to make a motion to dismiss the impeachment articles without a trial \u2014 but got the sense they wouldn\u2019t have the votes to do so.\n\nRepublican senators say they discussed the possibility that they\u2019ll need to work through the holidays and the fact that without unanimous consent from all senators, they wouldn\u2019t be able to work on other legislation during the trial.\n\n\u201cMost people believe we\u2019ll deal with it. Every indication is that articles will be coming our way eventually,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told reporters.\n\nCover: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joined at left by Sen.
