He is the ultimate technocrat, he has spent more than three decades in the (energy) ministry, working on energy issues,\" Croft said.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz is a long-standing member of the Saudi delegation to OPEC, a group of oil producing nations ostensibly led by Saudi Arabia. He is not expected to change Saudi Arabia's approach to oil policy or OPEC, including the current agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, including Russia, to curb supply in order to support prices and balance oil markets.", "description": "All eyes will now be on Saudi Arabia's new energy minister to see if the country will stay the course on stabilizing global crude markets, oil market expert Helima Croft said Monday.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106118561-1568011495327gettyimages-1067987002.jpeg?v=1568011522", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
