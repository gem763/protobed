The six-bedroom, five-bathroom, sod-roof house\u2014which the Mikkelsens call a \u201ccabin\u201d but is a mansion in all but name\u2014sits on a half-acre lot some 3,500 feet above sea level. It is currently the most expensive vacation property advertised for sale in Norway. But it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of the country\u2019s expanding market for luxury mountain homes.\n\nSteinar and Lena Mikkalsen with their dogs, Vimse, left and Nirre.

The luxury segment is far outpacing the general mountain-home market, which has seen growth between 4% and 6% annually since 2015.\n\nLuxury sales are concentrated in a handful of resorts to the west and north of greater Oslo, home to about one-quarter of the country\u2019s 5.3 million people.\n\nNorway\u2019s Ski Scene Prime ski resorts are becoming year-round destinations. In Hemsedal, a three-hour drive from Oslo, the country\u2019s capital and largest city, a vacationer zip lines over the Hemsil River, which is also known for its fishing.

Sveinug Braathen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nGeilo, which pioneered mansion-size ski cabins over the past decade or two, is known for its variety of attractions. In addition to Alpine runs, it offers a vast network of cross-country trails that wind their way above the tree line, along with prize-winning restaurants, prime trout fishing and easy access by train.\n\nIllustration: Shaw Nielsen\n\nBuyers include Norway\u2019s wealthiest citizens, such as Oslo billionaire Aage Thoresen, whose fortune comes from his family\u2019s grocery and real-estate businesses. This summer, Mr. Thoresen made national headlines when he paid $6.8 million for a Geilo mountain compound, setting a record for the highest price paid for a ski home.\n\nWealthy Oslo residents have long had three homes: a year-round residence in the capital, a summer cabin on Norway\u2019s southern coast and a cabin in the mountains. Until a generation ago, their vacation homes might have been little more than sheds, with bunk beds crammed into a single room and, sometimes, only a latrine out back. Now, they might have summer and mountain homes that are more lavish and more expensive than their primary residences.\n\nHemsedal, an hour\u2019s drive north from Geilo, is known for its young crowd and apr\u00e8s-ski options. Once largely restricted to the rental market, it is expanding into luxury-home sales, including newly built condos going for up to $1,128 a square foot.\n\nGjermund Svendsen-Rosendal, who runs EiendomsMegler 1 Fjellmegleren, a real-estate agency specializing in mountain homes, says he needed only a few days to sell a dozen million-dollar apartments this past Christmas in the latest phase of Hemsedal\u2019s new mountaintop Skigaarden apartment complex. Built in several stages, the complex will have about 150 apartments, with about half priced above $1 million. Last year, a 2,700-square-foot Skigaarden penthouse sold for $2.5 million.\n\nGeilo, about a three-hour drive from Oslo and Bergen, and Hemsedal compete for luxury buyers with Hafjell and Kvitfjell, two resorts developed for the 1994 Winter Olympics in nearby Lillehammer. In Hafjell\u2014at a two-hour drive, the most convenient major resort for residents of the capital\u2014Hans Houeland, an Oslo real-agent specializing in luxury properties, recently sold a 4,300-square-foot, seven-bedroom home on a half-acre lot for $1.5 million.\n\nThe Kvitfjell ski resort, where Norway\u2019s Olympic ski champion Aksel Lund Svindal is planning to build a home. Photo: Kvitfjell Alpinanlegg\n\nHafjell is known as a family resort, while Kvitfjell, a 45-minute drive farther north, has Norway\u2019s most challenging skiing, regularly hosting World Cup racing events. Aksel Lund Svindal, the Norwegian who won the downhill gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, has acquired a lot in Kvitfjell to build a home.\n\nBuyers at all these expanding resorts are overwhelmingly Norwegian, except for Trysil, northeast of Oslo, where some 10% of owners are Swedish, says Carl Geving, managing director of NEF, Norway\u2019s national association of real-estate agents.\n\nNorway Mountain Retreat Is Most Expensive on the Market Entrepreneur Steinar Mikkelsen has put his vacation home up for sale for $3.9 million, the highest price tag on a vacation property listing in the country. Sales of Norwegian mountain homes above $900,000 quadrupled between 2013 and 2018. This 8,100-square-foot mansion in Geilo, a mountain resort between Oslo and Bergen, is currently the most expensive vacation property advertised for sale in the country, with an asking price of $3.9 million.

Sveinung Braathen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nRustic sod roofs are typical of upscale mountain homes in Norway, and the new building boom in places like Hemsedal and Kvitfjell include contemporary, minimalist buildings that sport the earthy tops, with indoor touches such as double-height living rooms and open-plan kitchens.\n\nBack in Geilo, Steinar Mikkelsen wanted a traditional, sod-roof ski cabin, but on a larger scale. \u201cYou need a lot of room in a vacation home,\u201d he says, alluding to the Norwegian habit of big family gatherings at ski resorts during Christmas and Easter.\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Mikkelsen, who now has permanent residence just over Norway\u2019s border with Sweden, purchased an empty lot for $252,800, then spent more than $4 million on the home, which is filled with artisan touches, such as a handcrafted open fireplace off the kitchen and intricate hand-carved detailing on the doorways. Luxury amenities include a combination sauna and steam room, with tropical-hardwood benches, an outdoor Jacuzzi and a large wine cellar. The two-story home has two basements for extra volume and a custom-made wood-burning furnace, in case the electricity goes out. It was finished in time for the 2004 ski season.\n\nMr. Mikkelsen, now 70, shares the home with his wife, Lena Mikkelsen, 56, a Swedish interior decorator. Once an avid skier and hunter, he has had to cut back on cold-weather activities, which prompted him to sell the home. The couple plans to spend more time in the Caribbean, where they keep a sailboat in Antigua.\n\nOslo real-estate developer Magne Blindheim, founder of Eie Eiendomsmegling, has gone all in on a luxury mountain home in Hemsedal\u2019s Skigaarden complex. Opting to rent in the summer, he said he paid market value, or about $2 million, for a new 2,000-square-foot Skigaarden unit, and plans to customize the interior.\n\nHe says he regards the complex\u2019s slope-side setting and many off-piste options as a luxury. He also prizes the social activities that the complex\u2019s clublike atmosphere provides. \u201cEven though Skigaarden is expensive,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s low-key.\u201d", "description": "The country\u2019s mountain-home market has seen growth between 4% and 6% annually since 2015, as more Norwegians seek high-end living at high altitudes", "authors": ["J.S.
