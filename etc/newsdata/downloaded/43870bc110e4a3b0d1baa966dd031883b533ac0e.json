But when it comes to Brexit, conventional wisdom is often wrong. In fact, there are at least five ways to get such a people\u2019s vote, and only one involves having an election first.\n\nJohnson loses an election\n\nBoris Johnson may now look like he has a good chance to win an election. If the opposition forces are divided, he could get an overall majority with as little as a third of the vote.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut fast forward to 19 October. By then, if he obeys the law, he will have asked the EU to delay Brexit. Nigel Farage will say Johnson has betrayed the people and the Brexit Party will eat into the Tories\u2019 vote.\n\nThe prime minister is already having a terrible time \u2013 losing votes in parliament, giving rambling speeches and seeing his brother quit the Cabinet. Between now and mid-October, there will be many opportunities to harry Johnson, knocking both his morale and his standing in the country. Today\u2019s decision by the Scottish court that his advice to the Queen to suspend Parliament is illegal just the first.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Lib Dems, Greens, independent Conservatives and Plaid Cymru will have more time to agree how to join forces against a common foe. They are already talking. They may even find a way to involve Labour in loose local arrangements.\n\nIf all this happens, Johnson could well lose a November election. A Labour-led coalition or minority government would then take over. Since Jeremy Corbyn is now committed to holding a referendum, we\u2019d soon be into a people\u2019s vote campaign.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe PM bottles it\n\nThe prime minister now wants an election because he thinks he will win. But if he is worried he will lose, he may change his mind. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time. Remember how he gave up the battle to succeed David Cameron just after the 2016 referendum?\n\nIf Johnson wants to avoid an election, the clear alternative would be to call a referendum. Although this would be a u-turn, he could say that he toyed with the idea of two referendums back in 2016. Dominic Cummings, now his top adviser, said then that there was a \u201cstrong democratic case\u201d for having one referendum on the principle of Brexit and another on the terms of Brexit. Quite so.\n\nJohnson might worry that he would lose such a referendum. But if he has to pick his poison, he might think that was preferable to losing an election. After all, since it would take around six months to organise, he wouldn\u2019t be the shortest-serving prime minister in history. And even if he lost the referendum, he might just find a way to hang onto power.\n\nMPs force a people\u2019s vote\n\nJohnson can\u2019t just call a snap election anyway. As we saw this week and last, he needs two thirds of MPs to agree.\n\nAt the moment, Corbyn is saying he\u2019ll back an election as soon as Johnson has secured a delay to Brexit. But the Labour leader could change his mind, as his deputy Tom Watson is urging him to.\n\nCorbyn might switch tack to a referendum if he thought he\u2019d lose an election. And even if he thought he would win, we\u2019d still need a people\u2019s vote to resolve the Brexit issue. So why not have one first and hold the election afterwards? If Labour agreed, it and the rest of the opposition could pass legislation to hold a referendum.\n\nSome pundits will say that the government can sabotage laws that involve public spending \u2013 and that means Johnson could stymie a referendum if he doesn\u2019t want one. But parliament is sovereign and, if it\u2019s determined, it can make the government do what it wants.\n\nOnly this week, after all, it passed a law forcing the prime minister to ask for extra time despite his vow to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d. It wouldn\u2019t be beyond the wit of MPs to change the convention under which only the government can propose how public money is spent.\n\nPM gets a deal\n\nThis week\u2019s law doesn\u2019t force Johnson to ask for extra time if he can persuade MPs to back a deal to leave the EU. That may be why he now seems to be redoubling his efforts to get a deal. If so, his best bet could be to alter the notorious \u201cbackstop\u201d designed to keep the Irish border open so it applies only to Northern Ireland rather than the whole of the UK.\n\nAt the moment, he is only going part of the way, proposing some checks on agricultural products that cross between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That won\u2019t convince the EU. But if he went the whole way and agreed to comprehensive checks on both manufactured goods and agricultural products, the EU would be happy.\n\nJohnson\u2019s allies, the DUP, would scream blue murder as such a deal would distance Northern Ireland from Great Britain. But enough other MPs might decide to approve the deal if the prime minister agreed to put it to the people in a \u201cconfirmatory referendum\u201d.\n\nJohnson quits or is sacked\n\nAt the start of last week, the government had a majority of just one MP in the House of Commons, even when including the 10 DUP MPs. Since then, Johnson has lost an MP to the Lib Dems, expelled 21 others and seen Amber Rudd quit the party in sympathy with those who were driven out.\n\nAs a result, the opposition now easily has the numbers to win a vote of no confidence in Johnson. They might do this if he broke the law requiring him to ask the EU for extra time \u2013 or simply because they had had enough of him. The prime minister himself might fall on his sword \u2013 perhaps because it was the only way to avoid asking for a delay to Brexit without breaking the law.\n\nIf Johnson quits, the assumption is that there will then be an election. But a national unity government might instead be formed with the purpose of holding a Final Say referendum.\n\nThat may not seem likely now. But who would have predicted two months ago that we would be where we are today?\n\nHugo Dixon is chair of InFacts and deputy chair of the People\u2019s Vote campaign", "description": "Conventional wisdom has it that there\u2019s going to be an election in November \u2013 and there's now no chance of a Final Say referendum.
