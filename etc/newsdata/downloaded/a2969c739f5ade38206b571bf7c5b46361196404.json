That\u2019s a lot of material\u2019 Read more\n\nThat was then. Next week, the curtain of privacy behind which Salinger carefully guarded his personal life will be lowered further, with a major exhibition at the New York Public Library.\n\nThe exhibit, which will be free to the public and is scheduled to run for three months, will present a mix of personal and literary effects, ranging from the original typescript of The Catcher in the Rye, revised by the author, to a bookcase from Salinger\u2019s bedroom filled with books from his personal library.\n\nThe exhibit was organized by Salinger\u2019s son Matt Salinger, widow Colleen Salinger and the library\u2019s special collections department.\n\nHe was a private man who shared his work with millions but his life and non-published thoughts with less than a handful Matt Salinger\n\n\u201cHe was a famously private man who shared his work with millions but his life and non-published thoughts with less than a handful of people, including me,\u201d Matt Salinger said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that while he may have only fathered two children there are a great, great many readers out there who have their own rather profound relationships with him, through his work, and who have long wanted an opportunity to get to know him better.\u201d\n\nThe exhibit will also include:\n\nPhotographs from Salinger\u2019s childhood, youth and later life, including from his second world war service in the US army and time as entertainment director on the cruise ship MS Kungsholm in 1941\n\nCorrespondence between Salinger\u2019s friends, fellow soldiers and authors and editors including William Shawn, William Maxwell and Ernest Hemingway\n\nItems from the writer\u2019s childhood, including a bowl he made at summer camp when he was about 10 and kept his whole life\n\nNotebooks, passports, honorable discharge papers from the army in which he identified his civilian occupation as \u201cplaywright, author\u201d, and personal artifacts such as pipes, eyeglasses and a wrist watch\n\nOne of the author\u2019s two typewriters, his film projector and numerous other personal effects\n\nSalinger ceased publishing in the 1960s and refused with rare exceptions press requests and the enthusiastic advances of fans, some of whom went looking for him in his rural New Hampshire home.\n\nFrom everyteen to annoying: are today's young readers turning on The Catcher in the Rye?

The dyspeptic teenage protagonist of the novel, Holden Caulfield, spends a couple of days wandering New York City but does not make it to the library.\n\nThe exhibition will also include a previously undisclosed self-description from a 1982 legal document.\n\n\u201cI am a professional short-story writer and novelist,\u201d the description reads. \u201cI write fiction and only fiction. For more than 30 years, I have lived and done my work in rural New Hampshire. I was married here and my two children were raised here \u2026 I have been writing fiction rather passionately, singlemindedly, perhaps insatiably, since I was 15 or so.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I positively rejoice to imagine that, sooner or later, the finished product safely goes to the ideal private reader, alive or dead or yet unborn, male or female or possibly neither.\u201d", "description": "New York Public Library exhibit will show a mix of personal and literary effects, and will run for three months", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1b3b54800596582aa87adc23724adcfe356f329/0_236_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0360db9b4837e42e29303990f1d2fc3d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
