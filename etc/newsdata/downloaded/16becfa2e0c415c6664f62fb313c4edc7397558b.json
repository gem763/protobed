Ryan Tannehill gave the offense a much-needed spark; Jeffery Simmons gave the defense a boost; and the Titans recovered a fumble in the end zone to win a thriller on Sunday at Nissan Stadium, 23-20.\n\nHere are five observations as Tennessee improved to 3-4:\n\nMike Vrabel makes another questionable call\n\nWith 2:39 left and the Titans trailing by three points, coach Mike Vrabel kept his offense on the field for a fourth-and-1 from about midfield \u2013 opting to keep punter Brett Kern, who leads the league on punts placed inside the 20, on the sideline.\n\nIt nearly blew up in his face. Tannehill's keeper went nowhere, and the Titans turned the ball over on downs. The Chargers marched down to the goal line.\n\nThen madness ensued.\n\nTitans defense comes up huge\n\nOn a handoff at the 1-yard line, Chargers running back Melvin Gordon plunged forward but had the ball stripped by linebacker Wesley Woodyard. Jurrell Casey recovered it in the end zone for a touchback, sealing the game for Tennessee -- and bailing out\n\nBefore that sequence, there were a number of official reviews and penalties that hightened the intensity.\n\nNissan Stadium went bonkers after the head ref announced the turnover.\n\n#Tannehope\n\nWith Ryan Tannehill under center, the Titans offense looked, well, not completely lifeless.\n\nSuch was the case last week, prompting coach Mike Vrabel to promote Tannehill to starter over Marcus Mariota.\n\nThe Titans new starter hung in the pocket well, gave his receivers a chance and, for the majority of the afternoon, played really well.\n\nToward the end of the first half, he orchestrated an eight-play, 86 yard drive that was capped with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Corey Davis. His touchdown pass to Tajae Sharpe in the fourth quarter topped another long drive. His 38-yard dart to Corey Davis later in the fourth was the key play in another touchdown-scoring drive, this one that ended with a Derrick Henry run.\n\nTannehill finished 23-of-29 passing for 312 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nJeffery Simmons debuts\n\nJeffery Simmons burst forward and quickly penetrated the Chargers offensive line, blowing past center Dan Feeney before getting into the backfield, where he wrapped up Melvin Gordon for a tackle for a loss.\n\nThis is what the Titans had been waiting for.\n\nSimmons, the team\u2019s first round pick, practiced with the team for the first time earlier this week after recovering from a torn ACL in February. He was activated to the 53-man roster on Saturday, and on Sunday, he had multiple occasions to gesture to the crowd in celebration.\n\nIn the third quarter, Simmons got to Philip Rivers for a sack. The play helped lead to a three-and-out for the Chargers on their opening drive of the third quarter.\n\nTrick play turns into points\n\nBrett Kern, undoubtedly the team\u2019s MVP through the early part of 2019, can apparently throw it, too.\n\nThe Titans punter, who leads the league on punts placed inside the 20-yard line, faked a punt in the first quarter and instead threw a pass to Kevin Byard, who caught it and got just enough for a first down.\n\nA few plays later, Cody Parkey knocked in a 45-yard field goal, his first attempt as a member of the Titans, as they took a 3-0 lead.\n\nBanged up\n\nA handful of Titans sustained injuries Sunday.\n\nOn the offensive line, right tackle Jack Conklin injured his right thigh during the first series and didn\u2019t return. He spent much of the rest of his afternoon slowly riding a stationary bike on the sideline. And at right guard, Nate Davis left with a rib injury in the first half.\n\nDennis Kelly filled in at right tackle, and Jamil Douglas at right guard.\n\nDelanie Walker hurt his ankle and had a minimal impact.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
