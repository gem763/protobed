Their appearance drew the ire of left-wing activists, who rejected their pro-America, anti-socialism message and unwittingly helped Trump promote his upcoming book Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.\n\nTrump took the stage after Guilfoyle, who detailed her experience of pursuing the American dream.\n\n\u201cI am not a victim. I have never believed that I am a victim,\u201d she declared.\n\nShe decried the left\u2019s pursuit of socialism, which she said is \u201cplaguing\u201d the Democrat Party, and told the audience that the left \u201cneed[s] you to be a victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the power and control over your own beautiful life,\u201d Guilfoyle said, encouraging attendees to \u201cdream,\u201d which provoked campus protesters, who shouted, \u201cbullshit.\u201d Trump supporters quickly drowned the protesters out by chanting, \u201cUSA, USA, USA!\u201d\n\nThe disgruntled protesters became increasingly vocal after Trump took the stage. He, like Guilfoyle, warned of the fallacies of socialism \u2014 a narrative that prompted anti-Trump activists to shout, \u201cfuck you!\u201d\n\n\u201cCouple things I\u2019m going to talk about because they\u2019re sort of relevant to college campuses today beyond the sort of obvious suppression of conservative ideas and lack of free speech,\u201d Trump said, \u201csomething that I included in the book I have coming out in a few weeks called Triggered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI probably don\u2019t have to explain to you why the book is called Triggered because you can hear from the audience just why that is,\u201d he said amid shouting.\n\n\u201cBut really, one of the things that sort of drove me to write that book is people ask me \u2014 they\u2019re like, \u2018Don, you\u2019re the son of a billionaire from New York City. You went to an Ivy League school. You\u2019re supposed to be a liberal,\u201d he said as left-wing protesters stood up and shouted.\n\n\u201cAnd you know why I\u2019m not?\u201d Trump continued, unfazed by the protesters.\n\n\u201cBecause I have a mother who escaped from some of the liberal ideas that are now being preached on college campuses,\u201d he said, mentioning socialism again.\n\nTrump noted that virtually no one from communist or socialist countries are able to vouch for the systems and pointed to Venezuela, which further triggered activists scattered across the crowd.\n\n\u201cHow about Venezuela? A once thriving country, beautiful, with prosperity for everything. How come there\u2019s no one from Venezuela talking about the wonders of socialism?\u201d Trump asked.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re selling a fictitious creed. It\u2019s easy to buy into Santa Claus when you don\u2019t have the facts,\u201d he said before pivoting to the success of his father\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cUnder this administration, there isn\u2019t a single economic metric where we are not better off today than we were three years ago,\u201d Trump said, citing the historically low unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics and the millions of individuals off of food stamps. The latter indicates that people are \u201cself-sufficient,\u201d which is \u201cscary\u201d to the left, which only offers dependence, Trump added.\n\nOnce again, protesters broke out in a \u201cbullshit\u201d chant.\n\nProtesters could also be heard chanting, \u201cNazi scumbag,\u201d \u201cNo KKK, no fascist USA,\u201d and \u201cyou put children in cages.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them get it out of their system. It\u2019s all good,\u201d Trump said over the shouting. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re facing. You guys have a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference between the sides are \u2014 I\u2019ll still come here. Because as my father said in 2016, he\u2019s going to be the president for all Americans, not just those who agree with him,\u201d he said to cheers.\n\nTrump concluded his speech by thanking supporters for \u201chaving the guts\u201d to attend the event and urged college students to exercise the ability to listen and \u201chave sensible arguments face to face \u2014 not on social media where everyone\u2019s a badass.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot behind a computer screen where everyone\u2019s a tough guy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHaving that dialogue, respectfully, I promise you will learn a lot, and it will serve you well for the rest of your lives.\u201d\n\nProtests occurred outside throughout the duration of the event. Activists from Planned Parenthood and March for Our Lives were in attendance, one of whom displayed a picture of Andrew Pollack\u2019s daughter, Meadow, who was one of the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.\n\n\u201cA @AMarch4OurLives activist is using a picture of my deceased daughter to protest @DonaldJTrumpJr at @UF. My family has asked the group to leave her name out of their gun-grabbing agenda more than once. Meadow wouldn\u2019t agree with their agenda,\u201d he wrote:\n\nA @AMarch4OurLives activist is using a picture of my deceased daughter to protest @DonaldJTrumpJr at @UF.
