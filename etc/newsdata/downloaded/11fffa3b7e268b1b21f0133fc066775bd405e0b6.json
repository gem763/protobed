The Home Run Derby made up for it though, featuring a record 312 home runs in a span of three hours.\n\nForty players have already topped the 30-homer mark this season. That number figures to grow significantly with another 30 hitters sitting between 25 and 29.\n\nOther notable home run records\n\n\u2022 On Sept. 1, the Minnesota Twins broke MLB\u2019s team home run record when they hit their 267th home run of the season. Since then, the New York Yankees have caught them and even temporarily passed them. Both entered play on Wednesday with 276 team homers, meaning they\u2019ll be battling for the record until the final day.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2022 The Los Angeles Dodgers now own the National League\u2019s single-season home run record. Both the Dodgers and Houston Astros are on pace to break the previous MLB record of 266 set by the Yankees last season.\n\n\u2022 With 47 home runs, Pete Alonso has already shattered the New York Mets franchise record and the NL rookie record. He\u2019s five away from tying Aaron Judge\u2019s MLB rookie record of 52.\n\n\u2022 Reds rookie Aristides Aquino took over for Yasiel Puig after the trade deadline and went on to set several individual home run records in his first month. The most notable being that he\u2019s the only player in MLB history to hit 13 home runs within his first 100 plate appearances.\n\nWhy are so many home run records falling?\n\nThe focus throughout the season has been on the baseballs. The term \"juiced\" is the most popular used to describe these baseballs, which have left the park faster and farther than ever before.\n\nIt's clear something is different. Even commissioner Rob Manfred has had to admit that much. And whatever difference or differences there are seem to be a major contributing factor to every home run record that has or will fall this season.\n\nWith that in mind, hitters have also been more focused on hitting home runs than ever before. The increased reliance on launch angle as a means to increase power and home run probability has become more prevalent. Combine that with rebuilding teams like the Orioles, who have allowed the most home runs in a single season thanks largely to an ill-equipped pitching staff, there might be a perfect storm that\u2019s led to such a pronounced home run increase.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Baltimore Orioles infielder Jonathan Villar hit the 6,106th home run in MLB this season, setting the league-wide record.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O5hlr.bRXzrAgkWlxAJbnQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n1Zu7uwyqaB0fxxCwQ25Tw--~B/aD0yNDE1O3c9MzYyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6adba6c0-d50a-11e9-b5bf-966f1ba0ebbb", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
