He proceeded to fix this messily with what looked to Nicole like white glue.\n\nShe also claims that he managed to drill through many of the walls inside the house.\n\nA third appointment was made for the 22 August, with Nicole taking yet another day off work but no engineer showed.\n\nShe said: 'My children have had no TV or internet for weeks in the school holidays and have missed the entire football season so far. Then there is the state of my walls. DIY SOS need to come!'\n\nWith no internet, she and her sons went over their mobile data limits and she had to pay out \u00a345 for a dongle to be able to access the internet.\n\nA fourth appointment was made where the engineer did show up but was still unable to find out the source of the issue.\n\nIncreasingly frustrated, Nicole contacted This is Money for help, whilst also suggesting she would be getting in touch with the regulator as 'nobody at BT is doing anything to help'.\n\nSince This is Money contacted BT about the issue, Nicole's phone line has been properly installed and she is now able to use all the services she has been waiting weeks to use.\n\nA BT engineer failed to properly install a customer's phone line, instead leaving damaged walls\n\nA BT spokesperson said: 'We're very sorry for the time taken to fully install Ms Beebee's BT services and for any inconvenience caused. Engineers fixed the fault with her phone line and have successfully set-up her TV service, so all of Ms Beebee's services are now up and running.\n\n'Ms Beebee will be compensated in line with Ofcom's Automatic Compensation Scheme and we have offered an additional goodwill gesture to cover the costs.'\n\nNicole has since received \u00a3195, equivalent to \u00a35 for each day she had no services and \u00a325 for each missed appointment. She was also given a sum to cover all the costs she endured in the meantime, for example going over data on phones, buying a dongle for \u00a344.99 and a gesture of goodwill.\n\nHowever, Nicole's complaint with OpenReach, a division of BT, about the damage caused to her home is still outstanding.\n\nShe added: 'BT Openreach are still investigating so I've not had any compensation for the damage to my home nor a time scale for how long it will take them! It's just all been so bad.'\n\nIt is not just Nicole that has had a bad experience however as Ofcom have confirmed to This is Money that since 1 September 2018, it has received nine \u2018Fault/Service/Provision\u2019 complaints against Openreach that contain the word \u2018damage\u2019.", "description": "A catalogue of errors left a mum-of-x with damaged brickwork, children without TV or internet during the school holidays and a struggle to get things sorted until This is Money stepped in.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
