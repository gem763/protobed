The islands often include everything from tracts of private sandy beach to palm trees and \u00adsecluded coves of turquoise waters teeming with fish.\n\nThere\u2019s also scope for turning them into private residences as many come with DA approval for a dwelling and additional boating facilities.\n\nMORE: Couple\u2019s trick to get six homes\n\nStubborn buyer gifts sellers extra $500k\n\nWhat Gen Y gets wrong about home buying\n\nAn island in the mouth of the Clarence River on NSW\u2019s north coast is up for sale with a price guide of $800,000 and includes nearly 16ha of land.\n\nThe price is lower than Sydney\u2019s $900,000 median house price. Inner city houses, meanwhile, usually start at about $1.2 million.\n\nThe island is part of a larger island group within the delta of the Clarence River and is roughly 15km from tourist hub Yamba.\n\nSelling agent Melanie Shanahan of Solitary Islands Real Estate said it was one of her favourite listings to show prospective buyers \u00adbecause it meant hopping on a jet ski to get there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really beautiful spot,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want their own islands. Much of the \u00adinterest we\u2019re getting is from people who have bought and sold islands before.\u201d\n\nFurther north, a 27ha property known as Goat \u00adIsland is for sale at $1 million. Its main connection to the outside world is a small wet dock marina.\n\nAnd 200km to the south, the 129ha Yellow Rock \u00adIsland in Urunga is for sale \u2014 also with a $1 million price guide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice secluded spot,\u201d selling agent Paul Fitzpatrick of LJ Hooker Coffs Harbour said. \u201cThe catch is that any house you build on the land has to have a helipad for emergencies.\u201d\n\nIsland buyers get even more options in Queensland. Multiple islands which are part of an archipelago in the Torres Strait are up for grabs with prices ranging from just over $1 million to more than $3 million.\n\nWild Duck Island off the coast of Mackay is up for sale at $5 million and \u00adincludes 25 bungalows built for a resort project that was abandoned 15 years ago. There is also a runway.\n\nA spokesman from real estate company Private \u00adIslands Inc said it wasn\u2019t just luxury developers interested in the islands. Many of the buyers making enquiries wanted to build their own private retreats, he said\n\n\u201cIslands offer more privacy (and) because of the limited number of islands for sale in any given region, they are more exclusive,\u201d he said.", "description": "Fancy your own slice of paradise?
