Well, between 1900 and 2017 owning UK shares would have delivered an average return of 5.5 per cent, beating cash savings at 1 per cent and property at 1.8 per cent, according to the respected Credit Suisse Investment Yearbook.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that history will be repeated, but companies should always have the ability to put money to productive use and reward investors with rising share prices off the back of their profits, dividend payouts, or interest on bonds.\n\nYou won't make money every year - and last year investors in the UK stockmarket lost money - but over the long term the gains should build up.\n\nListen to the podcast and tell us what you think.", "description": "We bust the jargon, look at why people should invest, how to get started, what investments you can choose and how to find the right ones for you.", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
