He wept in the dock as the initial sexual assault verdict was returned.\n\nThe jury then cleared the footballer of an alternative charge of assault by beating.\n\n\"You are now discharged and free to go,\" judge Peter Armstrong told the defendant, who can now apply to have his court costs paid.\n\nGascoigne had denied sexually assaulting the woman on a train last August, claiming he planted a \"little peck\" on the stranger to boost her confidence after she had been abused by another passenger.\n\nHis defence team on Tuesday showed jurors a file of photographs of him kissing other footballers and even Princess Diana to prove the encounter was not sexual.\n\nBut prosecutors alleged he had acted criminally when he planted a \"sloppy\" drunken kiss on his accuser following an incident aboard the York to Newcastle train in which she was called \"fat and ugly\".\n\nGiving evidence earlier this week, Gascoigne said he was asked to pose for a photograph with two women, which the complainant took.\n\nHe then claimed someone shouted: \"You don't want a photo with her, she's fat and ugly\".\n\nThe ex-footballer said he felt sorry for the woman as \"I was called a fat bastard every time I played\".\n\nHe then told jurors that he sat next to the woman, telling her \"take no notice of what they say\" and \"listen, you're not fat and ugly, you are beautiful inside\".\n\nThen he gave her \"just a little peck\", he said.\n\nThe jury was shown four pages of photographs of Gascoigne platonically kissing, and being kissed, by celebrities and footballers including Ian Wright and Wayne Rooney.\n\nGascoigne dazzled during the 1990 World Cup in Italy, capturing the nation's heart when he got booked in the semi-final against West Germany.\n\nThe yellow card would have ruled him out of the final had England progressed.\n\nThe former player has struggled with alcoholism since retiring from top-flight football, and admitted he had drunk three or four cans of beer on the train.", "description": "A British jury has cleared former England footballer Paul Gascoigne of sexual assault and assault by beating after he kissed a fellow train passenger without her consent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2271/423559ee0b1b4b088504fe643473092e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
