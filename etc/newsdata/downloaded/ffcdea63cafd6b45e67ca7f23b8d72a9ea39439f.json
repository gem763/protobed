These provide Interpol\u2019s member states with lists of internationally wanted individuals.\n\n\u201cThis is fantastic news,\u201d said Kennedy Gihana, a Rwandan lawyer who represents Karegeya\u2019s family. \u201cAt last justice has prevailed. It can be 30 years or 40 years but these people will be prosecuted in the end.\u201d\n\nThe decision to launch a formal extradition process injects new life into a case that has been a stain on Kigali\u2019s international reputation and a five-year embarrassment for both governments involved.\n\nRwanda\u2019s Khashoggi: who killed the exiled spy chief? Read more\n\nIn the wake of Karegeya\u2019s murder, the judicial trail went mysteriously cold. The involvement of Afriforum, a non-governmental organisation and pressure group more often associated in South Africa with white minority causes, kicked the process back into life last year.\n\nGerrie Nel, the head of Afriforum\u2019s private prosecution unit, hailed the move as proof there had been a miscarriage of justice, pointing out that the warrants had been issued without any further investigation taking place.\n\nKaregeya was a schoolmate and personal friend of Rwanda\u2019s president, Paul Kagame, and rose to become head of external intelligence in Rwanda. He fled to South Africa in 2010 after serving prison time for insubordination. Gen Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, Rwanda\u2019s former army chief of staff, later joined forces with him there, setting up the Rwanda National Congress, an opposition party in exile.\n\nRwanda\u2019s government denounced the RNC as a terrorist organisation and has repeatedly asked Pretoria to send its members to Kigali to face trial \u2013 requests the South African authorities have ignored. Kayumba, who has survived repeated attempts on his life while in exile, is under 24-hour protection paid for by the South African state.\n\nRwanda\u2019s high commissioner to Pretoria, Vincent Karega, said Kigali was not aware of any extradition request by the South African authorities.\n\nRelatives of Karegeya are deeply sceptical that Kagame will agree to collaborate with the requests for extradition. However, they see the case as an opportunity to expose a pattern of sustained intimidation and targeted extrajudicial killings condoned by the president.\n\nHuman rights campaigners say Rwanda, whose head of state is feted at international conferences for its development record and economic growth rates, has repeatedly sent trained killers to murder opponents abroad, while jailing, intimidating and detaining without charge the few critics that remain at home.\n\n\u201cI highly doubt they will comply,\u201d said Leah Karegeya, the victim\u2019s widow, who now lives in Washington. \u201cBut let\u2019s wait for the first reaction from Kigali.\u201d\n\nFour Rwandans, including Gafaranga and Sugira, were identified in a court in Johannesburg this year as possible perpetrators. They were suspected of booking a room at the Michelangelo in order to ambush Karegeya during the New Year break.\n\nGihana said while there was a plethora of evidence against all four, extradition requests were premised on \u201coverwhelming\u201d as opposed to \u201ccircumstantial\u201d evidence.", "description": "Patrick Karegeya, former Rwandan spy chief, became enemy of President Paul Kagame", "authors": ["Michela Wrong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177a52e4521e5eec56f1bb5e3a7f5b722f6a7954/268_191_1852_1110/master/1852.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d7cd52420cca77d3d94ac6e4029007a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
