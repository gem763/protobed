Which model do you recommend and are there other cars I should investigate in this category, like Audi and BMW?\n\nJustus: There was a time when you could choose between the Mercedes CLS, BMW 6 Series Gran Coup\u00e9 and Audi A7 if you wanted a so-called four-door coup\u00e9 and had about R1 million to spend. The term \u2018coup\u00e9\u2019 does refer to a two-door car, but carmakers have convinced the world that a four-door coup\u00e9 is actually a thing.\n\nBMW has withdrawn the 6 Series Gran Coup\u00e9 and the new Audi A7 is still en route to South Africa, which leaves you with the impressive new Benz CLS. You can have the powerful CLS 400 d for about R1.2 million, but bear in mind that you\u2019ll pay through your nose for every single gadget or luxury item, as is the norm with German cars.\n\nThough the Benz CLS doesn\u2019t have direct competitors at the moment, it makes budgetary sense to consider less obvious alternatives. I can recommend these three: the Audi S5 Sportback quattro (R960 500), the VW Arteon 2.0 TSI 4Motion (R752 600) and the Volvo S90 T6 AWD Inscription (R970 600). The first two also peddle the idea of a four-door coup\u00e9 and all three of them have all-wheel-drive systems, like the Benz. As you might know, this gives a car better grip on the road than one that only drives the front or rear wheels. Each of these streamlined limos is brilliant in its own right.\n\nTo save a fortune, while still getting that sleek coup\u00e9 look you\u2019re after, buy the Honda Civic 1.5T Executive for R517 800. Its comparatively modest 1.5 turbo (petrol) engine only powers the front wheels, but the car is no slouch, spacious inside, gorgeous and extremely refined too. It\u2019s also comprehensively \u201cspecced\u201d, as gearheads say, so you won\u2019t have to fork out extra money for its advanced safety features, like forward collision warning.\n\nGregory: Is a used 2018 Honda Civic Type R a risky option? The retail price for a new Type R is almost R700 000!\n\nJustus: Hondas are generally tough and reliable, and the fourth generation (2018 onward) Type R is one of the best hot hatchbacks ever made, with rocket-ship looks to match. A low-mileage used FK8 Type R will extract around R640 000 from your wallet. Don\u2019t be tempted to buy the inferior previous generation FK2 model. If the FK8 is too dear, rather choose the Civic 1.5T Sport for R484 200, brand new. Also see my comments above on the Civic Executive. It has additional safety features the Sport has to go without, but gives the same strong performance.\n\nFlip and Rhyme also asked about a used car: Is it wise to buy a used Ford Ranger double-cab?\n\nJustus: As always, buy from a dealership whose reputation and good name are important to them. This would usually be the pre-owned arm of a new-car dealership, such as Ford, Mazda, Hyundai and Toyota. The Ranger has a 4-year or 120 000km warranty (whichever comes first), so buy one with as many of those kilometres or months left.\n\nIf you have the time, shop around for a great deal on a new Ranger. Then you can be sure the vehicle wasn\u2019t abused by a careless previous driver. Ford South Africa runs special offers quite often and dealers do it too.\n\nDon\u2019t just shop in your town or city. If you live in Joburg, call the dealer in, for example, Kroonstad. Somewhere out there is a Ford sales manager who\u2019s superkeen on making deals in the same month you\u2019re looking for your dream bakkie. For big bang for your buck, also consider the Mitsubishi Triton, which rides as comfortably on poor road surfaces as the Ranger.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nHave a car question you\u2019d like Justusto answer?
