The next day, the NFL announced that Burfict was suspended for the rest of the season \u2014 the longest punishment in league history for an on-field incident.\n\nThe latest illegal hit apparently will be used as part of the league\u2019s case when Burfict has his appeal heard on Tuesday.\n\nBurfict, who has accumulated more than $5.3 million in fines and stripped salary for rule violations, was ejected in the second quarter on Sunday for a blow that NFL vice president Jon Runyan called \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cflagrant.\u201d\n\nThe appeal hearing will be presided over by former NFL Hall of Fame linebacker Derrick Brooks, jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association.\n\nBurfict\u2019s suspension could be reduced. He incurred a five-game ban for a 2017 hit to a defenceless player that was trimmed to three games upon appeal.\n\nBrooks also oversaw Burfict\u2019s appeal of a three-game suspension in 2016 after a hit upon Antonio Brown, a suspension Brooks upheld.\n\nThe Raiders, without Burfict, will face the Chicago Bears on Sunday at London\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nRaiders coach Jon Gruden supported Burfict after the ban.\n\n\u201cIt hurts our team really bad,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to see what the appeal says. I\u2019m not happy about it. At all.\u201d\n\nBurfict played seven seasons for the Cincinnati Bengals before joining the Raiders this season.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 The National Football League has notified Oakland\u2019s Vontaze Burfict that he made another illegal hit on a defenceless", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/bae65f_burfict-has-notified-by-nfl-disciplinary-officials-he-hit-defenceless-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
