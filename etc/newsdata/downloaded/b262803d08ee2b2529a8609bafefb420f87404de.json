Crimson reporters called ICE for comment (ICE did not respond). According to an online petition circulated by Act on a Dream, this standard reportorial practice showed \u201ccultural insensitivity\u201d to ICE\u2019s record of \u201csurveilling and retaliating against\u201d activists. \u201cIn this political climate, a request for comment is virtually the same as tipping them off,\u201d the petition claimed. For what it\u2019s worth, Crimson editors have averred convincingly that they did not try to contact ICE until after the rally had ended, and would have provided no information about specific attendees, if ICE had granted the paper\u2019s request for an interview. Some 700 people (and about a dozen student organizations, including Harvard College Democrats) have endorsed this petition, with its demand that the paper apologize and change the policy that required it to call ICE for comment. Meanwhile, Act on a Dream and others are refusing contact with Crimson reporters.\n\nThat\u2019s about 700 people, many and perhaps most of them students at the country\u2019s most prestigious university, who have understandable concerns about ICE surveillance, deportations, and the historical treatment of immigrants and other minority groups by the press \u2014 but a warped view of how legitimate, ethical media work. Every responsible news gatherer seeks comment from the named subjects of its coverage; none would accept the self-censorship the petition demands of the Crimson. This is what it means to be an honest broker of information, \u201cwithout fear or favor.\u201d Without organizations willing to take on that sometimes-thankless role, public discussion degenerates into a struggle between competing brands of propaganda. (We emailed a request to Act on a Dream to hear its side of the story, and have not received a reply.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Trump does not get that; we expect more from the next generation\u2019s best and brightest. And indeed, there is cause for hope in this episode. The Crimson\u2019s admirable reaction has been to meet with critics, listen to their concerns \u2014 but stick to principle. \u201cAt stake here, we believe, is one of the core tenets that defines America\u2019s free and independent press,\u201d two top editors, seniors Angela N. Fu and Kristine E. Guillaume, wrote, \u201cthe right \u2014 and prerogative \u2014 of reporters to contact any person or organization relevant to a story. . . . This ensures the article is as thorough, balanced, and unbiased toward any particular viewpoint as possible. A world where news outlets categorically refuse to contact certain kinds of sources \u2014 a world where news outlets let third-party groups dictate the terms of their coverage \u2014 is a less informed, less accurate, and ultimately less democratic world.\u201d We couldn\u2019t have said it better ourselves.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Asking for comment is a basic tenet of newsgathering.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n6_vaF0IO-q5R7tUakspYVl95jA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QP5YSZXXJYI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
