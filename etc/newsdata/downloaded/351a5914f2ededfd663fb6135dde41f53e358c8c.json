The incident is notable because the act of mining a limited number of vessels makes relatively little sense when viewed through the lens of traditional patterns of coercive behavior. Limited coercive acts typically have little value with regards to gaining concessions from a determined opponent. Generally, these acts may serve as a visible demonstration of a state\u2019s willingness to enact some other, more substantial threat, such as shutting down the Strait of Hormuz outright. However, this requires the state making the threat to have the capacity to make good on its more substantial threats and for its opponents to believe that it is willing to incur the risks entailed. Iran, however, could not shut down the Strait of Hormuz for very long even if it wished to\u2014something noted by President Donald Trump\u2014and is unlikely to incur the substantial risks that an attempt would entail. Iran\u2019s opponents, then, clearly don\u2019t see its limited provocations as harbingers of something worse.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Would Tehran do it?
