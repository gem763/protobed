Tourmaline president and CEO Mike Rose as well as chief financial officer Brian Robinson and three independent directors will sit on the board of the new company.\n\n\u201cYou never know what the market is going to do,\u201d Rose said, adding that he was pleased with the reaction to the news but looking over the longer term.\n\n\u201cAll Canadian (exploration and production companies) are in the same boat \u2013 we\u2019re all undervalued,\u201d he said, adding that Topaz was a way for Tourmaline to boost its value.\n\nThe spinout of Topaz continues a trend set in recent years by Encana Corp. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Diamondback Energy Inc. in the U.S., that either spun out or sold off their royalty lands in recent years. In the case of Diamondback, the company spun out parts of its infrastructure in the Permian basin in Texas in 2014 into an entity called Viper Energy Partners LP.\n\nThe Topaz spinoff, however, is unique in Canada in combining the royalty and the infrastructure business in a spinoff, Rose said.\n\nIn each case, the companies spinning out royalty and infrastructure businesses have been rewarded in a challenging market for oil and gas.\n\nWhile Tourmaline values the deal at $775 million, analysts say the deal would have been worth more in the public market \u2014 as much as $1.25 billion \u2014 as energy royalty and infrastructure companies trade at much higher multiples than oil and gas exploration and production companies.\n\nGMP FirstEnergy analyst Robert Fitzmartyn said that Canadian oil and gas companies are currently trading at three to four times their debt-adjusted cash flow.\n\nBy contrast, he said, companies that might compare to the spin-out Topaz are PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. and Keyera Corp. that are trading at multiples of 16- to 18-times their adjusted cash flow \u2013 which demonstrates the large upside to Tourmaline.\n\nSmall- to mid-sized natural gas producers often emulate Tourmaline\u2019s business model as it is one of the largest gas producer in the country by volume, and the move to spin-off Topaz could lead to some other companies following suit.\n\n\u201cI think most boards will prefer to see a little bit longer term. Where is this in six months? How will Topaz look when it goes public?\u201d Fitzmartyn said. \u201cI think though that you\u2019ve got to acknowledge it and weigh the merits of (the spinoff). You\u2019re not doing your fiduciary duty if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCanadian natural gas producers have been challenged by extremely low commodity prices for months and many are trading at or near their historic lows.\n\nFor much of the summer and fall, natural gas at the AECO hub in Alberta fetched under US$1 per thousand cubic feet \u2013 and the commodity fell to a price as low as 7 cents per mcf in September.\n\nAECO has rebounded in recent days to average US$1.61 per mcf on Thursday, according to data from AltaCorp Capital.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "While Tourmaline values the deal at $775 million, analysts say the deal would have been worth more in the public market \u2014 as much as $1.25 billion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/0308_biz_gmo_tourmaline.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
