I\u2019ve seen her and it\u2019s just like Beauty Generation \u2013 they\u2019re just machines, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe Hong Kong connections are there again this year, if far looser, and one comes in the way of Benno Yung Tin-pang\u2019s unfashionable galloper Kungfumaster Panda, who raced against Enable at Newbury two-and-a-half years ago.\n\nThat race in April 2017 was the only time the John Gosden-trained Enable has failed to salute in a glittering 14-start career that has featured 10 Group One victories.\n\nThe five-year-old has been on an upwards trajectory since, while Kungfumaster Panda is on a ratings slide in Hong Kong.\n\nBred and raced by the queen until changing hands for the first time in March last year, Kungfumaster Panda had another 10 starts for two wins after meeting Enable before being shipped off to Hong Kong 12 months ago.\n\nApart from acquiring a catchy new name \u2013 Kungfumaster Panda had 15 starts for four wins when named Maths Prize \u2013 the gelding has achieved little else in Hong Kong.\n\nThe gelding beat home a total of four horses across six starts last season, with his rating dropping from 80 to 62, and Yung was surprised to discover his horse once clashed with and bettered Enable, but also went into bat for the five-year-old.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Yung asked. \u201cHe came to Hong Kong with too high a rating and he\u2019s had some injury issues.\u201d\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if Kungfumaster Panda will ever be seen on a racetrack again, the eyes of the world will be on Enable on Sunday.\n\nChampion jockey Frankie Dettori is unbeaten in 12 rides on the superstar, including both Arcs, and will again be in the saddle.\n\n\u201cA win from Enable will mean history and it will make her immortal. That is my inspiration,\u201d he said.\n\nEnable comes into the race fresh after only three starts this year, including her breathtaking win over Crystal Ocean in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July and a last-start victory over Magical in the Yorkshire Oaks in August.\n\nThe Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained Magical will again be among the challengers at Longchamp, along with stablemate Japan and French Derby winner Sottsass.\n\nWaldgeist, who ran fifth behind Exultant in last year\u2019s Group One Longines Hong Kong Vase (2,400m), is also in the field, while the race boasts a significant Japanese contingent in Fierement, Blast Onepiece and Kiseki.\n\nThe Takahisa Tezuka-trained Fierement looks the most likely of the trio to put in a big showing, while Kiseki will be familiar to Hong Kong fans after finishing back in the field in the 2017 Hong Kong Vase.", "description": "John Moore was only nine when his father George took out the 1959 Group One Prix de L\u2019Arc de Triomphe (2,400m) in a dramatic renewal but he certainly remembers sharing in the spoils....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/05/78841170-e682-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293e_image_hires_161801.JPG?itok=UvuxF527&v=1570263487", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
