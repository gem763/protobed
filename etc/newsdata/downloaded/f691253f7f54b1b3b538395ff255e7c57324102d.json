(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Capitals made their second round of training camp cuts Sunday, sending nine players to the team\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate in Hershey, Pa.\n\nIncluded in those cuts were Brett Leason, the Capitals\u2019 2019 second-round draft pick, who scored his first goal for the team in Saturday\u2019s 3-2 preseason win over the Carolina Hurricanes at Capital One Arena. The Capitals now have 35 players on their training camp roster, with their fourth preseason game Wednesday night on the road against the Chicago Blackhawks. The team is expected to make one more round of cuts before traveling for its final three preseason games.\n\nNHL teams have until Oct. 1 to trim down their roster and get under the salary cap. With a projected 23-man roster, the team is more than $1.3 million over the salary cap ceiling of $81.5 million, according to CapFriendly.com. The Capitals will get some salary-cap relief while Evgeny Kuznetsov is suspended because his $7.8 million cap hit will be off the books until he returns Oct. 8 against the Dallas Stars. Kuznetsov\u2019s suspension will buy them an additional week to become compliant.\n\nOn its first off-day of training camp last Thursday, the team cut 18 players from its preseason roster, sending Canadian junior players and Europeans playing abroad this season back to their respective clubs. Among those names was 2019 first-round draft pick Connor McMichael. McMichael, 18, played in the team\u2019s first two preseason games, impressing Capitals Coach Todd Reirden. McMichael was thought to be a possible third-line center replacement option with center Evgeny Kuznetsov suspended for the first three games of the season.\n\n\u201cMcMichael for him, he is excellent with the puck,\u201d Reirden said before the Capitals\u2019 3-2 win against the St. Louis Blues during the team\u2019s second preseason game. \u201cHis offensive reads and feel for the game has been, I think, very strong for a young player so far and the challenge of playing defense in this team is so important at this level.\u201d\n\nThe following is a running list of players the Capitals have cut in training camp so far. This list will be updated as more cuts are made throughout training camp.\n\nSecond round of cuts on Sept. 22:\n\n\u2666 Kristofers Bindulis (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Tobias Geisser (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Connor Hobbs (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Axel Jonsson-Fjallby (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Brett Leason (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Philippe Maillet (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Bobby Nardella (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Garrett Pilon (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Joe Snively (Hershey)\n\nFirst round of cuts on Sept.19:\n\n\u2666 Connor McMichael (London; OHL)\n\n\u2666 Aliaksei Protas (Prince Albert; WHL)\n\n\u2666 Eric Florchuk (Saskatoon; WHL)\n\n\u2666 Alex Kannok-Leipert (Vancouver; WHL)\n\n\u2666 Damien Riat (Biel; Swiss NLA)\n\n\u2666 Kody Clark (rehab in Hershey; upper-body injury)\n\n\u2666 Riley Sutter (rehab in Hershey; upper-body injury)\n\n\u2666 Casey Bailey (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Erik Burgdoerfer (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Tommy Hughes (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Kale Kessy (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Chris McCarthy (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Matt Moulson (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Logan Thompson (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Matthew Weis (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Steven Whitney (Hershey)\n\n\u2666 Beck Warm (released from ATO)\n\n\u2666 Hayden Hawkey (released from ATO)\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nJonas Siegenthaler is hoping to stick with Capitals from the start this year\n\nBrendan Leipsic, on his fifth team since 2015-16, hopes to find a home with the Capitals\n\nMartin Fehervary is the prospects the Caps can\u2019t stop talking about\n\nRichard Panik, seeking to maintain consistency, optimistic about his future in Washington", "description": "The Capitals will continue to trim down their roster before the Oct. 1 deadline.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "September At Pm", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
