According to both Fox News and Axios, Donald Trump will send Nancy Pelosi a letter today essentially daring her to hold a full House vote on an impeachment inquiry. Until one passes, the letter will declare, the administration will produce no witnesses or documentation for committees attempting an impeachment on the cheap:\n\nThe White House is planning to send Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter as soon as Friday arguing that President Trump and his team can ignore lawmakers\u2019 demands until she holds a full House vote formally approving an impeachment inquiry, 2 sources familiar with the letter tell Axios. Why it matters: By putting in writing the case that Trump and his supporters have been making verbally for days, the White House is preparing for a court fight and arguing to the public that its resistance to Congress\u2019 requests is justified. Trump wants to force House Democrats in vulnerable races to be on the record if they favor pursuing impeachment, these sources tell us.\n\nRepublicans also say the minority party can exert more influence over hearings and other aspects of an inquiry once it is formalized with a vote.\n\nBy calling this an inquiry without holding a vote, Pelosi and the Democratic committee chairmen are having it both ways, one official said. \u201cThey want to be a little bit pregnant.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been \u201ca little bit pregnant\u201d for well nigh unto three years. Until last week\u2019s \u201cAlea iacta est\u201d declaration from Nancy Pelosi, however, Democrats had a way of eliding that fact for political purposes, while still claiming in court the privileges of an impeachment probe. Pelosi\u2019s declaration stripped away that fig leaf, and now Trump wants Pelosi to fish or cut bait.\n\nA full House vote to start an impeachment inquiry therefore holds lower risk for Trump than his current predicament. If the full House does vote to launch a formal impeachment inquiry, then it will look like the effort to remove him has gained momentum \u2026 which it unquestionably has, but only among Democrats. However, it will then force Pelosi to adopt formal impeachment processes, outlined in detail by Kevin McCarthy yesterday, that will afford the GOP and the White House a lot more input and control than either have in the current, chaotic ad hoc process. Most if not all of that reflects historical norms and basic fairness within the American legal/judicial process, but it necessarily will require a restart and a slower pace going forward, neither of which Pelosi would prefer.\n\nThis triple-dog-dare only works if the Trump administration can make good on its threat to completely cut off cooperation without a formal inquiry. It\u2019s unlikely that courts will curtail committee subpoena powers in that kind of a standoff, but the White House can certainly stall House Democrats in court for quite a while first. Courts have already expressed some skepticism about giving the House the range they demand without opening up a formal impeachment process first.\n\nSo far, Democrats don\u2019t think much of McCarthy\u2019s demands or of Trump\u2019s briar-patch play, Fox reported:\n\nA senior Democratic aide told Fox News on Thursday, \u201cAs we continue to follow the facts, it would behoove the president to come up with something more persuasive than Kevin McCarthy\u2019s pathetic and bogus process arguments,\u201d following reports of the White House\u2019s letter to Pelosi, first reported by Axios. \u201cGiven that the president just this morning on national television urged yet another foreign government to meddle in our upcoming 2020 elections, we would think the White House would want to mount a rigorous defense of the president\u2019s clear betrayal of his oath of office,\u201d the aide said.\n\nTrue, but they\u2019d also like a fair opportunity to mount that defense. Why would Democrats object to that?", "description": "\"They want to be a little bit pregnant.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trump-pelosi-sotu.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
