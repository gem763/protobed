She served as National Security adviser in the Obama administration advising the president on Syria policy. She\u2019s also been ambassador to the United Nations. Ambassador Rice, welcome.\n\nSUSAN RICE: Good to be with you, Sacha.\n\nPFEIFFER: We just heard about the situation on the ground in northern Syria. Would you give us a higher-level view? So what are the strategic implications of withdrawing U.S. forces there in terms of the impact regionally and even internationally?\n\nRICE: Sacha, this is nothing short of a self-inflicted strategic catastrophe. The consequences of President Trump\u2019s impetuous decision to withdraw U.S. forces are multiple. First of all, ISIS is going to be able to rejuvenate and reconstitute itself. The New York Times is reporting that we abandoned five dozen high-value terrorists from ISIS that were imprisoned and now are without our protection and detention. We also have the reality that Kurds are being slaughtered and beheaded in the streets by Turkish-backed militia. Russia and Assad\u2019s regime in Syria now have the capacity and, in fact, have been invited by the Kurds to come to their aid and protection because the United States abandoned them.\n\nThe reason why for five years the Kurds have been protected and the Turks have not had the will to intervene and create this catastrophe is because the United States was firm in our support for the Kurds and deterring the Turks. When President Trump made the decision to withdraw U.S. forces, it basically rolled out the red carpet for Erdogan. This is what we have. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s Saigon, and it\u2019s nothing short of catastrophic and shameful.\n\nPFEIFFER: President Trump has repeatedly said that we need to end these endless wars. For people who agree with him and think there are no easy options in Syria, so we should just get out entirely, what\u2019s your response to that?\n\nRICE: Well, the reason why we had a small number \u2013 barely over a thousand U.S. troops \u2013 in Syria was not to topple the regime. It was not to get involved in the Syrian civil conflict. It was to fight a clear and present terrorist threat from ISIS. The reason why they needed to stay after ISIS had been largely debilitated but not entirely defeated is because we have seen time and again in that region \u2013 in Iraq and now in Syria \u2013 what happens when you take the pressure off the terrorists. They reconstitute and come back.\n\nThis was a very economical investment that was begun under the Obama administration and was continued until recently by the Trump administration to put in small numbers of U.S. personnel to provide training and advice and assistance to the Kurds and the Arab forces in northern Syria who were taking the fight to ISIS. So unlike the Iraq ground war, unlike Afghanistan, this was not an American ground war. It was not a war that was costly in terms of casualties for the United States or in terms of resources.\n\nAnd now, because of this withdrawal, all that work, all that investment is going to be at risk of loss because ISIS will have no pressure on it. There\u2019ll be a humanitarian catastrophe for which the United States has blood on its hands. And Russia, Iran and Assad will be the proximate beneficiaries in addition to the Turks.\n\nPFEIFFER: If you were still in a position to be formally advising the president, what would you tell him the U.S. should do now in this situation?\n\nRICE: Well, if I were advising the president, I\u2019d hope he would have taken my advice and not made this decision in the first place. Now, to be pretending that we\u2019re outraged and surprised at what the Turks are doing and talking about post-facto sanctions against Turkey is really a joke. I mean, what we ought to be doing is making very clear to the Turks that we will fight them if necessary to protect the investment we\u2019ve made in counterterrorism in Syria to protect the Kurds.\n\nYou know, we shouldn\u2019t have ever let it get to this point, but we still are the most powerful country militarily in that region. And the Turks wouldn\u2019t be doing this if they thought we were prepared to stop them.\n\nPFEIFFER: This is a situation where even some of the president\u2019s biggest backers like Lindsey Graham are very critical of this move. In about the 30 seconds we have left, what do you see as the likely political fallout for President Trump from this?\n\nRICE: I\u2019m not a political prognostician, and I don\u2019t know. I do know that this is such an egregious assault on our national security and our national interests delivered to us by the president of the United States that refreshingly, even his most (unintelligible) allies are appalled and concerned.\n\nPFEIFFER: That\u2019s Ambassador\u2026\n\nRICE: But what are they prepared to do about it? I don\u2019t know.\n\nPFEIFFER: That\u2019s Ambassador Susan Rice. Her new memoir \u201cTough Love: My Story Of The Things Worth Fighting For\u201d is out now. Thank you for your time.\n\nRICE: Thank you, Sacha.", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of NPR's \"All Things Considered,\" former Obama administration National Security Adviser Susan Rice said President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw troops in Syria is akin to the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War in 1 | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/Susan-Rice-APManuel-Balce-Ceneta.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
