This is the New India story . 65% youth is a major global advantage but its a window of three decades that we have to propel India to the forefront because after thirty years this advantage becomes a disadvantage with the majority of youth country turning into a majority of old . This is the situation of Japan today and we have to learn our lessons .\n\nThe name India is ringing all over the world . Even in a powerful country like America, the youth of India have usurped major leadership positions , especially in Silicon valley. But this young Indian has to struggle for employment in India. The reason for this is the increase in age of retirement due to politics of vote in government jobs. Those vacant posts arising due to retirement for which the rightful claimants were the youth, stand deprived .\n\nToday\u2019s youth is beginning to believe in self-employment. If those who go by self-employment can get encouragement and assistance and get success in good quantity, then emulating them, a large section who keeps looking for government jobs, will also veer towards self-employment. Startup is not an easy path to tread , but those who wish to work harder, who are not scared of accepting challenges and who are not averse to taking the risk should go for it . And the current generation , unlike ours whose sole aim was stability , is ready to invest their years into entrepreneurship. It has also been seen that those young people who want to do something novel are threatened by their parents aversion to risk and push them to take up a stable government or bank job. Our generation is conditioned to this thought process and we force our children to follow us .\n\nLet us now see how in India we redeem the startup and improve the employability of our youth. The way in which the Right to Education Act has shaped up across the whole country, encouraging any child to go to the nearby private school, in the same way any youth who has dreams and q viable idea should be encouraged so that he could not only be gainfully employed but develop an enterprise that could hire others. There is also another deterrent and that is only a few Indian cities like Mumbai , Delhi , Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune have the startup ecosystem which gives youth the kick to perform .\n\nHere\u2019s the solution \u2013 Jawahar Formula 1\n\nJust as every private school in the vicinity educates 25% poor children every year under the right to education act , in the same way every industry with a turnover of 50 crores will help in the creation of 25 young entrepreneurs. A grant of Rs. 1 lakh per annum per youth for 25 youth would be provisioned by the industry along with a basic working infrastructure. The process would be that the local youth get the opportunity to present their plans in the final year of the college by the industry and a jury selects 25 people . This process is undertaken by every industry with a turnover of more than 50 crores . After nurturing them for two years, with a quarterly periodic mentoring, it will be seen which of these ideas are workable solutions and the entrepreneurs are thrown open to the larger ecosystem. And then the cycle continues.\n\nGenerally it has been seen that only 20% success rate is achieved in startups and if this percentage is applied here too, then if the top 10000 industries in India take 25 young people then 2.5 lakh youth can work on their own and if If 20% of these are successful then 50000 self-employed youth with their own ventures will be ready. Such startups provide employment to 12 young people which is likely to go up by 50 percent in two years. 50000 start-ups can give up to 6 lakh youth in the first year and this can grow to 9 lakhs per year in the coming years.\n\nIn this way the youth gets the required support and financial assistance locally . In view of proper policy formulation and CSR fund deployment, the industry will get some tax rebates on this spend . Add to that the industry gets some equity share from the incubatee startup . After two years the government could handhold these successful startups . In today\u2019s startup world, less experienced people become mentors, and young people can not get proper guidance. But if an experienced industrialist is mentoring, the real life benefit of the experience can be reaped by young people, hence lesser likelihood of failure.\n\nIt would be a good way for the industry to become a partner in the advancement of the youth of #NewIndia , preventing youth from migrating and generating employment. This formula will create entrepreneurship hubs within the state and there will be equitable growth across the country .", "description": "Jawahar Formula 1 Every nook and corner of India is youth .
