Authorities have referred 19 children to U.S. Health and Human Services as a result of this investigation. Another 50 migrants fraudulently claimed to be unaccompanied minors.\n\n\u201cSome of the most disturbing cases identified involve transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and individuals who are increasingly exploiting innocent children to further their criminal activity,\u201d ICE said in a statement.\n\nIn some cases, criminal organizations made deals with the children\u2019s biological parents to transfer children as young as 4 months old to the U.S. and pose as a family unit either for human smuggling purposes or to fraudulently obtain immigration benefits, ICE said.\n\n\u201cThese are examples of the dark side of this humanitarian crisis that our Border Patrol and HSI agents are working tirelessly to identify,\u201d said El Paso Sector Interim Chief Gloria Chavez. \u201cWe will pursue the highest of judicial consequences for those who commit fraud and exploit innocent children.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has attempted to end the \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy for migrant family units, which provides migrant families an expedited release into the U.S. as their asylum cases are being processed.\n\nThen\u2013acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan said last month that the vast majority of migrant families who enter the country illegally will no longer be eligible for \u201ccatch and release\u201d due to the implementation of stricter policies. One such policy, the Migrant Protection Protocols, requires that migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "U.S. immigration authorities have discovered hundreds of instances at the border of \u201cfamily unit fraud,\u201d or unrelated individuals posing as families, over the last six months thanks to a new investigative initiative.Authorities exposed 238 fraudulent families presenting 329 false documents, according", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Denj3QErs4zLy.k_w0cwGg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/4ca6dfac9458f3316847b182f7552317", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
