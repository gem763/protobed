However, O\u2019Rourke shared a screenshot and called it a death threat:\n\nThis is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn't own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else. pic.twitter.com/jsiZmwjMDs \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told CNN it plans to report the message to the FBI.\n\nCain later called O\u2019Rourke \u201ca child\u201d and taunted the people who had reported his message.\n\n\u201cCool bro,\u201d he wrote to one.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has made gun control a central message of his campaign, especially after last month\u2019s mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, which left 22 people dead. The message Cain initially responded to was a partial quote from Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate, in which O\u2019Rourke was asked about his proposed mandatory buyback of assault weapons.\n\n\u201cCritics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns, and how would this work?\u201d asked debate moderator David Muir.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said assault weapons were designed for a battlefield, not for hunting or personal protection.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nLast year, Cain was thrown out of the state Democratic convention after trying to distribute prank gun control signs, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported at the time. One attendee accused him of brandishing a gun at the event.\n\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News, Cain told his fellow lawmakers earlier this year that he has Asperger syndrome and said: \u201cSometimes the things I say or do may come off completely different from what I intended.\u201d\n\nUsers on social media called out Cain for posting the threatening message and many said they had reported it:\n\nThreatening to murder someone w/ your gun is not a great argument against having that gun taken away. \u2014 Mangy Jay (@magi_jay) September 13, 2019\n\nThis man threatening to shoot Beto O\u2019Rourke is a TEXAS STATE LEGISLATOR.\n\n\n\nGun extremism is dangerous and deadly. And allowing people like this to write our nation\u2019s gun laws has given America a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high income country. #txlege https://t.co/WU2CgxG51f \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) September 13, 2019\n\nA state rep threatening murder. welcome to Y'all Qaeda. \u2014 Danny Deraney (@DannyDeraney) September 13, 2019\n\nThis language is dangerous. We, as Texas electeds, have to be better. Language like this contributes to deaths. https://t.co/bdO38AtX1F \u2014 Erin Zwiener (@ErinForYall) September 13, 2019\n\nIf you need a gun to talk tough or feel like a man, @BriscoeCain, you\u2019re a fucking coward. \u2014 Bradley Whitford (@BradleyWhitford) September 13, 2019\n\nIn case you forgot, people were just killed in El Paso. People were murdered. The language you are using and the way you are using it is dangerous. We need leaders who want to change our culture of violence. #txlege https://t.co/4pjgJjTN4A \u2014 Dr. Mary E.

That kind of statement is why I have no problem with gun control.\n\n\n\nNice ratio, Sparky.
