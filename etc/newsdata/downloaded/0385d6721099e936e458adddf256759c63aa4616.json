I was in so much pain, I would cry like a baby every night,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhen he couldn\u2019t take the pain anymore, Ntokozo decided to visit a private doctor, Dr MS Moola, based in KwaMashu.\n\n\u201cI went there on 16 October and I paid R190 for pain medication and I was told to come back after five days. He said there was a boil underneath the affected tooth.\u201d\n\nHowever, when he returned on 22 October, Ntokozo got more than he bargained for. In fact, he wishes he never went back to remove the tooth that gave him sleepless nights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been in so much pain in my life. I felt everything that was happening in my mouth. His hand was inside my mouth and I could feel the forceps grinding my tooth in pieces,\u201d he said.\n\nNtokozo claims when the dentist was done, he was given a mirror to see his mouth, which was in tatters. \u201cI was shocked to see my mother in that state. It didn\u2019t look like my mouth. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nHe claims when he asked the dentist about this, Dr Moola allegedly blamed Ntokozo\u2019s mouth. \u201cHe said my mouth was too small that\u2019s why the procedure didn\u2019t go well.\u201d\n\nNtokozo, who survives on piece jobs, says he was told to pay R300 to have his mouth stitched up. \u201cI was sent to another doctor who stitched me up, but I am no longer the same. I couldn\u2019t eat for weeks and survived on liquids like juice and porridge.\u201d\n\nHe reveals that because of the way his mouth now looks, his confidence has taken a knock as well,.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I am normal. I am still in pain, this doctor ruined my life. I will never be the same again.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Drum Dr Moola confirms that Ntokozo\u2019s mouth got cut during the procedure. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional, his mouth was too small that\u2019s why it got cut while trying to root out his tooth.\u201d He says he did not make him pay for the mistake to be fixed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I covered the cost to have another doctor stitch him up. But he can come back to the surgery to examine the damage,\u201d Dr Moola says.", "description": "A 26-year-old man had his mouth cut open when he allegedly went for a tooth-extraction procedure recently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9539/ff9cf71fb08c4cd88e79688d65ebf8e7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
