Here are a few things we didn\u2019t know last Sunday.\n\n1. Threats and bribes were the norm in Soviet hotels\n\nFor a proper Fawlty Towers experience, it was hard to beat a hotel stay in the Soviet Union. Marcel Theroux recounted a few memories for Telegraph Travel. \u201cThe phrase \u2018na remont\u2019 \u2013 closed for repair \u2013 was one that even non-Russian-speakers found themselves able to recognize after a few days in the country, while eating in hotel restaurants was an experience with the dark absurdity of a play by Ionesco, involving tears, threats, bribes, and broad farce. The menus were imaginary, the waiters on the take, food never arrived, and every now and again a raucous Russian wedding party would tear loose.\n\n\u201cYes for all that inconvenience \u2013 the atmosphere of suspicion, the officiousness at the front desk, the minuscule cakes of soap, abrasive toilet paper and unpredictable showers \u2013 I do feel a certain fondness for those times.\u201d\n\nRead the full story.\n\nSoviet hotels were big \u2013 but not beautiful Credit: GETTY More\n\n2. Britain\u2019s best airport? It\u2019s Doncaster\n\nDoncaster Sheffield Airport handled just 1.2m passengers last year, and only four airlines offer services from it. Which might help explain why it has just been named Britain\u2019s best air travel hub in a Which? survey \u2013 ahead of far busier rivals like Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester. Customers raved about its \u201csmall and uncrowded\u201d feel and \u201cshort or non-existent\u201d queues. The \u201cpersonable and helpful\u201d staff were also praised. The UK\u2019s second best airport? It\u2019s another minnow: plucky Southend.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n3. The German word for \u2018slug\u2019 is a thing of beauty\n\nTricky to learn and sometimes hard on the ears, the German language has a bad rep. But Paul Sullivan, a Berlin resident for over a decade, has nothing but praise for it. \u201cHow can you be down on a language with unique words like \u2018kummerspeck\u2019 (\u2018grief bacon\u2019, the fat gained through eating comfort food), and \u2018arschgeige\u2019 (\u2018arse violin\u2019, which is a heavy insult)?\n\n\u201cThen there are the hilariously literal words, especially those for animals: a skunk is a \u2018stink animal\u2019 (\u2018stinktier\u2019); a sloth is a lazy animal (\u2018faultier\u2019); and a small dog is a foot horn (\u2018fusshupe\u2019). My favourite, though, is slug, which in German is simply a naked snail (\u2018nacktschnecke\u2019).\u201d\n\nRead the full story.\n\n4. Downton Abbey has done funny things to the Cotswolds\n\nMost people hadn\u2019t heard of Bampton before Downton Abbey aired in 2010 \u2013 it was just another Cotswold village, outshined by the likes of Burford, Minster Lovell and Bourton-on-the-Water.\n\nNow, however, you can expect to see coaches full of tourists and a curious blurring of fiction and reality. Locals, who are getting a little miffed at the influx of selfie-seekers, say they often find people wandering among the graves, looking for headstone of Matthew Crawley \u2013 a character from the show.\n\nFor more horror stories from the village, read the full report by Lottie Gross.\n\nNot everybody loves Downton Abbey Credit: FOCUS FEATURES/JAAP BUITENDIJK More\n\nStory continues", "description": "One week older, one week wiser.
