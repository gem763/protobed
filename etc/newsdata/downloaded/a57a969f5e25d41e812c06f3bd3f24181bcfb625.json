Other than the fact that this is a step in a direction of an obvious ground for impeachment it\u2019s not clear to me that it\u2019s meaningfully different than what the committee has been doing all along,\u201d he said.\n\nUltimately, both Mr. Schwinn and Mr. Dewey are unsure how much traction Democrats will be able to get on this for impeachment, but expect Republicans will seize the opportunity to whip up their supporters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much it will move the needle at all and I think it will equally fire up the Republican base. Because Corey Lewandowski is going to come out fighting,\u201d Mr. Dewey said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
