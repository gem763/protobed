He met the ball, his brother screamed \u201chit it\u201d, David de Gea was beaten from distance and the 19-year-old knew life would never be quite the same again.\n\n\u201cI can just remember the loudest roar I\u2019ve ever heard in the Gallowgate,\u201d he says, his smile as wide as the Tyne. \u201cIt was all a bit surreal.\u201d\n\n\u00a3511m debt but dividends galore: the Glazers\u2019 legacy at Manchester United | David Conn Read more\n\nAs a schoolboy growing up by the mouth of the river in North Shields, he was obsessed with Newcastle United but never dared imagine that, this month, he would make his Premier League debut against Manchester United playing alongside his 21-year-old sibling, Sean, in central midfield. The idea that he might score the winning goal for Steve Bruce\u2019s previously struggling team in a 1-0 win at St James\u2019 Park belonged strictly to the realms of fantasy.\n\n\u201cWhen you get back to the halfway line and you hear the crowd singing your name it\u2019s mental,\u201d says Matty. \u201cAs a young lad it\u2019s what you\u2019ve always wanted. But when it actually happened it was indescribable. It still feels weird getting [congratulatory] texts from my mates.\u201d\n\nAfter the game he said thank you to Bruce. Manners matter to the Longstaffs\u2019 parents, David \u2013 a former Great Britain ice hockey player \u2013 and Michelle but if such politeness reflected his upbringing it was also sincere.\n\n\u201cIt was only right,\u201d says Matty, who earns around \u00a3850 a week but seems set for a significantly enhanced contract. \u201cI can\u2019t thank him enough. It was a brave move putting me in and backing a kid. He\u2019d been getting a lot of stick; a lot of managers under pressure at such a big club in such an important game would have gone for experience.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The brothers grew up in North Shields and supported Newcastle. They also have a younger sister who is a promising netball player. Photograph: ncjMedia Ltd\n\nWith his bonfire-bright ginger hair and adhesive first touch, Matty has, inevitably, been likened to Paul Scholes while Sean\u2019s elegant, straight-backed passing style meant he was hyped as the new Michael Carrick when he broke into Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side last season.\n\nFlattered as the siblings are, there is arguably a better comparison. Considering their younger sister, 15-year-old Milly, is an outstanding netballer, the Longstaffs may just be Tyneside\u2019s answer to the Neville family.\n\n\u201cTwo footballer brothers and an England netballer sister,\u201d says Sean. \u201cWe\u2019ve said to Milly: \u2018We\u2019ve done our little bit, it\u2019s up to you now.\u2019 She\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\nThe boys are talking in a decoratively tired backroom at Newcastle\u2019s training ground but their enthusiasm and sheer niceness refreshes it in a way two coats of fresh paint could not rival.\n\nTheir mother has said the pair \u201creally love each other\u201d and they look slightly startled at being asked whether her words damaged their street cred.\n\n\u201cWe genuinely do love each other,\u201d says Sean, firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be there for each other, always keep each other pretty level. There\u2019s not loads of people you can trust, so to have your brother out there alongside you, knowing he\u2019s got your back, is special.\n\n\u201cWe used to fight a lot and my mam once had to ask Newcastle\u2019s coaches to have a word and tell us to behave but we got it out of the way at a young age. We realised we had to help each other.\u201d\n\nIf mutual devotion has long trumped minor disagreements, the pair remain different, with Matty more extrovert and Sean stronger academically. Whereas the latter progressed smoothly through Newcastle\u2019s youth system, impressing hugely in nine first-team appearances last spring before a serious knee injury abridged his season, Matty\u2019s trajectory proved more complicated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matty Longstaff celebrates scoring the winner on his Newcastle debut against Manchester United. \u2018The emotion was crazy,\u2019 says Sean. \u2018It was even better than when I scored my first goal because of what he\u2019d been through.\u2019 Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty\n\n\u201cWhen he was 10 or 11 Newcastle turned him away,\u201d says Sean. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him crying about it. He said: \u2018No one will ever do that to me again.\u2019 From then on he\u2019s worked so hard. It\u2019s why I got a bit emotional when he scored. I filled up and thought: \u2018I can\u2019t start crying.\u2019 The emotion was crazy. It was just pure happiness. It was even better than when I scored my first goal, just because of the occasion and knowing what he\u2019d been through.\u201d\n\nVisceral as the emotions surrounding it remain, Newcastle\u2019s initial rejection was possibly the making of Matty. \u201cIt really pissed me off,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it fired me up.\u201d\n\nEuro 2020, Women's Champions League and Reading \u2013 Football Weekly Extra Read more\n\nBack at North Shields Juniors, Sunderland tried to sign him several times but he refused to countenance the notion and Middlesbrough received similarly short shrift: \u201cI said: \u2018Stop asking, there\u2019s only one club for me.\u2019 Fortunately I got back to Newcastle.\u201d\n\nWith Michelle dedicating almost every evening to driving her children to football, netball or cricket practice and spending weekends cheering them on from frequently windswept touchlines, sport shaped their lives. \u201cWe were brought up quite strictly,\u201d says Matty who, like Sean, is also a fine cricketer. \u201cWe had jokes and everything but our parents disciplined us.\u201d\n\nAfter a year in Stockholm, where their father played for Djurg\u00e5rden, the family debated emigrating to Canada. It was a sliding doors moment but England\u2019s north-east coast ultimately won the argument, leaving Longstaff Sr on course for his current role as player-coach at Whitley Warriors.\n\nBefore kick-off against Manchester United I looked at Matty and thought, to have two brothers from North Shields starting alongside each other, felt pretty crazy\n\nWhereas the 45-year-old is a veteran, his sons\u2019 on-pitch synchronicity belies their novice status. \u201cPlaying alongside my brother makes it a lot easier,\u201d says Matty. \u201cHe\u2019s so composed.\u201d\n\nSean shakes his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done what he\u2019s done at 19. We were in a tough situation and Matty\u2019s controlled the tempo of a Premier League game on his debut.\u201d\n\nIf the Longstaffs have made North Shields famous for more than its fish quay, Georgian houses and international ferry terminus, their stabilising presence seems imperative at Chelsea on Saturday. \u201cThis season\u2019s been turbulent,\u201d says Sean. \u201cNow it\u2019s about the dressing room sticking together. As long as we\u2019re all fighting for each other we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nLiverpool fans fuming over Amazon's 8pm Boxing Day fixture change Read more\n\nHe is more worried about Milly\u2019s adolescence in a small town where everybody recognises her celebrity siblings and heads turn when they take their regular place in the crowd at non-league North Shields. \u201cIt can be hard for her at school when everyone\u2019s talking about us; we try to make sure she doesn\u2019t read too much social media. That\u2019s the not so great side of it. We can\u2019t thank her enough for the sacrifices she\u2019s made for us.\u201d\n\nShola Ameobi, who played alongside his brother Sammy at St James\u2019, offers informed advice and a challenge has been set by George and Ted Robledo, Chilean siblings who helped Newcastle to 1952 FA Cup final glory against Arsenal with George scoring the only goal.\n\nReprising that feat is for the future though; right now the Longstaffs are content to hold their own in a changing room staffed with players from a dozen countries including Argentina, Brazil, Ghana and Paraguay.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cThe Premier League\u2019s so worldwide,\u201d says Sean. \u201cBefore kick-off against Manchester United I looked across at Matty and thought that to have two brothers from North Shields starting alongside each other felt pretty crazy.
