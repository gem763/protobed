Strike\u2019s Economic Toll: Idle Trucks, Packed Warehouses", "language": "en", "text": "The truck drivers at Phoenix Transit & Logistics in Dearborn, Mich., are long gone. Around three dozen of the trailers they once ferried between auto plants \u2014 packed with dashboards, engine components, lights and other parts for General Motors \u2014 are sitting in a lot with nowhere to go.\n\nIt\u2019s an increasingly familiar scene as the strike against G.M. by the United Auto Workers enters its fourth week. From suppliers to shippers to restaurants, the impact of the work stoppage is spreading through the web of businesses whose fates are tied to the biggest American automaker.\n\nWael Tlaib, the owner of Phoenix Transit & Logistics, said he had laid off nearly his entire staff, including 80 drivers, and had dipped into his personal savings to keep his company afloat. \u201cI might lose the business next week,\u201d Mr. Tlaib said.\n\nThe most intense economic pain is being felt in the industrial Midwest, where G.M.\u2019s network of plants and suppliers is thickest. It is a difficult time for the region\u2019s manufacturing industry, which even before the strike was contending with slowing auto sales, a weakening global economy and the trade war.", "description": "Much of the pain from the strike, now in its fourth week, is concentrated in the northern Midwest, which was already contending with a manufacturing slowdown.", "authors": ["Nelson D.
