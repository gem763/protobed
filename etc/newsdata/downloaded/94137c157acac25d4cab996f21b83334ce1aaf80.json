REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe bank\u2019s shares slipped nearly 2% as revenue at three of its four major businesses fell, led by a 15% drop in investment banking revenue because of lower advisory and underwriting fees.\n\nAt the bank\u2019s investing and lending division, which will have to wear the collapse in the value of WeWork owner The We Company as well as in other major market launches this year, net revenue fell 40% from last year to $662 million.\n\nAnalysts had estimated that Goldman would book a loss of over $250 million from its stake in WeWork in the third quarter. Goldman executives on Tuesday declined to comment on its stake in the office-sharing startup.\n\nBefore its botched public debut, WeWork\u2019s valuation plummeted from a peak of $47 billion in January to as low as $10-12 billion, Reuters reported last month. Uber\u2019s shares are down 24% since the company debuted earlier this year.\n\nThe only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for nearly a third of its overall revenue, but a 6% growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in its other major businesses.\n\n\u201cOverall, GS posted mixed results this quarter. While the top line beat to us was a positive, it was driven by more trading which tends to be less persistent and investment banking results were weak,\u201d analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nBond trading revenue was up 8%, while equities rose 5%. JPMorgan also reported a surge in bond trading.\n\nWall Street\u2019s biggest banks are facing several challenges in growing their revenue, largely due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and concerns about further interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nUnder Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, Goldman has undertaken a major shift in strategy from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets.\n\nGoldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.\n\nSolomon has pushed his top lieutenants to bring in at least $5 billion of new revenue from those businesses by 2020.\n\nThe bank\u2019s net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 27% to $1.79 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.45 billion a year ago. Earnings per share fell to $4.79 from $6.28 a year earlier.\n\nTotal net revenue fell 6% to $8.32 billion.\n\nA Goldman Sachs sign is seen above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in the Manhattan borough of New York January 24, 2014.
