An online petition asking the state to \u201cfind a better solution\u201d had gathered more than 2,000 signatures as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStudy: A new bridge close to Bay Bridge would provide most traffic relief\n\nProblems began after the Maryland Transportation Authority, which operates the bridge, suspended two-way traffic on the westbound span Sept. 24. State officials said eastbound traffic could no longer use a lane of the wider westbound span in the evenings because two-way traffic would be unsafe while the westbound lanes are narrowed to rebuild part of the bridge deck.\n\nUnder grilling from the state\u2019s Board of Public Works on Wednesday, Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said he understood that Friday was a \u201cmiserable day\u201d for motorists. He said the state had publicized the expected backups \u201call summer long,\u201d but unseasonably warm weather drew more beach traffic than expected for a fall weekend and more than one \u201cincident\u201d made things worse.\n\n\u201cI admit that clearly what happened was not anticipated, and we did not have a response already in an advance plan for it,\u201d Rahn told the board during its regular meeting in Annapolis. \u201cI apologize to the public for what they experienced last Friday. We\u2019re doing everything we can to address this going forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRahn said the state is focusing on keeping traffic moving, even if it backs up. Following the Friday problems, he said, the authority decided to open the westbound span for two-way traffic when eastbound backups are \u201cespecially bad.\u201d Because of the narrower lanes, he said, speed limits will be reduced to between 25 and 35 mph, and commercial trucks won\u2019t be permitted during two-way traffic.\n\nHogan says adding a third Bay Bridge span is \u201conly\u201d traffic relief option\n\nMaryland officials had previously announced following the Friday backups that there will be \u201ccashless tolling\u201d at the bridge from noon to 10 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays throughout the repair project. Motorists without an E-ZPass transponder won\u2019t have to stop at a toll booth. Instead, they will receive a bill for the $4 toll in the mail but will not have to pay the additional video tolling fee.\n\nRahn said the state also is working with the contractor to try to complete the project in one year, rather than two.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut with the $27 million project long scheduled, some state leaders said the authority should have done more to prevent the problem.\n\nComptroller Peter Franchot (D), one of the three members of the Board of Public Works, said he had heard \u201ca lot of anger and frustration\u201d from motorists.\n\nFranchot said the state hadn\u2019t done enough ahead of time to prevent the \u201chorrible traffic mess,\u201d such as by meeting with major employers to try to encourage teleworking, ride sharing and other efforts to reduce bridge traffic.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re going to get it right having not gotten it right so far with advanced planning,\u201d Franchot told Rahn. \u201c \u2026 Somebody dropped the ball.\u201d\n\nFranchot later announced that he would encourage his 80 employees who commute from the Eastern Shore to adjust their work hours, work from home and carpool when possible.\n\nErin Cox contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "A major repair project is scheduled to cause traffic delays for two years.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/doD8XYZjpztjJEl3qPTznJRk9gk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7IYP5HFF2MI6DKAR5EA3JJXCGE.jpg"}
