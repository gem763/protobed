Three friends of hers, who are also accused of extortion, were arrested last week.\n\nMr Chinmayanand, a 73-year-old former lawmaker, is a member of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHe served as a federal minister under former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.\n\nMr Chinmayanand's lawyer, Om Singh, told BBC Hindi that local police had registered a case of extortion against the woman and her friends on 24 August.\n\n\"Mr Chinmayanand received a text on his mobile phone demanding 50 million rupees ($700,000; \u00a3564,000), or they would make obscene videos of him publicly available. But we knew that there was nothing like this,\" Mr Singh said.\n\nIt's unclear what videos the alleged text refers to, but his accuser has told local media that she recorded her encounters with Mr Chinmayanand through a camera hidden in her glasses - she also said she has handed over 43 such videos to investigators who are looking into her allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nThe case has since been transferred to a special team investigating the allegations against both parties.\n\nThe woman, who was a student at one of several colleges run by the politician, alleges that the abuse lasted for months. She claims that he showed her a video of her bathing and blackmailed her into having sex with him.\n\nMr Chinmayanand has denied the allegations but was subsequently charged with \"misusing authority\" for sex - a lesser offence than rape - as well as stalking, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation.\n\nIf found guilty, he could face up to 10 years in jail.", "description": "An Indian law student has been sent to jail for 14 days after being arrested for alleged extortion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13A7C/production/_108880508_chin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
