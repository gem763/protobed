Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran of Iraq, quickly slammed Trump\u2019s tweet as \u201cbeyond repugnant,\u201d adding: \u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Robert Jeffress said in an interview Sunday (see the video above) that \u201cremoving the president\u201d will \u201ccause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never seen them more angry,\u201d Jeffress said of evangelicals.\n\nJeffress, a right-wing pastor based in Dallas and powerful Trump supporter, has said that Jews are going to hell. He has characterized both Islam and Mormonism as heresies from the \u201cpit of hell,\u201d and called evangelical Christians who don\u2019t support Trump \u201cmorons.\u201d\n\n....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant. https://t.co/a5Bae7bP7g \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) September 30, 2019\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) also slammed Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reprehensible way to talk and people could get hurt,\u201d Schatz warned. He added that this \u201cisn\u2019t about partisan teams anymore.\u201d\n\nThis is just a reprehensible way to talk and people could get hurt. This isn\u2019t about partisan teams anymore - it\u2019s clear now he will allow the Republican Party to eat itself and will tear the country apart if he thinks it gives him an advantage of any kind. https://t.co/Sg2U76BYFS \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) September 30, 2019\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) cited Trump\u2019s warning in a tweet and wondered if Republicans will now support the impeachment inquiry against the president \u2014 and condemn him in \u201cstrong, unequivocal terms.\u201d\n\nHey @brianschatz - question:\n\n\n\nThe President just said that if Congress impeaches him, his suppporters will rise up in armed insurrection. \u201cCivil War\u201d, he says.\n\n\n\nSo tomorrow will Senate Republicans\n\n\n\na. support impeachment inquiry; or\n\nb. condemn him in strong unequivocal terms \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 30, 2019\n\nIn addition to the outrage expressed by politicians against Trump\u2019s tweet, other followers of the president were stunned:\n\nif Obama had ever openly called for a civil war, Fox News would have totally lost their collective minds. Hannity would have shit red-hot cinder blocks. the incandescent furor from the wingnut outrage-industrial complex would have torn a fucking hole in the space/time continuum \u2014 Jeff Tiedrich (@itsJeffTiedrich) September 30, 2019\n\nAny president who would prefer civil war to being removed from office does not love their country and is certainly not serving it \u2014 Katie Mack (@AstroKatie) September 30, 2019\n\nAnd Democrats:\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t promoting Civil War another article of impeachment?\n\n\n\nI think so. \u2014 Michelangelo Signorile (@MSignorile) September 30, 2019\n\nA president calling for their own country\u2019s civil war is a \u201chigh crime\u201d\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t @ me. \u2014 Liddle\u2019 LeGate \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@williamlegate) September 30, 2019\n\nSo far this weekend, Donald Trump has called for executing whistleblowers and members of Congress, and threatened a new civil war if the impeachment process continues.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the president* doing this. Does anyone see a problem with that? \u2014 Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) September 30, 2019", "description": "Illinois Rep.
