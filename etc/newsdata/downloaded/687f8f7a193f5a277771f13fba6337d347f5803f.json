For any questions, please contact: events@politico.eu**\n\nThe European Commission has set its climate vision for 2050, supporting the objective of climate neutrality, and the different pathways proposed for the transition to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy. This includes decarbonization of the energy sector.\n\nIn April, more than half of EU countries signed a political declaration on decarbonized gas in which they commit to promote hydrogen and maximize using the existing gas grid to accommodate more low-carbon gas, such as bio-methane and other renewable gases. The move comes as industry tries to embrace the fact that natural gas will need to gradually play a smaller role to meet the EU\u2019s decarbonization path, which is why the sector aims to reposition itself as a provider of renewable gases.\n\nHowever, not all countries share the same vision for the role of low-carbon gas in the EU\u2019s energy mix, and the Greens warned that the bloc should fully phase out fossil fuels by the middle of this century if wants to meet the Paris Agreement. All eyes are now on the next Commission which is set to propose a legislative reform of the EU\u2019s gas rules to make room for more sources of decarbonized gas.\n\nQuestions to be addressed include:\n\nRenewable gas, biomethane, hydrogen and bioLNG, what qualifies as lower-carbon gas? What do we mean by green gas?\n\nWhat role can decarbonized/green gas play in the energy systems? Will natural gas play a role in the medium and long-term future?\n\nHow can cleaner gas help decarbonize industrial, transport and heating sectors? What is the outlook for 2030 and beyond?\n\nDoes the EU need more infrastructure for these new sources of green gas?\n\nDo we need to decentralize the gas system as we did for the electricity system?\n\nFollow us live on Thursday, October 3rd at 6:00 PM CET\n\nFollow us on Twitter using #EnergyVisions\n\nFor more information, please contact us by email at events@politico.eu.\n\nPhotography and filming \u2014 There will be photography and/or filming at this event and your image may be captured by us and used for our business and promotional purposes in print or on our website.
