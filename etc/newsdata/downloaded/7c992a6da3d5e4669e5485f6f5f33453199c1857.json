The Indspire Awards annually honour Indigenous success and achievement. A simulcast of the show will broadcast on CBC Radio, CBC Television and CBC Gem on June 23, 2019 at 8 p.m. (8:30 p.m. NT).\n\nIn celebration of Indigenous Book Club Month and National Indigenous History Month, Horn shared a book she loved reading: Son of a Trickster by Eden Robinson.\n\n\"Son of a Trickster is one of my favourite novels by an Indigenous author. Eden Robinson found a way to mix traditional west coast supernatural beings in a new dark modern world. I'm a Mohawk from the east coast and we have our own stories, but it is refreshing and comforting when you sit to read and know it is a truly authentic voice.\"", "description": "Kaniehtiio Horn is a Mohawk actress known for her role on Letterkenny and as host of the podcast Coffee with my Ma.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5183318.1561054707!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/son-of-a-trickster-recommended-by-tiio-horn.png"}
