I should not have done that,\u201d Trudeau acknowledged late Wednesday night. \u201cI should have known better but I didn't, and I am really sorry.\u201c\n\nTrudeau also admitted that he had also dressed up in such a way in high school for a talent show.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

But now I know better,\u201d he told the media aboard his campaign plane.\n\nThe first-term prime minister is running neck-and-neck in a tough campaign, with a Canadian federal election scheduled for Oct. 21.\n\nThe incident risks damaging Trudeau's already fragile brand.\n\nHe's made fighting racism a central pillar of his politics \u2014 he's increased Canadian immigration levels, and included numerous visible minorities in his Cabinet.\n\nThe first political opponent to speak out following the story\u2019s publication was the leader of the left-wing NDP \u2014 Jagmeet Singh, a son of immigrants from India.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling. It\u2019s insulting,\u201d Singh told reporters.\n\n\u201cAnytime we hear examples of brownface, or blackface, it\u2019s making a mockery of someone for what they\u2019ve lived and what their lived experiences are. I think he needs to answer for it.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2018s main election opponent called the incident \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike all Canadians, I was extremely shocked and disappointed when I learned of the lack of judgment and integrity from someone who\u2019s not fit to govern this country,\u201d said Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nCanadians of South Asian descent make up about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s 37 million population. They hold enormous sway in key election districts, known as ridings, in the Toronto and Vancouver areas.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May said she was shocked by the initial reports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful. When I look at it \u2014 and it\u2019s rare for me \u2014 I\u2019m almost speechless,\u201d she said before Trudeau spoke to reporters. \u201cIt demonstrates an enormous lack of judgment.\u201c\n\nOther prominent politicians in the U.S., particularly Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, have come under attack after pictures of them in racist costumes have surfaced. Northam refused to resign earlier this year after he admitted he had donned blackface in the past.\n\nTrudeau, the son of a former prime minister, may be highly regarded on the international stage for his diplomacy, but in Canada, he has come under close scrutiny for several issues. His opponents have particularly seized on a case in which Trudeau and several senior members of his government pressed a former attorney general to drop corruption charges against an engineering company, SNC-Lavalin.\n\nHe was also widely mocked for a weeklong trip to India, where he posed for photo-ops with his family in elaborate Indian outfits.\n\nLauren Gardner contributed to this report from Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Canada\n\nRacism", "description": "\u201cI should have known better but I didn't, and I am really sorry,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ae/5e/20384fd845579fb6c093878da4bb/190918-trudeau-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
