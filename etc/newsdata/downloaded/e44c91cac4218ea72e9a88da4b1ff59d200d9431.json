That company is alleged to have received over R4 million in funds from VBS Bank.\n\nMalema confirmed Santaclara was registered to his cousin, but denied he had any links to the company.\n\nHe did however say that no funds from VBS were channelled into the company account.\n\nA month ago the EFF\u2019s leader strongly denied he received or spent any money from the collapsed bank.\n\nMalema was speaking outside the Hawks offices in Pretoria where he met with investigators to provide a warning statement in a firearm-related case.\n\nAt the time Daily Maverick\u2019s investigative unit Scorpio reported about how more than R5 million was allegedly channelled from VBS bank into an account the leader of the red berets used as a slush fund.\n\nThe \u2018Commander in Chief\u2019, as he is sometimes called, was unequivocal when asked whether he had spent VBS funds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolute rubbish and there\u2019s nothing new about the Daily Maverick\u2019s allegations. I\u2019m not using Mahuna Investments\u2019 money and it did not receive money from VBS,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post VBS Returns To Haunt Malema Through Report Linking His Cousin To Alleged Fraud appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "VBS Returns To Haunt Malema Through Report Linking His Cousin To Alleged Fraud", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/international_newspapers_69x52._800x533_L_1419494241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
