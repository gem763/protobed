USA TODAY\n\nWith Halloween coming, we're being gifted with another visit from our favorite creepy, kooky, mysterious, spooky and altogether ooky clan.\n\nThe new animated movie \"The Addams Family\" (in theaters Friday) reboots the finger-snapping, horror-tinged characters that originally appeared in Charles Addams' New Yorker cartoons and have made occasional appearances on TV, movies, Broadway and IHOP menus.\n\nThe Addamses first had everyone snapping their fingers to Lurch's funky harpsichord beat with the 1960s TV series, and the family returned with two hit movies, 1991's \"The Addams Family\" and 1993's \"Addams Family Values.\"\n\nFall horror preview: 10 terrifying movies you must see this October, from 'Addams Family' to 'Zombieland'\n\nHalloween viewing: 22 not-so-scary movies to stream for kids\n\nThe latest outing features the origins of the Addams clan, revealing how years ago, married couple Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) were driven out of their home country and relocated to an abandoned New Jersey asylum that they made their own.\n\nThere's nothing but love between Morticia (voiced by Charlize Theron, left) and Gomez (Oscar Isaac) in \"The Addams Family.\" (Photo: METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PICTURES)\n\nThe movie catches up with them and their kids, Wednesday (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard), as the Addamses run afoul of their neighbor, an annoying TV home-improvement host (Allison Janney).\n\nIn honor of the latest incarnation, we pick our favorite Addams Family members ever:\n\nThe original cast of the 1960s \"Addams Family\" show (clockwise from far left: Jackie Coogan as Uncle Fester, John Astin as Gomez, Blossom Rock as Grandma, Ted Cassidy as Lurch, Ken Weatherwax as Pugsley, Carolyn Jones as Morticia and Lisa Loring as Wednesday. (Photo: MGM)\n\nJohn Astin's Gomez\n\nThe fashionable and eccentric patriarch from the '60s seems pretty normal in retrospect, but there's a lovably sinister side to him to go along with his goofiness. Plus, the absolute puppy love he shows for his beloved wife (Carolyn Jones) hits us right in the feels. Isaac's new version seems to be patterned after Astin, and no wonder: He's the best.\n\nAnjelica Huston's Morticia\n\nJones made cutting the buds off roses cool back in the day, and Theron's take isn't too shabby. Huston is just a joy to watch though. A great actress, she embraces the campiness of the role and adds a sultry darkness that's just a wee bit dangerous yet is still family friendly.\n\nWednesday Addams (voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz, center) makes an impression on her first day of school in \"The Addams Family.\" (Photo: METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PICTURES)\n\nChloe Grace Moretz's Wednesday\n\nFrom Lisa Loring in the '60s to Christina Ricci in the '90s, the Addamses' freaky daughter has always had a rebellious side. Moretz's Wednesday takes that to a relatable level in the new movie, wanting to go to a real school \u2013 where she causes a ruckus by going Dr. Frankenstein on some dead frogs \u2013 and even daring to put a little pink (gasp!) in her so-very-black wardrobe.\n\nPugsley (voiced by Finn Wolfhard, right) hangs with Grandma (Bette Midler) in \"The Addams Family.\" (Photo: METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PICTURES)\n\nFinn Wolfhard's Pugsley\n\nLet's be honest, Pugsley has never had a lot to do compared to his relatives. The filmmakers switch that up in the new movie, giving him a major story line: Although he'd rather try to blow his dad up, Pugsley instead needs to work on honing his middling saber-wielding skills for an important coming-of-age ritual at the upcoming family reunion.\n\nJackie Coogan's Uncle Fester\n\nChristopher Lloyd has played everyone from Doc Brown to Judge Doom, and his '90s Fester isn't too shabby; the same could be said of Nick Kroll's nicely weirdo version in the new movie. Yet the original dude who played Gomez's oddball bro, Jackie Coogan, was tops as he lit up the screen with strangeness (thanks to a light bulb in his mouth).\n\nTed Cassidy's Lurch\n\nThe groaning, grunting animated butler has his own intriguing backstory in the new flick, and he's responsible for much of the movie's soundtrack \u2013 a monster on the keyboard, this oversize guy knows everything from Bach's Toccata and Fugue to R.E.M.'s \"Everybody Hurts.\" Still, the OG Lurch (Ted Cassidy) had a hit song and his own '60s dance craze, so he wins in a squeaker.\n\nSnoop Dogg voices Cousin It in the new animated \"Addams Family\" film. (Photo: METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PICTURES)\n\nSnoop Dogg's Cousin It\n\nHe was a walking, chirping carpet wearing a bowler hat in his first two iterations. Snoop Dogg voices the latest take. Enough said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/10/addams-family-dream-team-best-versions-creepy-kooky-relatives/3926827002/", "description": "'The Addams Family' returns to the big screen with Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Chloe Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard.
