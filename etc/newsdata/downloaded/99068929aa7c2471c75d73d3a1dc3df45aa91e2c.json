Nor if it had ended in the draw perceived by one judge.\n\nThe only injustice came with an Italian offiicial\u2019s score of 117-112 against Prograis but there was nothing contentious about the third man\u2019s finding of 115-113 which brought home Taylor\u2019s majority decision.\n\nFor the record my running marking culminated in 114-114 equality, which showed Taylor two-up going into the 11th but Prograis surging back to edge both of two last epic rounds.\n\nThere were times when Prograis (left) dazzled with his laser-guided southpaw jab\n\nBut there was a moral imperative about Taylor\u2019s heroic effort which brooks no argument from me about the official result. Not when the UK warrior versus the US technician gave us such a thrilling reminder that contrasting styles make great fights.\n\nThere were times when Prograis dazzled with his laser southpaw jab, assortment of punches from all angles and will-o-the-wisp movement. Others when Taylor pressured him out of his stride so as to connect with more blows than this American master of evasion had ever previously endured.\n\nWhen it came down to the wire Taylor had to survive those championship rounds with blood pouring from a cut and swollen right eye.\n\nTaylor lands a shot to the back of Prograis' head during the opening rounds on Saturday\n\nAs he said: \u2018I got through it on instinct alone because I couldn\u2019t see those powerful left hooks coming.\u2019\n\nIt uld have been cruel to deny him the addition of the WBA title to his IBF belt. Just as it was heart-breaking for Prograis to forfeit the unbeaten record which he, too, brought to London.\n\nBut to the victor the spoils. That included the Muhammad Ali trophy for winning what was also the final of the World Super Series, which extended Taylor\u2019s earnings from this to tournament to $10million.\n\nHe goes on in search of the WBC and WBO light-welter titles held by Jose Ramirez, probably in America. There he would hope to be followed by \u2018my Tartan Army\u2019 of supporters, several thousand of whom roared their heads off in the O2 this weekend.\n\nIf not New York or Las Vegas, then he would \u2018love\u2019 to bring that fight to the grounds of Edinburgh Castle or the Easter Road stadium which is home to his treasured Hibernian.\n\nTaylor revealed he could hardly see from his right eye in final rounds of Saturday's fight\n\nEither way, Taylor regards himself as fighting for personal satisfaction in his sport, not for public fame.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not interested in becoming a celebrity,\u2019 he says. \u2018Only in being the best I can be and continuing to prove myself the best in the world in my weight division.\u2019\n\nThe latter he has done by overcoming Prograis, who will surely come again after admitting \u2018it was very close but on this night I wasn\u2019t quite the better man.\u2019\n\nThat generosity of spirit was matched by Taylor calling him \u2018a great champion.\u2019\n\nTogether they compiled a contest to challenge Errol Spence Jr\u2019s recent embattled victory in Vegas over Shawn Porter for that Fight of the Year accolade.\n\nThe World Super Series has had its critics but they have been silenced by how the format has obliged rival champions to come together in outstanding fights, climaxed by this one.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve witnessed history in the making,\u2019 said tournament promoter Kalle Sauerland.
