Researchers from Cargenie Mellon University and software firm Nefell Networks claim in the study that a Google algorithm can dominate almost half of a network\u2019s capacity when there are multiple online services vying for connections.\n\nThe report claims that Google-owned websites such as YouTube could stream videos faster than other competitors such as Netflix if users sharing the same connection try to access both sites simultaneously. This algorithm can be used by other services meaning that Google is most likely not the only group doing this, but the research focuses mostly on Google\u2019s role in managing online traffic.\n\nInternet services use algorithms known as \u201ccongestion control algorithms\u201d or CCA\u2019s to share bandwidth efficiently across a network and to \u201cthrottle\u201d or slow down certain websites or services when the capacity of the connection is stressed.\n\nResearchers found that Google\u2019s algorithm which is called BBR take up 40 percent of internet capacity when multiple services are competing for traffic. Researchers state when the algorithm was active, other services would be granted less than 4 percent capacity.\n\nGoogle does \u201copen source\u201d the algorithm meaning that other services can take advantage of it. Other websites use different CCAs meaning that they could face slower internet speeds. Researchers state that Google\u2019s algorithm, which went public in 2016, takes a disproportionate share of Internet traffic. Justine Shery of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s computer science department states: \u201cBy any traditional version of [network] fairness, BBR is not fair.\u201d\n\nGoogle has stated that it will be address issues of fairness in a new version of the algorithm being launched soon called BBR V2.
