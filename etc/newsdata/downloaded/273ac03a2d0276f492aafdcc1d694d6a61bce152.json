You keep meaning to do that too, but here you are, collapsed on your couch in a stupor on a Friday night. According to Variety, Raedio, the new record label cofounded by the Insecure creator earlier this year, will be partnering with Atlantic Records. \u201cMusic has always been an essential part of every project I do and working with emerging talent is a personal passion,\u201d the actress said in a statement. \u201cRaedio allows me to continue that work within the music industry and audio entertainment space. The Atlantic Records team are innovators in terms of shifting and shaping culture. I\u2019m excited to join forces with them to discover new artists.\u201d\n\nTo whit, you can hear Raedio\u2019s first release, \u201cKinda Love\u201d by TeaMarr, below. The song\u2019s music video also features a cameo from Issa Rae, which means she\u2019s wearing so many different hats, you can cycle all the way back around and feel okay about your relative unproductiveness. Not everyone can manage so many ventures at one time, and a stupor honestly sounds so good right about now.", "description": "Issa Rae\u2019s new record label, Raedio, is partnering with Atlantic Records, and released their first single, \u201cKinda Love\u201d by TeaMarrr.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/18-Issa-Rae.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
