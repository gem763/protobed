On Saturday, the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based group representing top energy-consuming nations, said it was in contact with Saudi authorities and major producer and consumer nations, and \u201cfor now, markets are well supplied with ample commercial stocks,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe IEA is monitoring the situation in Saudi Arabia closely.\u201d\n\nThe attack by Yemeni rebels, called Houthis, led to the shutdown of five million barrels a day of Saudi oil production. The facility attacked by drones early Saturday will resume production by Monday, kingdom officials said.\n\nMarkets haven\u2019t seen a shutdown on the scale of Saudi\u2019s five million barrels since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. That conflict, which led to an international military intervention, saw the loss of four million barrels a day.\n\nA sustained Saudi outage of several million daily barrels would likely prod U.S. and Europe officials to release emergency stockpiles, according to officials with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and analysts.\n\nWhile the group of industrialized nations would normally coordinate a release, the U.S. would be expected to turn to its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help global markets avoid price spikes.\n\nThe drone attacks Saturday hit Hijra Khurais, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil fields producing about 1.5 million barrels a day, and Abqaiq, the world\u2019s biggest crude stabilization facility, which processes seven million barrels of Saudi oil a day, or about 8% of the world\u2019s total output.\n\nThey are the latest assaults in recent months by the Iranian-aligned Houthis and Iranian-backed armed groups in Iraq on Saudi airports, a desalination plant and oil infrastructure. Since the Houthis took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014 in a civil war, a Saudi-led coalition has fought to reinstate a government there supported by regional powers.\n\nTensions between Iran and the U.S. and its allies including Saudi Arabia have helped push Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, up 12% to $60 a barrel this year. Oil is still well below its April highs on worries that softening demand will result in a supply glut. U.S. crude is at about $55 a barrel.\n\nHelima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the Houthis likely attacked the Saudi energy infrastructure \u201cin an effort to get prices up and send a message to the White House\u201d that the U.S. should stop backing the kingdom\u2019s war in Yemen. But as a response, she said, \u201cTrump could just front run the IEA\u201d with a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release.\n\nThe IEA last carried an emergency release of its strategic reserves when a Libyan civil war in 2011 took out production capacity of 1.7 million barrels a day.\n\nAny disruptions in Saudi oil production could ripple through the global economy, as the kingdom exports more crude petroleum than any other country.\n\nSaudi officials on Saturday discussed drawing down oil stocks to sell to foreign customers, to ensure that global oil supplies weren\u2019t disrupted, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe damage at Abqaiq will reverberate throughout the kingdom\u2019s oil fields. It is where the Saudi industry turns crude oil into specific grades, such as Arabian Extra Light, requested by customers.\n\nThe Ghawar field, the world\u2019s largest, and the Shaybah field, which produces a million barrels a day, also reported disruptions due to Abqaiq\u2019s problems, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nA tanker owned by Bahri, the Saudi Arabian oil shipper, had increased its security while sailing in the Persian Gulf Saturday, according to the vessel\u2019s captain. Safety measures included creating a restricted area on the shore side of the ship, deterring waterside access to the ship and additional security briefings to the crew.\n\nSome analysts said Aramco\u2019s robust redundancy measures may help Saudi Arabia avoid sustained production issues. The shutdown was a precautionary measure, so most of the output should be restored within 48 hours, Saudi officials said.\n\nAnalysts said they were looking ahead to the opening of futures-market trading Sunday evening to see how much oil prices would react, but that it was hard to assess without more details about the longer-term disruption to Saudi production.\n\n\u201cThe oil price could move up $5 to $10 a barrel if it turns out the damage is extensive,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Houston-based consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.\n\nMr. Lipow said the biggest effects would be felt in Asia. He estimates that China, Japan, India, Korea and Taiwan account for roughly four million barrels a day of consumption of crude from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe kingdom had stepped in to fill the void left by the loss of Iranian production due to U.S. sanctions. Analysts said they were waiting for more information about possible stockpile releases around the globe or updates on sanctions policies.\n\nBut prolonged disruptions to Abqaiq, the world\u2019s biggest crude stabilization facility, could result in significantly higher fuel prices, some analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the mother ship of the Saudi energy system,\u201d said Ms. Croft. \u201cThis is probably the worst infrastructure attack we\u2019ve seen in the kingdom.\u201d", "description": "Saudi Arabia said it would return to normal levels of oil production by Monday, as officials sought to reassure world markets after a drone attack Saturday prompted the kingdom to cut its crude production in half.", "authors": ["Benoit Faucon In London", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Amrith Ramkumar In New York"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107243/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
