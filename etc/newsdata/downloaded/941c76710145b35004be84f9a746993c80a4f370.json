Bonus veggies come in the form of shavings of sun-gold carrots, baby kale and sunchoke chips atop the first-course pasta dish.\n\nThe entree, the aforementioned Dover sole, served with a fennel mousseline (a rich, hollandaise-adjacent sauce) has a classic feel. It\u2019s accompanied by summer squash blossoms, whose green and gold hues echo the decor \u2014 and, certainly not coincidentally, the colors of the guest country. Hyperlocal sourcing is in effect, with herbs from the White House garden topping a rouille, a mayonnaise-like condiment spiked with garlic.\n\nAlso in the traditional category is the dessert, a gussied-up apple pie made with Lady apples from Pacific Northwest and Mid-Atlantic trees. The tart is accompanied with a scoop (or two, if you\u2019re the commander in chief?) of ice cream spiked with Calvados, an apple brandy that offers a double dose of the trademark American fruit.\n\nCream on all three courses? No point in counting calories on such a special occasion: This is only the second state dinner of the Trump administration and the first time the Aussies have been so feted since 2006.\n\nIt seems the eclectic blend of European influences threaded throughout the menu is intentional. According to the White House, the selection \u201cpays homage to Australia\u2019s special blend of culinary adaptations from its various cultures, not unlike the diverse food traditions of the United States.\u201d Meaning that the guest country has a melting pot of food ways, just like we do.\n\nAs for what\u2019s in the glasses, the wine list boasts some Australian DNA, notes The Washington Post\u2019s wine columnist, Dave McIntyre. With the first course, the famously teetotaling president is pouring a sauvignon blanc from Spring Mountain, whose winemaker studied viticulture at the University of Adelaide. The second-course accompaniment, a pinot noir from Willamette Valley\u2019s Argyle Winery (co-founded by Aussie Brian Croser), might raise eyebrows among those who still think that fish demands a white wine. (It doesn\u2019t; in fact, the Clintons shocked traditionalists in 1994 when they served a pinot noir with an arctic char at a state dinner.) And bubbles go with the sweet finale in the form of a demi-sec from J Vineyards in Sonoma.\n\nThe pageant of American products is no accident. State dinners (okay, so nit-pickers will point out that this one isn\u2019t technically a state dinner, since the Aussie prime minister isn\u2019t the head of state, but just go with it here) are meant to highlight the ties between the United States and its bestie nations \u2014 and they\u2019re a chance for White House chefs to showcase the best of U.S. cuisine.\n\n\n\nA place setting for last year\u2019s state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nIt\u2019s common, too, to nod to the cuisine of the visiting country, although this dinner\u2019s menu doesn\u2019t offer any overt tribute.\n\n\u201cFor each state dinner, the chef tries to honor the guests in some way, whether it be the wine selection, a dish, or a special ingredient,\u201d Lindsay Chervinsky, a historian with the White House Historical Association, wrote in an email. \u201cFor example, at the March 9, 2016 State Dinner in honor of Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau and Mrs. Trudeau, the dessert featured maple pecan cake because Canada is the one of largest producers of maple syrup. For the June 1, 1967 State Dinner in honor Australian Prime Minister Holt, the chef named the dessert \u2018Glac\u00e9 Zara\u2019 after Mrs. Holt.\u201d\n\nFor the Trumps\u2019 first state dinner, held last spring in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, the menu included Gallic touches: a salad with goat cheese g\u00e2teau and ice cream flavored with creme fraiche.\n\nBut White House chefs don\u2019t try to straight-up replicate the signature dishes of their guests\u2019 countries.\n\n\u201cIf the Japanese are visiting, we\u2019re not doing sushi,\u201d says John Moeller, who helped execute dozens of state dinners during his stint as a White House chef from 1992 to 2005.\n\nPutting together a menu for such a signature event is a laborious process, he notes. It typically starts three or more months out, when the state visit is set, and begins with going over the dietary restrictions and preferences of the visiting heads of state, usually provided by the State Department. Chefs will consider the time of year and what local ingredients will be available and suggest a list of dishes, he says, which eventually makes its way to the first lady, who might provide feedback or suggestions.\n\nThere\u2019s often a dress rehearsal where chefs prepare a dinner for 10 or so people (including the president and first lady) to test the meal, as well as the decor and flowers, which can result in more fine-tuning.\n\n[The world is Trump\u2019s oyster, but he prefers Filet-O-Fish]\n\nSo when it comes time for the real deal, the White House kitchen is prepared for the high-wire act that is a state dinner. Moeller says that once the traditional predinner toasts are finished, the staff swoops into action. \u201cOnce you hear the clinking of those glasses, there is no looking back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s got to roll \u2014 and there can be no mistakes.\u201d\n\nAnn Stock, who was the social secretary \u2014 a.k.a. the ringleader of the state-visit circus \u2014 in the Clinton administration, says White House staff feel such pressure because of the event\u2019s high stakes and high profile. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest honor our country can give another country,\u201d she says. And then there\u2019s the responsibility of showing off the best of American food, wine, design and music. \u201cThose are some of our country\u2019s biggest industries, and this is our chance to shine and showcase the best of America to our visitors,\u201d she says.\n\nGiven the importance of such moments, the staff take pains to avoid any dinner-table mishaps, sometimes pulling it off by the skin of their teeth.\n\nStock recalled that at the Clintons\u2019 first state dinner in 1994, an opulent white-tie affair honoring the emperor and empress of Japan, then-House Speaker Tom Foley and his wife hadn\u2019t shown up, with only minutes to go before guests were to be seated. She had the switchboard connect her to his home, and when she reached him, she learned that the couple had mixed up the dates and thought the dinner was the next evening.\n\nStock was faced with the prospect of an empty chair directly in primo territory, in front of the royal guests \u2014 a huge no-no \u2014 when she caught sight of White House curator Bill Allman, whom she had asked to be on hand to answer guests\u2019 questions about the mansion\u2019s art and antiques. \u201cThere he was, in pristine white tie, and I walked up to him and said, \u2018Mr. Allman, how would you like to be the speaker of the House?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd so the curator took a seat \u2014 between Jane Fonda and Barbra Streisand. \u201cHe\u2019s still talking about that night!\u201d Stock says.\n\nThe full menu:\n\nFirst Course\n\nSunchoke Ravioli\n\nReggiano Cream\n\nShaved Summer Vegetables\n\nSpring Mountain Sauvignon Blanc 2017\n\nMain Course\n\nDover Sole with Parsley Crisps\n\nZucchini Squash Blossoms\n\nFennel Mousseline\n\nBaby Garlic Rouille\n\nArgyle Pinot Noir \u201cReserve\u201d 2016\n\nDessert\n\nLady Apple Tart\n\nCalvados Ice Cream\n\nJ Demi-Sec NV\n\nThe last time a U.S. president hosted the Australians for a state dinner was in 2006, when George W.
