(AP) - Floyd Smith still vividly remembers the ceremonial faceoff he took against Montreal Canadiens captain Jean Beliveau before the Buffalo Sabres\u2018 first home game in franchise history.\n\n\u201c(Beliveau) let me win it,\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\n\nAt 35, Smith was lured out of retirement to serve as the Sabres first captain in 1970.\n\nSome 50 years later, the 84-year-old Smith was back in Buffalo on Saturday night. Amid chants of \u201cLet\u2019s Go Buffalo!\u201d Smith dropped the puck for a ceremonial faceoff and to kick off the Sabres\u2018 golden anniversary season before their home opener against the New Jersey Devils.\n\n\u201cAh, that was neat,\u201d Smith said, reflecting back to the one-plus season he spent in Buffalo before retiring. \u201cYou don\u2019t think as much about it then as you do now, how important it was.\u201d\n\nSmith, who eventually went on to coach the Sabres, was among 15 former team captains on hand for the team\u2019s home opener. The group included Gilbert Perreault, Mike Foligno, Michael Peca and Brian Gionta.\n\nThe Sabres distributed commemorative T-shirts to each fan, and celebrated their past with a lengthy video montage featuring numerous on- and off-ice highlights broadcast on the video scoreboard.\n\nThe former captains walked the red carpet in front of fans outside the arena before the game, and were each then introduced on the ice during a pre-game ceremony.\n\nThey wore the Sabres\u2018 specially designed 50th anniversary jerseys featuring a gold-emblazoned buffalo and two crossed swords on the chest.\n\nPerreault joked about how tight-fitting his No. 11 jersey was by saying it\u2019s been a while since he was at his playing weight.\n\nPerreault, who still holds most every offensive franchise record, including 512 goals and 1,326 goals, said it was a privilege to spend his entire 16-plus season career with one team.\n\nHe recalled Buffalo\u2019s first home game, a 3-0 loss to Montreal, as being special because he was from Quebec and played his junior hockey in Montreal.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to play against my idol, Jean Beliveau that night,\u201d Perreault said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have a chance to play one shift against him.\u201d\n\nThe Sabres and Vancouver Canucks were part of the NHL\u2019s second wave of expansion by entering the league together in 1970.\n\nBuffalo won the spin of a wheel to earn the right to draft Perreault with the No. 1 pick ahead of Vancouver, and went on to reach the Stanley Cup Final in 1975. The Sabres, coached by Smith, lost in six games to Philadelphia.\n\nThe 50th anniversary comes at a time the Sabres are in the midst of their toughest stretch in team history. They\u2019re eight-year playoff drought is a franchise worst and ranks as the NHL\u2019s longest active streak. And Buffalo has not won a playoff series since reaching the Eastern Conference finals in 2007.\n\nUnder new coach Ralph Krueger, the Sabres are coming off a season-opening 3-1 win at Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThey had a good start with a win, so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to be a great year,\u201d Perreault said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Floyd Smith still vividly remembers the ceremonial faceoff he took against Montreal Canadiens captain Jean Beliveau before the Buffalo Sabres' first home game in franchise history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
