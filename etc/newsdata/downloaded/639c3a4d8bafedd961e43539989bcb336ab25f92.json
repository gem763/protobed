The 9th District has been reliably Republican in the past, and President Trump won the district handily in 2016.\n\nMcCready lost the original election in 2018 to Republican candidate Mark Harris by a slim 925 votes, but those election results were thrown out over allegations of absentee ballot fraud intended to help Harris. Harris did not run in the subsequent special election.\n\nThe race has attracted some high-profile attention from Democratic presidential candidates and the president himself. Mr. Trump rallied for Bishop Monday in Fayetteville, and he warned the crowd, \"A vote for any Democrat in 2020, and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney also visited the state on Monday for get-out-the-vote events for Bishop on the other side of the congressional district.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Democratic voters were outpacing Republicans in early voting by about 7 percentage points.\n\nMcCready acknowledged the closeness of this race at a campaign event in Cumberland County on Sunday. \"Let's just say it like it is \u2014 this thing is going to be close,\" McCready said, adding, \"This is going to come down to hundreds of votes.\"\n\nA presidential battleground state that Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016, North Carolina will also have elections for governor and the U.S. next year. The race in the 9th District is seen as an early indicator of how the state and Republican-leaning suburbs nationwide are feeling as 2020 approaches.", "description": "This election do-over is the last of the 2018 midterm election seats to be decided.
