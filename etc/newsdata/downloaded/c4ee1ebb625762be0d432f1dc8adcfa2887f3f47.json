Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nBarnier said there had been a willingness by the UK to \u201cintensify contacts\u201d but that in terms of replacing the backstop \u201cthe ball is clearly in the British camp\u201d and \u201cthe Brexit situation remains serious and uncertain\u201d.\n\nBarnier\u2019s comments, published in full by the European commission, are the clearest indication so far of the lack of progress being made in the talks in Brussels, where the prime minister has insisted a major renegotiation is in process.\n\nThe EU negotiator said Johnson had claimed on becoming prime minister that he was \u201cready for an exit without agreement if his requests were not accepted, as if this prospect could lead us to give up our principles\u201d, but that the Commons had \u201crejected such a scenario\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Frost in Brussels on Wednesday.

But we do not have the ability to avoid this scenario alone.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s negotiator went on to raise concerns about the UK\u2019s plans for the future trade relationship, which he suggested amounted to an attempt to undercut the European economic model by becoming a Singapore-on-Thames.\n\nBarnier told the MEPs: \u201cOn our future economic partnership, they want us to state without ambiguity that the final destination must be a free trade agreement and in no way a customs union. And we are obviously ready to work in this direction.\n\nMerkel warns of danger to EU of Singapore-style UK on its border Read more\n\n\u201cWe will have a problem if the British will at the same time challenge the level playing field commitments we have negotiated with Mrs May and which guarantee fair competition between the EU and the UK. This is of course a point on which we will remain very vigilant.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the level of ambition of a future free trade agreement will be defined according to the guarantees given by the United Kingdom in terms of state aid, taxation or social and environmental standards, given its economic size and proximity.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier briefing with diplomats representing the EU27 about the latest talks with Frost, a senior member of Barnier\u2019s Brexit team had described the ideas so far put forward during technical talks between officials on both sides as aspirational.\n\n\u201cAnother longish meeting without tangible progress on Wednesday,\u201d said an EU diplomat, referring to the latest round of talks between the European commission and Frost.\n\nThe last substantive Brexit negotiation took place in Strasbourg in March when May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, drafted an ill-fated adjunct to the withdrawal agreement emphasising the temporary nature of the Irish backstop. May\u2019s deal was subsequently defeated in the Commons by the crushing margin of 149.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juncker and May at a summit in Brussels earlier this year. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nEU officials insisted that nearly two months after Johnson was made prime minister the gap between the two sides was still far too wide for any meaningful renegotiation and that British civil servants were still merely \u201ctalking about concepts\u201d.\n\nIn the most recent talks between officials, Frost was said to have outlined ideas covering customs and manufactured goods in which Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would be in separate customs and regulatory zones.\n\nSources said Johnson\u2019s envoy had suggested an \u201cenhanced market surveillance mechanism\u201d for industrial goods involving tough penalties for those who seek to smuggle contraband over the border.\n\nPlay Video European parliament chief: UK offers no 'credible' alternatives to backstop - video\n\nFrost had said the UK could commit to an open border in the withdrawal agreement but that the detail of how checks could be done away from the border would have to be decided during the stand-still transition period catered for in the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe EU says there must be a legally operable plan for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland in any withdrawal agreement and it will not accept a deal based on a promise.\n\nSpeaking after the MEPs\u2019 briefing with Barnier, the president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, told reporters: \u201cWe would like there to be initiatives to discuss but unfortunately there aren\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nThe UK government says it will not accept any backstop that leaves Northern Ireland in a separate customs territory and different regulatory areas for goods other than agrifood. There remains some confidence that the UK might move in that direction in order to put a last-gasp deal before parliament and avoid a further Brexit extension.\n\nOne diplomat said the UK \u201cnow seems [to better] recognise the unique situation on the island of Ireland\u201d, but that current proposals were \u201cwish-wash\u201d.", "description": "EU\u2019s top negotiator tells MEPs Britain has not offered credible proposals for Irish border", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765a8da4631653e64fd3cdcc801c0e7b941f1f42/0_103_3294_1977/master/3294.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a1a3677b622561c1437cb9a97c923e3"}
