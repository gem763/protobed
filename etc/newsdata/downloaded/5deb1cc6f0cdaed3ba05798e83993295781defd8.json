Boeing is revising MCAS, tying it to an additional sensor at all times and making it less powerful.\n\n\"We are learning, we still have more to learn, we have to work to do to restore the public's trust,\" Muilenburg said.\n\nMuilenburg testified Tuesday before a Senate committee. He avoided major gaffes but was criticized for several mistakes, including failing to tell Congress and regulators about a senior test pilot's messages that seemed to raise alarms the new flight-control system.\n\nBoeing hopes to win approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before year-end to get the Max back in the air. Regulators in other parts of the world have indicated they may take longer to review Boeing's changes to the plane.\n\nAfter the hearings, Congress is likely to consider changes in how the FAA certifies new planes.\n\nPelosi calls for Republicans to put country over party:Trump impeachment inquiry latest\n\nWho is Alexander Vindman?
