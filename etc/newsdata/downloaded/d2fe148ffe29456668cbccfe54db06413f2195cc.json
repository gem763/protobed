Because for me, it was business, not personal. And there\u2019s a huge line.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018That\u2019s what happens when you work with people that you like. You fall out business-wise, but for me, I say what I feel at the time, and for me, it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And because I said certain things about, and to, Simon, doesn\u2019t mean I hate him forever, just for that second I don\u2019t like him\u2026 I never use the word hate when I talk about people. He\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t want to work with him.\u2019\n\nSharon Osbourne at the Emmys in 2019 (Picture: Steve Granitz/WireImage)\n\nSharon also claimed on Monday\u2019s episode of The Talk the pair haven\u2019t spoken in over a year, despite Simon\u2019s comments alleging they had a phone call recently.\n\n\u2018The \u201cother day\u201d was May 2018!\u2019 Sharon said.\n\nSharon was a judge on The X Factor from 2004 to 2007, before reappearing on the 2013, 2016, and 2017 series. She was lined-up to appear on the 2018 series, but released a statement shortly after the competition began stating she\u2019d decided she was no longer needed.\n\nBack in March, Sharon claimed Simon fired her from the 2018 series because she was \u2018too old\u2019.\n\n\u2018I turned down a judge [gig] on The Masked Singer,\u2019 Sharon said in March. \u2018I was signed on to do [X Factor]. I was signed to go to England, and then Simon Cowell changed his mind and thought I was too old.\n\n\u2018Simon Cowell goes, \u201cShe\u2019s old. We need somebody young.\u201d So if you want young, fire yourself.\u2019 Simon\u2019s reps denied the allegations at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe X Factor is set to return this year with two special editions; a celebrity version and an all-stars series which brings back past contestants.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity kicks off Saturday 12 October on ITV at 8.35pm.\n\nMORE: The X Factor Celebrity gets overhaul as six chair challenge is axed\n\nMORE: Rylan Clark-Neal patches things up with Gary Barlow seven years on from X Factor \u2018feud\u2019", "description": "Sharon Osbourne has expressed how she doesn't want to work with Simon Cowell ever again after The X Factor.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176421063_1570604391.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
