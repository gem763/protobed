No one really knows how to check if their team is engaged,\" he said.\n\n\"The larger the organisation gets, the more disconnected and less close they get.\"\n\nThe creation of Heelix came about thanks to a twist of fate, with Mr Winning meeting JobVibe co-founder Tim Mullen in the lift of his Sydney office.\n\nMr Mullen pitched Mr Winning the idea for his business and the concept immediately appealed to Mr Winning, who likes to track every data point he can in his company.\n\nHe liked that the product could give him weekly updates on his teams, rather than relying on annual or bi-annual staff engagement surveys, which were easily influenced by the time of the year in which they were conducted.\n\n\"I'm generally not a fan of external software businesses because I like to own all of that IP in-house and I don't like licensing fees,\" he said.\n\nThe Heelix platform is already being used monthly by 80 per cent of Winning Group staff. Supplied\n\n\"But I liked that this start-up was in our building. With other software solutions you have little influence over the product road map, but with this we had a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"After a while, it ran out of funding, scaled back and had no product development going on so they were going to wind it up. We liked it so much we decided to acquire it.\"\n\nMr Winning has since employed JobVibe co-founder Tim Mullen and 13 others to lead Heelix's development and it's about to start a sales and marketing push.\n\nHe also employed neuroscientist Katharina Kuehn, who has incorporated her insights on human behavioural drivers into the platform.\n\nMr Winning has already used the tool to drive decision making around who would be a good person to promote to team leader and to improve training material for staff.\n\nMr Mullen said rather than just being a useful platform for employers, the social networking and performance tracking tools were designed so that employees would also want to use Heelix.\n\n\"It gives employees a simple structure to manage their individual performance and then also connects them to each other to provide recognition,\" he said.\n\n\"We provide managers with recommendations on what to do with the data... and enable teams themselves to understand how they work.\"", "description": "John Winning met JobVibe founder Tim Mullen in his building's lift.
