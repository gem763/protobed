Think about it, based upon different states and the tax credit you get for tips, it's a 50 percent or greater labor cost increase. No industry can sustain a 50 percent labor cost increase,\" Taffer told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d after being asked about the impact on the restaurant industry.\n\nTaffer said that, as a result of minimum wage increases, Seattle lost nearly 1,000 restaurants and described the measure as a \u201cshock to the [restaurant] industry economically.\"\n\nSEATTLE-BASED RESTAURANT CHAIN BLAMES HIGH MINIMUM WAGE FOR BANKRUPTCY\n\nRestaurants Unlimited, a Seattle-based company that owns 35 upscale restaurants across the country, filed for bankruptcy in July and declared, \u201cOver the last three years, the company\u2019s profitability has been significantly impacted by progressive wage laws along the Pacific coast\u2026the result was to increase the company\u2019s annual wage expenses by an aggregate of $10.6 million.\u201d\n\nRestaurants Unlimited went on to cite three examples in which minimum wages have risen dramatically over the last three years. Portland now requires $12.50 an hour, an increase of 35 percent. San Francisco\u2019s minimum wage has climbed 41 percent to $15.59 per hour. And Seattle, the first city with a $15 minimum wage, now forces large employers to pay at least $16 an hour.\n\nRestaurants Unlimited did raise menu prices and even added a living wage surcharge to bills. But it still lost money.\n\n2020 DEMS MAKE HARD SELL FOR ORGANIZED LABOR, BUT UNIONS IN NO RUSH TO ENDORSE\n\nOn Labor Day, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the holiday puts a spotlight on \u201cthe needs of working families.\u201d\n\nSanders made his pitch to raise the minimum wage to \u201ca living wage,\u201d gender pay equality, and to make \u201cit easier for workers to be able to join unions.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTaffer said restaurants face a \"crisis mode\" when confronted with a choice of raising prices significantly to account for higher labor costs or cut workers.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to eliminate employees and we\u2019re going to incentivize more robotics,\u201d said Taffer, whose Paramount Network show is about to kick off its sixth season.\n\n\"When they talk about raising wages and raising taxes, it doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\nFox News' Dan Springer and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "\"No industry can sustain a 50 percent labor cost increase,\" TV\u00a0host Jon Taffer said.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-17-at-12.36.28-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
