It's all I can think about, really.\n\nWhen I served in the military, we would often do ruck marches. It\u2019s a staple of Army service, but it\u2019s particularly essential to life in the infantry.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYou put on a 35-pound rucksack with full gear and march distances of 12, 15, 18 miles (sometimes more) at a brisk pace. It was a point of pride to do that well a handful of times a year. It's exhausting. It really tests your resilience.\n\nOur feet would be covered with blisters, our muscles would ache, and some among us \u2014 soldiers with peak physical conditioning \u2014 would pass out from dehydration or exhaustion. You get what I'm saying? Marching just 12 miles with that gear could break you in half.\n\nI say that because the distance between San Pedro Sula, near the northern border of Honduras, and McAllen, Texas, right on the southern border of the United States, is about 1,442 miles.\n\nEven for a physically fit adult fleeing horrific violence and persecution, walking 10 hours a day at a typical pace of 3 miles an hour, it would take 48 days to make that distance on foot.\n\nNow add children. Add people with disabilities. Add those who are pregnant. Factor in weather and food scarcity and water scarcity and a lack of access to necessary medical care.\n\nFactor in vulnerability to violence and discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation, and race, among other things.\n\nTake all of that into account and answer me this: what kind of violence and persecution is so horrific and devastating that it would force vulnerable people to make that trip? So dire that walking by foot up the entire east coast of Mexico is the only option you have left?\n\nThe past two years have seen unprecedented attacks by the Trump-Pence administration on vulnerable communities, and among the most vulnerable people in this onslaught have been undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers. Children. Babies. In cages.\n\nI search my soul for answers, and at the end of day, I don't understand how the Republican Party and certain justices and the folks in the White House \u2014 all of them professed Christians \u2014 would so readily toss away the words of Christ and turn away suffering people like trash.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent against the majority's opinion, wrote: \u201cThe rule the government promulgated topples decades of settled asylum practices and affects some of the most vulnerable people in the Western hemisphere \u2014 without affording the public a chance to weigh in.\u201d\n\nI do not believe America's reputation will recover in my lifetime. We will be known for the blatant, intentional cruelty inflicted on the vulnerable by this White House and the GOP. We will be known as the nation that created suffering just for the sake of its existence.", "description": "Late Wednesday night, the Supreme Court released an order essentially allowing the Trump administration to bar most Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the United States while the relevant court cases are being considered.
