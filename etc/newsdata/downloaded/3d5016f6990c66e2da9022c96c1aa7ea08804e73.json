Similar inquiries are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.", "description": "House lawmakers asked the companies for information on how their businesses had been affected by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.", "authors": ["Jack Nicas", "David Mccabe"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/business/20bigtech2/20bigtech2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
