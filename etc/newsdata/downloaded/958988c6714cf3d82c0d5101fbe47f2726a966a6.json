Luckily, Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland\u2019s Rick and Morty prominently features your mister, and a round of other nods to the series\u2019 first three seasons, in the show\u2019s new Season 4 trailer, released on Sunday by Adult Swim.\n\nAs promised, Rick and Morty, which hasn\u2019t aired a new episode since the show\u2019s third season concluded in October 2017, will return in November. Interestingly, despite the two year gap, the new trailer alludes to just five new episodes, starting Sunday, November 10 at 11:30pm. The series received a gravity-warping 70-episode renewal in May 2018, so at this rate, you\u2019ll have enough Rick and Morty to last you through the end of time. An eternity of bliss with your one true love, Mr. Poopybutthole.", "description": "Over two years since the show completed its third season, Adult Swim releases a trailer for the show\u2019s Season 4, which premieres November 10.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/7-Rick-And-Morty-Trailer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
