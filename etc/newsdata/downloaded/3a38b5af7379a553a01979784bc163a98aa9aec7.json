We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we'll employ 3,000 people here.\"\n\nThe UK operation employed 1,290 people in 2017, and almost 2,000 in 2018.\n\nFacebook said it complies with tax laws in all jurisdictions and pays what is legally due.\n\nBut Ms Hodge, a former chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, and who now leads an all-party parliamentary group looking into the tax system, tweeted that it was \"still outrageous\" that big tech firms were not paying their fair into society.\n\nLast month, Amazon came under fire for paying \u00a314.7m in UK corporation tax last year, despite reporting sales of \u00a32.3bn. Google has faced similar criticism.\n\nEarlier this week, the Organisation for Economic and Development (OECD), proposed tax changes aimed at making global firms pay more tax.\n\nThe proposals would give governments more power specifically to tax big technology firms such as Apple, Facebook and Google.\n\nCompanies that do business in more than one country have long been a challenge for tax authorities, because they can structure their business in a way that minimises their tax bills.\n\nThe OECD's proposal includes new rules on where tax should be paid and on the proportion of their profits that should be taxed in each country.", "description": "Tech firms have been criticised for the amount of tax they pay, but Facebook says it pays what is legally owed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/143C/production/_105408150_gettyimages-1090299210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
