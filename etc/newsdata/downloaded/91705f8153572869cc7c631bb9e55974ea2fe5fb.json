At the time, Facebook had 10 million users compared with Myspace\u2018s 100 million and was about to bet the business on News Feed, which was unproven as a product.\n\nZuckerberg said his decision not to sell upset the board and led to most of his management team quitting.\n\n\u201cSo once you can get through that, if you\u2019re like, when you\u2019re like 21 or 22 and all these experienced people around you say that you\u2019re going to regret the decision that you\u2019re making for the rest of your life, and they all quit and walk out and then you basically have no team and you get through that, that leaves you with a lot of confidence that you \u2013 that you can make long-term decisions and that they can work out over time,\u201d Zuckerberg said, according to the audio.\n\n\u201cI am lucky because of the structure that we have. I think some people don\u2019t have the flexibility to focus on what they think is right over the long term because there really are near-term constraints, \u201d he added.\n\nHe also said he might have been fired in 2018, when the company had a disastrous earnings report that shaved over $100 billion off its market cap \u2013 which he attributed in the audio to his decision to focus Facebook more on connecting with friends and family and less on viral videos and stories, \u201camong a number of other reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo again, would I\u2019ve been able to do that if I didn\u2019t control the company? I don\u2019t know. maybe I would\u2019ve been fired but \u2026 over the long term, it really is profitable to do the right thing,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nJake Kanter contributed to this report.", "description": "Business Insider - Mark Zuckerberg told employees in July that his past risky decisions would probably have resulted in an ouster, according to leaked audio..
