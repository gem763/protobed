It was a total disaster,\u201d Trump told crowds gathered at a natural gas event, before repeating a line from when he first pledged to leave the deal, saying \u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\u201d\n\nHis views on the deal have been widely criticized by Democrats, environmentalists, and even some Republicans, who say the U.S. is abdicating global leadership at a time when urgent action is required to stem the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\n\nTrump has repeatedly boasted about withdrawing the U.S. from the deal, despite the rigid timelines required by the agreement.\n\nAdding to the confusion was a White House readout of Wednesday\u2019s speech, which said \u201cthe President announced he is pulling the United States out of the fraudulent, ineffective, and one-sided Paris Climate Accord.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by The Hill whether the speech constituted a formal withdrawal, a spokesman for the White House said \u201cthe president has already announced the U.S. withdraw from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord.\u201d Reporting from the New York Times indicates the formal process is set to begin soon.\n\nIf the U.S. indeed begins the process to leave the accord, it would do so just weeks ahead of a UN summit in Chile, where leaders will hammer out final details for complying with the agreement.\n\nThe landmark 2015 agreement signed by President Obama requires the U.S. to reduce emissions about 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.\n\nWhile some Republicans may have changed their rhetoric on the realities of climate change, many remain opposed to the deal, arguing the U.S. should not have to make efforts to curb emissions without more efforts from other countries first.\n\nStill, many climate change experts have said the Paris Accord is simply the price of admission to the climate conversation and warn even the near global effort may fall short of the action necessary to limit rising temperatures.\n\nRecommitting the U.S. to the Paris Climate Accord has become something of a box to tick for Democrats running for president on 2020, most of whom have said they would do so their very first day in office.\n\nHouse Democrats have already taken steps to prevent Trump\u2019s intentions, passing a resolution in May that would block the move.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Overnight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Partisan squabbles endanger congressional response to Trump's course on Syria MORE immediately said the bill \"will go nowhere.\"\n\nIn anticipation for what was expected to be a personal announcement from Trump on the withdrawal, the Union of Concerned Scientists called such a move \u201cirresponsible and shortsighted.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, no other country is following President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE out the door on Paris,\u201d the group said in a statement.", "description": "The White House is reportedly beginning to prepare to formally withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
