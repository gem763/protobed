In Denver, two months later, a carry-on bag with four vaping batteries \u201ccaught fire on the boarding bridge,\u201d and firefighters were called to put it out, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIn March, Southwest Airlines employees had to pull a smoking suitcase containing e-cigarette batteries from a plane\u2019s cargo hold in San Diego. Adjacent bags were damaged, as was the plane, which was temporarily taken out of service, according to the FAA.\n\nE-cigarettes and the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power them have caused smoke or fire incidents on planes or at airports more than 30 times in three years, according to an FAA database.\n\nBut the e-cigarettes are part of a broader problem, data shows. Passengers in the United States bring an estimated 2.3 billion electronic devices on planes each year, and safety experts say federal regulators have struggled to keep up with the deluge, often deferring to airlines to manage potential dangers.\n\nIn addition to the e-cigarette incidents, the FAA recorded more than 65 other cases of smoking, sparking and flaming lithium-ion batteries in laptops, tablets, phones and other devices, including power packs, drill batteries and rechargeable socks, according to a Washington Post analysis of FAA data, which the agency acknowledged is incomplete.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s a pretty significant threat,\u201d said Mark Millam, vice president of technical programs at the Flight Safety Foundation and a former safety chief at Northwest Airlines. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from one to multiple devices that most passengers are carrying on. You don\u2019t know where all these things are coming from and what\u2019s in them and how legitimate they are.\u201d\n\nThe Post analysis covers the three-year period through Aug. 1, 2019, the latest data available. The FAA took the rare step of banning fire-prone Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on Oct. 15, 2016.\n\n[Long before the Max disasters, Boeing had a history of failing to fix safety problems]\n\nSome advocates \u2014 and even some inside the airline industry \u2014 say federal regulators have not been aggressive enough in addressing the risks.\n\nAn FAA advisory group said last year that the agency\u2019s guidance for flight crews in fighting fires caused by electronic devices is \u201cinadequate and outdated.\u201d It said better training is needed to manage threats from burning batteries, including potentially toxic and flammable gases and smoke that could obscure pilots\u2019 vision.\n\n\u201cSo far we\u2019ve been lucky nothing\u2019s happened,\u201d said Charles Leocha, president of the advocacy group Travelers United. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the FAA has caught up with the threat.\u201d\n\n'Up to the individual airlines'\n\nNumerous laptops or their batteries have been recalled by their makers because of the possibility they could overheat and catch fire, including those from Apple, Toshiba, Lenovo and Sony, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nBut while the FAA broadly prohibits hazardous devices, it has not barred specific laptops.\n\n\u201cThe hazardous materials regulations prohibit passengers from bringing on board \u2018batteries and battery-powered devices which are likely to create sparks or generate a dangerous evolution of heat, unless packaged in a manner which precludes such an occurrence,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the individual airlines to determine whether a device is likely to \u2018create sparks or generate a dangerous evolution of heat,\u2019 and to transmit that information to their passengers,\u201d the FAA said, adding later, \u201cBecause of the wide variety of battery issues that can occur, it is important that airlines have the flexibility to assess and address the risks involved in each individual situation.\u201d\n\nMedia reports this summer that the FAA had banned hundreds of thousands of recalled 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro laptops from planes were inaccurate, the agency and airline representatives said. And airlines\u2019 responses have been inconsistent. A Delta spokeswoman said the recalled laptops are not permitted, pointing to a policy statement on the airline\u2019s website that \u201cdamaged, defective or recalled lithium batteries must not be carried in carry-on or checked baggage.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, executives at American and United said the recalled laptops can be brought aboard in carry-on bags but not in checked luggage. United customers must keep the devices turned off and unplugged, the airline said. \u201cPart of the responsibility we\u2019re going to place on the customer,\u201d United spokesman Charles Hobart said.\n\n[FAA misled Congress on inspector training for Boeing 737 Max, investigators say]\n\n\n\nAn image taken from security camera video shows an e-cigarette battery in a knapsack that burst into flames at a passenger checkpoint at Yeager Airport in Charleston, W.Va., in June. (Transportation Security Administration)\n\nFlight attendants, ground crews, agents with the Transportation Security Administration and passengers have increasingly become firefighters, scrambling to limit the damage, FAA incident reports show.\n\nWhen a Frontier Airlines passenger tossed a smoking iPhone into the aisle on a flight to Phoenix last year, \u201canother passenger picked it up and brought it to the lavatory and placed it in the sink and ran water over it then covered it in ice,\u201d according to an FAA report.\n\nThe flight was diverted to Tampa, two people were treated for minor burns, and several passengers reported nausea and headaches, the FAA said. Firefighters walked away with \u201cthe faulty cell phone and its associated defective charger,\u201d the FAA said.\n\nThe year before, an iPhone caught fire after being crunched in a reclining seat on a flight from Spain. Flight attendants put the phone in a fire containment bag.\n\nOn a December 2016 flight from Honolulu, \u201ca fire was discovered in an overhead bin,\u201d according to an FAA incident report. The crew used three halon-gas fire extinguishers and two more filled with water to douse the flaming laptop that caused it.\n\nMany of the burning battery incidents took place on the ground, such as when a woman ran off a plane in Oakland because an e-cigarette burned a hole in her purse. Another erupted in a passenger\u2019s pocket in Las Vegas, sending a man to the hospital.\n\n[Head of pilots union points to training and engineering mistakes with Boeing 737 Max]\n\n\n\nThe e-cigarette battery burns at the checkpoint. (Transportation Security Administration)\n\nBut about a quarter of the incidents involving e-cigarettes, and half of those involving other electronics, happened in the air, the FAA data show, elevating safety concerns.\n\n\u201cJust one fire incident poses a high risk of death,\u201d serious injury or destruction of property, the U.S. Transportation Department and the FAA said in their 2016 emergency order banning the Samsung Note 7. \u201cThis risk is magnified when the fire or evolution of heat occurs aboard an aircraft during flight.\u201d\n\nTo reduce the risk of \u201cserious harm to the traveling public,\u201d the Transportation Department banned e-cigarettes from checked bags in 2015, \u201cbecause the devices are capable of generating extreme heat and an incident can result in the ignition of nearby contents,\u201d according to a regulatory filing.\n\nDOT cited \u201ctwo near misses for the safety of aviation passengers\u201d \u2014 a fire in a checked bag before a flight from Boston in 2014 and another in January 2015 in a baggage area in Los Angeles.\n\nBetter to bring the devices into cabins because fires there can \u201cbe immediately identified and mitigated\u201d by flight attendants, the department said. (Federal regulations bar passengers from putting spare lithium-ion or lithium metal batteries for other electronics in their checked luggage for the same reasons.)\n\nBut enforcement has been lax, and passengers continue to disregard the checked-luggage ban, interviews and incident reports show.\n\n[FAA discovers new safety concern during Boeing 737 Max test]\n\nA flaming checked bag scorched the floor of an American Airlines plane before takeoff in St. Kitts in March. Another, in May on a belt loader in Baltimore, had to be extinguished by firefighters. Last year, a burning bag rumbled around the carousel in Harrisburg, Pa., after a flight, according to the FAA.\n\nIn several recommendations last year, the FAA advisory group, the Air Carrier Training Aviation Rulemaking Committee, called on the agency to update its advice to airlines on dealing with fires caused by batteries. The group said training should be enhanced on \u201cthe critical importance of maintaining aircraft control\u201d during incidents, given the danger of toxic fumes and smoke.\n\nFlight-planning computers used by pilots also pose an underappreciated risk, the group said. If they overheat in the cockpit, or smoke from elsewhere isn\u2019t cleared fast enough, \u201cpilots may be unable to see their flight instruments.\u201d\n\nIn addition, there are no federal test standards for the containment bags some airlines use for burning devices, the group said, leaving airlines dependent on safety assertions by vendors.\n\n[With its ties in Washington, Boeing has taken over more and more of the FAA\u2019s job]\n\n\u201cHigh-energy\u201d chemical fires can happen when a battery short-circuits, is improperly charged or is damaged, the group noted. As batteries get more powerful, so do the resulting fires, \u201cpotentially resulting in aircraft structural damage,\u201d the group said.\n\nAn FAA field demonstration showed burning batteries can \u201cquickly generate sufficient flammable gas in the small space inside an overhead bin to cause an explosion,\u201d the group said. In another test, an overheating laptop battery \u201cprojected flaming matter\u201d onto a passenger dummy, setting its clothes alight.\n\nThe FAA said it has \u201ccontinued to work collaboratively with the industry\u201d through the advisory group and is working \u201cto update our guidance and develop training media for the industry,\u201d which it expects to release for public comment by early 2020.\n\nAviation's first responders\n\nAirlines vary widely in how well they prepare flight crews to fight fires, according to a 2017 FAA report.\n\n\u201cSome programs comply with regulatory requirements by providing the minimum amount of training required with one-time emergency drills that can hardly be considered \u2018realistic,\u2019 \u201d the report said, while others \u201cprovide annual theoretical and practical training in the most realistic environments.\u201d\n\nAbout two-thirds of flight attendants surveyed said their practical training in fighting fires was \u201ctoo short,\u201d according to the report.\n\n[FAA officials face scrutiny over rigor of its oversight]\n\n\u201cFire on board is extremely concerning,\u201d said Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.\n\nA key issue for \u201caviation\u2019s first responders\u201d is making sure there are enough flight attendants on board to quickly address all emergencies, fires included, since airlines generally set their staffing at the minimum level required by regulators, Garland said.\n\nIf e-cigarettes are found to pose an increased likelihood of fire compared with other electronics, \u201cthen the FAA should be setting a standard there,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the union has not called for a ban. \u201cLithium-ion batteries are part of almost everything we touch at this point in life, and there are some realistic components about how you deal with that,\u201d particularly on a plane with 200 passengers, each with two or three devices, Garland said.\n\nFlight crews have been able to handle nearly all of the e-cigarette incidents during flights in recent years without diverting the plane, according to FAA data.\n\nThey dealt with smoking bags on flights from London, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio, a smoking battery in a passenger\u2019s pocket en route to Denver and a charred bag headed for Florida, among others. Flight attendants often dumped the devices into containment bags.\n\nAfter a passenger saw his overheating e-cigarette smoking on a flight to Indianapolis in December 2016, an American Airlines crew \u201cused fire extinguishers to extinguish\u201d the device, and the flight was diverted to Little Rock.\n\nThe FAA noted that \u201ccurrent requirements for e-cigarettes state that spare batteries should be protected so as to prevent short circuits.\u201d But those rules are sometimes ignored, such as on a 2017 flight when an \u201cunprotected battery\u201d was tossed into a small bag with jewelry, according to an FAA incident report.\n\nSome have questioned whether e-cigarettes should be allowed on planes at all.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like a bad idea until we figure out what\u2019s going on, why they\u2019re exploding,\u201d said Matthew E. Rossheim, a public health expert and assistant professor at George Mason University.\n\n[FDA blasts Juul for illegally marketing e-cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes]\n\n\n\nAn FAA notice for passengers. The agency says \u201cbanning e-cigarettes from cabins could have the unintended consequence of passengers putting them in their checked luggage,\u201d making it harder for flight crews \u201cto be informed and mitigate any safety concerns.\u201d (Federal Aviation Administration)\n\nRossheim and his colleagues estimated in a study last year that 2,035 people went to U.S. emergency rooms to treat e-cigarette explosion and burn injuries from 2015 to 2017.\n\nA review of a CPSC database covering cases in 2018 shows the severity of ongoing injuries.\n\nIn June, a 44-year-old man\u2019s vape pen exploded in his pocket at a motel, causing second-degree burns on his penis, according to an account filed with the commission. Eight days later, a 38-year-old heard a \u201cwhooshing\u201d sound when his device caught fire, burning his thigh. Then, two days later, another explosion and chemical burn, this time on a 28-year-old\u2019s upper leg.\n\n\u201cIf it happens in somebody\u2019s pocket while they\u2019re on an airplane packed with people, it could result in severe injuries, not only to the person whose pocket it\u2019s in but all the people who are around and in range of the blast,\u201d Rossheim said.\n\nMarket leader Juul says its devices are safe to carry on planes.\n\n\u201cOur captive batteries cannot be removed or altered by the consumer and have limited charging capacity, which mitigates the risks associated with a removable battery. JUUL device batteries also store a fraction of the energy of common open-system vaporizers,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nBut there are numerous competitors, and many users modify the devices and use aftermarket replacement batteries.\n\n[Vape pen kills man after exploding in his mouth]\n\nMillam, of the Flight Safety Foundation, said banning broad classes of devices is an overly simplistic approach. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more complicated than just saying, \u2018My e-cigarette turned black \u2014 should we ban all e-cigarettes?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor airlines, \u201cusually this comes down to a risk assessment and calculation,\u201d Millam said, including two basic questions: \u201cHow often is that sort of thing going to cause problems?\u201d and \u201cWhat is its potential to ignite something around it?\u201d\n\nContinuing to gather information to see if a clear case emerges, as has been done in the past, makes sense, he said. Airlines have banned hoverboards and restricted \u201csmart\u201d bags, which are equipped with batteries to recharge yet more batteries.\n\nThe FAA said \u201cbanning e-cigarettes from cabins could have the unintended consequence of passengers putting them in their checked luggage,\u201d making it harder for flight crews \u201cto be informed and mitigate any safety concerns.\u201d\n\nUnited spokesman Hobart said the airline has a range of mitigation strategies in case of any problem, including using containment bags or diverting an aircraft if need be.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the best-trained crew members in the business,\u201d Hobart said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not safe to fly, we\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d", "description": "Safety officials have struggled to keep up with the deluge of billions of electronic devices travelers are carrying.", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Rzwrh2AQuRSSgZsFhVcqoUZ0Gno=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SBE2RCXG6MI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
