Mr Wagstaff branded the alleged victim 'stupid and wicked' for accusing his long-time friend.\n\nDuring a fractious exchange with prosecuting barrister, Robin Turton, the retired chief executive furiously denied Mr Wellings had done anything wrong during the incident and was shocked when his friend was arrested at Darlington railway station.\n\nMr Wagstaff accepted that the pair had been a 'bit loud' and had been told to 'pipe down' by a fellow passenger during the train journey but denied his friend had behaved inappropriately towards the woman.\n\nDuring his evidence in chief, the witness said the alleged victim behaved like 'a Hollywood actress' in the way she reacted to Mr Wellings touching her arm as he attempted to get her attention. Mr Wagstaff said: 'The woman made a dramatic \"oh\" and pulled away.\n\n'Arthur said \"I'm sorry, did I touch your tittie?\" \u2013 I will never forget it. At the time I thought it was an Oscar-worthy performance \u2013 I thought no he didn't (touch her breast) but if he did it was by accident.'\n\nDuring cross examination, Mr Wagstaff clashed with Mr Turton on several occasions.\n\nHe said: 'Never in a million years did I expect this to come to court. I didn't know that she had made the claim that he had touched her breasts. We never heard anything, we thought she couldn't be that stupid, that wicked, to make that claim against an 83-year-old man of such high moral standing.'\n\nA number of character references were read out in support of Mr Wellings, of Becket Drive, York, including one from Age UK in the city where the defendant volunteers.\n\nIn the prosecution's closing address, Mr Turton described the pair's behaviour as 'boorish' while they were on the train.\n\nHe said: 'She felt that Arthur Wellings was showing off to his younger friend. Arthur Wellings was not thinking about other people's feelings, just his own. This was the first time that anything like this had happened to her.'\n\nAisha Wadoodi's closing speech in Mr Wellings' defence reminded the jurors that her client was a man of good character and hit back at Mr Turton's allegation that the two friends had been acting in a rude or arrogant way during the journey.\n\nMr Wellings and Mr Wagstaff walked smiling together from the court but made no comment on his acquittal.", "description": "Arthur Wellings walked free from Teesside Crown Court today after he accidentally brushed against a train hostess after he touched her arm on a train near Darlington.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20040322-0-image-a-6_1571756509291.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
