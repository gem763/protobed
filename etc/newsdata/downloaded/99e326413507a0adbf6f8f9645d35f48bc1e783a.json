The attacks seem to be aimed at destroying the \u201cIranian land bridge\u201d that the precipitous President Obama pullout of American forces from Iraq enabled.\n\nThe development of this network of terror armies from Tehran to Damascus has endangered the national security of the United States, along with its allies in the region, including the Jewish state of Israel.\n\nThe \u201cunidentified\u201d aircraft seem to be operating with impunity in a region brimming with Russian air defense systems employed by Iran, Syria and Russia herself, protecting her forces near Russia\u2019s air bases in Latakia.\n\nThis development begs several questions.\n\nFirst, whose aircraft are these? It is obvious the aircraft described are stealth attack jets; this leaves only the United States and Israel as possibilities. The F-35 is rumored to now operate with complete air superiority over Iraq and Iran, due to the alleged impossibility of its tracking and detection.\n\nSecondly, why is Russia allowing the aircraft to operate with impunity?\n\nWe have written before about a possible deal in the works between Washington and Moscow, allowing the U.S. (and Israel) to target Iran in the Middle East in return for relaxation of sanctions over Russia\u2019s behavior in Ukraine. It looks like President Trump is getting America\u2019s part of the deal in the Levant and Fertile Crescent. Russia is not lighting up Israeli or American jets with its vaunted S-400s in-theater.\n\nI believe Israel is behind most of the attacks. Part of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy is to withdraw American forces from the region to save lives, treasure, and operational stress on our military, which is strung out from endless wars.\n\nIt seems Mr. Trump has told the Israelis \u2014 \u201cWe gave you the F-35, now use it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
