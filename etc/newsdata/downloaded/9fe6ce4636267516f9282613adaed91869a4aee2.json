He split up from his long-term girlfriend and then he lost his job. But he knows he only has himself to blame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s always been a popular member of the cast and everyone loves Robbie Jackson so it\u2019s a real shame that he will no longer be on our screens.\u2019\n\nThey added: \u2018Dean knows that he was given a huge opportunity when he returned to EastEnders full-time two years ago after a number of guest stints. But his break-up with Rebekah hit him hard and he spent a lot of the summer out in Ibiza. Whenever he wasn\u2019t filming he\u2019d be off for the weekend.\n\n\u2018He was telling friends out there what had been going on and how he was coming to the end of his contract when his bosses found out what he\u2019d done and decided not to renew his contract for now.\u2019\n\nBack in March, Gaffney split from his girlfriend of three years.\n\nAn insider told The Sun at the time: \u2018Dean hit the jackpot when he got together with Rebekah but now she\u2019s told him to take a hike.\n\n\u2018She got bored of his antics and felt like a trophy on his arm, not a girlfriend he treasured and wanted to marry. Dean was gutted when it happened but Rebekah had reached the end of her tether and left him.\n\n\u2018She feels like she is better off by herself and seeing as Dean thinks he\u2019s some kind of stud, he\u2019ll no doubt manage to charm someone else into being his girlfriend in no time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro.co.uk has approached EastEnders for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Robbie Jackson has already been seen leaving the country to take care of his son Sami, who has been injured in a car accident.", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/18110737-low_res-eastenders-april-june-2019-29c4_1570974648.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
