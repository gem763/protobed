But in a news release Friday night, Mr. Schiff (D., Calif.) said the inspector general had determined the complaint to be credible and notified his House committee of the matter on Monday.\n\nMr. Schiff said he asked acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the full, unredacted complaint the next day, and he suggested it was being withheld to protect President Trump or other administration officials.\n\nMr. Schiff said he also sought all records pertaining to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s involvement in the matter and any correspondence with others in the executive branch, including the White House.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut earlier on Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence rebuffed Mr. Schiff\u2019s request and stated that it would withhold the whistleblower complaint in part because it involves confidential and \u201cpotentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community,\u201d according to the House committee\u2019s news release.\n\nA senior intelligence official said in a statement Friday night that the subpoena was being reviewed and would be responded to appropriately.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Mr. Maguire \u201care committed to fully complying with the law and upholding whistleblower protections and have done so here,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn a letter accompanying the subpoena to Mr. Maguire, Mr. Schiff said the acting director of national intelligence was failing to comply with his legal obligations to turn over the complaint.\n\n\u201cYou do not possess the authority to withhold from the Committee a whistleblower disclosure from within the Intelligence Community that is intended for Congress,\u201d Mr. Schiff wrote in the letter. \u201cThe committee can only conclude, based on this remarkable confluence of factors, that the serious misconduct at issue involves the President of the United States and/or other senior White House or Administration officials.\u201d\n\nMr. Maguire took over as the Trump administration\u2019s top intelligence official after Dan Coats and his top deputy, Sue Gordon, resigned last month amid pressure from the White House.\n\nWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to the nation\u2019s top intelligence official Friday night, seeking to force him to turn over a whistleblower complaint that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general has allegedly deemed a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d", "authors": ["Siobhan Hughes", "Dustin Volz", "Siobhan.Hughes Wsj.Com", "Dustin.Volz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107228/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
