The Turkish offensive has attracted global condemnation, amid fears of a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Syrians have become internally displaced, dozens of civilians have been killed and hundreds of detainees have escaped from Kurdish camps and prisons \u2013 some of them relatives of Isis members \u2013 since the offensive began.\n\nA meeting of the Nato Parliamentary Assembly meeting in London heard on Monday, with surprise and consternation, Ben Wallace say that: \u201cTurkey needs to do what it has to do to defend itself. It is absolutely clear that Turkey has a threat emanating towards it from groups such as the PKK, a terrorist organisation.\u201d\n\nA member of the German Bundestag spoke of his astonishment at Mr Wallace\u2019s remark and pointedly asked: \u201cif you are convinced that Turkey has a legitimate reason for invading Syria, what would be your answer to the Turks if they were to ask you, in reference to Article 5 [which stipulates mutual support for Nato members] that Nato should support them?\u201d\n\nUK and other European Special Forces, present in limited numbers in Syria, had been working alongside the Americans, with the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Force (SDF). They have now withdrawn from northern Syria and will leave the country when US troops do so.\n\nThe Kurds on Sunday signed a security deal with Damascus, hoping to push back the Turkish offensive. Kurdish dreams of an autonomous statelet appear to be over.\n\nThere is, The Independent understands, a feeling of great unhappiness among many involved in the British and US mission to Iraq and Syria about what has unfolded.\n\nGeneral Sir David Richards, the former head of the British military, and former commander of international forces in Afghanistan, said that: \u201cOn an emotional level, and if one being dispassionate, on a tactical level, what is being done to the Kurds is plainly wrong. In fact it\u2019s pretty awful after all they had done against Isis. But we are also in a situation now where there doesn\u2019t appear to be a coherent strategy in Syria.\n\n\u201cDecisions have been taken by the Trump administration which are very difficult to fathom.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what\u2019s going to happen now to a bunch of very violent Isis prisoners, whether they are going to become free again to carry on terrorist attacks,\u201d Sir David told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThese decisions also mean that Russian and Iranian influence will grow. I really can\u2019t see how this protects Western interests. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d\n\nGeneral Sir Richard Barrons, the former chief of Joint Forces Command, who had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, lamented that Trump\u2019s decision has pushed the Kurds to turn to the Assad regime for support.\n\n\u201cThe move by President Trump to withdraw US forces was used by the Turks to go into Syria in the guise of a CT (counter terrorism) operation to attack who they see as their Kurdish enemy, and create a zone where they are going to put some of the millions of Syrian refugees in their country,\u201d Sir Richard said.\n\nAnkara sees Syrian Kurdish groups as an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish group banned in Turkey.\n\nThe American move, Sir Richard said, \u201chas meant that the SDF has been suddenly left without support and this means they have had to turn to the Syrians.\n\nWith the Kurds it is a matter of treating allies with decency and honour. The Kurds did a good job against Isis, and this is not the way they should have been treated", "description": "Senior former commanders in the British military have condemned the way Kurdish allies in Syria have been abandoned by Donald Trump, and spoken of their deep concern about how this has raised the real threat of Isis rising again to carry out attacks in the region and beyond.The generals, most of whom", "authors": ["Kim Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XnPS6VnnAEiZgcgWJgpwHg--~B/aD0zNzE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/84ddcd57a702c19c6b835d298116b593", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
