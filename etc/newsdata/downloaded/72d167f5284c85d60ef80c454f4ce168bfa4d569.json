It is in a very sensitive and difficult phase,\" he said.\n\nJohnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by the current deadline of Oct. 31, with or without a transition deal.\n\nWith the outcome of the marathon Brexit process still mired in doubt, the United Kingdom Supreme Court will rule on Tuesday whether Johnson's Aug. 28 decision to suspend parliament was unlawful.\n\nBREXIT IN PLAY?\n\nIf its 11 justices rule against the government at 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) on Tuesday, Johnson could be forced to recall parliament - a step that widens the scope for lawmakers to block his \"do-or-die\" Brexit plans, which they fear could see Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party will vote to decide its strategy on Monday, leader Jeremy Corbyn heading for a showdown with the widely pro-EU party membership over whether Labour should endorse a policy of remaining in the bloc.\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution. Unless the Irish border backstop is removed or amended, Johnson will not be able to win parliamentary approval - but Ireland and the EU are loath to sign a deal without a solution to the frontier.\n\nJohnson has said he wants to secure an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18, and that \"a large number of the important players\", including Britain, Germany, France and Ireland, are keen to reach an agreement.\n\nBut he says that means a removal of the backstop, which aims to avoid the reimposition of checks along what would be the sole British land border with the EU by having London follow EU rules on trade, state aid, labour and environmental standards.\n\nHe said it was important the United Kingdom \"whole and entire\" was able to break away from EU law in future.\n\n\"The problem with ... the current backstop is that it would prevent the UK from diverging over a huge range of industrial standards and others,\" he said. \"We may want to regulate differently but clearly there is also a strong incentive to keep goods moving fluidly, and we think we can do both.\"\n\nAn EU diplomat said on Monday that Johnson's government was sticking to a counter-productive approach imposing \"its own, self-made problems on us and demand(ing) that we fix them.\n\n\"...Why would we bend our rules for a country that is leaving? Why put ourselves at risk for a third country? Why help smooth their departure at our own cost?\" the diplomat said.", "description": "EU's Barnier says it's hard to see Brexit solution", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8M18R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
