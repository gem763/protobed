He can shoot and he is so quick and (has) good movements.\n\n\u201cWe now have another player who is very good in one-versus-one situations. We have Sofiane (Boufal), we have him, we have Nathan (Redmond)... So the quality we have in the front is fantastic.\n\n\u201cThey are hard to read and when they have the ball they are always very, very good and dangerous. This is absolutely a development from last season.\u201d\n\nSouthampton, who moved up to 10th, next host Bournemouth in the league on Friday.", "description": "Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuettl applauded Moussa Djenepo's ability to adapt quickly after playing the winger out of position in Saturday's 1-0 Premier League win over Sheffield United.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430112558&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0CO", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
