REUTERS/Joe White/File Photo\n\nToyota will also equip GAC and their joint venture\u2019s car models with fuel cells, according to a filing by GAC to the Shanghai stock exchange on Thursday.\n\nThe companies did not disclose financial details of the projects which deepen cooperation among the partners to develop new energy vehicle and connectivity technologies.\n\nFuel-cell cars use a stack of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity to propel the vehicle, with water being the only byproduct.\n\nToyota will also expand cooperation on hybrid vehicles and aim to launch more battery electric vehicles with \u201cgood quality and low prices\u201d separately with FAW and GAC.\n\nSources told Reuters last year Toyota planned to sell electric vehicles with GAC\u2019s logo in their joint venture\u2019s dealerships, in a move to meet China\u2019s strict green car quotas.\n\nThe new development plan reflects gestures of goodwill to Beijing by Toyota, whose Chief Executive Akio Toyoda wants to \u201cstep on the accelerator in China\u201d, while needing \u201cto strike a fine balance between China and the United States\u201d, according to minutes of internal meetings seen by Reuters.\n\nToyota sold around 1.5 million cars in China in 2018, far below its global rival General Motors and Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) China sales. However, it is laying the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, Reuters reported last year.\n\nToyota in April said it had started supplying fuel-cell parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Beijing SinoHytec Co Ltd. In July it said it would supply key hydrogen fuel-cell parts to Chinese automakers FAW and Higer Bus.\n\nToyota will also share resources and talent to develop \u201cintelligent connected\u201d vehicles with GAC and FAW.", "description": "Toyota Motor plans to launch hydrogen fuel-cell car models with its China partners Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) and FAW Group [SASACJ.UL], as the Japanese automaker tries to boost its presence in the world's biggest auto market.", "authors": ["Yilei Sun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434172855&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1AN", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
