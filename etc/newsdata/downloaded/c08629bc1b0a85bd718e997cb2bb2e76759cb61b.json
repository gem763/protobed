He's a friend of mine, and I'm glad we didn't have a problem because, frankly, he's a hell of a leader, and he's a tough man,\" Trump said, adding that the Turkish president is a \"strong man.\"\n\nThe chummy remarks came a week after the US president sent a letter to his Turkish counterpart warning him not to be \"a tough guy.\" Even so, it appeared that, in looking to compliment Erdogan, Trump turned to what he considers to be the highest praise possible: tough.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Trump praised a leader for being tough. That the president seems to prefer strongmen to traditional allies is one of the constants of his otherwise chaotic foreign policy.\n\nTrump is in office for it at the right time. While this is hardly an era of great men, it is a time ripe with tough guys pushing tough-guy foreign policy.\n\nAnd when that tough-guy attitude leads to disastrous action, as it inevitably does, the results are catastrophic for those whom the policy really affects.\n\nThe cult of the tough guy\n\nTough-guy foreign policy is based on the idea that strength, above all, is what matters, and that the way to seem strong, in their minds, is to project an image of traditional masculinity.\n\nThe classic of the genre is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rides horses and goes fishing shirtless (experiences captured on film and released by the Kremlin).\n\nPutin is an avowed fan of judo and plays hockey. His country reportedly set up a national doping project so that its athletes might appear the toughest and strongest at the Olympics. He told Oliver Stone, in his questionable documentary on the Russian president, that only women have bad days and he would not shower near a gay man so as not to provoke him.\n\nAnd this is the machismo that Putin demonstrates in his foreign policy too. The Russian president brought his dog out to shake German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who reportedly has a fear of dogs after being attacked in 1995, threatened to string then-Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili up \"by the balls,\" and reminded us all that he could take out capital cities in a matter of days.\n\nBut while Putin may be the original tough guy, he is far from the only one these days.\n\nThere is Trump, obviously. But there is also Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte with his drug war and fond recollections of having personally killed people. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has positioned himself as the defender of Christian Europe, and Trump also praised Orban as a \"tough man.\" There is North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, of whom Trump said, \"I was being really tough and so was he.\" And, of course, there is Erdogan.\n\nTo a point, tough-guy foreign policy has its merits. These elected and unelected men can find common ground in being tough guys and keep from killing one another's citizens, even if it is accompanied by embarrassing photo shoots, egregious human-rights abuses, and disparagement of women.\n\nThe limits of tough-guy policy\n\nBut tough-guy foreign policy works only to a point.\n\nWhen the tough guys' interests inevitably come into conflict, and when the common ground crumbles beneath them, the machismo can become a liability.\n\nBecause toughness is not, in fact, a foreign policy, and personal chemistry between world leaders, even if it is predicated on something as powerful as traditional masculinity, is not necessarily enough to maintain a bilateral relationship.\n\nIf the thing these men have in common is that they resort to projection of strength, they will at some point project it to make one of the other tough guys seem weaker. After all, not all of them can be the toughest guy all the time.\n\nThe shaky nature of tough-guy foreign policy is why the talks between the US and North Korea could go off the rails so easily. It's why it's so disconcerting that the US withdrew from its landmark nuclear agreement with Russia roughly a year after Putin and Trump had their hours-long meeting in Helsinki. And it's why we wait to see what Erdo\u011fan meant when he said he wouldn't forget Trump's letter \u2014 and that \"it should be known that when the time comes, necessary action will be taken regarding this issue.\"\n\nTough-guy foreign policy is appealing to ego, but an ego can easily be bruised, and the consequences can be a nuclear arms race.\n\nWhether the tough guys win or lose, the people who depend on real strength, and not a cartoonish version of it, suffer.\n\nTurkish air strikes crashed down on the hours-old US-Turkish deal. Ankara had picked its military offensive back up. Fourteen civilians were killed by this hell of a leader, this tough man, this strong man.\n\nSubsequently, Erdo\u011fan reached another deal in Syria \u2014 this time with Vladimir Putin, who is, for now, the new guarantor of the Kurds. Later, Trump announced that with the Kurds gone Turkey had agreed to keep the ceasefire in place. \"People are saying, 'Wow, what a great outcome \u2014 congratulations,'\" the president said.\n\nHe announced this as a victory. For a tough guy, everything has to be.", "description": "Trump has shown an affinity for \"tough guy\" leaders like Putin and Erdogan, but this type of foreign policy will end in disaster.", "authors": ["Emily Tamkin", "Opinion Contributor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db20c24dee0191fae3fc967?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
