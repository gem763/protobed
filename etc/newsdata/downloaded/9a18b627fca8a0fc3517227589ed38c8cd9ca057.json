The switch forced Mr. Pence into an awkward commute by plane from the western coast of Ireland to Dublin on the east coast.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s aides initially said Mr. Trump suggested, though never commanded, the vice president to stay at his place.\n\nLater, however, the Pence team released a statement taking full responsibility for the choice.\n\nEither way, Democrats want to know how much it cost taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe White House has not made public how much [the] vice president\u2019s trip cost the American taxpayer \u2014 or benefited the Trump Organization \u2014 but based on previous investigations by the Government Accountability Office, the bill could be significant,\u201d Mr. Cummings told Mr. Mulvaney.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
