As the investigation moved closer to publication, I called the Weinstein Company for comment. Sounding nervous, an assistant said he\u2019d check if the boss was available. And then there was Weinstein\u2019s husky baritone. \u201cWow!\u201d he said with mock excitement. \u201cWhat do I owe this occasion to?\u201d The writing about the man has seldom lingered on this quality: he was pretty funny. But he veered swiftly toward fury. Weinstein hung up on me several times that fall, including on that first day. I told him I wanted to be fair, to include anything he had to say, then asked if he was comfortable with me recording. He seemed to panic, and was gone with a click. The pattern repeated that afternoon. But when I got him to talk for a sustained time, he abandoned his initial caution and got sharply combative.\n\n\u201cHow did you identify yourself to all these women?\u201d he demanded. I was caught off balance. I had started reporting the story for NBC, before turning to the New Yorker.\n\n\u201cDepending on the timing, I accurately described the outlet.\u201d\n\nHe jumped in again. \u201cOh, really? Like you\u2019re a reporter at NBC. And what do your friends at NBC have to say about that now?\u201d I felt a flush rising in my cheeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling because I want to hear you out,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo. I know what you want. I know you\u2019re scared, and alone, and your bosses abandoned you, and your father\u2026 \u201d\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s editor David Remnick stood outside the office, tapping on the glass quietly. He shook his head, made a \u201cwrap it up\u201d gesture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to talk to you, or whomever you want on your team,\u201d I said.\n\nWeinstein laughed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t save someone you love, and now you think you can save everyone.\u201d He really said this. You\u2019d think he was pointing a detonator at Aquaman.\n\nIn the days before the story was published, I reached Weinstein again for less formal calls, and then for long sessions during which I was joined by Remnick, my editor Deirdre Foley-Mendelssohn, and New Yorker lawyer Fabio Bertoni; Weinstein was joined by lawyers and crisis advisors. He had added to his team the public relations firm Sitrick and Company, which handed the assignment to an even-tempered former Los Angeles Times reporter, Sallie Hofmeister.\n\nLarge portions of the conversations were placed off the record. But there were also, among the calls, exchanges for which no ground rules were set, or which Weinstein explicitly placed on the record. At times he sounded defeated. There could be an almost boyish charm in the small \u201cHi, Ronan,\u201d at the top of each call. But more often, there were flashes of the old Weinstein, arrogant and raging. \u201cAllow me to edify you,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cI\u2019m giving you insights.\u201d\n\nBy the end, Weinstein sounded resigned. Several times, he conceded we\u2019d been fair and that he 'deserved' a lot of it\n\nHe suggested repeatedly that an interaction wasn\u2019t rape if the woman came back to him later. That this was at odds with the reality of sexual assault, since it so often transpires within workplace or family relationships \u2013 that it was at odds with the law \u2013 seemed to escape him. He was sceptical, too, of the theme of possible retaliation from him that ran through the women\u2019s claims. \u201cThere\u2019s no retaliating in Hollywood,\u201d he said, calling the concept of powerful men intimidating women in the industry a \u201cmyth\u201d. When I wondered how he figured this was the case, he said that people could simply call up a Ronan Farrow or a [New York Times reporter] Jodi Kantor and the retaliation would go away. I marveled at this logic: helping to create a problem, then pointing to the response it had generated to claim the problem didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn the earlier calls, there was a sense that Weinstein was still living in a parallel reality. He would acknowledge wrongdoing, then characterise his actions by discussing a time he wrote an offensive comment in a girl\u2019s yearbook, or looked at a colleague the wrong way. Each time I reminded him that we were reporting multiple allegations of rape, he sounded startled. He\u2019d been overwhelmed, he\u2019d say, and hadn\u2019t focused on the factchecking messages we\u2019d sent. And this seemed likely enough.\n\nLater, as his advisors joined the fray, the response that we ultimately included in the story came to the fore: a blanket denial of all \u201cnon-consensual sex\u201d, with little engagement on the specific allegations. This seemed to reflect Weinstein\u2019s sincere view: he seldom suggested events hadn\u2019t transpired, instead insisting that the interactions had been consensual and were being recast, years later, in a spirit of opportunism.\n\nHe spent an inordinate amount of time attacking the character of the women. \u201cHarvey, I have a question,\u201d Remnick interjected at one point, in all earnestness. \u201cHow does this relate to your behavior?\u201d Weinstein seemed unconcerned with disputing specific facts. Sometimes, he simply couldn\u2019t recall them. Once, he launched into a detailed discussion of an allegation not included in the story. He\u2019d mixed up a name we\u2019d given him with a similar-sounding one from his own memories.\n\nAs the calls progressed, his temper flared. \u201cShe has an NDA,\u201d he said of one woman. \u201cBe careful for her. We like her.\u201d His dismayed handlers began rapidly talking over him, with limited success. \u201cShe\u2019s a sweetie and a sweetheart,\u201d he continued. \u201cDoesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d There were threats to the New Yorker: to sue, or to leak our factchecking memo to preempt our story. \u201cCareful,\u201d Weinstein would say. \u201cGuys, careful.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Farrow with New Yorker editor David Remnick, who published the Weinstein story two years ago.

Several times, he conceded that we\u2019d been fair \u2013 and that he \u201cdeserved\u201d a lot of it.\n\nOn 10 October, Foley-Mendelssohn circulated a final edit at 1am. When I arrived, the magazine\u2019s offices were quiet and flooded with sunlight, like a prism. As we prepared to go live, a few of us began to gather, and I moved to take a picture. My idea had been unsmiling documentation, not triumphalism, but Remnick broke it up all the same. \u201cNot our style,\u201d he said, and shooed people away to work.\n\nWhen it was up, I wandered over to a window and looked out at the Hudson. There was a numb feeling; Peggy Lee droning, \u201cIs that all there is to a fire?\u201d I hoped the women would feel it was worth it; that they\u2019d been able to protect others. And I wondered what would become of me. I had no arrangement with the New Yorker, and no path forward in television.\n\nMy phone chimed, chimed again. Message after message arrived, quickening to a constant scroll. I heard from fellow journalists, including several reporters who said they had fielded efforts to intimidate them.\n\nBut mostly the messages came from stranger after stranger, saying they, too, had stories. Some were from women, some from men. Some were accounts of sexual violence and some focused on other kinds of corruption. A TV producer emailed me: \u201cThere are more Harveys in your midst.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This is an edited extract from Catch And Kill by Ronan Farrow, published by Fleet, an imprint of Little, Brown, on 15 October at \u00a320.", "description": "Long conference calls and bad-tempered threats: an exclusive extract from Ronan Farrow\u2019s book Catch And Kill", "authors": ["Ronan Farrow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6bfbbc73f44ed3e7e155c3254fcd08a902c10cc/0_28_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=236fa78e63b95e68458d91ab017690c4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
