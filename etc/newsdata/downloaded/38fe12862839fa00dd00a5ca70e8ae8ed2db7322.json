Under the current law, cigarettes are only defined as products that use tobacco leaves. Many of the liquid-form e-cigarettes use tobacco stems and the roots.This will allow the government to tightly regulate products, including control over advertising and related postings and distribution on the internet.The bill will also gradually ban the use of scents in e-cigarettes, as the pleasant smell has the potential to attract younger users.\u201cThe government will actively cooperate,\u201d Park added.According to the government, the first case where a patient was suspected of having lung problems related to vaping was reported on Oct. 2. The government started monitoring liquid e-cigarettes on Sept. 20.A Korean man in his 30s who previously smoked five cigarettes to as much as a full pack daily was reported to have used Juul and KT&G\u2019s Lil Vapor for two to three months.The patient was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 27 but was released five days later, as the patient\u2019s health improved since he stopped vaping.Tests of the patient showed no sign of infection, and the doctor suspected his lungs to be affected by the vaping.Health concerns over vaping have been raised since similar cases have been reported in the United States.According to the Korean Health Ministry 1,479 people who have used liquid e-cigarettes in the United States have suffered severe lung damage, and 33 of them have died.Of the patients, 79 percent of the patients were 35 years old or younger, while 15 percent were 18 or younger. But 78 percent of the cases involved the use of cannabis.The government said as of the end of 2018 about 36 liquid e-cigarette products from 11 companies, including the San Francisco-based Juul as well as KT&G, were sold here.The Health Ministry said it will come up with stronger measures against liquid e-cigarettes in cooperation with other ministries, including the Finance Ministry and the Food and Drug Safety Ministry.President Moon Jae-in on Oct. 18 held an emergency meeting where he ordered the government to come up with liquid e-cigarettes measures.BY LEE HO-JEONG [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
