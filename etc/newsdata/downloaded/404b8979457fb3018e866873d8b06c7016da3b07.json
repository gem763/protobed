Or something that says: approach this text with a creative wariness. If only Scotland, PA\u2014a Roundabout production which opens tonight at the Laura Pels Theatre (to December 8)\u2014had done this. Alas, it feels \u201cfull of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d\n\nMacbeth can be done well or terribly in the original text, even before you take it as the basis of a new musical (based on the 2001 movie, directed by Billy Morrissette). If you\u2019re going to go for it, the first hurdle is to decide on your tone and approach. If you\u2019re going tragic, go fully tragic. If you\u2019re going comic, go comic. If you\u2019re going to mix tragedy and comedy, treat it as the most important cocktail you will ever mix in your life and get the combinations right. Or: bleurgh.\n\nScotland, PA, set in the fall of 1975, starts as what seems to be a simple stoner comedy, with its That \u201870s Show set of a crappy Pennsylvania diner overseen by Duncan (Jeb Brown). His son Malcolm (Will Meyers) is the archetypal kid who can\u2019t stand his dad, but after some backchat about how dead-endy things are in the joint and town, suddenly the musical takes a left turn, with father hitting son and son revealing father used to hit dead mother. Whoa, OK.\n\nThis sets the weird tonal shifts of the whole musical. One second we\u2019re just lolling around having some zoned-out fun, man, and the next it\u2019s murder most foul. From plot lines to character names, the Shakespeare play parallels mount up: Mac/Macbeth; Duncan/King Duncan; Banko/Banquo; Malcolm/Malcolm; Peg McDuff/Macduff; Hector/Hecate; Mrs. Lenox/Lennox.\n\nThe three witches here (Alysha Umphress, Wonu Ogunfowora, and Kaleb Wells) are in hippy garb, and prone to singing and toking\u2014and getting the munchies, post-interval\u2014at the same time. They waft around speaking gloomy words about destiny and death, but also with big smiles on their faces.\n\nMac (Ryan McCartan) and wife Pat (Taylor Iman Jones) work at the diner, and are good souls. They have worked there for a long time, and she is feeling stuck and he doesn\u2019t seem to care. Quite some time, and more than one musical number, is devoted to emphasizing this. I think we are supposed to be wary of her desire to get out of this tree-dominated backwater, but I found myself nodding away at everything she had to say.\n\nBut the musical pins everything on Mac, who seems, frankly, to be a wet ball of wool. She can do so much better than him, although the musical makes her subservient to his own life. She is his cheerleader. He is the one who needs to get the ambition and drive to get them out of here, whereas\u2014in front of us\u2014she clearly has this herself. Why make her so dependent on his success?\n\n\u201c The blood-spattered, murderous side of Scotland, PA, begins\u2014and the tonal shifts and plot oddness spin out of all control \u201d\n\nThey figure they should rob the diner, reasoning they are owed what they will steal because of being so poorly paid all this time. But Duncan is at the diner, and perilously close\u2014after discovering Mac and Pat\u2019s attempted robbery\u2014to the new deep fat fryer. And so the blood-spattered, murderous side of Scotland, PA, begins\u2014and the tonal shifts and plot oddness spin out of all control.\n\nThe musical is serious Mac and Pat, then goes zany, and treats other characters like their buddy Banko (Jay Armstrong Johnson, who at least keeps his fug of dopiness a constant), who just wants to have sex with a woman, the same way.\n\nThe diner, now the property of Mac, receives a makeover, by the way, to what looks like a McDonald\u2019s, but is in fact a McBeth\u2019s. Of course. But the golden M is there, sharper-looking than the classic logo but still... and the yellow and red are in familiar interplay. And so perhaps the ultimate horror and moral corrosion the play is suggesting lies in fast food. Or maybe not: the fries are delicious (they\u2019re on sale at intermission).\n\nBut Mac doesn\u2019t seem as tortured or terrifying as Macbeth should. He didn\u2019t want this, but now that he has it he becomes a power-mad lunatic. So, he goes from someone with good ideas and kindness to a madman, but why? Pat is meant to be Lady Macbeth; again, why? Because she has the temerity to suggest they have a better life? This reasonable life quandary becomes a motivation for serial murder because (I guess) McBeth\u2019s suddenly becomes, in Mac and Pat\u2019s intentions, a global franchise. Again, light comedy hits dark drama\u2014and again, we don't quite see how Mac and Pat got here.\n\nThe musical\u2019s emulations of Macbeth, beyond the naming of characters, don\u2019t map or make sense; not least because the original Macbeth is a tragedy, rather than a stoner comedy with tragic pretensions. Megan Lawrence as Peg McDuff is a vegetarian busybody detective out to expose Mac and Pat\u2019s crimes, bringing an element of amiable comedy, which again is in stark contrast to the musical\u2019s suddenly serious bearing. \u201cSomething wicked this way comes\u201d? Maybe. But is it meant to scare or humor us?\n\nThe music is well-played and well-sung\u2014and the musical also includes a genuinely surprising and well-meant coming out song\u2014but the score does not thrill or freak out as much as its characters do. Is there a tragedy unfolding before us? Yes, but it isn\u2019t Mac\u2019s, or even Macbeth\u2019s. Instead, we are left with \u201ca sorry sight\u201d indeed.", "description": "At first, the musical \u2018Scotland, PA\u2019 feels like a \u201870s-set stoner comedy.
