But having sold their home and everything in it, Locatelli says they could not afford to go back.\n\nFor months, they slept on a dirt floor in a shed with other new arrivals.\n\n\u201cThere were people from Bahia, there were people from Ceara, Fortaleza, there were people from Rio Grande do Sul,\u201d Locatelli recalls.\n\nEventually they received a block of dense virgin forest near Ruropolis \u2014 a three-hour drive from Santarem, where she now lives \u2014 but the house and furniture promised by the government did not exist.\n\nThere was no running water, malaria was rife, and their crops failed.\n\n\u201cIt was misery,\u201d says Locatelli.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of suffering. A lot of people died.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Others worse off \u2013\n\nLocatelli\u2019s ex-husband bought a chainsaw to cut down trees on the block allocated to them and earned money by clearing land for others.\n\nIt was the start of widespread deforestation in the region that accelerated over the following decades as cattle breeders and grain growers pushed deeper into the rainforest.\n\nWithin a few months, Orlando was seriously injured in a tree-felling accident that killed another man, forcing Locatelli to become the family\u2019s breadwinner.\n\nDespite only having a few years of primary school education, Locatelli enrolled in a teacher training course and worked at the roadside community\u2019s school.\n\nLocatelli consoled herself that other families were worse off than hers.\n\n\u201cI had to stand firm and confront life,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t let us starve.\u201d\n\nWhile the years of hardship in the Amazon are etched deeply into her memory, Locatelli says she is sad to see the extent of this year\u2019s deforestation and fires.\n\nTree clearing in the Amazon nearly doubled in the first eight months, compared with the same period in 2018, to 6,404 square kilometers (about 2,470 square miles) \u2014 more than twice the size of Luxembourg.\n\nThe pick-up in deforestation has been blamed for the sharp increase in fires that have ravaged swaths of the region and sparked an international outcry.\n\n\u201cMy head is not the same as when I arrived. We depend a lot on the forest,\u201d Locatelli says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve cried several times and asked God to help in some way so the forest isn\u2019t wiped out.\u201d", "description": "Santar\u00e9m (Brazil) (AFP) \u2013 Maria Helena Locatelli was promised land and a better future in the Amazon rainforest, but all she got was misery when she", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/820918_maria-helena-locatelli-in-her-house-in-santarem-in-brazil-amazon-region-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
