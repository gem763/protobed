There are some people trapped under the carriages,\" he told AFP.\n\nOne of the survivors, Guillaume Yambi Musala, said between 30 and 40 people were in each carriage.\n\n\"I saw a lot of deaths. As it was night, it was impossible to know the exact number,\" he told AFP by telephone.\n\n\"Because there was no passenger train, I took a place on the freight train after paying 15,000 Congolese francs ($9) to the conductor,\" he said, adding that the conductor did not give him a receipt.\n\nStowaways are common on trains in DR Congo, which has only a few thousand kilometres of paved roads to cover the country's 2.3 million square kilometres (880,000 square miles).\n\nWith service by passenger trains patchy to non-existent, often people illegally stow away on freight trains as they have no other means to traverse such long distances.\n\nRailways in DRC have a poor record for safety, hampered by derelict tracks and decrepit locomotives, many of them dating from the 1960s.\n\nIn March, at least 24 people were killed and 31 were injured when a freight train carrying illegal passengers crashed in the central region of Kasai.\n\nIn November last year, 10 stowaways were killed and 24 injured near the eastern town of Samba when the brakes failed on a freight train.\n\nLike many state companies in DR Congo, the national rail company SNCC is on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Kabila stepped down in January, its employees urged his successor, Felix Tshisekedi, to pay months of back wages. The SNCC's former head Sylvestre Ilunga is the country's current prime minister.\n\nPresident Tshisekedi has pledged to spend more on infrastructure, but the state coffers have been bare, despite the country's vast mineral resources.\n\nOpposition figure Moise Katumbi said that \"the rehabilitation of the railway, long neglected by the former regime, is a priority to spare the lives and suffering of our compatriots.\"", "description": "A freight train derailed in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, killing between 10 and 50 people stowing away onboard according to conflicting reports, in the latest rail tragedy to strike the vast central African nation.
