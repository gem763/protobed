The company, whose core product is a $2,245 internet-connected bike, made its debut on the Nasdaq on Thursday, opening at $27 per share.\n\nIn its S-1 filing, the company describes itself as more than just a fitness company \u2014 it says its a tech, media, software, retail, and a social connection company.\n\nBeyond these labels, one brand consultant believes that Peloton\u2019s unique way of doing things pushes past a one-dimensional business model, representing status in a new light.\n\n\u201cYou're literally at home by yourself, but you're connected to a community of potential millions, you know? So it's very unique. And it signals status in a new way,\u201d said Chuck Welch, founder of Brand Consultant agency Rupture, on YFi AM on Thursday.\n\nPresident of Peloton William Lynch and employees celebrate ringing the opening bell for the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market site in New York City, New York, U.S., September 26, 2019.

In addition to the bike, Peloton also has a $4,295 treadmill and an app that offers everything from power walking to meditation to yoga to strength training.\n\n\u201cI don't see them as a bike company...I see them as a wellness company. So if you say, OK, wellness is my purview, then that opens me up to get off the bike, and it becomes, how can I serve my customer base through all these different means, whether it's CBD, whether it's supplements, whether it's meet-ups, whether it's music concerts, new products? Hell, Peloton could create its own new fitness model where people actually get off the bike and go into the gym.\u201d\n\nIn Welch\u2019s eyes, the company has the energy it needs to maintain its following and profitability. \u201cI think they have a very unique model. They kind of pioneered a new liminal space that's not quite digital, not quite physical. It kind of sits in between.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"It's [Peloton] very intimate, where it's not showy, but it still kind of signal status in a new way", "authors": ["Jennifer Shanker", "Production Assistant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fP7CEBqa12g8aD.KuUvi1g--~B/aD0zNTgwO3c9NTM3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/de2c9580-e09a-11e9-bfef-975f47bdb2e8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
