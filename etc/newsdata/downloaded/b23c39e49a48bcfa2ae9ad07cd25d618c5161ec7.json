A figure of global import who at the age of 16 stands at the head of a peaceful campaign to clean up the planet despite having buckets of polluted bile thrown at her by supposedly \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d adults every day. She can\u2019t vote in her native Sweden. She wouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote if she held British citizenship either.\n\nExhibit B: Boris Johnson, a bloviating, law breaking demagogue who shamelessly, and successfully, encourages violence against other elected representatives. He can.\n\nExtending the franchise to cover 16 and 17-year-olds is very much on the agenda as their elders systematically and wilfully engage in sowing chronic distemper around what was once a decent sort of country.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOpposition parties favour the idea so we may yet join the likes of Austria - where 16 is the age of majority - sooner than you think.\n\nThat would be a welcome development.\n\nOpponents of such a move like to argue that 16 and 17-year-olds are not mature enough to make choices about their and the country\u2019s future because, I don\u2019t know, they watch a lot of YouTube and sometimes like to sleep with each other with unintended consequences. As if that can\u2019t happen to anyone with a functional reproductive system.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Yesterday The Times ran a baleful front page warning of riots if our law breaking gangster government fails to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d.\n\nWho is it that\u2019s threatening them?\n\nWho is it bandying around words that in another context might get you hauled before the local magistrates for a ticking off together with a demand that you spend some time cleaning up the local canal? Incitement to riot is a crime, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\nIt certainly isn\u2019t 16 and 17-year-olds. It isn\u2019t 18 or 19-year olds for that matter.\n\nYou might find a fair number of teenagers cheerfully waving signs with the occasional potty mouthed joke on them while enthusiastically blowing whistles at Final Say marches.\n\nYou won\u2019t find them caving in the windows of MPs\u2019 offices as has been happening in recent days.\n\nIt is a corps of mostly middle aged and older men egged on by Tory MPs in an unholy alliance with those on their (far) right flank, who are engaging in that sort of behaviour.\n\nBut, but, but, how on earth can we let them vote when we don\u2019t let them drink?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve seen variants on that one. Growing up, is a process. You get different rights and different responsibilities at different ages.\n\nThat thing about alcohol, which you can obtain fairly easily at 16 (I did and I doubt it\u2019s changed much since I was a teenager) is that it is a drug that, once again, plenty of older folks regularly prove they are not mature and responsible enough to handle. A good example would be a government advisor by the name of Dominic Cummings, who\u2019s fond of confronting shadow cabinet members while stinking of wine late at night.\n\nBy the way, you are criminally responsible at the age of 10, far younger than in most European countries. I\u2019m not going to argue that a 10-year-old should get the right to vote on the criminal justice system that considers them as responsible as an adult for their actions. But perhaps the \u201cthey\u2019re not mature enough to vote\u201d brigade might like to spend some time addressing that one.\n\nWhat you can do at 16 is jump into bed with a partner of your choice (see above) pay taxes and make decisions about your future - mostly you\u2019ll be in education but the choice regarding the direction you take is still yours. You can also marry and pick up a gun in the service of your country although you\u2019ll have to get your parents approval.\n\nSome of those parents (and grandparents) are not excelling themselves when it comes to setting an example, and particularly the parent in Downing Street. Has anyone established how many kids he has yet? Or how many he is actually involved in the lives of?\n\nGoodness me, my 11-year-old shows more maturity and more responsibility than the incredible sulk does.\n\nI\u2019m not arguing he should have the vote. He\u2019s only part way through his schooling for a start. But in five years' time he and his schoolmates will have a knowledge of history, government, and the rights and responsibilities of British citizenship that is a good deal sharper and fresher in mind than most of their elders.\n\nHe and his friends will almost certainly behave better too.\n\nIt\u2019s high time we let them cast their verdict on the way those elders are running things.\n\nIt is, after all, their future that is at stake and that is being trashed in front of their eyes by the supposed grown ups.", "description": "Exhibit A: Greta Thurnberg.
