(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nThe Oakland Raiders, in an abrupt reversal, allowed wide receiver Antonio Brown to rejoin the team Friday and opted against suspending or releasing him, at least for now.\n\nHe is scheduled to play in the Raiders\u2019 season-opening game Monday night at home against the Denver Broncos, according to Coach Jon Gruden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Gruden told reporters Friday at the team\u2019s training facility. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, yes.\u201d\n\n[The Antonio Brown saga, explained]\n\nGruden also said: \u201cAntonio is back today.

Enough talk, man. I\u2019m excited to be out here with my teammates. I\u2019m grateful for all the fans. I\u2019m excited to be a part of the Raiders and see you guys soon.\u201d\n\n#Raiders WR Antonio Brown \u201cI\u2019m excited to be out here with my team. I apologized to my teammates.

A suspension would have been without pay and could have voided the guarantee of a large portion of Brown\u2019s contract.\n\nThe penalties would have come in reaction to a practice-field incident Wednesday between Brown and Mike Mayock, the team\u2019s general manager.\n\nBut agent Drew Rosenhaus, who represents Brown, worked to mend Brown\u2019s relationship with Mayock and the team. The Raiders appear to be giving Brown, the seven-time Pro Bowl selection they obtained in an offseason trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers, at least one more chance.\n\nSeveral people familiar with the situation said later Friday they expect the Raiders to fine Brown for Wednesday\u2019s verbal confrontation with Mayock, but the amount of any such fine was not immediately clear. Under the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the NFL Players Association, a club can fine a player as much as one game\u2019s pay for conduct detrimental to the team. In Brown\u2019s case, that would be $860,294, one-seventeenth of his 2019 salary of $14.625 million.\n\nLater Friday, Brown released a video on his YouTube channel containing audio, apparently, of a phone conversation that he had with Gruden. During the conversation, Gruden asks Brown if he wants to be a Raider or not and Brown replies by asking if the team wants that. Gruden tells Brown to \u201cjust play football.\u201d\n\nUnder the CBA, a team can suspend a player for as many as four games without pay for conduct detrimental to the team. The Raiders, at least for the time being, have chosen not to do that with Brown. Brown could, if he chooses, appeal any penalty by the Raiders through the NFLPA.\n\nBrown signed a three-year, $50.1 million contract with the Raiders as part of the offseason trade that brought him from the Pittsburgh Steelers. That deal contained $30.1 million in guaranteed money. If he was suspended, that could have revoked the guarantee of $29.1 million, although this season\u2019s salary would have become re-guaranteed by being on the Raiders\u2019 roster Monday.\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident came with Brown unhappy about receiving a letter from Mayock informing him that he had been fined nearly $54,000 for missing a walk-through and a practice last month. Brown had posted a photo of that fine letter to social media. The incident included, according to reports, Brown using profane language toward Mayock and threatening to punch him. Brown reportedly also punted a football and told Mayock to fine him for that.\n\nAntonio Brown posts his displeasure with fines from #Raiders pic.twitter.com/0OMhdwFu7K \u2014 Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) September 4, 2019\n\nThe Raiders told Brown to stay home Thursday rather than report to the team\u2019s training facility. Brown did not participate in Thursday\u2019s practice. Mayock and Gruden spoke to reporters Thursday but declined to discuss the specifics of Wednesday\u2019s incident or the Raiders\u2019 plans for Brown.\n\nBrown was one of the NFL\u2019s most productive pass-catchers in Pittsburgh. But he became increasingly disgruntled, and the Steelers eventually accommodated his trade request. His short tenure with the Raiders has been turbulent. He missed practice time because of injuries to his feet reportedly suffered while undergoing cryotherapy treatments. He filed two failed grievances against the NFL seeking to be permitted to wear a helmet not up to the league\u2019s safety standards.\n\nThe Raiders mostly remained supportive of Brown throughout the feet and helmet ordeals. Gruden has expressed admiration for Brown as a player and has said he believes that Brown is a good person. But Mayock followed one of Brown\u2019s absences last month by saying that it was time for Brown to be \u201call-in or all-out\u201d in terms of his commitment to the team.\n\nRead more:\n\nTyreek Hill, Chiefs agree to contract extension after tumultuous offseason\n\nThe Steelers are less talented than a year ago.
