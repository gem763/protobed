Grassroots pro-secession groups had warned that if any of the defendants were found guilty they would organize protests and \"peaceful civil disobedience.\" Spanish authorities have deployed hundreds of extra police to the region.\n\n\"Today, they have violated all their rights. It is horrible that Europe doesn't act,\" 60-year-old civil servant Deni Saball said while protesting in the street. \"I don't want to be European. I don't want to be Spanish.\"\n\nThe court's decision was another milestone in the long struggle for separatists who want Catalonia to break away from Spain and create a new European state. Spain insists it won't allow it. The Spanish constitution says the country cannot be divided.\n\nThe separatist effort fell flat when it won no international recognition. The Spanish government stepped in and fired the Catalan regional government, with prosecutors later bringing charges.\n\nAt the center of the prosecutors' case was the Oct. 1, 2017 independence referendum that the Catalan government held even though the country's highest court had disallowed it.\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote won, but because it was an illegal ballot most voters didn't turn out and the vote count was considered of dubious value. The Catalan Parliament, however, unilaterally declared independence three weeks later, triggering Spain's worst political crisis in decades.\n\nSeven separatist leaders allegedly involved in the events, including ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, fled the country and are regarded by Spain as fugitives.\n\n\"A total of 100 years of prison. How horrible,\" Puigdemont tweeted Monday. \"Now more than ever, we will be with you and your families. For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia.\"\n\nThe trial featured over 500 witnesses, including former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, and 50 nationally televised hearings.\n\nDefense lawyers argued that the leaders of the secessionist movement were carrying out the will of roughly half of the 7.5 million residents of Catalonia who, opinion polls indicate, would like the region to be a separate country.\n\nThe Catalan leaders - jailed for nearly two years while their case was heard - have grown into powerful symbols for the separatists. Many sympathizers wear yellow ribbons pinned to their clothes as a sign of protest.\n\nThe verdict will almost certainly become another rallying point for the separatist cause, which is going through its most difficult period in years with its most charismatic leaders behind bars or abroad.\n\nThe Catalan separatist movement's two main political parties disagree on the next moves, and the grassroots organizations that have driven the movement are starting to criticize the lack of political progress.\n\nThe verdict also came less than a month before Spain holds a general election on Nov. 10 to choose a new government, and the political handling of the Catalan independence question will undoubtedly be one of the top issues.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writers Joseph Wilson in Barcelona and Barry Hatton in Lisbon contributed.\n\nSupreme Court judge Manuel Marchena, centre, arrives at the court in Madrid, Spain, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.
