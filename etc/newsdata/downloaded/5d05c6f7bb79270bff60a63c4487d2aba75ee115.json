Dangerous leaks like this must end", "language": "en", "text": "Several news organizations have reported that the whistleblower behind the \u201cUkraine impeachment\u201d feeding frenzy is a CIA officer who was detailed to the White House.\n\nIf accurate, that raises some very troubling questions and scenarios.\n\nNot for President Trump. But rather, for the CIA and others in the Deep State who may be leaking confidential and top secret information for personal or partisan reasons.\n\nHOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nThe Trump White House and CIA have a history. Part of it has been adversarial from the very beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nOver two years ago, new organizations reported that career officials within the CIA were doing everything in their power to remove Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Trump\u2019s then-senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council.\n\nThe CIA officials were reportedly outraged that Cohen-Watnick, along with his previous boss, Michael Flynn, saw eye-to-eye about what they believed to be the failings of CIA human intelligence operations.\n\nIn a news report at the time, an intelligence community insider said CIA officials viewed Cohen-Watnick as a \"threat,\" so they tried to replace him with an \"agency loyalist.\"\n\nAn agency loyalist. One can and should read a lot into that particular description.\n\nIn theory and by law, all intelligence operatives should be loyal to the United States of America, and not an agency, ideology, political party or even a past president.\n\nBut that is where human nature steps into the equation. Human nature dictates that we all have biases.\n\nAs we have seen during the course of these politically polarized three years, some people are overly influenced or even blinded by liberal bias. Others by conservative bias.\n\nHuman nature and bias do not cease to exist once one enters the intelligence community. But it must be seen for what it is and then controlled.\n\nIt can certainly be argued that before the election of Donald Trump, President Obama spent eight years stacking the intelligence community deck with political and professional operatives who strongly agreed with his ideological view of the world.\n\nIt can also be argued that many of those Obama holdovers were horrified by the election of Trump, and suddenly saw it as their \u201cduty\u201d to do anything in their power to delegitimize him and his administration.\n\nThere is no doubt that since Day One of the Trump presidency, the \u201cduty\u201d of some of these intelligence operatives was to open a direct pipeline to certain members of the media to leak classified or secret information with the sole intention of harming the president personally and professionally.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs I have stressed in the past, I don\u2019t believe there is any government agency more critical to the welfare of our national security than the Central Intelligence Agency. Its field operatives anonymously put their lives on the line every single day to protect us all. With Gina Haspel as director, the agency could not be in more capable hands.\n\nThat said, given the sometimes adversarial relationship between the Trump White House and CIA, if it proves true that a CIA officer was the whistleblower raising the Ukraine allegations, what is the responsibility of the CIA to now investigate itself?\n\nWere there partisan or personal reasons behind the leak?\n\nIf so, where does this all stop? Who next gets caught in a politically manufactured witch hunt?\n\nShould Elizabeth Warren or another Democrat win in 2020 and Trump loyalists burrowed deep into the administration and Deep State seek to sabotage her agenda, the mainstream media, liberal members of Congress and Hollywood celebrities would and should call them out as partisan hacks operating to the detriment of our nation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLeaking for partisan gain or retribution is a very dangerous game. Especially if intelligence operatives are behind the leaks. The outcome of such a game will always be a loss for our country.\n\nFor the sake of us all, it must be called out and stopped.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DOUGLAS MACKINNON", "description": "The Trump White House has had an adversarial relationship with the CIA.
