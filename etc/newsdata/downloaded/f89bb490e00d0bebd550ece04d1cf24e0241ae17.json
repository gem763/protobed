He\u2019s never met a camera he didn\u2019t love. And frankly, he\u2019s never met a camera he didn\u2019t lie to. Adam Schiff is basically the Jussie Smollett of Congress on steroids. I've never seen anything so ridiculous,\u201d Trump Jr. said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cHannity.\u201d\n\nLast week, during his opening remarks at a House Intelligence hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, Schiff read a made-up summary of the Ukraine call\u2019s transcript, claiming it was \u201cpart parody.\u201d\n\nSchiff also knew about the whistleblower complaint before it was made, according to a New York Times report, meaning he lied when he said \u201cwe did not speak directly to the whistleblower.\u201d President Trump even accused him of helping write it, too.\n\nTrump Jr. said if he did even a fraction of what Schiff has done, he\u2019d be in jail.\n\n\u201cIf I lied even a little bit \u2026 like Adam Schiff has lied to the American people, and in front of Congress the other day, they\u2019d throw me in jail for perjury,\u201d Trump Jr. said. \u201cHe\u2019s done it over and over. \u2026 He\u2019s probably the person that magically leaked my emails and edited them \u2014which was the big CNN bombshell which made it seem like I got the WikiLeaks stuff the week before as opposed to a week after.\u201d", "description": "Preach..10/03/2019 19:25:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/253/82c911c9-0afd-4294-8452-af3e9594b13b.png"}
