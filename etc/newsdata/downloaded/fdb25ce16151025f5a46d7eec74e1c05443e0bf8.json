Gavin Newsom signed into law AB 730, which makes it a crime to distribute audio or video that gives a false, damaging impression of a politician\u2019s words or actions. The law applies to any candidate within 60 days of an election, but includes some exceptions. News media will be exempt from the requirement, as will videos made for satire or parody. Potentially deceptive video or audio will also be allowed if it includes a disclaimer noting that it\u2019s fake. The law will sunset in 2023.\n\nWhile the word \u201cdeepfake\u201d doesn\u2019t appear in the legislation, the bill clearly takes aim at doctored works. Lawmakers have raised concerns recently that distorted deepfake videos, like a slowed video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that appeared over the summer, could be used to influence elections in the future.\n\nAt the same time, Newsom also signed a law that would ban pornographic deepfakes made without consent. While political deepfakes have generated headlines, at least one study recently found that the majority of deepfakes are pornographic.\n\nThe election law has also raised concerns about free speech, and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union of California have questioned the legislation\u2019s value. \u201cDespite the author\u2019s good intentions, this bill will not solve the problem of deceptive political videos,\u201d the group said in a statement noted by the Associated Press, \u201cit will only result in voter confusion, malicious litigation, and repression of free speech.\u201d", "description": "California has passed a law meant to prevent altered \"deepfake\" videos from influencing elections, in a plan that has raised free speech concerns.", "authors": ["Colin Lecher", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrhMdzEnksFAF5Q7CUwlAKjyITU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8358995/jbareham_170417_1617_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
