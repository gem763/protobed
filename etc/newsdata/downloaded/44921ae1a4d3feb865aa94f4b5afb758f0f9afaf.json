The organizations sued the Trump administration early this year arguing that the border situation was not an emergency, and the fund-grab violates the Constitution by overstepping executive authority and sidestepping Congress\u2019 authority to determine allocations.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s filing, the administration explained that it had planned to build three additional sections of wall using cost savings from other portions, Bloomberg reported. But the expected savings will not be enough after all.\n\nTrump administration attorneys first informed judges about the extra 20 miles just last month when it appeared there would be excess funds.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump could raid Pentagon funds to build 100 miles of fencing along the wall.\n\nThe president is now arranging to redirect $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds for border wall construction. But only money allocated to Pentagon construction projects outside the U.S. \u2014 $1.8 billion \u2014 will initially be available for the barrier, according to a letter early this month by Secretary of Defense Matt Esper.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear why those funds weren\u2019t available for the extra 20-mile section.", "description": "Lawyers reveal \u2014 then retract \u2014 plan for more wall in Arizona and California, according to a court filing, Bloomberg reports.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7d8827240000d3267a8c3e.jpeg?cache=0f4xrqqc6b&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
