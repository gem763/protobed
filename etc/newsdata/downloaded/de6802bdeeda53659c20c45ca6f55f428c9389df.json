Antti Rinne was accompanied by his wife.\n\nAnd just two days before Finland's Lutheran Archbishop Tapio Luoma said it was just a matter of time before his church accepted same-sex marriage. The church is the biggest in the country.", "description": "In the socially conserative Balkan state of North Macedonia it was the first LGBTQ Pride parade ever.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/99/25/72/1000x563_cmsv2_0e420567-a963-592b-acb5-351d4ce57f08-3992572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-29"}
