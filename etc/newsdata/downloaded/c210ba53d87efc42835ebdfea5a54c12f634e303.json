There was also an extra half-bubble in black that touched parts of Alabama, in contrast to a white shape around Florida.\n\nMr. Trump had warned earlier this week that Alabama was among states that would likely be hit much harder than expected by Dorian, though the National Weather Service said shortly after his warning that Alabama wouldn\u2019t see any effects from Dorian and that the system would remain too far east.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he felt it necessary to pull out a Sharpie and change the map; I don\u2019t know if it was one of his aides [who believed] they had to do that in order to order to protect his ego,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cThis is humiliating. This is an embarrassing moment for our country, and we seem to see a new national embarrassment every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing there is literally pathetic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you feel a kind of pity for everybody involved, and that\u2019s not how I want to feel about the president whether it\u2019s from my party or the other one.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has continued to point to other forecasts to back up a projection that is seemingly no longer all that relevant, with Dorian now moving up the East Coast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
