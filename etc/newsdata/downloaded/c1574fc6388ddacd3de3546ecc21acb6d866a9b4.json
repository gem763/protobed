A conviction under the mask ban is punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine. They were both released on bail pending trial.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nProtesters wearing Guy Fawkes masks take part in an Anti-ERO (Emergency Regulations Ordinance) demonstration against a newly imposed law banning face masks in public in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nRiot police attempt to disperse activists on Sunday after they set fire to barricades in the financial hub\n\nTens of thousands of masked protesters marched defiantly in the city centre Sunday, but the peaceful rallies quickly degenerated into chaos at several locations as hard-liners again lobbed gasoline bombs, started fires and trashed subway stations and China-linked banks and shops. Police responded with tear gas in familiar skirmishes.\n\nIt also drew a first warning from the Chinese military after protesters pointed lasers at one of its barracks in Hong Kong. Police said rioters also attacked bystanders, including two men left unconscious after bloody beatings and a woman who took photos of rioting.\n\nIn a statement Monday, police said the 'public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation.' The chaos has led many shops and public services to shutter and panic buying in some areas.\n\nThe city's MTR network of subways and trains was entirely closed Saturday and partially reopened Sunday but was quickly targeted again by protesters. Most stations remained closed Monday amid fears of more protests.\n\nHong Kong's High Court has rejected a second effort to invalidate the mask ban but agreed to hear later this month an application by 24 legislators against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's use of the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance to impose the ban without legislative approval.\n\nRiot police secure a street after protesters set fire to barricades on Sunday in the latest action in four months of protests\n\nPolice fired tear gas and baton charged protesters in several locations, while some protesters threw bricks and petrol bombs at police, as night began to fall on Sunday (pictured: pictured is a member of the press)\n\nLam has said that the mask ban will make the identification of rioters easier for police and that other measures are possible if violence continues.\n\nCritics fear Lam's use of the emergency law that gives her broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary could pave the way for more draconian moves. The law was enacted by the British in 1922 to quell a seamen's strike and was last used in 1967 to crush riots.\n\nLam has said she will seek the legislature's backing for the mask ban when it meets next on Oct. 16.\n\nA police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said 13 people were detained Saturday for violating the ban and other offences but couldn't say how many more were arrested Sunday.\n\nEnforcement is tricky in a city where many have worn surgical masks since a deadly respiratory disease outbreak in 2003. Both peaceful and violent demonstrators say violence is the only way for protesters to force the government to bend to clamors for full democracy and other demands.\n\nOnce police arrived on the scene yesterday demonstrators started throwing petrol bombs at them before running away\n\nAn anti-government protester throws back a tear gas canister during a demonstration in Wan Chai district on Sunday\n\nBut it sparked fears of more deadly duels after two teens were injured by gunfire from officers under attack this week. An 18-year-old protester, shot at close range by a riot officer on Tuesday, was charged with rioting and assaulting police. A 14-year-old teen, who suffered a gunshot wound to his thigh Friday night, was arrested.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a proposed law that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.\n\nProtesters are upset at what they say are Beijing's increasing influence over the former British colony, which was promised a level of autonomy when it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997.", "description": "An 18-year-old student and a 38-year-old unemployed woman were the first to be prosecuted after the ban came into force Saturday under sweeping emergency powers which provoked furious backlash.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/19382524-0-image-a-2_1570429865311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
