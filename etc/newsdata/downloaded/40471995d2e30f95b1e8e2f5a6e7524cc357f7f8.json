It was all a bit melodramatic, end of the world, apocalyptic. I wonder the impact she\u2019s now having on young people around the world watching this who must be thinking, \u201cOh my god, the world is literally about to end.\u201d It\u2019s not about to end.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want millions, if not billions, of young people watching Greta do that kind of speech and genuinely think the planet is literally about to end, because it isn\u2019t. So climate change is serious, it should be dealt with, it\u2019s an important issue, but it\u2019s not end of the world stuff in the way she\u2019s portraying it, in my opinion.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPiers isn\u2019t the only TV star who has taken issue with Ms Thunberg, with Jeremy Clarkson branding her a \u2018spoilt brat\u2019.\n\nHowever, the majority of people are hailing Greta as the most influential teenager on the world stage, thanks to her relentless campaigning for environmental issues.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
