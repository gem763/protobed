What we did do was fight a private corporation that has run rampantly across our country seizing land and polluting our nation\u2019s water supply.\"\n\n\u201cUsing tires and gasoline-soaked rags, we burned multiple valve sites, their electrical units, as well as additional heavy equipment located on DAPL [Dakota Access pipeline] easements throughout Iowa, further halting construction,\" she added, describing their actions.\n\nIf the women are convicted, some counts in the indictment carry mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years in prison, with the sentence jumping to 20 years for subsequent convictions.\n\nA spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners, one of the companies involved with the pipeline, told the Times that the women's protest had crossed a line.\n\n\u201cWe support the right we all have as Americans to lawfully express our opinions, regardless of who agrees with them,\u201d said Vicki Granado. \u201cHowever, when those actions cross the line and become unlawful, that becomes an issue for law enforcement and our legal system.\u201d", "description": "Two women have been charged by the Justice Department with attempting to damage the controversial Dakota Access pipeline in Iowa after attacking the oil pipeline with torches in 2017.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dakotaaccesspipeline_protest_020817gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
