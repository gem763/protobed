I haven\u2019t seen that name on an album cover in years. I have seen the name Fenty plastered over eyeshadows, lipsticks, sunglasses, shoes, bras, and luxury denim jackets, however. Rihanna has been cashing in on her truth since 2016 when Anti dropped, hardly mentioning music until she has to put a fan with the right intentions in the wrong place. But thanks to her new photography book (yes, the one Cardi B paid $11,000 for at a charity auction), Vogue forced Rihanna to acknowledge the booty-shaking songs we didn\u2019t get this summer, among other things.\n\n\u201cI have been trying to get back into the studio,\u201d she admits to Vogue. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can lock myself in for an extended amount of time, like I had the luxury of doing before.\u201d But she promises that she hasn\u2019t forgot about R9, a \u201creggae-infused\u201d album inspired by the songs she spent her childhood listening to. Yes, it\u2019s been on its way for over a year. And what about it? Go ahead and read your li\u2019l coffee-table book. Even if she can\u2019t promise an album tomorrow, Rihanna stays true to herself and her passions, whether that\u2019s makeup, music, or social justice. (She confirms she turned down a Super Bowl appearance in support of Colin Kaepernick: \u201cWho gains from that? Not my people.\u201d) Making music will always be a priority for her because \u201call of these other things flourish on top of that foundation.\u201d That\u2019s why her other new album R10 (which is already in discovery) is going to be called ADELE. Just kidding. It is still on its way, though. This isn\u2019t a Yandhi situation where we\u2019re never going to hear about it again. \u201cWe always went into the music this time around saying that we were going to do two different pieces of art,\u201d she says, explaining R10\u2019s genesis. \u201cOne was gonna be inspired by the music that I grew up listening to. And one was gonna be the evolution of where I\u2019m going next with music.\u201d But only God (Rihanna) knows when the albums might drop.", "description": "Pop star Rihanna emerges to reassure fans that her album is coming eventually.
