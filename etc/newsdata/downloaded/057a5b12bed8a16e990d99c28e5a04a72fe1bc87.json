Boehm both left the live-streaming company over the past two weeks, at a time when the service is undergoing some of its biggest changes to date.\n\nBoehm announced his departure from Mixer on October 2nd, and Salsamendi announced that he was leaving on October 10th. The pair launched Mixer, initially known as Beam, in January 2016. Microsoft acquired the company in August 2016. It was renamed Mixer in 2017.\n\nWhile Boehm didn\u2019t announce what his next steps were, Salsamendi used his farewell letter on Twitter to talk about his next journey \u2014 in \u201clasers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been fascinated with the idea of using light to represent music,\u201d Salsamendi wrote. \u201cGrowing up I dreamed of running lighting for EDM festivals and tours, and I want to pursue that passion in a bigger way.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrowing up I dreamed of running lighting for EDM festivals and tours, and I want to pursue that passion in a bigger way.\u201d\n\nTheir departure comes at a time when Mixer is making bigger splashes than ever in the gaming industry. Mixer has become the third-largest streaming service (just behind Google-owned YouTube and Amazon-owned Twitch). Through Microsoft, the streaming service has also started working on partnerships with popular streamers, including Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins. Mixer went from being a lesser-known streaming service to one of the most-watched platforms after Blevins announced in August that he was leaving Twitch, his home for many years, to exclusively stream on Mixer going forward.\n\nSalsamendi and Boehm\u2019s departures aren\u2019t the only prominent names leaving Microsoft, either. Mike Ybarra, a longtime Xbox executive, is leaving the company after 20 years of working with various divisions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great ride at Xbox and the future is bright,\u201d Ybarra tweeted on October 9th. \u201cThanks to everyone at TeamXbox, I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished and I wish you the best.\u201d", "description": "Mixer co-founders Matt Salsamendi and James J.
