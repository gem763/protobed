In South Africa, Growthpoint [JSE:GRT], SA\u2019s largest listed property company, last month reported a 26% increase in local vacancies - from 5.4% of its gross leasable area (GLA) to 6.8%.\n\nMore than 54% of the fund\u2019s leases now expire after five years, providing long term visibility of income for investors, IAP CEO Graeme Katz said.\n\nIt declared an interim distribution of 3.20 Australian cents per unit (pre-withholding tax) and expects it will deliver 8.88 Australian cents for the full year.\n\nThe share\u2019s underlying net asset value increased to AUD1.33 per unit, up from AUD1.30, but its headline earnings fell from AUD25.570m to AUD22m.\n\n\n\nThe JSE-listed fund made its debut on the Australian stock exchange earlier this year, and raised AUD161m.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the support we have received from both institutional and retail investors in Australia, and the continued support from our existing investor base in South Africa,\u201d Katz said.", "description": "The fund now owns 31 office buildings and industrial properties in Australia and New-Zealand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9533/05a63ba8b41142ffbe285e2ffd084b16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
