Now Sir Jackie, he does not rush to answer when asked about his achievement, instead there is a pause as the 80 year old remembers Monza in 1969. His answer, when it comes, is considered but delivered with conviction. \u201cI never felt at any time that I was better than anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew I had a fantastic team of people around me.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Monza will host the 90th Italian Grand Prix. In 1969, Stewart was driving here for Ken Tyrrell\u2019s team, running Matra cars. His affection for Tyrrell and his squad is well known but Stewart explains how he owed them much more than just the title. \u201cRoger Hill, Roy Topp and Roland Law were the three mechanics,\u201d he says. \u201cI recently spoke at the Royal Automobile Club and they and the Queen were there. I had them stand up and said: \u2018I am here today because of those three men.\u2019 My wife, Helen, counted 57 people had died in my career. I didn\u2019t lose wheels or aerofoils. When everybody else was crashing, my car did not.\u201d\n\nThe passage of time has clearly not dampened the affection with which he holds the team for whom he took all three of his titles. Nor has it dimmed the vivacity of his memories of Monza. The race was a thriller on a track where passing at high speed was the norm. There were no chicanes and the cars slipstreamed one another with repeated overtaking throughout a lap. It was also run at a breakneck pace, the average speed moving from 143mph to 146mph across the 68 laps. The lead and places were exchanged with almost bewildering frequency, Stewart explains, in what was for the most part a six-way fight at the front between Stewart, Graham Hill, Piers Courage, Bruce McLaren, Jochen Rindt and Jean\u2011Pierre Beltoise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jackie Stewart remains a keen observer of the F1 circuit.

Late on, Courage\u2019s Brabham had fallen back with a fuel problem and on lap 64 a broken drive shaft took Hill\u2019s Lotus out. With the remaining four contenders nose to tail as they entered the final lap, Stewart\u2019s great friend Rindt took the lead through the Lesmos, but Stewart had claimed it back as they entered the back straight.\n\nOnly Parabolica remained. Beltoise braked late and went wide, Stewart swept up the inside and led heading for the line. Stewart and Tyrrell\u2019s decision to put in a higher gear ratio made the difference when he did not have to change gear on the run to the flag.\n\nThe protagonists crossed it almost as one: Stewart, Rindt, Beltoise and McLaren. Nineteen-hundredths of a second separated them \u2013 what was then the closest finish in F1.\n\nJust as they will be passionate on Sunday, the Italian fans erupted at what had been a magnificent race. Ferrari may not have won but they knew they had seen a worthy world champion claim his crown in the most glorious fashion.\n\nMotorsport magazine wrote: \u201cThe huge crowd poured on to the track and the presentation of the victors laurels disappeared under a seething mob of wildly enthusiastic spectators.\u201d\n\nStewart remembers with a smile being at the heart of their celebratory maelstrom. \u201cThe crowds at Monza were as big as they are today,\u201d he says. \u201cI came down from the podium and the crowd broke though the barriers. In those days the wives came up on the podium, so Helen was with me.\n\n\u201cThe crowd completely engulfed us, the police had no chance. We then went into an administration office and they broke through there. Then Helen and I went into a toilet with the laurel wreath still on and they were banging on the door of the toilet, so we had to climb out of the window and run down to the paddock.\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything like it. I jumped into the back of a Dunlop van, but somebody saw me going in so they pushed the van. Fortunately, a friend of mine, Philip Martyn, a world champion backgammon player, had a big Merc so he brought it into the paddock and Helen and I ran into it and he drove it away.\u201d\n\nStewart has been married to Helen since 1962. His relationship with his long-term sponsor, Rolex, on whose behalf he is recalling the events at Monza, is six years shorter.\n\nWhen he won his first world championship he had been with them a year; now Stewart is one of their \u201ctestimonees\u201d, a role given to those who have achieved extraordinary feats, such as Sir Malcolm Campbell, Sir Edmund Hillary, and in the modern era, Roger Federer and Tiger Woods.\n\nJackie Stewart and his struggle to make F1 a safer sport for all | Giles Richards Read more\n\nHe has long taken all such commitments seriously, believes in making them last and that where he can, he should also try and make a difference. His tireless work in making racing safer is well documented and vital. Of late, he has thrown himself into defeating dementia, to which his wife has succumbed. His charity, Race Against Dementia, has raised $3.5m for research into the disease.\n\nPerhaps less well known is that his commitment to those who had been so vital in his success 50 years ago was never forgotten. In 1987, he founded the Grand Prix Mechanics Trust, now the Grand Prix Trust, of which he is still chairman, to provide support and welfare to any former F1 team members that require it.\n\nStewart has been able to contribute so much thanks in part to the success he enjoyed in 1969. That year, he was in complete control. He won six of the first eight races to take the title and remains the only driver to have a led on at least one lap of every grand prix in a season.\n\nMonza was its peak but one that, despite the glory, he kept very much in perspective. \u201cIf you start thinking you are king of the castle, you usually have a fall,\u201d he says of that remarkable year. \u201cAnd I had a great fear of falling.\u201d", "description": "Fifty years after clinching his first title with what was then the closest ever F1 race finish, Jackie Stewart tips his hat to the Tyrrell organisation, he tells Giles Richards", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209e6fc7187c63ab2948b5e895f168f42b1b4a22/12_208_5296_3178/master/5296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0cd8051a1bcae3adf52723e28ba5b8d6", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
