Admissions officers from around the US share some of the most common errors they see in applications and how to avoid them.\n\nTelling your story\n\nDon\u2019t waste precious words on the admission essay by restating the prompt or discussing an activity listed elsewhere on the application. Gary Clark, director of undergraduate admission at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), says it is also a major missed opportunity when students spend too much of their essay describing a scene or another person who plays a role in their story. The essay needs to offer new insight into the candidate.\n\nAdmissions committees are time-constrained. An essay that gets to the main point quickly, with a very strong opening sentence, and drops the reader right into the moment without a long buildup is more likely to grab the reader\u2019s attention.\n\nHow to get into Oxford University by knowing what a rock looks like: ancient institution reveals sample interview questions\n\nA chance for your voice to be heard\n\n\u201cAs an applicant, you need and should have an editor,\u201d says Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech and co-author of \u201cThe Truth About College Admission: A Family Guide to Getting In and Staying Together.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes the best editor is a parent, someone you trust. But students need to watch for when an editor becomes a second author. I tell students that even in your high school you can think of someone who basically has the same grades, classes, and test scores as you do and is just as involved with their activities. The essay is your opportunity to separate yourself, to insert your voice. Don\u2019t let someone rob you of the very thing that we are looking for: that unique, personal voice. I think parents can unintentionally do that.\u201d\n\nUniversities seek honesty and authenticity in the admission essay. \u201cWhatever a student can do to get their true self across to us is worthwhile,\u201d says Gregory Sneed, vice president of enrollment management at Denison University, a top liberal arts school in the US state of Ohio. \u201cOne of the big misconceptions is students feel they need some sort of disadvantage in their background in order to make a compelling case and that\u2019s not at all true.\u201d\n\nGary Clark urges students to answer the questions in a straightforward manner and cautions them not to offer up \u201covercrafted, thesaurus-ridden answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo often students think they need to construct themselves into what they think we want to see,\u201d he says. He tells students to \u201cthink less about what you think we want to hear, and more about what you want to say.\u201d\n\nPro tips for completing your 2018 Jupas application: the ultimate guide from an expert\n\nSimple mistakes that matter\n\nStudents should use a single, legal form of their name for every interaction around their university application, as well as a single email account and cellphone number to ensure that all their data gets into their file in a timely manner.\n\nUniversities often email and sometimes call a student. Although these forms of communication are not entirely native to teenagers, applicants need to get comfortable with both. Universities may email about honours programmes, scholarships, campus visits or missing information on the application. Missing an email or voice mail can be costly. Equally, students are urged to regularly check the online portal to make sure their application is complete.\n\nAn expert\u2019s guide on getting into Harvard, UCLA, and other US universities\n\nTeacher and counselor recommendations\n\nAfter the essay, the recommendation of a teacher, coach or counselor is another important way admission committees come to know a student. Rick Clark urges students to ask for recommendations from the teacher who knows them best and can share insight into the student\u2019s growth, their work ethic, endeavor, resilience and character. Students are often tempted to ask the teacher who gave them the best grade, but that information is already on the transcript.\n\nWhen you have made a mistake, own it\n\nUniversities recognise that teenagers make mistakes and errors in judgment. But how the university finds out about an applicant\u2019s misstep may affect their decision.\n\n\u201cWe are parents. We have our own kids and they are not perfect,\u201d Rick Clark says. His impression of a candidate is affected positively when the student is forthcoming about his or her error with the admissions office. \u201cThat carries a lot of weight. ... It\u2019s a character thing. We are building a community, we don\u2019t expect perfection but we do want character.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare for a student to voluntarily disclose information [of an infraction] in an application, where we would hold that against the student in the review process,\u201d Sneed says. \u201cWhat frustrates us is when there is a disciplinary violation and the student doesn\u2019t volunteer that information and we find out later. Then the situation is less about the violation and more about the truthfulness of the student.\u201d\n\nApplying to university in Britain? Expert tips for a great application, without the stress\n\nExtracurricular activities\n\nIt\u2019s all about quality, not quantity. Universities are not looking for a laundry list of extracurricular activities but instead seek genuine involvement or interest in an activity. They can see through students who are padding their CV.\n\n\u201cWhen a student, at the end of their junior year or the beginning of their senior year, suddenly joins a large number of organisations, that raises an eyebrow because it does not demonstrate sustained depth of involvement and true interest,\u201d Sneed says. \u201cWhat stands out are students who have done a handful of things and have done them really well and have distinguished themselves either through their leadership, some sort of special talent, or their dedication.\u201d\n\nA good application might just give you the edge to get the place you want. Photo: AP\n\nDoes a university expect a student to demonstrate their interest?\n\nAs part of the application, some universities consider \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d in their admission decision, Sneed says. Students should convey their interest to these universities, as it will be tracked and recorded in their application file. The Common Data set for each college shows the gradient of importance of \u201cdemonstrated interest,\u201d in the application from very important to not considered at all.\n\nA student can show genuine interest, explains Susan Dabbar, an independent educational consultant and founder of Admissions Smarts, by visiting campus for a tour or information session. For students without the time or resources to visit, Dabbar suggests they email and start talking with their regional college admission representative (who may be one of their application\u2019s first readers), attend an information session at their high school or a local college fair to meet their rep, and read all email communication from the university.\n\n\u201cResearch the schools on your final univeristy list to see if they offer or require an [in-person or online] interview. It is one of the best ways to learn more about each other,\u201d Dabbar says. Applicants can express their interest if there is a supplemental essay question asking why a student wants to attend that university.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018why us\u2019 essay is a place to really shine and tell a school what you\u2019ve learned, why you want to attend and what you hope to contribute. I tell my students, \u2018Write this essay like you\u2019re in love,\u2019 \u201d Dabbar says.\n\nA guide to finding out what US colleges want and picking one that's right for you\n\nDon\u2019t reverse engineer the application process\n\n\u201cBeware of the gospel, according to the neighbor,\u201d Gary Clark cautions parents and teenagers. He urges applicants to refrain from trying to \u201creverse engineer\u201d the admissions process and infer what a university is seeking from past admission decisions. Universities consider a large number of factors when evaluating a student, as well as their need to build a freshman class.\n\nClark explains that it is too easy to make inaccurate inferences about what the admissions committee is seeking. He reminds applicants that at many universities, particularly highly selective ones, a student may not have been admitted simply because there were too many qualified applicants.", "description": "From wasting time on essays to not using your own voice, here are the simple errors you should avoid when applying to schools in the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_222591376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
