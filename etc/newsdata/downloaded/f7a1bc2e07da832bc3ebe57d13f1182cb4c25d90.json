More\n\n\u201cThe impact of this is so huge that it will probably encourage more discussions about what we\u2019ll do in these cases down the road,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the future, it needs to be more refined.\u201d\n\nPG&E\u2019s approach certainly was more sledgehammer than scalpel, affecting more than 30 counties across the state, where it provides power to about 16 million of California\u2019s 40 million residents.\n\nCalifornia power outage Q&A: What you need to know\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the utility warned that it could take days to restore power because all power lines would need to be inspected for possible wind-related damage before electricity could once again flow.\n\nIn fact, about 25,000 miles of PG&E lines are involved in this week\u2019s preventive outage, company spokesman Jeff Smith says.\n\nA Pacific Gas & Electric lineman works to repair a power line last November in fire-ravaged Paradise, Calif. The utility says power could be shut off in 30 counties in central and Northern California starting Wednesday, Oct. 9, when hot weather and strong winds are forecast, and through Thursday. More\n\n\u201cOur aim is to restore power 48 hours after the weather has passed, but customers should prepare for an extended day outage, especially when you have so many shutoffs going on,\u201d he says. \u201cWith over 30 counties, that\u2019s a lot of wire we need to inspect.\u201d\n\nSmith says that because of the changing climate and the state\u2019s recent wildfire history, such public safety power shutoffs, newly instituted this year, \u201care necessary to keep customers safe.\"\n\nCalifornia's rising fire danger\n\nThe utility\u2019s outage track record is wanting. Data published by the California Public Utilities Commission this month shows across all three utilities it regulates in California, there have been 4,082,970 customer hours of preemptive outages since the end of 2017.\n\nOf those, PG&E accounted for just over half the total outage hours, although San Diego Gas & Electric customers were most likely to experience an outage, racking up 2 million hours of outages in the same time period across their relatively small, 4,100-square-mile territory.\n\nFire increasingly is a part of the California energy puzzle. Fire itself, of course, is not an unnatural part of the landscapes here, it\u2019s part of what created them in the first place and will continue to occur.\n\nThe lantern section is nearly empty at an ACE Hardware store as shoppers prepare for possible power shutoffs in Los Gatos, Calif., Oct. 8, 2019.
