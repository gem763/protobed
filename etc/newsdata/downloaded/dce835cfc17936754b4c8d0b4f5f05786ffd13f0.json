That means Beal will be with the Wizards at least for the next three seasons, barring something unforeseen like a trade.\n\nBy agreeing to this deal now, Beal can hit free agency in 2022, when he has 10 years of service. That\u2019s significant because the two-time All-Star would be eligible to sign a massive extension \u2014 this time worth five years, $266 million.\n\nRegardless, Beal\u2019s extension Thursday addressed one of the pressing questions facing the franchise: Could the Wizards convince him to stay? Washington shifted directions late last season and this summer new general manager Tommy Sheppard made it clear the team was rebuilding. Expectations are low for Washington this season, and many wondered whether Beal would want to be part of a multi-year rebuild.\n\nBeal, though, never indicated he wanted to play elsewhere \u2014 and his extension confirms it.\n\nThis deal also effectively removes Beal from trade rumors. While the Wizards had been open about their desire to not trade Beal, contending teams were clamoring to get the 26-year-old.\n\nESPN first reported the news.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
