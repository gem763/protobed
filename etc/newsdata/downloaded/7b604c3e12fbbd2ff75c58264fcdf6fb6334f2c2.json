As he left the store he pulled out a piece of gum and dropped the silver wrapper onto the ground.\n\nBarry says his grandmother yelled for him to pick it up before a white woman, who has been dubbed 'Pick It Up Peggy', appeared behind him and started to scream at him for littering.\n\n'Nu-uh don't even act like that. Pick it up. Find it. Get down on your knees and find it,' the white woman wearing sunglasses says in the shocking clip, aggressively pointing into the a piece of grass where the gum wrapper fell.\n\n'No count, little n****r. That\u2019s how you are are, all y\u2019all - no count, f***ing n****r,' she added, as Henry's cousin whipped out a cellphone to record the incident.\n\nA white woman called 14-year-old black teen Barry Henry the n-word after he littered by dropping a gum wrapper on the ground on Sunday outside a Fedex store in St. Petersburg, Florida\n\nShocking video footage of her foul-mouthed tirade shows the moment she points to the grass where he dropped the wrapper and demands 'get down on your knees and find it'\n\n'No count, little n****r. That\u2019s how you are are, all y\u2019all - no count, f***ing n****r,' the white woman wearing sunglasses yelled at Henry in front of his family\n\n'Walk around here acting like some! Film me, f***er, film me,' the woman continued her tirade as Barry walked away, trying to laugh it off.\n\nIn the video Barry doesn't respond to the woman's heated rant and walks away without saying a word when a security guard from a nearby building walked over to see what was going on.\n\nBarry's cousin recorded the entire incident. His sister Deysha Henry, 24, posted it on Facebook where its gone viral racked up over 226,00 views as of Wednesday.\n\nThe white woman in the clip is yet to be identified.\n\nThe internet coined her 'Pick It Up Peggy' after the infamous memes of Barbecue Becky and Permit Patty - other white women who reached viral fame for harassing black people.\n\n'I thought she was going to attack us. The lady was telling me, \"Just pick it up,\" real loud and just yelling and everything, crazy,' Barry said to WTSP.\n\nNot only was the unwarranted rant racist, it the first time Henry was ever called the n-word. To add to the humiliation, the white woman launched her attack in front of his watching cousin and grandmother.\n\n'I never thought that somebody would say that because it\u2019s 2019. Who would say anything like that?' he said.\n\n'I thought she was going to attack us. The lady was telling me, \"Just pick it up,\" real loud and just yelling and everything, crazy,' Barry said on the incident\n\nIn the video Barry doesn't respond to the woman's heated rant and walks away without saying a word when a security guard from a nearby building walked over to see what was going on\n\n'I was in shock, I was sad, I was mad, I had every emotion there possibly could be,' Barry's mother Tykeshia Henry-Burch.\n\n'He told me it hurt him and that he felt, well he said to me, \"I feel traumatized, mom.\" I was like, I\u2019ve never taught my children to look at the color of anyone\u2019s skin. Ever. We like people for who they are. We\u2019ve never had any issues. It was very traumatizing,' she added to WFLA.\n\n'It\u2019s definitely a crazy world. I think that woman was already upset about something else and just a reason to act out, like go from zero to ten. People feel bad for my brother,' Barry's sister Deysha Henry said.\n\n'Yes, he was wrong for dropping a gum wrapper on the ground, but it did not warrant her response. He was going to pick it up, my grandmother told him to pick it up, but as soon as the woman started yelling, my grandmother said, \"let\u2019s go,\"' she said.\n\nThe video outraged the community and led St. Petersburg City Council member Steve Kornell to share the video and ask for Barry to be identified so he could be honored at this week's council meeting.\n\n'I never thought that somebody would say that because it\u2019s 2019. Who would say anything like that?' Henry said\n\n'He told me it hurt him and that he felt, well he said to me, \"I feel traumatized, mom.\" I was like, I\u2019ve never taught my children to look at the color of anyone\u2019s skin,' Henry's mom Tykeshia Henry-Burch said\n\nHenry's sister posted a cellphone video of the horrific tirade where it's racked up over 226,000 views as of Wednesday\n\n'If anyone knows this young man I would love to honor him at this week\u2019s City Council meeting for his extreme politeness towards this woman who did not deserve it at all. It says a great deal about him and about her,' he said on Facebook.\n\nDeysha said Councilman Kornell even called the Henry family to extend his apologies.\n\n'He called and asked if he could take the boys to the Rays\u2019 playoff game (Monday) but they had school. He was completely apologetic about what happened and wanted to thank them for their politeness,' Deysha said.\n\nShe shared an update on that video on Facebook she didn't upload the video to be retaliatory.\n\n'The point of this post is/was to continue to raise awareness regarding inappropriate behavior, and racism in our city, country, and world. Please note that we are not a confrontational family, and we are not looking for vengeance towards this woman, nor are we looking to fight racism, with racism,' she said.", "description": "A white woman called 14-year-old black teen Barry Henry the n-word after he littered by dropping a gum wrapper on the ground on Sunday outside a Fedex store in St. Petersburg, Florida.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495092-0-image-a-36_1570630754668.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
