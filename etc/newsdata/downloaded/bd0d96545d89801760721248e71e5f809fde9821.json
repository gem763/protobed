The bill requires many contract workers to be treated as regular employees, which would mean that they would be covered by minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance and other protections afforded traditional employees.\n\nPlatform-based freelance work essentially turns a person\u2019s labor into a freely traded commodity. To Uber, the men and women who drive passengers in cars summoned with the company\u2019s app do not count as its work force at all. Rather, they are its customers, according to the company\u2019s securities filings. Just like the people ordering a ride or a food delivery, they are \u201cend-users.\u201d\n\nThe company views its role as making a market between people who want a ride and people who want to get somewhere. In other words, it sees itself more like a stock exchange or an auction website. The New York Stock Exchange doesn\u2019t set the price of General Motors stock, nor eBay the price of Beanie Babies.\n\nThat, in turn, helps explain the stark divide between the views of Uber executives and those of the labor unions and California lawmakers who want Uber\u2019s drivers to become employees, not free-floating independent contractors.\n\nResearch by economists employed by Uber has an almost radical implication: that the company couldn\u2019t raise hourly compensation if it wanted to.\n\nAccording to the study, which relied on internal company data, when Uber raised the rates drivers are paid, it created an initial surge in earnings. But over time, higher prices cause less demand from riders and more supply of drivers, so drivers end up spending more of their time twiddling their thumbs waiting for a gig, leaving hourly earnings little changed.", "description": "Companies like Uber are hitting the turbulence of government regulation, worker resistance and labor market reality.", "authors": ["Neil Irwin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/upshot/00up-gig1/00up-gig1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
