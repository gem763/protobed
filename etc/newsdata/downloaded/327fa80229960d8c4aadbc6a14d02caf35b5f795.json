He was such a nice guy and I could never have imagined what he\u2019d done.\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIf I could speak to him now I would ask him, \u2018Why the f*** didn\u2019t you tell me? I would have helped you\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs for Eddie, he is responsible. If he hadn\u2019t been so greedy Giles would still be alive. He\u2019s a very dangerous man.\u201d\n\nFrenchman Olivier, 46, also tells how:\n\nGiles was so terrified of his partner-in-crime that he fitted their home with CCTV\n\nGreedy Putman, 54, was still buying Lotto scratchcards AFTER the fake ticket \u201cwin\u201d \u2013 for which he chose to remain anonymous\n\nGiles almost revealed his dreadful secret to his lover in a chance remark\n\nAnd he smashed up Putman\u2019s car before locking himself away for hours on end in the lead up to his suicide at a beauty spot.\n\nOlivier began dating Giles after they met at a pub in St Albans, Herts, in 2011 \u2013 the year after the fraud.\n\nHe was introduced to Putman, from nearby Kings Langsley, a year later and became friendly with him.\n\nOlivier knew his new acquaintance was a Lotto winner \u2013 but was wary of the loudmouth builder.\n\n\u201cEddie was generous and friendly and I got on with his girlfriend very well,\u201d says Olivier.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cBut I never really liked him or felt he was someone I could trust.\n\n\u201cHe was a big show-off, always out for himself. I did tell Giles what I thought of Eddie, but at the same time it was his friend so I didn\u2019t cause a fuss.\n\n\"I think Giles\u2019 point of view was very like mine, but he said, \u2018He\u2019s good fun and we\u2019re doing business together\u2019.\u201d\n\nOlivier noticed Putman always kept the curtains closed at his house.\n\n\u201cEven during the day because he was worried about people seeing in,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cHe drove a big white BMW M Sport, which he was very proud of.\n\n\u201cHis girlfriend also had other cars she would drive and they went to Mauritius flying first class with British Airways.\n\n\"He was spending money, but was also careful not to show too much.\u201d\n\nOlivier says his new lover mentioned early in their relationship that he used to have a job with Camelot.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t working, but he always seemed to have money,\u201d he says.\n\n(Image: Olivier Orphelin)\n\n\u201cOne thing I did think was strange was that he always had \u00a350 notes in a cash box.\n\n\u201cI suspect now Eddie was giving him the money.\n\n\"Giles did have some money of his own \u2013 I once saw over his shoulder he had \u00a312,000 in the bank.\n\n\"He always told me he had saved a lot of money and worked a lot when he was younger.\u201d\n\nThen came the day Giles almost blurted out his dark secret. In 2012 Olivier read in the Sunday Mirror that Putman had been given nine months for benefit fraud.\n\nHe recalls: \u201cI said to Giles, \u2018Why did Eddie need to do that when he\u2019s a lottery winner?\u2019\n\n\u201cGiles looked at me aggressively and then snapped back, \u2018He never won the lottery!\u2019 I asked him what he meant, but he wouldn\u2019t say any more.\n\nHe said, \u2018Just leave it\u2019. But Eddie\u2019s conviction changed Giles completely. He was livid about it and became very worried and depressed.\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to me then, but it obviously does now because he was drawing attention to himself and Giles.\n\n\"That was when him being a lottery winner came out in the Press.\n\n\u201cAfter Eddie got out of jail, Giles and Eddie would go up to Eddie\u2019s office in his house for hours.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t know at the time what they were talking about, but I suspect now it was the winnings and the split.\u201d\n\nIt emerged at Putman\u2019s trial that his friendship with Giles started breaking down after he reportedly gave him only \u00a3280,000 of the \u00a32.5million prize.\n\nOlivier soon noticed the pair were no longer speaking.\n\nHe says: \u201cBy 2015, we began seeing Eddie less and less. I asked Giles why and he said it was because Eddie owed him a lot of money.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me how much he owed him. I guess he couldn\u2019t because it wouldn\u2019t have made any sense.\u201d\n\nThen the simmering tension between the two fraudsters blew up.\n\nIn July 2015 Putman \u2013 who had served seven years in the early Nineties for raping a teenager \u2013 went to police and claimed Giles had blackmailed him \u201cover six years\u201d for a sum \u201cin the region of \u00a3400,000\u201d.\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge/Sunday Mirror)\n\nHe also accused Giles of burglary and criminal damage, smashing his car and CCTV system before fleeing with a mobile.\n\nOlivier said: \u201cI found a letter from the police which had all the allegations against Giles. I confronted him, but he was petrified and I couldn\u2019t get a word out of him.\n\n\"He wouldn\u2019t tell me anything apart from, \u2018I don\u2019t know what came over me. I just got angry\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe was so laid back normally, but he was really worried about it and said, \u2018I could go to jail\u2019.\n\n\u201cNow I know it was the other allegations getting out he was worried about. He felt trapped. By August he was locking himself in his office for hours listening to depressive music.\u201d\n\nIn September, Giles vanished. He drove to Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire and killed himself.\n\nOlivier says: \u201cThe day after Giles disappeared, a friend of his knocked on the door. He said, \u2018Can I come in? I need to tell you something\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was like all of a sudden I had been thrown into a James Bond movie. It was surreal. But as crazy as it sounded, it all also made sense. I was crying and thinking, \u2018How didn\u2019t I spot this?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his note, Giles told his lover of five years: \u201cThere is a lot I haven\u2019t told you, and while I have wanted to on several occasions I have always stopped myself. I should have been more open with you I know, but that\u2019s just the way I am.\n\n\u201cThere is one last thing\u2026 You know that I have been having issues with Eddie recently and he may try and contact you. Do not approach or speak to him.\n\n\u201cIn the unlikely event he tries to make contact with you, do not listen. He will lie about everything.\n\n\u201cHe may appear sincere, concerned and even sympathetic, but I can assure you he is none of these things.\n\n\u201cLock down your Facebook account and remove all photos of me at least for the next few months.\u201d\n\nIt ended with the chilling words: \u201cDESTROY THIS PAGE AFTER READING.\u201d\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge/Sunday Mirror)\n\nOlivier believes his lover couldn\u2019t cope with going to prison \u2013 or with what he had done.\n\n\u201cAfter he died I found audio books on his computer about dealing with guilt,\u201d says Olivier.\n\n\u201cHe was tortured and feeling under pressure. Now it began to torture me that Eddie had done something bad, but was still walking free spending the money.\u201d\n\nOlivier bravely testified in court against Putman. Giles had left behind evidence of Putman\u2019s involvement in the fraud.\n\nNow Olivier hopes the jail sentence will give him closure.\n\nHe says: \u201cI\u2019m glad Eddie has got what he deserves. For me it has closed a chapter. I\u2019ve got justice now and I feel like the weight is finally off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear from Eddie ever again. I\u2019m going to burn all the photos I have of him.\u201d\n\nProsecutors are launching a Proceeds of Crime case against Putman to try to recover the money.\n\n\u201cThe important thing now is they take his assets.\n\n\u201cHe will come out of prison with nothing,\u201d says Olivier.\n\n\u201cHis downfall came because he thought he was smarter than everyone else, but what he didn\u2019t realise was Giles was smarter than him.\n\n\"Giles was always a very caring person and took care of others more than himself.\n\n\u201cI want him to be remembered as a very outgoing and giving person, who made a stupid mistake. I\u2019ll always love him.\n\n\u201cI hope me telling Giles\u2019s story will help other people spot the signs to avoid their loved ones from committing suicide.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
