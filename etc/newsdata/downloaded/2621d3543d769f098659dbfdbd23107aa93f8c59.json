Seven were saved, two missed the target and a remarkable 19 went straight into the wall.\n\nHe wasted two more attempts during Tuesday's Champions League match against Lokomotiv Moscow, prompting a wave of criticism on social media and in Juventus blogs, especially as the team has two other expert free-kick specialists - Miralem Pjanic and Paulo Dybala.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has failed to score from 28 free-kick attempts since joining Juventus\n\nHowever, Maurizio Sarri says he will not take him off free-kick duty, leaving it up to the players\n\nRonaldo has scored one free-kick for the club, but it was in the International Champions Cup pre-season tournament. The ball ended up in the back of the net after his effort was deflected off the wall.\n\nSarri gave little attention to the problem when asked about it at a news conference on Friday.\n\n'The free-kicks? We have two right-footed options on the pitch: him (Pjanic) and Ronaldo. So they will have to decide among themselves who takes them, as happens in just about any other side,' he said.\n\nThe 34-year-old had a similarly poor record with Portugal, failing with his first 44 attempts at European Championship and World Cup tournaments before finally breaking his duck in the 3-3 draw with Spain at the World Cup last year.\n\nOf his 28 attempts, seven were saved, two missed the target and 19 went straight into the wall\n\nHe has a similarly poor record for Portugal after failing with his first 44 attempts for his country\n\nJuventus, who lead Serie A with 22 points out of a possible 24 and are still unbeaten since Sarri took over in the close season, visit promoted Lecce on Saturday.\n\nSarri said that Ronaldo would have to rest at some point, but could not say when.\n\n'Even he will have to take a break, but I don't know when,' said the coach. 'I speak to him every day, about how he feels on the pitch and (about) the numbers that come from the doctors and fitness coaches at the end of the match. We will make the decision based on how he feels.'", "description": "Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri will not intervene to stop Cristiano Ronaldo taking free-kicks within scoring range, despite the Portuguese forward's dismal record for the Turin side.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20186986-0-image-a-24_1572017658692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
