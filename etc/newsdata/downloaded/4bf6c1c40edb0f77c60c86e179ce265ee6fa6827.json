I sometimes wonder whether, for this Fukuyama generation, history did end in the nineties.\n\nHistory, of course, did not end, but it gave us valuable lessons and hoped we would change.\n\nUnfortunately, with an economics profession that was vested so deeply in the continuation of classical economics, with international economics professors like Harvard University\u2019s Nicholas Gregory Mankiw sitting at the helm of classical economics as its propagandist in chief, having indoctrinated generations of university students across the world, there would be no turning back from their messianic mission.\n\nUnfortunately, the global economy did not really move on. Since 2008, no country has had real and significant economic growth, except China, and the reason is simple.\n\nPeople had lost everything in the classical economics-led economic crisis, they had lost their businesses, their investments, their savings; unlike classical economists they were not willing to just pick up from where they left off, only to wake up with another loss of lifetime savings and a never-ending nightmare.\n\nPeople had realised that something was fundamentally wrong with the purely market-led economy and were just not willing to put all their stakes in a Ponzi scheme they clearly did not understand.\n\nThat was 10 years ago and, despite a global economy that has been limping for over a decade, the nihilism continues and the classical economists have duped us to forget the crisis of their profession and are back to their worn out dogmas \u2013 \u201cmarkets are our hope and, as long as government does what markets want and stays out of their way, our march to the new Jerusalem is inevitable\u201d.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhy do we allow classical economists to insult our intelligence and ruin our lives in this way? Why do we think the very people who caused our problems would be the ones to solve them? Yonela Diko\n\nWhy do we allow classical economists to insult our intelligence and ruin our lives in this way?\n\nWhy do we think the very people who caused our problems would be the ones to solve them?\n\nWhy do we think owners of a Ponzi scheme would blame themselves and take some responsibility?\n\nHow did we lose our towering intellectuals who sat in various schools of economics around the world and argued for days on end on the global economic models needed during various epochs in history?\n\nHave we lost our economists to the largess of corporate capture and malfeasance?\n\n\n\nWe have been here before, however. In 1933, unemployment in the US was at 24.9% and in England at 14%, and this was considered a severe global meltdown.\n\nOur unemployment is 29% and, despite our ability to limp forward, we are in a severe economic crisis.\n\nLike in the thirties, the classical economic theory that had prevailed at the time, championed by economists such as Friedrich von Hayek, collapsed in its failure to both diagnose the problem and come up with solutions.\n\nAccording to Von Hayek, people were unemployed because they lacked skills the markets needed, because businesses could not afford wages workers demanded (through their unions) and, of course, governments were standing in the way of good business with their stifling policies.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nToday, Mboweni is also telling us that the lack of skills the market needs; cost of doing business, including cost of labour; government red tape; and other neoclassical factors are responsible for our current economic stagnation.\n\nUnfortunately, today, alternative economic thinking has been wiped out through worldwide university indoctrination and corporate capture of academics so we have very little chance of exposing this neoclassical nonsense.\n\nIn the thirties, more sober economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, emerged and correctly pointed out that such a severe economic crisis would not be solved by such fiddling on the supply side of the economy.\n\nAs was the case then, so it is now; we are having a demand-side crisis.\n\nInvestors and consumers will not return to the market just because policy is made certain, workers are given skills, the cost of doing business is lowered or corruption is fought.\n\nPeople don\u2019t have the capital to participate in the economy and they are not willing to gamble with the little they do have in the crisis-prone markets.\n\nMany have decided to sit on their cash.\n\nWhat was needed then to get the economy out of a severe economic crisis is what is needed today, which is for government to become the \u201cprimary shopper in the land\u201d, to plug the gap in the demand.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government replaced the missing private investors and became extremely efficient at it.\n\nChina has always understood that classical economics is a theory developed by owners of financial capital, industrialists, land owners, the academic intelligentsia and, to a lesser extent, the middle class.\n\nOnly after this group would have made a royal mess of their economy would they remember the importance of the state in the economy.\n\nGiven the crisis-prone nature of the markets, its champions have realised that in order for state assistance to be guaranteed (because the markets will always come knocking on government\u2019s door to be saved), classical economists need to have their own people in government treasury departments.\n\nOnce that is secured, it matters not who is in the Union Buildings or Luthuli House.\n\nClassical economics will never be of service to the poor, because the poor have nothing to bargain with in the market.\n\nIf capital owners and businesses come knocking at government\u2019s door when they have pushed themselves into a fix, why can\u2019t the government get into business and be the bargaining chip the poor need to be able to participate, instead of servicing the selfish and greedy private businesses that are leeching people\u2019s taxes on every self-induced economic meltdown.\n\nThis is how state capitalism has emerged, and it has been the engine of global growth since 2008.\n\n\n\nSo, Mboweni\u2019s document is 20 years late and, more accurately, it is 90 years discredited and abandoned.\n\nOf course, as with Von Hayek, although he was abandoned in the thirties in favour of Keynes\u2019 government-led growth, once growth had returned and countries become successful again, Von Hayek was dusted off by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, selling off state assets, deregulating, lowering taxes and reducing the size of government to a skeleton incapable of standing up to private investors.\n\nThen it all came down.\n\nThere is no time in history when classical economics ever revived an economy as severely challenged as ours.\n\nAs long as Mboweni and Kganyago are at the helm, we will never see growth in this country.\n\nDiko is a media strategist and political commentator", "description": "There is no time in history when classical economics ever revived an economy as severely challenged as ours, writes Yonela Diko.", "authors": ["Yonela Diko"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9096/77ca44864f8f430fad0e15dab7bba013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
