This treatment is done by a dermatologist using a dermapen \u2014 think a small stamp of needles \u2014 that\u2019s pressed into the skin.\n\nThen, there\u2019s at-home microneedling which you\u2019ve probably seen on Instagram or Youtube. It involves using a dermaroller (a rolling wheel of short micro needles). It works similarly to a tool used for aerating soil and makes way for the products that you follow up with afterwards.\n\n\u201cNormally, only about four percent of a product\u2019s ingredients penetrate into the skin, but using a dermaroller allows up to 70 percent to make it through,\u201d says Danna Omari, esthetician and founder of Noy Skincare in New York City. \u201cSo, any condition you\u2019re concerned with \u2014 wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars \u2014 will improve that much faster because the ingredients in your skincare are actually able to get to work.\u201d\n\nIn-office treatments can set you back between R2000-R2500.\n\nMeanwhile, at-home dermarollers can cost anywhere from R250 to R800 \u2014 but Dr Levin says you may want to consider paying the hefty price tag because \u201cat-home devices are much more superficial and not as precise.\u201d\n\nMicroneedling shouldn\u2019t hurt if you\u2019re doing it correctly.\n\nHere\u2019s your step-by-step guide for microneedling, according to Omari:\n\nCompletely clean your skin. Once you\u2019re makeup free, roll each area of your face and neck in different directions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal \u2014 like an asterisk) for two to five minutes. Immediately follow it up with your favourite eye cream, serums, and moisturizer.\n\nREAD MORE: \u201cI Tried The Blood Plasma Facial \u2014 Here\u2019s What Happened\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re investing in a safe tool for microneedling.\n\nOpt for a roller with \u201csterilized stainless steel and has surgical-grade needles at the optimal length and angle to help prevent micro tears,\u201d says Omari.\n\nKeep in mind that while in-office treatments are meant to draw blood, at-home rollers should not.\n\nThere are some risks involved with microneedling \u2014 particularly if you DIY.\n\n\u201cAt-home microneedling devices are difficult to clean, so there\u2019s a higher risk of infection,\u201d warns Dr Levin. Omari agrees that keeping your tool clean is key and recommends running it under hot water after each use then letting it dry completely before putting it back in its case. Once or twice a week, she also recommends soaking it in a cleansing solution for 10 minutes. If you\u2019re in a pinch, she says denture solution tablets work, too.\n\nMicroneedling isn\u2019t for you if you have inflamed skin.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dealing with an inflammatory condition \u2014 such as psoriasis or eczema, or actively tanned, sunburned skin \u2014 or you have a skin infection such as cold sores, microneedling should not be performed,\u201d explains Dr Levin. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to further stress out skin that\u2019s already irritated.\u201d If you\u2019re unsure which camp you fall in, always ask your dermatologist or esthetician before getting started.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "This beauty service can help fight lines, scars and pigmentation.", "authors": ["Chelsea Burns"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5000/44e2dd84c2084bc3b4be359c26d1918c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
