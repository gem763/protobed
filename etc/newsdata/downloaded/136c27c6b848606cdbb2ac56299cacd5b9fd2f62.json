To downplay Mr. Trump\u2019s transgressions, they are drawing a false equivalence between his July phone call with President Zelensky of Ukraine and former Vice President Biden\u2019s efforts in 2015 to encourage the replacement of the Ukrainian prosecutor general.\n\nDon\u2019t be confused. These two cases have almost nothing in common. While I was President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Mr. Biden took repeated steps \u2014 at the president\u2019s behest \u2014 to advance a widely supported, completely overt United States government policy to encourage Ukrainian officials to aggressively combat endemic corruption and bolster Ukraine\u2019s nascent democracy.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s pressure on President Petro Poroshenko to remove his poor-performing prosecutor general, including by threatening to withhold additional aid, was fully consistent with American interests. It was also a policy fully supported by the International Monetary Fund and our European partners, who along with the United States were providing billions in economic assistance to support the newly elected Ukrainian government.\n\nThis broadly backed anti-corruption policy had nothing to do with Mr. Biden, his son Hunter, or any other individual. Moreover, the policy was conducted transparently and openly for all to see. As has been widely reported, the prosecutor general also was not pursuing any inquiry of Hunter Biden or the owner of the company whose board he sat on, Burisma, at the time of the vice president\u2019s intervention. Indeed, by pressing for the removal of the corrupt prosecutor general, Mr. Biden backed a policy that increased the likelihood that a responsible replacement might pursue Burisma\u2019s owner and others.", "description": "Almost everything about President Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president violated protocol.", "authors": ["Susan E.
