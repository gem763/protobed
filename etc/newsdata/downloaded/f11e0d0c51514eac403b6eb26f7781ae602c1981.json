As founding editor, Frank aimed to create a library of \u201cgood books, books to delight and enlighten and surprise readers,\u201d yet one \u201csurprising in its own right, making connections with a spark.\u201d In particular, the whole \u201chad to be recognizable as a series.\u201d To achieve this, Frank decided to draw on \u201call sorts of extraordinary books that had never even been translated into English,\u201d as well as \u201cthe literature hidden away in publishers\u2019 backlists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is this restless, elegant eclecticism, along with a truly global reach, that keeps the NYRB Classics so exhilarating. \u201cThe Red Thread,\u201d Frank tells us, is a Chinese \u201cmetaphor for a binding tie that exists between people unknown to each other.\u201d Creating such a tie is precisely one of the things that the world\u2019s literature can do.\n\nWho is \u2018The Clockwork Man\u2019? He may be literature\u2019s first cyborg.\n\nFor Frank, literature doesn\u2019t just mean fiction and poetry. Eve Babitz\u2019s manic \u201cNew York Confidential,\u201d about a year in Manhattan during the go-go 1960s, is followed by passages from Henry David Thoreau\u2019s nature journals. Other selections include Jessica Mitford\u2019s stunning interview with George Jackson, the doomed young author of \u201cSoledad Brother,\u201d Elizabeth Hardwick\u2019s portrait of Billie Holiday and Rachel Bespaloff\u2019s reflections on Helen of Troy: \u201cOf all the figures in the poem she is the severest, the most austere.\u201d From Andrei Platonov to Victor Serge, with stops along the way for Leonardo Sciascia, Tove Jansson, Mavis Gallant, Balzac, Vasily Grossman and Kenji Miyazawa, this sampler underscores that great writing recognizes no borders. In an especially lovely piece, Simon Leys outlines China\u2019s traditional belief in the interpenetration of ethics and aesthetics: \u201cOne writes, one paints, one plays the zither in order to perfect one\u2019s character, to attain moral fulfillment by ensuring that one\u2019s individual humanity is in harmony with the rhythms of universal creation.\u201d Leys concludes, \u201cEven as he is creating his work, it is always and essentially on himself that the artist is working.\u201d\n\nHawley Harvey Crippen and Henri D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Landru were notorious murderers, so the euphonious juxtaposition of their names struck Douglas G. Greene as singularly apt when he was founding a press specializing in collections of criminous short stories. Silver Bullets: The 25th Anniversary of Crippen & Landru Publishers multitasks as an anthology, a festschrift and a bibliographical history. Its appendix lists the more than 100 volumes that Greene and his successor, Jeffrey Marks, have published since John Dickson Carr's \"Speak of the Devil\" in 1994. My own favorite Crippen & Landru titles include all five of Edward D. Hoch's volumes about that New England Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Sam Hawthorne, Anthony Berkeley's \"The Avenging Chance\" and Vincent Cornier's \"The Duel of Shadows.\" Each contains dazzling examples of seemingly \"impossible\" murders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat entertaining subgenre\u2019s most familiar scenario typically reveals Sir Reginald or the awful Mrs. Murgatroyd stabbed to death in a room locked from the inside. But the next most popular setup must be the body found on the deserted beach with no footsteps in the sand except those of the murdered man or woman. Such is the situation facing Sir Gideon Parrot in \u201cThe Flying Fiend,\u201d Hoch\u2019s contribution to \u201cSilver Bullets.\u201d Note that Sir Gideon\u2019s last name pays winking homage to a certain fussy Golden Age ratiocinator: In \u201cParrot,\u201d he explains: \u201cThe t is silent, the accent is on the o.\u201d\n\nBesides the Hoch, \u201cSilver Bullets\u201d is shot through with tales of villainy from Liza Cody; Peter Lovesey; Bill Pronzini and Marcia Muller; Jon Breen; Michael Z. Lewin; and many others. All the authors preface their stories with brief appreciations of Greene and his publishing house.\n\nDispatch from a \u2018horror\u2019 convention\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction: 70th Anniversary Issue, dated September-October and edited by C.C. Finlay, is a bumper volume of 256 pages containing four novelets, eight short stories, two poems and a variety of cartoons, book reviews and essays. As an \u201cAll-Star Issue\u201d it showcases some of our most admired contemporary writers of \u201cfantastika\u201d: Kelly Link, Ken Liu, Michael Swanwick, Maureen McHugh, Elizabeth Bear, Esther Friesner, Paolo Bacigalupi. In addition, science fiction grandmaster Robert Silverberg describes how \u201cF&SF\u201d got its start and Paul Di Filippo offers a scholarly jeu d\u2019esprit about a long-lost collaboration between Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. One particular coup: Michael Moorcock\u2019s intense \u201cKabul\u201d tracks a ragtag band of soldiers and survivalists in a devastated near-future Afghanistan. Think \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d but even bleaker.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo mark the 25th anniversary of Chicago Quarterly Review, the fall 2019 issue is appropriately huge, as befits Carl Sandburg\u2019s \u201cstormy, husky, brawling,/ City of the Big Shoulders.\u201d Here, in over 400 pages, are 32 short stories, 20 poems, a suite of photographs and a dozen works of nonfiction. The result isn\u2019t just a literary quarterly; it\u2019s a tour of the bright and darkling plain we call contemporary American literature.\n\nBesides many younger writers, this issue of CQR also features the work of several old pros: stories by Chicago mainstays Harry Mark Petrakis \u2014 now in his mid-90s \u2014 and John Blades, poems from David Lehman and Michael Collier, and an evocative memoir by violinist Judith Aller about growing up in Los Angeles among the celebrated musicians of the Aller-Slatkin family.\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style.\n\nESSAY\n\nAD", "description": "Here\u2019s to 20 years of NYRB Classics, 25 years of the Chicago Quarterly Review and other bookish toasts.", "authors": ["Michael Dirda"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PGWvXrKuCqE8Vgw_GKPILvGxdbw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DXTAGTXFLQI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg"}
