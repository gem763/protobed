The big four banks have passed on only a fraction of the cut.\n\nCommonwealth Bank shares fell more than 2.8 per cent to $77.34, Westpac skidded 2.4 per cent to $28.50, National Australia Bank was down 3.5 per cent to $28 and Australia and New Zealand Bank fell 2.7 per cent to $27.30.\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley sounded the alarm about bank dividends.\n\n\"Major banks will need to fundamentally change their approach to capital management, given pressure on profitability due to lower rates and more onerous capital requirements,\" analyst Richard Wiles said.\n\n\"This means they should target higher capital levels and lower their dividend payout ratios. We forecast dividend cuts at [Westpac] and ANZ, but also think that payout ratios at NAB and CBA remain too high.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar was up to US67\u00a2 and the yield on the 10-year Australian bond fell 4 basis points to 0.9 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchroders fixed income and multi-asset head Simon Doyle warned that the market could get even more vicious in coming months.\n\n\"Markets, generally for the better part of the last 10 years, have been in quite a virtuous cycle,\" he said. \"It could turn from a virtuous to a vicious cycle pretty quickly.\"\n\nHe said robust profits and low rates so far had supported highly priced equity markets and risk assets, but he believed this could change rather quickly.\n\n\"If you do start to see economic growth begin to fragment and profits decline, then you no longer have that support,\" he said. \"That's why that nervousness is coming through, and I think that nervousness is completely justified.\"\n\nLaggard stocks included CSL, whose shares were down 2.4 per cent to $229.03. Mining giant BHP Group fell 3.2 per cent to $35.15.\n\nTechnology play Nearmap took a heavy loss, down 5.5 per cent to $2.42 a share.\n\nGold miners bucked the trend, posting solid gains as investors scrambled for safe-haven assets. The appeal of gold producers has been boosted by the weakness in the Australian dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It reflects a lot of the uncertainty around the global economy ... when you're in that environment when you've got very low yields across the world, it's natural for investors to look for things that might store value,\" Mr Doyle said.\n\n\"And I think the gold miners are a leveraged play on gold and provide easy access to gold for investors.\"\n\nGold miner Newcrest Mining lifted 2.8 per cent to $35.48 on Thursday, Northern Star Resources was up 3.5 per cent to $11.69 and Evolution Mining increased its value by 2 per cent for shares to be worth $4.62.\n\nSaracen Mining jumped 4.1 per cent to $3.58, Gold Road Resources increased 1.3 per cent to $1.22 and Regis Resources went up 1.5 per cent to $4.91.\n\nDespite the activity around gold miners, the price of gold fell 0.1 per cent to $US1498.24 ($2236) an ounce on Thursday.\n\nAnother commodity, crude oil, was down 0.2 per cent to $US57.55 a barrel.", "description": "Australian shares have taken a second battering in as many days, as trade war developments and weak US data hit fragile investor confidence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e90021b83b8e9df1d8a6b31e278253fbd6daa829", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
