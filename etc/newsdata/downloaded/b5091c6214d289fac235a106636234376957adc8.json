Security Council resolution could pave the way for talks.\n\n\u201cOur response to talks under pressure is NO,\u201d said Rouhani, but warned that Iran might exit a 2015 nuclear deal if the European powers failed to salvage the deal.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to the nuclear deal ... but Iran\u2019s patience has a limit,\u201d said the pragmatic president, who was architect of the deal with six powers.\n\nIran has criticized the European parties to the deal for their failure to protect Iran\u2019s interests by shielding them from U.S. penalties which has been reimposed and tightened since last year when Washington exited the pact.\n\nIn retaliation, Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to the agreement.\n\nThe confrontation between arch enemies Iran and the United States has ratcheted up after attacks on Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14 that Washington, the EU and Riyadh blame on Tehran despite its denials.\n\nRouhani said the only way to secure peace and safety in the Gulf was strengthening \u201cconsolidation among all the nations with common interests in the Persian Gulf and the Hormuz region.\u201d\n\nHe said to those countries that \u201cwe are neighbors with you, not with America\u201d and called for the United States to withdraw troops from the region.", "description": "Iran will never hold talks with the United States under pressure, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, but added that lifting all the sanctions Washington imposed on Tehran and respecting a U.N.
