Photograph: Supplied/The Mint\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way for grandparents to connect with grandchildren, and for all of us to share our own experiences and memories with each other \u2013 both here and with friends and family overseas,\u201d she said following their release.\n\nBesides the self-evidently Australian inclusions \u2013 the kangaroo features, as does the platypus (which is already on Australia\u2019s 20c coin) \u2013 others may cause confusion for any international guest interested in joining what Australia Post is marketing as \u201cthe Great Aussie Coin Hunt\u201d.\n\nThe yowie, for example, which has its roots in Indigenous folklore, is a mythical creature said to inhabit the Australian outback. Roughly akin to Big Foot, \u201cyowie hunters\u201d regularly claim sightings of the creature and have become their own sub-genre of curiosity story.\n\nThe inclusion of thongs \u2013 Australia\u2019s term for the flip-flop \u2013 may also create confusion for visitors.\n\nThe promotion is also a boon for American-owned company Arnott\u2019s Biscuits and the Seventh Day Adventist Church-owned company Sanitarium; the coins feature the Arnott\u2019s-owned biscuit the Iced VoVo and Sanitarium\u2019s breakfast cereal Weet-Bix. Other brands, including Vegemite and the Zooper Dooper ice block, also feature.\n\nThe township of Xantippe \u2013 located about 240 kilometres north of Perth in Western Australia with a population of 20 people \u2013 was included because it is the only town in Australia which starts with X.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest There\u2019s even a new coin for the yowie hunters out there. Photograph: Supplied/The Mint\n\nDespite being marketed as a hunt, the coins are only available as change at Australia Post stores, leading one Twitter user to ask the obvious question: \u201cwhat can you actually buy from Australia Post?\u201d\n\nAustralia Post suggested a sewing machine.\n\n\u201cNeed some new stationery? A phone charger? Some lollies? Maybe an airbed or a sewing machine?\u201d Australia Post replied.\n\n\u201cThere are a surprising array of gifts and goodies at your local Post Office these days.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Great Aussie Coin Hunt\u2019 a boon for brands, with Vegemite, Iced VoVos and Zooper Doopers scoring their own $1 coins", "authors": ["Michael Mcgowan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0615baa6af56b87823a468385fcd4dea3db74db2/0_211_4466_2681/master/4466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4a4377c1799a79390516a9e6080013a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
