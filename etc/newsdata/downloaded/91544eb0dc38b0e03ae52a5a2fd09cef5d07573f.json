In a tweet, he said that witnesses to the attack said it was a mortar attack by government forces.\n\nOne of the wounded, Gulabistan, 45, said the mosque was full when the explosion happened.\n\n\u201cMullah already started prayers and reciting verses of holy Koran, when a huge boom happened, then all around me it got dark, the only thing I remember is females\u2019 voices and then I found myself in the hospital,\u201d Gulabistan said.\n\nHe said he had been told his son was among the dead while his brother and two nephews had been wounded and were in hospital.\n\nA Reuters reporter saw 67 freshly excavated graves for the victims in Jawdara village.\n\nU.S. ambassador John R Bass, said in a tweet that \u201ckilling worshippers assembled together in peace is unconscionable. All Afghans have the right to live and worship together in safety.\u201d\n\nThe European Union said the attack aimed to undermine hopes for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban and Islamic State fighters are actively operating in parts of Nangarhar, which shares a border with Pakistan in the east.\n\nThe mosque attack was the latest act of violence in the country. A U.N. report this week said 4,313 civilians were killed and wounded in Afghanistan\u2019s war between July and September.", "description": "Police and local people searched on Saturday for more bodies in the rubble of a mosque in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province after bomb blasts in which at least 69 people were killed during Friday prayers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442632762&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I08D", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
