(AP) - Quandre Diggs was trying to get some rest on his off day. The incessant buzz of his phone wouldn\u2019t give him a chance to rest.\n\nOn the other end was his agent, letting him know he was headed to catch a plane for a new destination. He was no longer the defensive captain for the Detroit Lions. Diggs\u2019 new home was in Seattle after being traded to the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cI was blindsided by it,\u201d Diggs said Wednesday. \u201cI was taking a nap, me and my daughter was taking a nap, and I just kept getting phone calls. I got a call from my agent and he said you\u2019re going to Seattle.\u201d\n\nThe versatile safety is now in a whirlwind of trying to get himself acclimated to a new team, a new system and to possibly be in position to contribute on Sunday when the Seahawks travel to Atlanta.\n\nIt was a surprising move that interrupted Diggs\u2019 rest while his 3-month-old daughter slept. Diggs was a starter with the Lions, who sit at 2-3-1 in the NFC North. He was a team captain. He was able to play both safety positions for the Lions after initially starting his career as a nickel cornerback.\n\nBut Seattle had a significant need. The Seahawks\u2019 safety depth is essentially gone. Lano Hill is expected to be out for a few weeks with an elbow injury. Starter Bradley McDougald is dealing with back spasms that caused him to miss last week\u2019s loss to Baltimore. Coach Pete Carroll sounded pessimistic that McDougald would be able to play against Atlanta.\n\nThe injuries left Seattle with only three safeties on the active roster against Baltimore. There needed to be a move and Seattle seemed just as surprised to find the Lions willing to part with a starter.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that could be possible,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe got concerned with our depth and our issues with a couple of guys banged up and not sure when they\u2019re going to get back. \u2026 We were looking and it happened to pop up just right.\n\nWhile Diggs is intrigued by his opportunity with the Seahawks, he was clearly unhappy with leaving Detroit and many of his teammates with the Lions echoed their displeasure with the move.\n\n\u201cThe whole team captain aspect, that\u2019s tough,\u201d Diggs said. \u201cI worked my tail off for those guys in that locker room. I\u2019ve changed the way I went about my business there and it\u2019s tough to leave those guys. I miss those guys, but I guess that\u2019s just how things go.\u201d\n\nCarroll said Diggs will be sprinkled in at both safety positions, but he first mentioned free safety. Carroll insisted the trade was out of a need for depth and not an indictment of starting free safety Tedric Thompson, who has struggled at times this season. Thompson was responsible for the blown coverage that led to a 50-yard pass play in the loss to Baltimore last Sunday.\n\nBut Diggs\u2019 versatility to play both safety positions and a little cornerback if needed will be fully examined by the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve used him in a number of different ways so there is a big variety of background that I just think he\u2019s been a unique player,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys I\u2019ve seen for a long time and liked for a long time.\u201d\n\nOne aspect helping Diggs\u2019 transition will be the number of connections already in Seattle. Wide receiver Tyler Lockett is one of his closest friends. Diggs played several seasons with Ziggy Ansah and last year with Luke Willson.\n\n\u201cHe really talks the talk and that\u2019s the thing you learn when you are around him,\u201d Lockett said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to set you straight. He\u2019s not going to tell me something that\u2019s not true about myself. He\u2019s going to tell me the truth about myself, if I\u2019m playing too much, if I\u2019m taking it too personal, whatever the case is. Just to have him here allows you to have another accountability partner.\u201d\n\nNOTES: T Duane Brown (biceps) was a limited participant in practice after missing the past two games. Carroll was uncertain if Brown would be ready to play by Sunday. \u2026 DE Ziggy Ansah (ankle) was also a limited participant after missing last Sunday\u2019s loss to Baltimore. \u2026 QB Russell Wilson was a full participant but was listed with a knee injury. It\u2019s his first appearance on the injury report this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Quandre Diggs was trying to get some rest on his off day.
