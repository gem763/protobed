Labor activists long have been asking for a raise in the minimum wage, and in July 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that gradually would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour by 2025. Although it\u2019s unlikely the bill will pass in the Senate, some individual states, cities, counties and companies already have implemented a $15 minimum wage or approved plans that eventually will make the minimum wage $15.\n\nHere\u2019s what a $15 minimum wage would mean for workers, employers, consumers and the economy, and how this higher minimum wage has impacted the places that already have it.\n\nLast updated: Sept. 24, 2019\n\nFederal vs. State Minimum Wage\n\nThe federal minimum wage is the base minimum wage any individual state can mandate. States can pass their own laws to implement a minimum wage that is greater than the federal minimum wage. Currently, 29 states plus Washington, D.C., Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal minimum wage.\n\nWhy Raise the Minimum Wage?\n\nA person working full time and earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would make roughly $15,000 a year. That would put a family of two or more with no additional income below the federal poverty level of $16,910.\n\nOver 1 Million Americans Would Rise Above Poverty Level If the Federal Minimum Wage Increased\n\nIf the U.S. minimum wage were raised to $15 by 2025, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 17 million workers would see a boost in their wages, according to a CNBC report. In addition, another 10 million Americans who now earn slightly more than $15 an hour might also see a wage increase, according to the report.\n\nThe increase in pay for these workers would move 1.3 million Americans above the poverty level, the CBO projected.\n\nThe Potential Downsides of an Increased Minimum Wage\n\nA higher minimum wage could have negative repercussions for both workers and employers, according to the CBO analysis. The CBO estimated that 1.3 million Americans could lose their jobs if a wage hike were enacted, although some economists believe the actual number would be much lower.\n\nThe CBO also said that an increase in the minimum wage would \u201creduce business income and raise prices\u201d as companies pass on the higher costs of labor to consumers. In addition, it could slightly reduce the U.S.\u2019s total output.\n\nSome Research Disputes the CBO Findings\n\nAlthough the CBO predicts that raising the minimum wage would have negative effects on employment, some research contradicts these findings. A 2019 study by UC Berkeley\u2019s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics looked at sub-state wage variations that would echo what would happen if the minimum wage moved closer to the median wage across the U.S.\n\nAccording to a press release, the study \u201cdid not detect adverse effects on employment, weeks worked or weekly hours among workers with a high school degree or less.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results of our research show that we can raise pay to $15, even in low-cost states,\u201d said Anna Godoey, one of the study authors, in the press release. \u201cThe data show that the minimum wage has positive effects, especially in areas where the highest proportion of workers received minimum wage increases. We also found reduced household and child poverty in such counties.\u201d\n\nStates That Have Passed a $15 Minimum Wage\n\nIt remains to be seen whether a federal minimum wage of $15 will pass in the Senate, but several states have passed their own legislation in recent years to raise the minimum wage for its employees, with seven states passing legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 over the next few years:\n\nCalifornia minimum wage: The state minimum wage will be $15 by January 2022.\n\nThe state minimum wage will be $15 by January 2022.
