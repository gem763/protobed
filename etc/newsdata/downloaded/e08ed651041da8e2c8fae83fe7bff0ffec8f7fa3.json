Warren, I want to start with you,\u201d Cooper continued.\n\n\u201cYou have said that there\u2019s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn\u2019t it be the voters who determine the president\u2019s fate?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator said impeachment is necessary because the president broke the law \u201cover and over.\u201d She said she initially made the determination after reading the Mueller report and falsely claimed that Mueller had shown \u201cthat this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly,\u201d despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.\n\nAttorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that the evidence was \u201cnot sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,\u201d Warren said, adding that impeachment is about Trump as well as \u201cthe next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impeachment must go forward,\u201d she proclaimed.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) concurred, repeating the false claim that Trump obstructed justice and calling him the \u201cmost corrupt president in the history of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the House will find him guilty of \u2014 worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous,\u201d he said, adding that he looks forward to a \u201cspeedy and expeditious impeachment process.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile there are varying degrees of support, all of Warren and Sanders\u2019 colleagues signaled support for the Democrat-led impeachment efforts.\n\nHere are their most significant lines on impeachment:\n\nJoe Biden (D):\n\nI said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did that, they would have no choice \u2014 no choice \u2014 but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president \u2014 and I agree with Bernie, Sen. Sanders \u2014 is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA):\n\nBut the reality of it is that I don\u2019t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there\u2019s been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ):\n\nAnybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that\u2019s what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN):\n\nWe can do two things at once. That\u2019s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro (D):\n\nNot only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out ten different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly \u2014 in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg (D):\n\nLook, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It\u2019s also about the presidency itself, because a president ten years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI):\n\nThe serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.\n\nTom Steyer (D):\n\nTwo years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They\u2019re the voice that counts, and that\u2019s who I went to, the American people.\n\nAndrew Yang (D):\n\nI support impeachment, but we shouldn\u2019t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke (D):\n\nAnd we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president\u2019s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.\n\nTrump reacted to the Democrat debate on Wednesday, writing, \u201cYou would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!\u201d he exclaimed:\n\nYou would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States. Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2019\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday that the House will hold off on a House-wide vote on the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,\u201d Pelosi said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to call bluffs. We\u2019re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.\u201d", "description": "Every single candidate on the debate stage at Tuesday's Democrat debate expressed support for an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dem-debate-stage-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
