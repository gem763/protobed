The tweet started a firestorm that engulfed the league as it prepared to open the 2019-20 season with a preseason trip to China.\n\nCHARLES BARKLEY TELLS MIKE PENCE TO 'SHUT UP' AFTER VP BLASTS NBA COWARDICE, HYPOCRISY ON CHINA\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to double down on engaging with the people of China and India and throughout Africa, throughout the world regardless of their governments,\u201d said Silver, who appeared on TNT\u2019s broadcast of \u201cInside the NBA.\u201d \u201cCertainly [if] we get to a point where the U.S. government tells us we shouldn\u2019t be doing business in certain territories or countries, we won\u2019t.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cBut I\u2019m a firm believer that through sports, independent of governments, you bring people together, they acknowledge that commonality they create empathy. Through personal relationships, there\u2019s no substitute. This league for decades has been on the ground in China, spreading the game, teaching the values of this game, and, again, I think those are core American values and we\u2019ve never wavered.\u201d\n\nSilver said he was unclear about the overall financial impact the controversy has had on the NBA. He noted Chinese state television suspended broadcasts while the country\u2019s streaming service, Tencent. has put some games back on the platform. He tried to make the larger point that the current issues between the U.S. and China have \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with the NBA.\u201d\n\nNBA 'ACTING LIKE A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY' OF CHINA, PENCE SAYS AMID CONTROVERSY OVER HONG KONG TWEET\n\nSilver has supported Morey\u2019s right to speak freely but has stated that he regretted the outcome of the tweet.\n\nHe claimed last week that the Chinese government urged him to remove Morey from his position as the team\u2019s general manager and boasted that he resisted the request. Chinese officials took offense Silver's allegation and denied making the demand.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nState media vowed \u201cretribution\u201d for Silver\u2019s alleged lies.", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday he hoped\u00a0his league can \"bring people together\" hours after\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence blasted the NBA as acting as a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary of China.\u201d", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
