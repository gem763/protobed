Please try again later.\"\n\nOne of Tesla's selling features is that you can use the app to unlock your car and don't need to travel with the key. But if you don't have the key card or key fob and are logged out of the app and are, therefore, unable to use its \"phone-as-key\" function, you would have to wait.\n\nA representative for Tesla told Business Insider that the app was down at around 4 pm PST on Monday and was only briefly unavailable.", "description": "Panicked Tesla drivers took to Twitter to complain early Tuesday and tweeted at Tesla and Elon Musk to ask what was going on.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6e4f042e22af250c0e3355-2732-1366.jpg"}
