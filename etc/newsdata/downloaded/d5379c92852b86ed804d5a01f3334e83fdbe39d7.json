Others have found that the people who score best on tests tend to be the ones that assume they did poorly.\n\nBut the opposite is true, too, according to a 2004 study entitled Unskilled And Unaware Of It.\n\nIt may sound alarming, but scientists have actually found that this form of self-deception is a critical survival mechanism.\n\nMany social psychologists believe that deceiving yourself is crucial to confidence, and confidence is crucial to getting ahead.\n\nThe unskilled and unaware theory, coupled with work that suggests humans generally think we're better than everyone else, without any real trait basis for that opinion, were the inspiration for the UCSB team's hypothesis.\n\nIn order to test it, they tested over 3,458 Americans between ages 33 and 51.\n\nIn addition to asking what this group thought of today's youth, the research team assessed how authoritarian each participant was, how intelligent they were (according to IQ tests), and how well they were.\n\nWhen the results were in, the researchers found a fairly simple pattern: the smarter someone was, the more likely they were to think the kids today are getting dumber, the better read, the less they thought younger generations are, and the more authoritarian their own leanings were, the more disrespectful they believed youth to be.\n\nBroadly, the study group believed the younger generation is in decline and worst than them, with the exception of intelligence. Participants thought that intelligence was about equal from generation to generation, unless they themselves were particularly intelligent.\n\nAnd to take it a step further, the research team started toying with participants' perceptions of their own reading enjoyment and literary prowess in another study\n\nThese study participants were given an 'author recognition' test, and how much they remembered enjoying reading as a child - but how they answered the author test, in fact, didn't matter at all.\n\nResearchers randomly told them they'd scored in the top, bottom or middle of the pack, as a way of undermining and manipulating how well read the participants thought they were.\n\nThey found that manipulating people's memories of themselves actually changed how they saw others.\n\n'The present findings suggest that denigrating today\u2019s youth is a fundamental illusion,' the study authors wrote.\n\n'Although the cognitive mechanisms that unfairly impugn children today are likely to persist for millennia to come, knowledge of their sources may minimize unwarranted gloom about future generations.'", "description": "UC Santa Barbara researchers found that they could water down older generations' negative beliefs about younger ones if they undermined older people's beliefs in their own superiority.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19808224-0-image-a-3_1571260713457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
