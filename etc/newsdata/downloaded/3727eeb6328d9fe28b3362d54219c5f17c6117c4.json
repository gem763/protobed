Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019, a sum that came from around 1.4 million donations, his campaign reported Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d\n\nThe third quarter ended Monday, and all 2020 candidates must report their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Sanders\u2019 third-quarter haul stacks up against his fellow candidates, but the senator has long been in the top echelon of fundraising, leaning on the support of small-dollar donations that propelled him forward in 2016.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden had all also raised more than $20 million by the end of July, while other candidates have struggled to hit those targets, according to Open Secrets.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign said Tuesday he had raised a total of $61.5 million since he unveiled his bid for the White House, noting that 99.9% of donors hadn\u2019t yet maxed out how much they\u2019re legally allowed to give.\n\nAn additional $2.6 million was transferred to the campaign from other campaign accounts.\n\nSome Democrats had been ringing the alarm bells to their supporters as the deadline loomed. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) said last month that his campaign was considering dropping out of the race if it didn\u2019t reach a self-imposed goal of $1.7 million for the quarter (his team said they \u201cblew past\u201d that total this weekend). Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s campaign also sent out a stark fundraising email in recent days, although his team later said it wasn\u2019t a signal that he planned to leave the race.\n\nCandidates\u2019 number of donors will come into play for the Democratic National Committee\u2019s upcoming debates in November. That event will have a higher threshold, mandating candidates have at least 165,000 individual donors as well as reaching at least 3% in at least four approved polls of Democratic voters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, on the other hand, has already amassed a gargantuan war chest, raising more than $200 million from his campaign committee and outside groups. His campaign has not yet filed its FEC disclosures for the third quarter.", "description": "That figure came from 1.4 million donations, an average of $18.07 apiece.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92e4562100005900f8d8c1.jpeg?cache=5einjhae79&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
