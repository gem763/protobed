During her tenure, she rose through the ranks from executive assistant to director of productions and vice president of production and finance.\n\nLISTEN TO BOMBSHELL AUDIO IN DE NIRO HARASSMENT CASE:\n\nRobinson said the 76-year-old actor and unhinged Hollywood star treated her like his \u201coffice wife,\u201d the federal lawsuit states.\n\nRobinson claims De Niro often went ballistic on her, once calling her a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d in a profanity-laced voicemail when she did not answer his phone call, according to the suit.\n\nFOX Business reached out to De Niro on Thursday and his camp responded with this statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAs the bombshell voicemail was heard around the world, the crazed star of \"The Irishman\" was hitting the red carpet in New York for Variety's Power of New York event.\n\nThe accuser's attorney maintains the maniacal tirade by De Niro was \u201cnot an isolated incident.\u201d \u201cIt was one example among many of the kinds of conduct that Mr. De Niro subjected Ms. Robinson to,\u201d she said.\n\nHarwin told FOX Business De Niro\u2019s treatment of Robinson began during her first year of employment. \"The work environment grew much worse over time and eventually became so intolerable that she had no choice but to quit,\" Harwin said.\n\nThe suit claims Robinson complained repeatedly and, on multiple occasions, told De Niro she wanted to resign. Robinson's team said once De Niro learned his former employee was taking legal action, the multi-millionaire struck first and filed a $6 million lawsuit of his own in August 2019 under his company name Canal Productions.\n\nCanal Productions accused Robinson of stealing hundreds of thousands of company dollars before suddenly resigning. The suit also alleges Robinson lied to get paid for 96 unused vacation days and in one instance, watched 55 episodes of \"Friends\" on Netflix during work hours.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it was Mr. De Niro who put Ms. Robinson in the public eye. He filed a retaliatory lawsuit that was covered across every media and trampled Ms. Robinson's reputation to not only people in the entertainment industry but also to people across the country in every walk of life.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nRobinson is seeking $12 million in damages, double what De Niro is seeking.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "De Niro accuser claims actor asked her to scratch his back and put away his boxers.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
