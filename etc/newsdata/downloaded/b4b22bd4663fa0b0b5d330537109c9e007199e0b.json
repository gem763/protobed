(AP) - The Latest on the indictment of a Colorado coroner (all times local):\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nAn indictment says the coroner in a remote Colorado mountain community sent his wife to handle three death scenes even though she wasn\u2019t authorized to do so.\n\nThe indictment, announced Monday, charges Lake County Coroner Shannon Kent with second-degree official misconduct. Kent said he was waiting to consult with his attorney before commenting.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bruce Brown said Kent\u2019s wife, Staci Kent, is not accused of any crime.\n\nThe indictment accuses Shannon Kent of having his wife act as a deputy coroner. Brown says state law requires deputy coroners to take an oath administered by a county clerk or a judge, and that Staci Kent hadn\u2019t done that.\n\nA portion of the indictment released Monday says Staci Kent was delayed in responding to one call because the van she was driving was stuck in the snow with two bodies inside.\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe coroner in a remote Colorado mountain community has been accused of sending his wife to handle numerous death scenes even though she wasn\u2019t authorized to do so.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bruce Brown said Monday that Lake County Coroner Shannon Kent was indicted on a charge of second-degree official misconduct.\n\nKent said he was waiting to consult with his attorney before commenting.\n\nKent is based in Leadville, 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Denver. He was appointed to the job in 2012 and elected to four-year terms in 2014 and 2018.\n\nHe\u2019s the second elected official in Brown\u2019s district to be indicted this summer.\n\nEagle County Sheriff James van Beek was charged with official misconduct in August over expenditures from a reserve fund.
