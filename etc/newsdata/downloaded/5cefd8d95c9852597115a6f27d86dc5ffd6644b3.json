It also follows the release of emails through a Freedom of Information Act request by the conservative group Judicial Watch that seemed to indicate Mueller knew there was a real possibility he could be named special counsel if he wasn\u2019t chosen as the next FBI director.\n\nMUELLER REJOINS WILMERHALE LAW FIRM, IN LATEST POST-RUSSIA PROBE LANDING\n\n\u201cThe boss and his staff do not know about our discussions,\u201d then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an email to Mueller on May 12, 2017. Rosenstein\u2019s boss was then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe, meaning the president would not have known either.\n\nA source close to Rosenstein confirmed to Fox News that he had confidential conversations with Mueller about whether he would be willing to serve in the event he needed to appoint a special counsel. These conversations began on May 12, 2017, prior to Mueller's meeting with the president on May 16, 2017, the source acknowledged.\n\nAt the time of the now-famous May 16, 2017 meeting, Comey had been fired as FBI director just days before and -- unbeknownst to the president -- Mueller would end up being named special counsel the very next day to oversee the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nThe president has repeatedly claimed that Mueller \u2013 who served as FBI director under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2013 met with him about returning to lead the Justice Department. The president has pointed to this to argue it was a conflict for Mueller to become special counsel, saying he opted against hiring Mueller as FBI director.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Mueller, in his July congressional testimony, denied the claim, saying he believed he was giving \u201cinput\u201d to the president about the position.\n\n\u201cMy understanding was I was not applying for the job,\u201d Mueller said on July 24. \u201cI was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job.\u201d\n\nFox News' Bret Baier, Alex Pappas and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump insisted on Wednesday that when he met with Robert Mueller in May 2017, the former special counsel was seeking a job as the next director of the FBI.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/07/28/694940094001_6064821845001_6064814650001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
