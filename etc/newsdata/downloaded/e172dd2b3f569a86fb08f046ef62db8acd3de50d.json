We are angry.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office following the meeting with Mr Raab, Mr Seiger added: \u201cWe are extremely grateful for the opportunity and that we\u2019ve had that time with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need some time to gather our thoughts and compose ourselves. We just need about an hour or so to gather our thoughts,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Ms Charles said she felt \u201clet down by both government\u201d.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really see the point we were invited to see Dominic Raab, we are no further forward than where we were this time last week,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPart of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK Government side to show they are trying to help.\n\n\u201cBut, although he is engaging with us, we have no answers. We are really frustrated that we could spend half an hour or more with him and just come out with nothing.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer for Mr Dunn\u2019s family said they are engaging lawyers to take a civil case against Ms Sacoolas in the US.\n\n\u201cOur position is that she doesn\u2019t have immunity and that waivers are always granted in these circumstances,\u201d Radd Seiger told reporters in Westminster on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNow we can disclose to you we have brought lawyers on board ... We are going to Washington soon to help us get that justice for Harry.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson, the prime minister, Mr Raab and Northamptonshire Police have asked the US to consider waiving the immunity.\n\nIt has since emerged that Mrs Sacoolas was previously handed a fine for \u201cfailure to pay full time and attention\u201d while driving in the state of Virginia in 2006.\n\nPrior to meeting the US Ambassador, Mr Raab raised the case in a telephone call with Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s meeting, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Foreign Secretary met the US Ambassador today and urged the US to reconsider its position and do the right thing by Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said US authorities had been appealed to in \u201cthe strongest terms\u201d to apply a waiver and \u201callow the justice process to take place\u201d after Ms Sacoolas left the UK despite telling officers she did not plan to do so.\n\nRead more\n\nParents of Harry Dunn say they will chase US woman \u2018to Washington\u2019\n\nUK urges US to waive diplomatic immunity for Harry Dunn suspect\n\nUS diplomat\u2019s wife suspected of involvement in deadly crash leaves UK", "description": "The family of a teenager killed in a car crash involving a US diplomat\u2019s wife have said they have been left \u201cangry and frustrated\u201d after meeting with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, which they described as a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d.Harry Dunn, 19, was killed when his motorbike collided with a car in Northamptonshire", "authors": ["Samuel Osborne"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6.t3isXj1JbpbxXyFMmBxw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/feb58fc5dd6c55cb11456202f898654c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
