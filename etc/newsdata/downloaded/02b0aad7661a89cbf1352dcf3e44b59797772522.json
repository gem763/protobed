The decision mostly marks a defeat for Mozilla, which sued the agency last year. But it\u2019s tentatively positive for states like California, which has been fighting for the right to impose stricter net neutrality laws.\n\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals says the FCC had authority to reclassify internet service providers as \u201cinformation services\u201d under Title I of the Telecommunications Act, rather than \u201ccommon carriers\u201d that can be more heavily regulated. It wasn\u2019t persuaded by most of the arguments against this change, but it noted three areas where the FCC hasn\u2019t adequately defended itself.\n\nThe court said the FCC exhibited \u201cdisregard of its duty\u201d to evaluate how its rule change would affect public safety. Public safety was a key issue in a hearing earlier this year, with net neutrality advocates arguing that the FCC\u2019s decision let ISPs throttle first responders\u2019 data \u2014 something that happened in California last year. \u201cThe harms from blocking and throttling during a public safety emergency are irreparable. People could be injured or die,\u201d reads the ruling, which orders the FCC to address these safety concerns.\n\nThe FCC also didn\u2019t sufficiently explain what the rules would mean for utility pole access \u2014 which can make it easier for new competitors to set up internet service networks \u2014 and didn\u2019t address concerns about how the change would affect the Lifeline internet access program for low-income Americans.\n\nAnd most notably, the court vacated a section of the rules that let the FCC preempt any stricter state net neutrality laws. The FCC has previously filed suit against states that passed their own net neutrality rules.\n\nFCC chair Ajit Pai celebrated the ruling on Twitter. \u201cToday\u2019s D.C. Circuit decision is a big victory for consumers!\u201d Pai wrote. \u201cThe court affirmed the FCC\u2019s decision to repeal 1930s utility-style regulation of the internet.\u201d In an official statement, he also said he \u201clook[s] forward to addressing ... the narrow issues that the court identified.\u201d\n\nMozilla also released a statement responding to the decision. \u201cOur fight to preserve net neutrality as a fundamental digital right is far from over. We are encouraged to see the court free states to enact net neutrality rules that protect consumers,\u201d it says. \u201cWe are considering our next steps in the litigation around the FCC\u2019s 2018 Order, and are grateful to be a part of a broad community pressing for net neutrality protections in courts, states and in Congress.\u201d", "description": "An appeals court has upheld the FCC\u2019s repeal of net neutrality laws last year, but it says the agency can\u2019t stop states from passing stricter laws.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnQyiQ5lR8tbCKGu1nPpaKIzuyw=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11515081/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
