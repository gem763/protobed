But the \u201cconsensus was to flout the rules and divide this year\u2019s prize to celebrate two winners.\u201d\n\nEvaristo, who won for her novel \u201cGirl, Woman, Other,\u201d is the first black woman to win the Booker Prize. \u201cI hope that honor doesn\u2019t last too long,\u201d she said in her acceptance speech. Atwood, who won in 2000 for \u201cThe Blind Assassin,\u201d was considered a front-runner this year for \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d the sequel to her 1985 dystopian classic, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time the award has been shared. In 1992, Michael Ondaatje\u2019s \u201cThe English Patient\u201d shared it with Barry Unsworth\u2019s \u201cSacred Hunger,\u201d but the prize\u2019s organizers then changed the rules to only allow one winner to avoid undermining either book .", "description": "The judges rebelled against the literary prize\u2019s rules and awarded it to \u201cThe Testaments\u201d and \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d", "authors": ["Alex Marshall", "Alexandra Alter"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/books/14Booker1/14Booker1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
