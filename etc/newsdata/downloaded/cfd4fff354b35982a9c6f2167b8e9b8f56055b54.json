All of us in the national team wish him a good recovery.\"\n\nL\u00f6w says he is sure S\u00fcle will return, \"but now we won't put any pressure on him at all and we will support him as best as we can.\"\n\nS\u00fcle has made 24 appearances for Germany.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
