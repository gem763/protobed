A good kid. Strong walker.\n\n\"One time he stopped in to get (I think) a lucozade from a Londis and it was the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.\n\n\"I f***ing smashed him that day.\"\n\nAdam walked from Archway to Aldgate East on the three days he was in the office.\n\nThe 10-mile round trip took an hour and 45 minutes each way.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nHe said as soon as he noticed his soon-to-be competitor walking the same route at 8.30am, he decided to race him.\n\nAdam said: \"When I'd see him I would walk behind him for a while just to feel his pace and then I would wait until a good moment.\n\n\"I'd have to go in front of him quite late into the game on Commercial Street so he couldn't sneak up behind me and overtake at the last minute.\n\n\"I'd have to leave it to the last possible second to go 'right I'm in front of you now and you cannot beat me because we're at the end of the race'.\"\n\nIn the viral Facebook post, Adam reminisced about one time he left his smartly-dressed competitor trailing in his wake.\n\nAdam said: \"One day I think he went in for a little drink - a lucozade or an energy drink probably.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"At first I thought 'this doesn't feel like a real achievement to beat him by this much because he's gone in there'.\n\n\"Then I thought 'in F1 they have pit stops and that counts'. So I decided it was still winning, it wasn't by default or a moot race, so I won.\n\n\"I was way in front of him - I left him in the dust - as it's busy in shops at that time in the morning with people getting their morning bits.\n\n\"It was end game, no question.\"\n\nFlush with success, Adam shared his emphatic victory with pals on Facebook.\n\nAdam said: \"It was a high that took me through the day.\n\n\"I didn't bandy it about the office because I didn't want to be crass, so I just kept it to myself and have a nice little warm glow throughout the day.\n\n\"I put it online because I thought it was something that people in London and other cities would relate to, it feels quite British for some reason, but I didn't know how far it would go.\n\n\"When I'm walking along the street generally people are going into over-drive mode to take over the person in front because they're walking too slowly.\n\n\"So when you find someone who's clearly in the same sort of range as you it becomes a challenge , that's the best outcome you can get. You've made a nemesis and, in a way, a friend.\"\n\nHe added: \"I hope he was aware of me. I think he saw the back of me a few times but I don't know if he saw it as a race and if he did, maybe he would have beaten me.\n\nNow Adam has a new side job two nights a week at a pub and, despite it being only a five minute walk, he has discovered a new adversary - a \"very quick\" woman who he pits himself against.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nAnother photo shows the seemingly unaware woman as he raced behind her in his bid to overtake.\n\n\"In my head she's called Taylor - because she's swift. She has locomotives for legs, I've never got past her,\" he said.\n\nAdam said that if he beat her, he could quit his job and hunt down his next competitor.\n\n\"I want to be the undisputed champion of the competitive walking circuit,\" he claimed.\n\n\"Some people would say that's a pipe dream but I think it's possible.\n\n\"I think if I beat her I'll quit my job there and I'll find somewhere else and then take on the champion of that track.\"", "description": "Adam Woollard, 28, from north London, said he wants to be the 'undisputed champion of the competitive walking circuit'", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545734.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Mediajpgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
