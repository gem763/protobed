Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper, but also squarely within his constitutional powers.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president pushing for a Biden-related investigation, but there\u2019s no serious argument for this. The conduct of foreign policy \u2014 and the inevitable cajoling of and horse-trading with foreign leaders \u2014 is a core presidential duty.\n\nThe problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency, namely his inability or willingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn\u2019t think institutionally or constitutionally, making it a historic irony that he\u2019s appointed a phalanx of judges who will attempt to faithfully interpret the Constitution and protect the institutional prerogatives of the different branches for decades to come.\n\nIn contrast to Trump\u2019s carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It\u2019s not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn\u2019t know that they exist; it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nHer broad approach is if she doesn\u2019t like something about America, she\u2019ll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn\u2019t a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.\n\nThe philosophical and political line from Woodrow Wilson \u2014 the foundational progressive political leader and thinker who scorned what he considered the inefficiency of our traditional constitutional system \u2014 to Warren is direct and unbroken.\n\nOne of Warren\u2019s signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax of 2 percent annually on household net worth of $50 million to $1 billion and 3 percent on net worth above $1 billion. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, the Warren plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.\n\nSomeone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \u201cconstitutionally or legal suspect\u201d is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.\n\nAs conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.\n\nAnd on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it\u2019s not clear under what authority.\n\nTellingly, almost no one on her side says, \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re getting at Liz, but you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nTo their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Her answer came down to the assertion that if a majority supports the tax, it should pass muster. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren\u2019t thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.\n\nThis gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal, didn\u2019t raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn\u2019t have the power to do it.\n\nTo be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small. It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions and a move that at least violates the spirit of our system.\n\nAll you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it\u2019s freaking out Trump, it\u2019s boosting the prospects of Elizabeth Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.\n\n", "description": "Should Warren become president, she will undertake a historic bout of federal activism unmoored from any serious consideration of constitutional constraints.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cb/09/5e052f0e4323924b6937d322196a/191009-elizabeth-warren-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
