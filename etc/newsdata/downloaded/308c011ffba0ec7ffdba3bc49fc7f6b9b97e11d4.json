Although the process may vary per different exchanges, there are three main steps to buying bitcoin with a credit or debit card.\n\n1. Open an exchange account.\n\nSelect a cryptocurrency exchange or service which allows credit/debit card BTC purchases in your jurisdiction. See our recommended exchanges list above, read our reviews, or find other options for your region.\n\nFor instance, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and CEX.io are considered the most beginner-friendly options. A broker like eToro is excellent for beginning investors, as you can make use of their social trading feature and learn how to trade along the way.\n\nServices like Changelly, Coinmama, and BitPanda are among the most convenient options to buy BTC, while LocalBitcoins is a peer-to-peer platform that helps you exchange Bitcoins with other users directly.\n\nBinance, KuCoin, and OKEx are great if you consider buying Bitcoin, as well as altcoins.\n\nDue to the differences in regulations, the best exchanges to buy bitcoin may differ based on your country. For instance, the most convenient exchanges for Canadians differ from the best ones for Indians or the residents of the United Kingdom.\n\n2. Get your account verified.\n\nYou need to verify your account before you can buy BTC with credit or debit card. This involves the uploading of your passport, national ID or other documents according to your preferred level of verification. Once approved and cleared, you can buy bitcoins with your credit/debit card.\n\nSource: Unsplash.\n\n3. Place your bitcoin order.\n\nLog in to the exchange account, select an option to buy BTC with a credit/debit card. Then you will be asked to fill in all the required details and complete the transaction. The bitcoins should be credited to your account almost immediately.\n\nMind that there might be restrictions on how much BTC you can purchase with your credit/debit card daily or weekly. Besides, every exchange has its own terms concerning payment fees - typically it\u2019s much more expensive to buy bitcoin with a credit/debit card compared with a bank transfer or crypto-to-crypto transaction. Check with the exchange of your choice before you hit that \u201cplace order\u201d button.\n\nAlso, remember to stay safe! It's possible that sketchy, low-profile companies selling bitcoin may be collecting your card information and could possibly use it to commit fraud.\n\nBesides, don\u2019t ever leave your bitcoins in the exchange longer than necessary. If\u2019 you\u2019re not sure why you should do so, see our guide on \u201cwhy you shouldn\u2019t leave your digital assets in cryptocurrency exchanges.\u201d\n\nBuy Bitcoin with credit or debit card using Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATM.
