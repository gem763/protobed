Tuesday saw them rehash numerous conversations they\u2019ve already had, and there are still eight excruciating nights of such television for us to endure.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, for instance, once again loudly and obnoxiously announced his intention to confiscate semiautomatic \u201cassault weapons\u201d from their lawful owners. He said he \u201cbelieves\u201d that compliance will be forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I really need to engage with this nonsense, I\u2019ll go ahead and note that the American people don\u2019t support gun confiscation \u2014 even in polls where they endorse banning sales of new assault weapons; that compliance with gun bans is low pretty much everywhere; that his policy would violate the Second Amendment; and that there\u2019s little solid evidence that blanket gun bans are effective in reducing crime. We\u2019re not going to pass this law, we wouldn\u2019t comply with it if we did, and the courts might not allow it anyway.\n\nBut with that out of the way, let\u2019s address what should be an elephant in the room: While Beto was rambling on about his bizarre fantasies in which docile AR-15 owners happily identify themselves to the government and dutifully surrender their arms, our actual legal regime for regulating these guns came under serious threat from a case out of California \u2014 because the folks who are supposed to enforce the gun laws have royally messed up for decades.\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on here, you need a little bit of background. There are lots of rules about making and selling guns in this country: If you sell guns regularly as a business, you need to get a license and conduct background checks on your buyers; each gun a manufacturer creates for sale needs a serial number; etc. However, it\u2019s generally legal to sell firearm parts without following those rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exception is the \u201creceiver.\u201d Federal law treats this part \u2014 the frame that holds the gun\u2019s guts, basically \u2014 the same way it treats an entire firearm. It needs to have a serial number and so on even when it\u2019s sold by itself, preventing people from evading the law by simply buying and selling firearms piece by piece.\n\nBut this creates an issue for AR-15s, whose receivers themselves are divided into two parts. For these guns, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives treats the bottom part \u2014 the \u201clower receiver\u201d \u2014 as the firearm for regulatory purposes. The only way to skirt the law is to sell \u201c80 percent lowers,\u201d hunks of metal mostly made into lowers but still requiring some machining. (It\u2019s legal to finish these off yourself, but only for personal use.)\n\nBut wait a minute: Could the ATF\u2019s usual practice be wrong? Is it actually flat-out legal to sell a completed lower with no serial number and no background check? That\u2019s the issue raised by the recent case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can read the whole story over at CNN, and find the judge\u2019s order here, but for our purposes, these are the important facts: A guy named Joseph Roh illegally manufactured and sold AR-15s and other guns through a slapstick scheme to avoid the law. A judge issued a tentative order against Roh \u2014 but in the process held that lower receivers are not firearms under current regulations, thus acquitting Roh of some of the charges. The government decided to let Roh off with a slap on the wrist rather than pursue the matter further, to prevent the order, as CNN puts it, from \u201cbecoming permanent, drawing publicity, and creating case law that could hamper ATF enforcement efforts.\u201d It ended up on CNN\u2019s website regardless, and anyone prosecuted for selling AR-15 lowers going forward will be tempted to try Roh\u2019s defense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did this happen? Vague laws and poorly crafted bureaucratic rules.\n\nCongress\u2019s law on this matter simply refers to a \u201creceiver\u201d; it doesn\u2019t define the word. The definition is found instead in the Code of Federal Regulations:\n\nThat part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel.\n\nThis is very bad, for the reason noted above: AR-15s don\u2019t have a single receiver. The bolt and threading are found in the upper receiver, while the hammer and firing mechanism are in the lower. Neither, in other words, by itself meets the definition of \u201creceiver\u201d in the regulation \u2014 and for decades the ATF has been enforcing, via its opaque in-house classification process, a rule that doesn\u2019t exist in the official rulebook. As a result, someone who carefully reads both the law and the regulation is not on notice that it\u2019s illegal to sell a lower receiver without a serial number and background check, and cannot rightfully be punished for doing so.\n\nThe upshot? Here\u2019s how the government put it in a filing noted by CNN, warning the judge about the consequences of enforcing the rule as written:\n\nUnregulated parts could be manufactured, sold, and combined with other commercially available parts to create completed, un-serialized firearms which would not be subject to background checks, and which would be untraceable.\n\nIt also stressed that the problem is common to many semiautomatic guns, not just AR-15s and their variants.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a court has noticed this problem, surprisingly enough. In 2016\u2019s U.S. v. Jimenez, a court found similarly when faced with wording like this in a related part of the regulatory code. It further noted that the ATF itself was confused about how to handle split receivers when it discussed them internally in the 1970s.\n\nThis might be a loophole the executive branch can plug fairly easily, since the problem lies mainly in the regulation and not the statute passed by Congress \u2014 though prosecutors could lose cases against illegal gun sellers in the meantime. It\u2019s also possible that other courts will let the agency get away with pretending that the rule means something other than what it says. (See, for instance, ATF\u2019s decision to ban \u201cbump stocks\u201d by administrative fiat despite the fact the statute at issue clearly does not cover them.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you have to ask: If Congress and the ATF can\u2019t write rules clearly ensuring that our basic gun laws apply to AR-15s, how well could Beto\u2019s confiscation drive possibly go?\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
