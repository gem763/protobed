According to Barnier, the new deal assures that Northern Ireland would \"benefit from the UK\u2019s future trade policy\u201d while also remaining \"an entry point into our single market.\u201d\n\nHow?\n\n\u201cUK authorities can apply UK tariffs on products coming from third countries so long as those goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk of entering our single market,\u201d he answered. \u201cHowever, for goods at risk of entering the single market, the UK authorities will apply the EU\u2019s tariffs.\u201dHe did not explain how authorities will determine which goods could be at risk of entering the single market.\n\nYou can read the full text of the deal (64 pages) here.", "description": "Habemus deal: everything you need to know about the deal that Boris Johson struck with the European Union", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/97/58/1000x563_cmsv2_e5c5b0cf-4c69-517c-8fa9-ab2dea6886ad-4239758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
