There are currently no plans to hold a global pitch or to terminate our relationship with MediaCom. We are focusing our energies and time on building ambitious plans for our categories and countries. Any stories to the contrary are untrue.\"\n\nStephen Allan, the worldwide chairman and CEO of MediaCom, added: \"Bayer is a longstanding and key global client of MediaCom and we are delighted to continue to work together to grow our partnership.\"\n\nTheir statements come after Business Insider had previously reached out to MediaCom, GroupM, and Bayer multiple times for comment but they had not responded.\n\nIn the US, MediaCom won Bayer's business in 2011. Bayer has been bringing its US digital buying in-house in 2017, Digiday reported. While Bayer's team initially worked with MediaCom on media buying, the agency was gradually phased out and today handles its offline media only.\n\nIn-housing shows no signs of slowing\n\nWPP roped in a small team from MediaCom's sister GroupM agency Essence to work alongside MediaCom at the client's behest, but that move didn't work out, said two sources familiar with the situation.\n\nBayer is looking to bring all US digital media buying in-house by 2020. It's been taking on functions including strategy, planning and analytics in 2019, working with S4 Capital's MightyHive during the transition, according to Digiday. The company claims to have reduced its programmatic buying costs by $10 to $11 million within the first six weeks.\n\nRead more: Hershey's bet on in-housing is yielding sweet results, with overhead costs down 25%, output up fivefold and over $4 million saved in agency fee\n\nThe desire for more control over their consumer data has led to an increasing number of brands including ADT and Hershey's taking media operations in-house. 78% of brands that are members of the Association of National Advertisers reported in 2018 that they had some form of an in-house agency.\n\nMedia offerings have also become increasingly commoditized\n\nRead More: WPP just lost a huge chunk of one of its oldest, most valuable accounts, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWhile clients take more of their ad duties in house, the rise of programmatic advertising has impacted media agencies as competitors can come in and automate the media-buying process. In such an environment, media agencies like MediaCom no longer have the clout they once did in TV buying.\n\nBayer spent $5.4 million on media in the US in 2018, according to Kantar.", "description": "The decision follows Bayer taking steps to bring its US programmatic buying in-house starting in 2017.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db0aa004af9096c40102ab2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
