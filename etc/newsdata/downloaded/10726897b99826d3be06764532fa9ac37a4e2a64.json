REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nCanada\u2019s central bank is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.75% at a rate decision next Wednesday and through the rest of the year, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nAlso next Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen easing for the third time since July. That could lower the range for the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate below the Bank of Canada\u2019s equivalent rate for the first time since December 2016.\n\n\u201cWhat stands out is that everybody else is easing and the BoC is not,\u201d said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy in New York.\n\nThe European Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand are among other central banks to have eased monetary policy this year.\n\nThe divergence in policy and the rally this week in the price of oil, one of Canada\u2019s major exports, have been positive for the Canadian dollar, Anderson said.\n\nOil prices rose as support from falling U.S. crude inventories, optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal and possible action from OPEC and its allies to extend output cuts outweighed broader economic concerns. U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled 0.8% higher at $56.66 a barrel.\n\nAt 3:17 p.m. (1917 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading 0.1% higher at 1.3061 to the greenback, or 76.56 U.S. cents. The currency, which posted on Thursday its strongest intraday level in more than three months at 1.3053, traded in a narrow range of 1.3058 to 1.3077.\n\nFor the week, the loonie was up 0.5%.\n\nThe gain this week for the loonie came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party won Monday\u2019s federal election but lost its majority in Parliament.\n\nTrudeau has since promised to continue with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which could get more of Canada\u2019s oil to international markets and to prioritize a tax cut for the middle class.\n\nCanadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year CA2YT=RR fell 5.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.66% and the 10-year CA10YT=RR was down 13 Canadian cents to yield 1.537%.", "description": "The Canadian dollar edged higher against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, adding to this week's gain as oil prices rose and investors looked for the Bank of Canada to stick to its divergent path from other central banks.", "authors": ["Fergal Smith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444895002&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O18W", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
