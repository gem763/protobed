We have kids and grandkids here.\n\nWe love the state and its people. We love the weather, the beaches, the deserts and the mountains.\n\nWhat we don't love is what the Democrat Party and its policies have been doing for decades to harm California and its big cities.\n\nThe Democrats running this state almost act like they hate it. All they seem to want is more illegal immigrants, more crippling environmental laws and higher prices for everything.\n\nThe shocking TV images of huge homeless communities living in tents in Los Angeles and San Francisco are the most glaring sign of the Democrats' failure.\n\nEven Democrats like Gov. Gavin Newsom agree that it has been state policies like strict building laws and environmental regulations that have created tens of thousands of homeless people.\n\nOnly let's please not call them \"homeless people.\" It's a misnomer.\n\nMost of the thousands of people you see on TV living in tents and sleeping bags are homeless by choice.\n\nThey're mostly drug addicts. Or mentally ill. Or bums or vagrants who've chosen to live on the street amid their own garbage, used drug needles and human waste.\n\nThey're also mostly males.\n\nThere are lots of genuinely homeless people in California who need assistance from government or private social agencies.\n\nBut they're usually women and children and they're usually living in shelters where they can get the help they need.\n\nShelters have rules you have to follow and homeless mothers and their kids will abide by them. Men won't.\n\nWe keep hearing that we need to build more low-income housing units for the homeless.\n\nBut the truth is, most of the men on the sidewalks of downtown L.A. wouldn't stay in a shelter if it was located in the penthouse of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel.\n\nHalf of the country's unsheltered homeless people live in California. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti wants President Trump to solve the state's homeless crisis.\n\nBut it's the responsibility of the Democrat-controlled state government, the Democrat governor and the Democrat mayors - the ones who created the crisis in the first place.\n\nFor California natives like me, it's a crying shame.\n\nThe most beautiful state in the U.S. has been wrecked by Democrats and it's only going to get worse as more illegal immigrants arrive from Mexico and Central America.\n\nI'm afraid it's only a matter of time before the state runs out of money and the productive people who provide it. -", "description": "Donald Trump visited enemy territory this week.He came out here .09/21/2019 3:11:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Reagan", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/176/710ea37d-9a62-488f-b54e-49b9980b61b7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
