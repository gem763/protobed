I found my clients instead of waiting for them to come to me\n\nCourtesy of Hero Images/Getty Images\n\n\"Build it and they will come\" might happen in the movies, but it definitely isn't the way to create a successful business. (If only!)\n\nA common mistake that many new entrepreneurs make is to set up a gorgeous website, sit back, and wait for clients to come to them. Given that there are over a billion websites on the internet, those are some tough odds.\n\nSo instead of waiting, I went out and found my clients.\n\nMy first online business was doing digital advertising consulting for business owners using skills from my job. Through asking small business owners where they spent their time online, I realized that my potential clients were in Facebook groups. (The forum might change over time, but the principle is the same. Over the years, I've helped students find their clients all over the internet, including on Reddit, Instagram, Youtube, podcasts, industry-specific forums, and more.)\n\nWithin those groups, I searched for terms that my ideal clients would likely be talking about, like \"ads\" and \"campaigns.\" More often than not, they were asking questions about those things that I could help with, so I answered their questions \u2014 for free, and without expecting anything in return.\n\nI didn't know how exactly that would translate into my getting clients, but I knew that if I lead with giving value, I would at the very least start building my reputation online. Plus, I figured there had to be some people who would want more help than I could give through my free responses.\n\nWhen I did ask for something in return, it was simply a few minutes of their time to ask a few market research questions, like, \"What are you struggling with?\" and \"What would you want help with?\" so I could understand what I might be able to eventually sell.\n\nI kept a running list of about 10 Facebook groups and answered every question I could find each day.\n\nAnd that's how I got my first client.\n\nAfter hopping on a market research call, I thanked her by answering a few questions she had about advertising. After our call, she continued to email me follow-up questions, which I answered. After about two weeks of this, she sent me an email letting me know how much she appreciated what I'd helped her with already \u2014 for free \u2014 and asked how she could hire me to get even better results.\n\nI couldn't believe it when I saw her first payment come through Paypal. I was in business! After seeing how well that had worked, I continued to do that until I'd gotten my first few clients.\n\nI want to clarify that the process wasn't easy! I must have spoken to over 50 people in this way to get those clients. More often than not, they'd tell me that I was too expensive (even though I was charging the same rate as my salary). It was incredibly disheartening, and I was tempted to give up. However, each time, I reminded myself that successful entrepreneurs view rejection as a stepping stone, and I needed to do that as well if I was serious about building my business.\n\nRead more: I'm a recruiter who's placed hundreds of senior professionals.
