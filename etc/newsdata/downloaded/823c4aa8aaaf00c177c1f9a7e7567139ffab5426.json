The band were on fire. And we ended up with the best-selling live album of all time\u2019\n\nPeter Frampton, singer, songwriter\n\nWhen I was 11, I saw this guy on the steps of our school playing sax and singing Elvis Presley songs. I asked my father \u2013 the school\u2019s art teacher \u2013 who he was. He said: \u201cOh, that\u2019s Jones.\u201d I said: \u201cI want to be him.\u201d We became great friends, and \u201cJones\u201d became better known as David Bowie. David used to tell a story about seeing me on Top of the Pops with the Herd and going: \u201cThat\u2019s Peter! Why isn\u2019t he in school?\u201d\n\nI also played guitar in Humble Pie with Steve Marriott from the Small Faces, but wanted to lead my own band and do some singing. After my first three solo albums flopped, I was convinced the record company were about to drop me.\n\nI had three weeks off, so took my guitar to Nassau in the Bahamas to write another album, knowing it was probably make or break. I bumped into Alvin Lee from Ten Years After at the airport and thought: \u201cI won\u2019t get any work done now.\u201d I don\u2019t remember anything about the next two weeks, but after Alvin left I thought: \u201cI\u2019ve got a week left to write the album.\u201d\n\nThe next day I messed around with my acoustic and in about 20 minutes came up with the chords that became Show Me the Way. I had some lunch and a little swim and under a palm tree I then wrote Baby I Love Your Way. Both songs are about the girlfriend I was about to start living with. With Baby I Love Your Way, the sun was setting, so I wrote: \u201cThe shadows grow so long before my eyes.\u201d The moonlight brought the fireflies out, so they went into the song, too.\n\nWhen we recorded it, the drummer, John Siomos, said: \u201cThis is one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d But the album [Frampton] flopped. Everything turned around after we recorded a live album in San Francisco, our first big headline show. I was so nervous I forgot that it was being recorded, but to my surprise 8,000 people were going nuts for us. The band were on fire. I really meant what I was singing, and the inspiration of so many people screaming at us meant we really captured something. The live versions of Show Me the Way and Baby I Love Your Way became massive hits, and Frampton Comes Alive! was soon the best-selling live album of all time.\n\nChris Kimsey, engineer, producer\n\nWe recorded the studio version of Baby I Love Your Way in a castle in Gloucestershire, using Ronnie Lane\u2019s mobile studio. The idea was to get away from London and the label, not that they interfered much. It was more a manor with a few turrets than a full-on medieval castle, so not too goth, but dank and miserable. There were balls and chains and armour.\n\nQuite often when anyone\u2019s under pressure in music, you find that something special happens very quickly. Peter was listening to a lot of Stevie Wonder and was impressed that Stevie played every instrument on his records, so Peter did that, too \u2013 everything except the drums, and he\u2019s a really good drummer!\n\nThe live version is more stripped down, faster, with more electric guitar. Peter sings his heart out. He wasn\u2019t really noted as a singer so he wanted to make his mark, and he succeeded. The energy of the live album feels as if there\u2019s sunshine on it \u2013 Big Mountain kept that feel for their reggae cover version \u2013 whereas on our initial album version it was probably pissing it down with rain.\n\nPeople always ask me whether the live album was overdubbed. It was all live apart from a keyboard part we had to fix because a lead came out on stage. Frampton Comes Alive! was never intended to be a double album. Peter\u2019s manager went: \u201cNobody will want to listen to the whole gig.\u201d But, when A&M Records owner Jerry Moss came down to listen, he said: \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d So we had to go back in and mix the rest. After the live album came out, Peter couldn\u2019t go out on his own because he\u2019d get mobbed. In New York, girls would be jumping on him \u2013 not just a few but loads of them \u2013 trying to rip his clothes off. It was insane.\n\n\u2022 Peter Frampton\u2019s new album, All Blues, is out now. His farewell tour of the US ends on 12 October.", "description": "\u2018There were 8,000 people going nuts for us in San Francisco. The band were on fire.
