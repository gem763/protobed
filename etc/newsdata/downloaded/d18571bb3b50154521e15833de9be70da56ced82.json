REUTERS/Hamad l Mohammed/File Photo\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 strikes on two Saudi Aramco oil plants that initially halved the country\u2019s crude output. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement has claimed responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe UK is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks. We think it very likely indeed that Iran was indeed responsible,\u201d Johnson told reporters on a plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n\u201cWe will be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether Britain would rule out military action, Johnson said it would be closely watching a proposal by the United States to do more to help defend Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cClearly if we are asked, either by the Saudis or by the Americans, to have a role then we will consider in what way we could be useful,\u201d he said.\n\nIran said Britain should stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia instead of accusing Tehran.\n\n\u201cThe (British) government ... should take action to stop selling deadly weapons to Saudi Arabia, which is the request of many people in the world, and release themselves from accusations of committing war crimes against the people of Yemen,\u201d Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency.\n\nThe United States is aiming to avoid war with Iran and additional troops ordered to be deployed in the Gulf region are for \u201cdeterrence and defense\u201d, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.\n\nJohnson said he would be discussing Iran\u2019s actions in the region with President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. meeting, as well as pushing for the release of several dual national Iranians who he said were being held \u201cillegally and unfairly\u201d.\n\nA British government official said the Houthi\u2019s claim of responsibility was \u201cimplausible\u201d because the scale, sophistication and range of the attack on the Saudi oil facilities was inconsistent with their capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe sophistication points very, very firmly to Iranian involvement and I think it is implausible that that wouldn\u2019t have been authorized by the Iranian government,\u201d the official said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also said it was very likely Iran was responsible for the attack.\n\n\u201cUK believes it is very likely that Iran was responsible for the outrageous, unlawful attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Raab said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe will work with our international partners on a robust diplomatic response and for stability in the region.\u201d", "description": "Britain believes it is very likely Iran was behind an attack on Saudi oil facilities and London will work with the United States and European allies to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432884077&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0IK", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
