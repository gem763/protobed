The latest report from the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2014a group made up of scientists from 195 countries\u2014says that keeping the Earth from warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius will require not only reducing emissions, but removing carbon that is already in the atmosphere. The most surefire way to do that, according to the IPCC, is through reforestation and ecosystem restoration. \u201cIt\u2019s the only technology that\u2019s currently available to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at scale,\u201d ecologist Will Turner recently told Mashable. (Though carbon-removal technologies have been experimented with, none are yet reliable or deployable on a massive scale.)\n\n\n\nHow much carbon needs to be removed? \u201cThe low-end IPCC estimate requires pulling 100 gigatons of carbon dioxide removal by 2100, roughly double the amount that humanity produces in a year today,\u201d Vox reported last year. \u201cThe high-end estimate is 1,000 gigatons, effectively forcing humanity to undo 20 years of global greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Those goals can be met, at least in part, through reforestation. According to Vox, a study published last month in the journal Science found that \u201cletting saplings regrow on land where forests have been cleared would increase global forested area by one-third and remove 205 billion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe Earth, as a whole, has been losing its forests at a steady rate over the last three decades\u2014from 41.2 million square kilometers in 1990 to 39.9 million square kilometers in 2016, according to the World Bank. That\u2019s a net loss of forests equivalent to the size of Peru, or approximately twice the size of Texas. That number would be a lot higher, though, if it weren\u2019t for other countries\u2019 efforts to plant trees. China and India, notably, have made concerted efforts to increase their amount of forested land.\n\nThe increase in tree cover in those countries, however, \u201cdoes not offset the damage from loss of natural vegetation in tropical regions, such as Brazil and Indonesia,\u201d according to NASA. That\u2019s partly because newer trees don\u2019t provide nearly as big a climate benefit as older trees; according to one study published in 2017 and reported on by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, \u201cAlmost 70 percent of all the carbon stored in trees is accumulated in the last half of their lives.\u201d\n\nThere are several caveats to reforestation as a climate solution. Not just any trees will do; some consume more water than others. And it\u2019s not as though agricultural land can simply be replaced with forests, thereby disrupting the food supply and putting farmers out of work. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be like tending a garden,\u201d World Resources Institute Senior Fellow Frances Seymour told Mashable. Trees also take a really long time to grow, and mature forests absorb far more carbon than young ones. So reforestation isn\u2019t a silver bullet solution to tackling climate change; it has to be paired with aggressive emissions reductions\u2014the kind that can only come from a worldwide phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\n", "description": "Aggressive reforestation will be required to stem climate change\u2014and that includes the United States.", "authors": ["Emily Atkin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/406d60387510ed5f81ee5ee055b3f66fd5520633.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
