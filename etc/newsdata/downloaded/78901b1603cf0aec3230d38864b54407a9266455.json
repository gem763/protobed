Applewhite/AP\n\nA politically motivated ouster led to the resignation of Mike Pompeo's top deputy\n\nPerhaps the most significant example of this was Yovanovitch's dismissal.\n\nShe was abruptly recalled from her position in May after a tumultuous stint that involved frequent clashes with Giuliani.\n\nTheir main disagreement stemmed from her refusal to facilitate the former New York mayor's efforts to use official channels to push the Ukrainian government to dig up damaging information on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\"She refused to allow her embassy to be dragged into some sort of effort to concoct dirt for political purposes,\" a former official told The Guardian.\n\nWhat Yovanovitch said\n\nYovanovitch testified to Congress last week that she was removed based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\" and that the campaign against her was spearheaded by Trump and Giuliani beginning last spring.\n\nShe also testified that a senior State Department official told her she was being recalled despite the fact that she had \"done nothing wrong.\"\n\nYovanovitch's account has been corroborated by several other officials who testified to Congress.\n\nWhat Fiona Hill said\n\nHill, who served as the White House's senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, praised Yovanovitch when she appeared before lawmakers on Friday.\n\nThe New York Times reported, moreover, that Hill saw Yovanovitch's removal as an abuse of the system.\n\nHill also described how Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine were perceived within the White House, at one point telling lawmakers that former national security adviser John Bolton was so alarmed that he instructed Hill to tell a top White House lawyer he was not involved in the \"drug deal\" being \"cooked up\" in Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, a former top deputy to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the stunning revelation to congressional investigators that Yovanovitch's ouster was the catalyst for his resignation last week.\n\nWhat Michael McKinley said\n\nMcKinley, who served as one of Pompeo's senior advisers, testified that career diplomats were routinely mistreated and sidelined within the department for political reasons.\n\nHe said Yovanovitch's dismissal was the last straw for him.\n\nAccording to a copy of his opening remarks that was obtained by The Times , McKinley testified that after learning last month that Trump slammed Yovanovitch as being \"bad news\" during a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, he tried to get senior State Department officials to publicly defend Yovanovitch for her \"professionalism and courage.\"\n\nMcKinley said his request garnered no significant response from the agency, no statement was issued, and he ultimately decided to resign.\n\nRead more: FBI officials were 'rattled' and 'blindsided' by Trump's call for Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Joe Biden\n\nKurt Volker More", "description": "Trump and Giuliani used the State Department to circumvent career diplomats and policy experts and carry out a shadow foreign-policy agenda.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0ijZuqCMLkOk8uhSZya_wg--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/1fc663ce0c36986f128882c5accd5dc9", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
