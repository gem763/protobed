Aaron Bunch\n\nThe oil and gas producer's quarterly update on Thursday also reiterated a target for a final go-ahead on its Senegalese oil project before the end of the year although funding and cost reviews have yet to be completed.\n\n\"Our major growth projects are progressing well towards key decision points,\" chief executive Peter Coleman said as Woodside posted a bigger-than-expected 44 per cent jump in production in the September quarter from the June period when output was reduced by maintenance work at the Pluto LNG plant.\n\nOutput surged to 24.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, helped by record production at Pluto and the start-up of the Greater Enfield oil project off WA. The figure beat estimates by UBS and RBC Capital Markets.\n\nSales jumped 58 per cent from the June quarter to $US1.16 billion ($1.72 billion), despite lower crude oil prices, and were marginally ahead of the year-earlier quarter.", "description": "The oil and gas producer is still seeking to nut out the details of gas processing deals for Browse and Scarborough gas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ddb63975accb106af234a030dbc54880fca98abc", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
