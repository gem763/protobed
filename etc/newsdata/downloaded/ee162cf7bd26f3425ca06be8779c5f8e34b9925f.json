She may not have used Gabbard's name, but she said that one candidate was \"a favorite of the Russians,\" implied that she's an asset, and said that the candidate (clearly Gabbard), was prepping for a third-party spoiler run.\n\nShe may be right on the last point, and one can hope that this takes some of the wind out of Gabbard's third-party sails, if she is indeed mulling such a thing. Still, it's not great for American democracy when former secretaries of state are running around accusing congresswomen of working for the Russians.\n\nThe pedants among the pundits will point out that Clinton didn't say Gabbard was working for the Russians, that there's a difference between being an agent and being an asset. An asset is simply someone the Russians think they can compromise or exploit for their benefit, and on that front, Gabbard may fit the bill.\n\nShe uses Kremlin talking points on Syria, repeating the RT-approved phrase \"regime change war\" nine times in the last Democratic debate.", "description": "Yes, Clinton erred in her phrasing, implying that the Hawaii congresswoman is a Russia favorite, writes Jill Filipovic. But the central message -- that Gabbard is unqualified for the presidency, and a loose cannon whose political ambitions are amplified by shady operators -- holds true.", "authors": ["Jill Filipovic"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191015215102-tulsi-gabbard-debate-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
