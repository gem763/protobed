The latest version of the company\u2019s wildly popular entry-level smart speaker has been rebranded the Nest Home Mini, in keeping with the branding refresh of its smart home offerings. The new version of the device looks a lot like its predecessor, but features a number of internal upgrades.\n\nChief among the changes are improved sound and built-in machine learning that lets the device adapt power based on usage. The new version of the Mini smart speaker also doubles as an intercom and a conferencing speaker, so users can call the device directly, using Duo.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1897350,1897349,1897348,1897347\"]\n\nThe most fun addition here, however, is the wall mount.

The Nest Mini\u2019s familiar fabric covering is made using recycled bottles, as noted earlier in today\u2019s event, in keeping with the company\u2019s increased focus on sustainability.\n\nThe new Mini arrives October 22, priced at tempting $49 \u2014 same as its briskly selling predecessor.
