And he chose to put the team first.\n\n\u201c[My wife] Laurel and I are in a great spot, and in the past, I\u2019ve had increases in my contract,\u201d Bennett said in a statement. \u201cI have more than enough, and if there are ways that this can help out the athletic department, the other programs and coaches, by not tying up so much [in men\u2019s basketball], that\u2019s my desire.\u201d\n\nHe and his wife have also pledged $500,000 toward a career development program for current and former UVA men\u2019s basketball players. The move scored plenty of praise online (and some confusion with the legendary singer Tony Bennett).\n\nWhoa. #UVA Tony Bennett\n\nTurns down raise and asked to provide raises to his staff\n\n\n\nThen\n\n\n\nDonates $500K to school for a career development program to assist athletes that go pro in something other then their sport\n\n\n\nPretty amazing stuff a coach putting others infront of himself \u2014 matt pierce (@tx_pierce) September 16, 2019\n\nReading this morning about Tony Bennett turning down a raise so that others could have more, I am reminded of this interview, and specifically this line about humility:\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s not thinking less of yourself, it\u2019s thinking of yourself less.\" https://t.co/0Vt30DtWmD \u2014 Mike Couzens (@MikeCouzens) September 16, 2019\n\nReally need Twitter to add a \"Don't worry, not dead\" subtitle under trending celebrities. For the record, Tony Bennett is not dead. Christie Brinkley is not dead and BB King died a few years ago \u2014 Mearn (@mearn) September 16, 2019\n\nGranted, turning down this raise isn\u2019t hurting Bennett too badly. He earns a base salary of $500,000 a year, the Washington Post reported, and he takes home an additional $2.5 million in supplemental income as part of a contract modification retroactive to July 1. He also scores performance incentives, such as a $400,000 bonus for winning the national championship, which bumped his compensation to $1.175 million last season. And he extended his contract for another year, meaning he will remain the Cavs\u2019 coach through 2027.\n\nRelated: Some companies give bonuses. These companies grant wishes\n\nHe\u2019s not the only boss to take a pay cut for his employees \u2014 which has been good for business, in some cases. Dan Price, the CEO of Seattle payment-processing firm Gravity Payments, made headlines in 2015 when he cut 90% of his $1 million salary to ensure his employees all made a minimum \u201cliving wage\u201d of at least $70,000. Last year, Gravity said it had 80% more clients than when the experiment started, and the company\u2019s average worker took home $103,000.\n\nFive years ago, U.S. health-care services company CareCentrix was losing 30% to 40% of its employees a year. So it froze the salaries of 20 executives to raise the minimum pay of its entry-level employees from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour (under $16,000 a year) to $15 an hour ($34,000 a year). It reports that its business has tripled since then, and the company\u2019s base pay is now approaching $16.50 an hour. And last December, the CEO of Sturgis Hospital in Michigan took a 10% pay cut to boost the facility\u2019s finances.\n\nBut this move is still an exception to the rule in the CEO playbook. In fact, the CEOs at S&P 500 SPX, -0.31% companies pocketed a 7% raise last year, on average, or roughly $800,000 extra, as their median pay rose to $12 million in 2018, including salary, stock and other compensation. It would take 158 years for the typical worker at most big companies to make what their CEO did in 2018.", "description": "Virginia Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett is the exception.
