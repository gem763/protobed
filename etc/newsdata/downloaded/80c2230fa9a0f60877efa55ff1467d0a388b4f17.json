It\u2019s the most wonderful time of year \u2013 not Christmas, fuck that. LOVE ISLAND RECAP TIME! The bit where I get to write 5,000 words a day about my favourite show full of trash humans who fight over other trash humans and then win 50,000 before breaking up over text.\n\nThe first episode is always boring as fuck, and nothing new here \u2013 boring as fuck. But! We still got to meet all the Insta-famous folks, so it\u2019s worth a recap regardless. Also you probably didn\u2019t watch bc it started at 8.45pm, an ungodly time which I hope won\u2019t be repeated every day forever.\n\nAnyway let\u2019s get into it. We open with Sophie telling us some sort of \u201ctime for love\u201d shit, before some brief skits of each contestant in their IRL jobs. We\u2019ve got Jessie getting a text and whipping her bartending shirt off to expose a bikini, Adam throwing a packet of plaster onto the floor which seems really dangerous but also perfectly dramatic, and Cartier (how is this her real name, HOW) literally sitting in what looks like a Catholic mass.\n\nThe first into the house are Cartier (I still can\u2019t) and Vanessa. They are absolutely beside themselves with how \u201cstunning\u201d the villa is. Which is alarming considering it has hot pink doors like the fucking Barbie mansion except not remotely as cool.\n\nThey sit down for a champers by the ocean, and guys \u2013 I have no idea why considering we all should have learned from the sludgy cesspit that was the Bachelor In Paradise Australia situation but we are in Fiji, and once again it seems it\u2019s a terrible time of year for a holiday because the weather is basically the squall from that movie where the guy is on the boat and it gets hit by the giant wave. I did try Googling this but no luck. Just work it out.\n\nThe girls get their little show reel bit \u2013 Vanessa is French and speaks French, and also is smart you guys because she studied Finance/Economics at Uni. I just have a feeling that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you across-the-board brilliant with a giant brain, but sure. Cartier (why, did her parents just really love those love bracelets) is a born-again Christian who loves Jesus.\n\nCartier (AGH) turns a bit serial killer and is telling Vanessa over and over how beautiful she is. Vanessa seems uncomfortable about it towards the end, but luckily new gal Cynthia rocks up. She\u2019s a model and has never had a boyfriend. That\u2019s all she tells us. Also I need to note here that they keep shoving these people in a blue/pink ball pit that has no connection whatsoever to anything. Why? Why are we in a ball pit?\n\nAnyway then it\u2019s time to meet Jessie, who is SUPER fucking keen to be here. Like, aggressively keen. I\u2019m a bit scared. She also really likes her boobs because she made them herself. You know what, fair enough.\n\nAnother person who is so fucking pumped to be here she almost jettisoned off the Jeep she rode in on is Cassie. Also in a ball pit.\n\nShe\u2019s an EA. This will come into play later. Anyway! Places to be people to do, it\u2019s time for Sophie Monk to cruise on in and interrogate the women on what they\u2019re looking for. Vanessa likes bad boys but also mummy\u2019s boys \u2013 she explains that she\u2019s a magnet for shit dudes (honey, aren\u2019t we all) and wants a nice one to settle down with.\n\nCartier tells everyone she\u2019s the PERFECT girlfriend because she will cook, clean and look after her man. Everyone seems alarmed which is reassuring, at least we\u2019ve got some feminists up in here.\n\nThen it\u2019s time to line them all up and wheel out men for them to select. I love this bit so much. The first guy out is the WOOOOOOOOORST! His name is Maurice and he\u2019s basically obsessed with \u201chot\u201d women.\n\nLook at this fuckwit:\n\nMy friend Jo goes \u201cwow, everyone looks really flammable don\u2019t they\u201d which really should be the tagline for this show. The amount of spray-on foundation and hair gel that goes into these people, my god.\n\nNo one walks forward for him, probably because he says \u201cI want adventure, excitement and a hell of a lot of beauty\u201d. So he gets to pick, and he chooses Jessie because she has, among other physical-only qualities, \u201can incredible complexion\u201d. Honestly, this fucking guy. Like I know you haven\u2019t really met them yet but can you not be creepily specific about their physical attributes like they\u2019re store mannequins?\n\nNext we have Gerard, who concerningly likes to do everything naked but while wearing this apron:\n\nBut also seems less obsessed with himself and has a whole training business where he helps people with disabilities keep fit, which is wholesome and nice. I mean he could still be a cunt but it\u2019s a good start.\n\nCartier (FUCKING HELL) steps forward, and Gerard seems to not mind she\u2019s named after a jewellery store. They couple up. Next we have Adam, a plasterer from the GC.\n\nHe has a weird vibe, he\u2019s all \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone with a spark, someone edgy, someone who can put up with me\u201d which is like\u2026 well, Sophie nails it by asking if he\u2019s a bit \u201ccranky-pants\u201d and he says it depends on which side of the bed he wakes up on. Dude, now is not the time to talk about your man-baby tantrums.\n\nNaturally no one wants to couple up with a tantrum-thrower, so Adam gets to pick and he selects Vanessa, who looks fucking thrilled about it:\n\nNext we have my personal obsession \u2013 the international DJ, Sam. You know how I said Maurice sucked? Sam is like, more subtly sucky because you can just tell he froths himself hard. He\u2019s all \u201cI\u2019ve DJed for Justin Bieber and Drake\u201d and has been single for 7 years because he\u2019s too picky and travels all the time. IDK you have to watch to get it but the dude just LOVES HIMSELF.\n\nVanessa steps forward with the excuse \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just felt something there\u201d but I think what she meant was \u201cI know this guy is an international DJ and I want to be a DJ groupie and maybe meet Calvin Harris, then dump this guy for him\u201d.\n\nEven Sam and Sophie look a bit suss.\n\nAnyway, Vanessa and Sam couple up with leaves Adam sitting like a Nigel over on a settee. Then Matthew walks in \u2013 he\u2019s a model but also\u2026 a wrestler? It\u2019s a bit of a vibe until he starts going on about the plethora of women he\u2019s \u201cspent time with\u201d and pouting for the camera.\n\nCynthia steps forward, but Matthew chooses Vanessa. Apparently everyone has lost their damn minds over the woman, and naturally she\u2019s fucking loving it but also doing that Taylor Swift \u201cwhat, me!?\u201d thing.\n\nThen Adam and Sam are wheeled back out to make decisions on who they wanna couple up with. Adam gets to go first because he was there first, and Sam\u2019s all \u201cSTITCH UP! WHAT A STITCH UP!\u201d which is kinda fucking rude considering there\u2019s two women left and it implies one is not good.\n\nTurns out the \u201cnot good\u201d one to these douchelords is Cynthia, which has vibes of racism and fuckwittery but look, maybe the show edited out some bit where she like, said she enjoys torturing kittens. Let\u2019s hope so.\n\nThe final couples are Jessie/Maurice, Cartier (no)/Gerard, Vanessa/Matthew, Cassie/Adam and Cynthia/Sam. This will not last, obviously.\n\nAnyway we spend some boring time watching these people get to know each other by saying things that are fundamentally unhinged-levels of stupid. Like Adam being all \u201cwhat\u2019s an EA\u201d to Cassie, who laughs like a drain. Why? It\u2019s not funny? In brilliant areas, Cartier tells Gerard she likes Nickelback which is such a fucking mood and a half \u2013 Nickelback rule and I won\u2019t deny it.\n\nAlso, Jessie is trying to think of the word \u201ccharismatic\u201d at one point, and Maurice says \u201ckrismatic\u201d, and she genuinely goes \u201cYES! KRISMATIC! THAT\u2019S IT!\u201d. Hahahahahaha fuck this show is good.\n\nWe also had Matthew telling the camera he\u2019s really happy he coupled up with Vanessa, because two other guys wanted her but he got her. Yeah ok.\n\nAnyway then we have the first party night, and it\u2019s all pretty boring except that Jessie and Maurice are already pashing, and Cynthia is attracted to Maurice and tells him but he\u2019s like no thank you.\n\nThen everyone goes to bed and there\u2019s a bit of light petting action, especially from Matthew/Vanessa.\n\nThe it\u2019s morning and Gerard is really trying to make that nude apron happen.\n\nThere\u2019s more boring talk, the only juice is that Gerard is a bit off Cartier (blegh) because she\u2019s a bit young for him. Not at all because she\u2019s in love with Jesus, nope, no way.\n\nFINALLY, something spicy happens. At the second party, Eoghan walks in \u2013 this giant Irish guy with sexy hair. Everyone wants a piece of the Eoghan pie, including Vanessa who is now bored of Matthew, and Cartier (fuck).\n\nEveryone plays truth or dare but it\u2019s mainly a game I\u2019ll call \u201cEveryone Kiss Eoghan\u201d.\n\nIt gets fucking weirder when Eoghan for some reason is made to strip down to his Reg Grundies?\n\nAnyway that\u2019s basically it, all the boys hate him naturally. Can\u2019t wait to see who abandons their partner in record time for a chance at dry humping the Irish Jesus.
