One version is lined with a thin film of recycled PET plastic to keep beer from seeping out. The other uses a bio-based lining. The prototypes will be used to test the linings.\n\nFor Carlsberg, the innovation is a way to lower its impact on the environment and present consumers with an interesting new option.\n\nFiber bottles are better for the environment than aluminum or glass because they are sourced in a sustainable way, and because the material has a \"very low impact on production process,\" explained Myriam Shingleton, vice president of group development for Carlsberg.\n\nCarlsberg's latest paper bottle prototype.\n\n\"The energy and efficiency of the technology that we're using\" reduce carbon emissions compared to other production processes, she said.", "description": "Carlsberg is getting closer to its goal of selling beer in paper bottles.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191010142156-01-carlsberg-green-fibre-bottle-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
