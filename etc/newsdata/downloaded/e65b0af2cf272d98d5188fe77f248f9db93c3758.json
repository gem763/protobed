It's also expected to be a major awards contender.\n\nThe film is a character study of how Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian and clown-for-hire, becomes the classic Batman nemesis.\n\nThe Aurora theater was remodeled and renamed after the 2012 shooting that also wounded 58 people. James Holmes was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.", "description": "Law enforcement authorities are concerned the film's plot may inspire someone to commit a mass shooting", "authors": ["Barry Petersen"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/1025418f-5f11-4da8-a628-24e752afe2ee/thumbnail/1200x630g2/0172c8ce1cf239a7d8c6e4bde10feb01/joaquin-phoenix-joker-movie-trailer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
