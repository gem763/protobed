He is slated to go on trial for terrorism in October but has not been fitted with an electronic tag.\n\nUkrainian nationalists later protested with road flares outside the court, calling it a \u201cterrorist accomplice\u201d and \u201cbranch of the FSB\u201d.\n\nMr Tsemakh reportedly commanded anti-aircraft defences in the town of Snizhne when a Buk missile fired from the area brought down MH17 in July 2014, killing 298, including 10 Britons.\n\nThe Dutch-led joint investigative team has said the Russian military deployed the Buk launcher to eastern Ukraine, findings denied by Moscow, and charged three Russians and a Ukrainian with murder in June. Court proceedings are scheduled for March.\n\nNationalists protest outside the court after Mr Tsemakh was released Credit: Sergii Kharchenko/EPA-EFE/REX More\n\nDiscussing the downing of MH17 in a 2015 Russian nationalist video interview, Mr Tsemakh said that he \u201cgot that guy out\u201d and \u201chid\u201d something. Although the exact word was bleeped out, many believe that he was saying he had hid the \u201cBuk\u201d after the plane was shot down.\n\nRumours began appearing in recent weeks that Mr Tsemakh could be included in the prisoner exchange that Moscow and Kiev have been negotiating since Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Mr Putin in July.\n\nA Russian newspaper quoted sources on Thursday as saying that Moscow demanded Mr Tsemakh in exchange for freeing Crimean director and Amnesty International prisoner of conscience Oleg Sentsov.\n\nIf true, that would be an unusual level of interest by Moscow in the fate of a foreign national, as Mr Tsemakh is a Ukrainian citizen, and suggest it does not want him to be questioned.\n\nIn a letter to Mr Zelenskiy on Wednesday, 40 MEPs including Catherine Rowett of the United Kingdom opposed Russia's alleged requests to trade for Mr Tsemakh, calling him a \u201ckey suspect\u201d in the MH17 investigation who should testify in the case.\n\nDutch chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said in a leaked letter to his Ukrainian counterparts last week that Mr Tsemakh's status as a suspect meant that \u201ckeeping him available for (further) questioning by the joint investigation team is therefore of the utmost importance\u201d.\n\nA spokeswoman for the team told media on Thursday that it wanted him to remain in Ukraine, as it would be difficult to question him if he was sent to Russia.\n\nVladimir Putin speaks at a forum in Vladivostok on Thursday Credit: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg More", "description": "A Kiev court has released a \u201ckey suspect\u201d in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 shortly before Vladimir Putin said prisoner swap negotiations with Ukraine were in their final stages, raising fears among European politicians that the man will be sent to Russia.
