Below are some of the sentiments shared by CEOs and health care providers about the possibility of an expanded Medicare system.\n\nMerck (MRK) CEO Kenneth Frazier:\n\nKenneth Frazier headshot, as Merck pharmaceutical company Chairman of the board, president, and CEO, graphic element on gray More\n\n\u201cI happen to think that Medicare has an important role to play in health care. I also think that the private sector has an important role to play in health care.I think at the end of the day, the U.S. medical system has its challenges, but I think its still the best medical system in the world, and I would not like to see us try to wholesale change the system by saying we\u2019re going to give Medicare for everybody and thereby take away people\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nKaiser Permanente CEO Brandon Tyson:\n\nKaiser Permanente Bernard J.

Do we continue to focus only on the coverage side, or do we in fact really start to look at, as an industry, what the cost of care is and how we can deal with the inefficiencies of care, the wide variations of practices, known improved practices that aren\u2019t implemented in the entire ecosystem. So those are the bigger issues that I\u2019m worried about, rather than trying to figure out how now to take all the things we have in place for coverage already\u2014 private insurance and government sponsored programs\u2014in which 90 percent of Americans are covered under that, blow that up, and spend the time working through that, versus really focusing on the affordability of care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan G.

I do come from the for-profit world, before I came into the not-for-profit world so I can sort of understand both sides. I believe that there is an onus of responsibility of making sure that people can get insurance, that people can get care. We see it all the time where people are underinsured or have no insurance whatsoever, and we\u2019re an organization that has a little bit of heft but we certainly don\u2019t have the ability to take care of all the people out there that need help when they get a diagnosis of breast cancer.\u201d", "description": "Given soaring health care costs and the upcoming general election in 2020, the debate over \u201cMedicare for All\u201d has become nearly possible to avoid.", "authors": ["Anjalee Khemlani", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IL5m3EjmPAsRx3vcNFV_OA--~B/aD0yMzI3O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6b1cf730-ec50-11e9-bfbb-b36ec1c797d0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
