As part of this process, we take into account the interest of borrowers, depositors and shareholders who provide the equity that enables us to operate.\"\n\nA second chance for banks\n\nMr Hartzer said banks also needed to make reasonable profits.\n\n\"This not only supports shareholder investment; it also underpins prudential stability, and our debt rating,'' he said.\n\n\"Westpac must also retain its AA rating.\n\nIf there's ever been an environment in which it's easier for people to leave, then it's now. \u2014 Wayne Swan\n\n\"This rating allows the bank to import funding at more reasonable cost from international investors. To lose it would increase the cost of our wholesale funding, which would inevitably lead to higher interest rates for our borrowers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said the inquiry would provide the bank with a second chance to explain how it arrived at difficult pricing decisions and would help restore public confidence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThere is cynicism in the broader community about interest rates for home loans. We know we have not done a good job in explaining our position and we will be working hard to ensure this process delivers results,\u201d he said.\n\nNAB chief customer officer and retail bank boss Mike Baird also welcomed the opportunity to present the bank's case, saying the record low-interest rate environment was critical to understanding how the banks responded to cuts to the cash rate, taking into account both borrowers and depositors.\n\nAfter initially rejecting calls for an inquiry when the RBA cut rates in early October \u2013 for the third time this year, Mr Frydenberg called in the ACCC over the weekend.\n\nIt will examine the refusal of the banks to pass on to borrowers the three rate cuts in full, explore the removal of impediments to people switching banks, and look at the \"loyalty tax'' in which long-term customers pay higher rates of interest compared with the rates used to attract new customers.\n\n'Merry dance'\n\n\"The Australian public is sick and tired of the merry dance where the RBA has cut rates three times in recent months, the government and the RBA itself have called on the banks to pass them on, and the banks have just ignored that advice and that call,'' Mr Frydenberg said.\n\nHowever, he ruled out subjecting the banks to the forced divestment rules about to be applied to the electricity sector and used as a last resort in the case of anti-competitive conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also ruled out legislation to force banks to pass on rate cuts in full, because banking was a market operation and \"we want that market to operate more effectively\".\n\nA senior government source also scotched the idea of imposing on banks a default interest rate they must offer as an option, similar to the default power price energy companies have been forced to adopt as a consequence of them hitting long-term customers with a loyalty tax.\n\nMr Frydenberg concurred with the bank chiefs, saying they should treat the inquiry as a \"circuit breaker\".\n\nHe rang the big four CEOs on Sunday and \"told them that this\n\ncould actually help clear the air and this was an opportunity for them to explain to the regulator why they haven\u2019t been passing on the rate cuts in full and how they balance the competing needs of shareholders and customers, and depositors and borrowers''.\n\n\"But, at the same time, they\u2019re defending their patch and we\u2019ll continue to get the best possible deal for the consumer.\"\n\nSwitching option\n\nHe said \"the key\" outcome was \"more competition, more transparency and empowering consumers to take their business to the bank that offers them the best possible deal\".\n\n\"What we\u2019ve seen so far hasn\u2019t been good enough,'' he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2010, the then Labor government released a package of measures designed to make the smaller lenders more competitive and to make it easier for people to switch banks. The measures included banning exit fees and examining account portability.\n\nWayne Swan, who was treasurer at the time, said that apart from the consumer data rights legislation that the government was implementing, there was not much that could be done\n\nHe suggested that the government run an advertising campaign encouraging disgruntled consumers to switch banks and showing how it could be done.\n\n\"Now it is in the hands of consumers,'' he said.\n\n\"If there's ever been an environment in which it's easier for people to leave, then it's now.''\n\nAt the time he was fighting the banks, Mr Swan closed all his accounts with a big bank and joined a credit union \u2013 he remains with them today.\n\nACCC chairman Rod Sims, who has been critical of the banks, especially over the loyalty tax, would not speculate on what he may or may not recommend.\n\nLike Mr Frydenberg, he said the banks had an opportunity to account for themselves.\n\n\"Let's just get the facts on the table,'' he said. \"All the information has never been available before. I'm not looking beyond that.\"", "description": "Westpac has warned that a political pile-on could result in the loss of its AA credit rating, as the government plays down expectations of its ACCC inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2932%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_418%2C$y_6/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6ee82d76e8106d8f4b824db7058338acb3c50417", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
