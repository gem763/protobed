He has tried to use the office of the presidency to pressure foreign governments to investigate a political opponent, a clear abuse of power.\n\nOn Thursday, a reporter asked the president, \u201cWhat exactly did you hope the Ukrainian president would do about the Bidens?\u201d Trump\u2019s answer was stunning \u2014 and obvious at the same time. He replied, \u201cI think if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation. \u2026 They should investigate the Bidens. \u2026 China likewise should start an investigation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor those who have been paying close attention, this is, indeed, the exact thing Republicans have spent days denying that Trump asked in his July phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, though the president has upped the ante by adding a request to China to investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE and his son.\n\nA Monmouth University poll released this week found that only 40 percent of Republicans believe Trump mentioned Biden on the call with the Ukrainian president. What will they say now?\n\nThe president is his own worst enemy \u2014 and I, for one, am thankful for it. He strikes a hole in the heart of any decent defense of his behavior on a regular basis. There have been no breaches in whistleblower protocol, no matter what accusations the president hurls at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) or the whistleblower himself.\n\nAccording to guidance on \u201cprotected disclosures\u201d from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), communication of urgent concern can go to congressional intelligence committees. There is bipartisan consensus on this, with spokespeople for Sens. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrLawyers express concern for whistleblower's safety GOP battens down the hatches after release of Trump whistleblower complaint House Intel member calls whistleblower complaint 'deeply disturbing' MORE (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerIran-linked group targeted email accounts for US presidential campaign, government officials Hillicon Valley: Clapper praises whistleblower complaint | Senators urge social media giants to take action against 'deepfakes' | Tim Cook asks Supreme Court to protect DACA | Harris pushes Twitter to suspend Trump Senators urge social media companies to take action against 'deepfake' videos MORE (D-Va.) saying that it would be standard practice for the \u201cintelligence committee to tell a potential whistleblower to hire counsel and file a complaint with an agency IG or the IC IG.\u201d\n\nThere goes that argument. And with news trickling out about congressional testimony by Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerWhite House struggles to contain Ukraine fallout Gordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony MORE, the former special envoy to Ukraine \u2014 which included a text message from Bill Taylor, the former top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, that read, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance to help with a political campaign\u201d \u2014 the president\u2019s story will continue to look more and more ridiculous. (The text message exchange reveals pushback on that assertion and then a suggestion to take the conversation offline.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmericans are taking note.\n\nFor those following public opinion on the impeachment issue, a new poll from USA Today and Ipsos finds that 45 percent of Americans support impeaching Trump, compared to 38 percent who oppose it. Critically, 44 percent support the Senate removing Trump from office, and 35 percent oppose it. The rise in support for removing Trump from office represents a shift in attitude toward impeachment from independent voters. Nearly a third feel there is reliable evidence to impeach, compared to 34 percent who say no, but those independents support impeaching Trump by a 37-33 percent margin. Overall support for removing Trump is now up to 37 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed.\n\nThis is before any formal inquiry has even begun.\n\nIn the same poll, 52 percent say they believe Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Biden is an abuse of power, compared to just 21 percent who don\u2019t. The gap among independents is noteworthy: 45 percent see it as an abuse of power, versus 16 percent who don\u2019t. It\u2019s even close among Republicans, with 30 percent reporting that it\u2019s an abuse of power and 40 percent saying that it isn\u2019t. And 44 percent believe the whistleblower is a patriot, versus 21 percent who think he\u2019s a traitor.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious opening for the Biden campaign to make the president\u2019s attacks a central component of his campaign, especially with his emphasis on his own electability. There\u2019s a strong argument to be made that Trump is going after Biden because he sees him as his principal challenger, which time will bear out. Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders released from hospital after doctors say he had heart attack Saagar Enjeti claims media is protecting Biden Warren campaign fires senior official after allegations of 'inappropriate behavior' MORE\u2019s (D-Mass.) surge is very real.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the meantime, we need to see more statements from Biden like this one: \u201cWith his administration in free fall, Donald Trump is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations.\u201d\n\nWe must all be on the offensive to combat Trump\u2019s smears and his Republican defenders and to hold them to account. The impeachable offenses are all around us, and they\u2019re banking on the fact that we aren\u2019t paying attention or are consuming news from sources that do their dirty work.\n\nDon\u2019t let Trump\u2019s gamble that we\u2019re too dumb to see what he\u2019s doing pay off. We\u2019re better than that.\n\nJessica Tarlov is head of research at Bustle Digital Group and a Fox News contributor. She earned her Ph.D. at the London School of Economics in political science.
