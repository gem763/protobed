A draft on TV is never that exciting\n\nIn a Fantasy Premier League draft, each team gets 60 seconds per pick. So the 100 seconds that each team received - for obvious reasons of synergy - were rather a lot. And while a draft on TV is never that exciting - once the early rounds were done this looked a lot like an exercise in ranking county players - the time allocated for each pick meant that the event rumbled on for almost two and a half hours. A draft may be a more efficient way of distributing players than an auction like the Indian Premier League\u2019s - but it is also colder and not as much fun.\n\n2. Spinners are in demand - just like in T20\n\nBefore the first season of Twenty20 cricket, in 2003, it was assumed that spinners would be \u201chopeless,\u201d Surrey\u2019s captain Adam Hollioake later recalled. The idea was simple enough: a cocktail of batsmen attacking with alacrity and short boundaries would emasculate spinners.", "description": "The draft for the inaugural Hundred tournament took place on Sunday night, with eight franchises picking the very best short-format players.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/21/TELEMMGLPICT000213637113-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SK8fQrJGiSc0wsot5slw59Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
