Today, Judge Anita Farris ruled that the ordinance \u201cimpermissibly regulates firearms\u201d, which is a no-no under the state\u2019s firearms preemption law. The law, which was passed in 1983, leaves gun regulations in the hands of the state lawmakers to provide for a uniform standard across the state.\n\nThe city of Edmonds had sought to keep the ordinance in place while it appeals the judge\u2019s decision, but Farris rejected the argument by attorneys for the city. As the SAF notes:\n\nThe judge explained that part of the \u201cstay test\u201d requires showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits, and she saw no possibility of success for the city on appeal. She described it as \u201cnot a close call.\n\nCompare that to the actions of King County Judge Barbara Linde, who rejected a lawsuit challenging a similar storage law in Seattle after finding that the Second Amendment Foundation and the NRA did not have standing to file litigation. The gun groups are appealing that decision to the state Court of Appeals, and it\u2019s expected that the city of Edmonds will do the same after suffering their defeat in Snohomish County. This sets up the distinct possibility that the state Supreme Court will eventually weigh in on the matter, given the conflicts over the law in the lower courts.\n\nWashington State\u2019s firearms preemption law is crystal clear. The state \u201cfully occupies and preempts the entire field of firearms regulation within the boundaries of the state, including the registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge, and transportation of firearms, or any other element relating to firearms or parts thereof, including ammunition and reloader components.\u201d\n\nThat definition doesn\u2019t leave a lot of wiggle room for cities to pass their own gun control laws, which is why anti-gun activists are challenging preemption laws all over the country, from Pittsburgh to the Puget Sound. As the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action reported almost a year ago, the Washington State-based \u201cAlliance for Gun Responsibility\u201d is actively trying to repeal firearms preemption in the state, and we\u2019ve seen similar bills introduced in several other states, including Virginia.\n\nCongratulations to SAF, NRA, and the other plaintiffs in this case for an important win in the court system. The fight over firearms preemption is far from over in Washington State, but today\u2019s decision is a big deal in terms of defending firearms preemption law, and a great example of why these laws are needed in states throughout the nation.", "description": "A Washington State judge says the state's firearms preemption law prevents cities like Edmonds, Washington from passing its own local gun storage ordinance.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/54e3d4454354b114a6da837ec32f2a7f1038dfe35b57744873_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
