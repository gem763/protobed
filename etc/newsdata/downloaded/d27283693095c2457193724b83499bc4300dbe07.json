Pictured, different dinosaurs developed different internal mechanisms in order to keep cool\n\nTo do this, the research duo turned to the modern-day relatives of dinosaurs \u2014 birds and reptiles.\n\nIn these animals, evaporation of moisture in the nose, mouth, and eyes serves to cool blood on its way to the brain.\n\nThe team obtained the carcasses of birds and reptiles that had died of natural causes from zoos and wildlife rehabilitation facilities.\n\nUsing a special CT scanning technique that highlights both arteries and veins, they traced blood flow from the sites of evaporative cooling to the brain.\n\nThey also precisely measured the bony canals and grooves that convey the blood vessels.\n\n'The handy thing about blood vessels is that they basically write their presence into the bones,' said Professor Porter.\n\n'The bony canals and grooves that we see in modern-day birds and reptiles are our link to the dinosaur fossils.'\n\n'We can use this bony evidence to restore the patterns of blood flow in extinct dinosaurs and hopefully get a glimpse into their thermal physiology and how they dealt with heat.'\n\nProfessors Porter and Wimter, pictured, turned the modern-day relatives of dinosaurs \u2014 birds and reptiles \u2014 to work out how their prehistoric cousins would have stayed cool\n\nThe results showed that large-bodied dinosaurs used different approaches to keep their brains cool.\n\nSmaller dinosaurs \u2014 such as the goat-sized pachycephalosaur Stegoceras \u2014 had a very balanced vascular pattern, with no single cooling region being particularly emphasised.\n\n'That makes physiological sense because smaller dinosaurs have less of a problem with overheating,' explained Professor Porter.\n\n'But giants like sauropods and ankylosaurs increased blood flow to particular cooling regions of the head, far beyond what was necessary to simply nourish the tissues.'\n\nThis unbalanced vascular pattern allowed the thermal strategies of large dinosaurs to be more focused.\n\nSauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus used both the nasal cavity and mouth for cooling \u2014 whereas ankylosaurs such as Euoplocephalus used only the former.\n\n'It's possible that sauropods were so large \u2014 often weighing dozens of tons \u2014 that they needed to recruit the mouth as a cooling region in times of heat stress,' said Professor Porter.\n\n'Panting sauropods may have been a common sight!'\n\nWHAT ARE SAUROPODS? Sauropods were the first successful group of herbivorous dinosaurs, dominating most terrestrial ecosystems for more than 140 million years, from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous. They had long necks and tails and relatively small skulls and brains. They stretched to 130 feet (40 metres) and weighed up to 80 tonnes (80,000kg) - 14 times the weight of an African elephant. Sauropods were the first successful group of herbivorous dinosaurs, dominating most terrestrial ecosystems for more than 140 million years, from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous They were widespread - their remains have been found on all the continents except Antarctica. They had nostrils high up on their skulls - rather than being located at the end of the snout like those of so many other terrestrial vertebrates. Some fossils shows that these nostril openings were so far up the skull that there were very close to the eye openings. Sauropods such as the Diplodocus began to diversify in the Middle Jurassic about 180 million years ago.

Rex \u2014 were also gigantic.\n\nHowever, the duo's analysis showed these creatures had a balanced vascular pattern \u2014 just like small-bodied dinosaurs.\n\n'This finding had us scratching our heads until we noticed the obvious difference - theropods like Majungasaurus and T. Rex had a huge air sinus in their snouts,' explained Professor Witmer.\n\nLooking closely at the bones showed a richly supply of blood vessels \u2014 pumping air in and out every time the animal opened and closed its mouth.\n\n'An actively ventilated, highly vascular sinus meant we had another potential cooling region,' said Professor Witmer.\n\n'Theropod dinosaurs solved the same problem \u2014 but in a different way.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Anatomical Record.", "description": "Using special 3D imaging techniques on dino relatives (birds and reptiles), experts in Ohio have identified multiple areas of heat exchange that would have kept giant dinosaurs' brains cool.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19796506-0-image-a-10_1571242541640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
