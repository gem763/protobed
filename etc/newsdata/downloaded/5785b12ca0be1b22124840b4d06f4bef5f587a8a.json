A spokesperson said there was no chance of opposition members agreeing to Assad or his closest allies joining a unity government and that the insertion of the phrase had been an important win for pro-opposition government.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show after his return from Geneva, Hague said the international community was some way from resolving the crisis, but added: \"We are putting great energy into it.\"\n\nHe added: \"Is it deeply frustrating that hundreds of people are dying every week while we talk? Of course it is. I spent 10 hours yesterday talking to the foreign ministers of Russia and China about what we can do.\n\n\"We made one step forward that's worth having, which is that we agreed with Russia and China what a transitional government should look like. And that there should be a transitional unity government in Syria, and that should be made up of people from the present government and opposition groups on the basis of mutual consent, which would of course exclude President Assad from that.\"\n\nThe French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, speaking on Sunday backed Hague's approach. \"Even if they say the opposite, the fact that the text says specifically that there will be a transitional government with all powers means it won't be Bashar al-Assad \u2026 because it will be people that are agreed to by mutual consent. The opposition will never agree to him, so it signals implicitly that Assad must go and that he is finished,\" he told TF1 TV station.\n\nThe agreement has met with negative reaction from opposition groups fighting the Assad regime, who described it as ambiguous and a waste of time.\n\n\"Every day I ask myself, do they not see how the Syrian people are being slaughtered?\" a veteran Syrian opposition figure, Haitham Maleh, asked. \"It is a catastrophe, the country has been destroyed, and they want us then to sit with the killer?\"\n\nMaleh said the Geneva agreement would have \"no value on the ground\".\n\nThe UN special envoy, Kofi Annan, said he hoped to see concrete results towards a settlement within a year and insisted \"it is for the people of Syria to come to a political agreement\".\n\nAddressing the meeting earlier, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said Assad and his allies had no place in the transitional process.\n\nThe Geneva meeting ended amid reports of fresh violence in Syria, including claims that government forces had overrun Douma city, which has been under siege for several weeks.\n\nClinton said the conditions set out in the statement offered the best chance of a transition to a democratic post-Assad period, including free elections. She added that the US would meet next week with Syria's divided opposition to try to forge unity between them in line with the Kofi Annan principles.\n\nRussia had previously refused to back a provision that would call for Assad to step down to pave the way for a unity government. The final UN communique, which followed a day of difficult negotiations, appeared to preserve the Moscow \"red line\" \u2013 that the Syrian people should have ownership of the transition process and it should not be imposed from outside.\n\nOpposition from Russia, with the backing of China, has been seen by western powers as one of the main obstacles in the efforts to end the conflict, which has claimed more than 15,000 lives. According to western diplomatic sources, the sticking point during talks has been a paragraph in the text interpreted by the US and the UK as suggesting that Assad would need to step down before the transition.\n\nThe emergency meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of the UN security council's permanent five members, as well as representatives of the EU and Arab states, including Syria's neighbour Iraq.\n\nAddressing delegates, Annan warned that the war in Syria risked spilling over into a wider regional conflict of \"grave severity\". However, at times during the day that seemed a moot point as US officials accused Russia of \"stonewalling\" and raised the prospect that the talks might fail.\n\nAdmonishing the foreign powers present, Annan said the crisis should never have reached this point. \"Either unite to secure your common interests or divide and surely fail in your own individual way,\" he said. \"Without your unity, your common resolve and your action now \u2026 nobody can win and everyone will lose in some way.\"", "description": "UK and French foreign ministers confirm there is no place for President Bashar al-Assad in transitional Syrian government", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont", "Shiv Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/1/1341150447981/William-Hague-on-The-Andr-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aff954eff88757c63c3f037acfdcfbe8", "published_at": "2012-07-01"}
