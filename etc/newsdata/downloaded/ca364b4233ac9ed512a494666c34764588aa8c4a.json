A scholar graduated from Harvard and Oxford, a man with gravitas in the legal community. Before he began seeking elective office in the late 1980s, Weld was a high-ranking and extremely knowledgeable federal prosecutor.\n\nFor a time, he was the chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division under President Reagan. I have not been a fan of his post-DOJ political career, but I\u2019ve never thought of him as a clown.\n\nJOE WALSH, BILL WELD SWING AT TRUMP IN FIRST GOP PRIMARY DEBATE\n\nNow, he has beclowned himself.\n\nIt was a \u201cHold my beer\u201d moment of one-upmanship Monday on \"Morning Joe,\" MSNBC, where the Trump-deranged legions make their 24/7 calls for impeachment.

For former governor Weld, though, grounds for Trump\u2019s impeachment are so matter-of-factly to be assumed that he\u2019s moved beyond them.\n\nWay beyond them.\n\nTrump, he asserts (and I\u2019m not kidding, though I wish I were), may need to be put to death.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "Former governor Bill Weld is so desperate to find an audience for his forlorn GOP-nomination challenge to the president that he has beclowned himself over Ukraine.", "authors": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.
