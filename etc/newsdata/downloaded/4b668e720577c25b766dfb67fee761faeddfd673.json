Unicef/Holt 5/32 China As a working mother, Fiona managed to breastfeed her baby for 28 months. \u201cI made it because I learned correct knowledge of breastfeeding online, and also having a healthy baby makes me more confident.

Ms. Mohammed has three other children. \u201cPreviously, I used to buy and use the vegetables from the market, but now I\u2019m using [vegetables] from my garden. \u2026 I\u2019m taking my child to the health post, and his weight is being measured every month. If his weight is decreasing, then I give him more of the proper foods, and I take him back to the health post. The reason why I planted the vegetables is for my child to be healthy, to gain weight and to have a brighter mind. The future that I want for my child is for him to go to school and be a good student and become a doctor.
