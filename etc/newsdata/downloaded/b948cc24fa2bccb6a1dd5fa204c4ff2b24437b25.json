I just didn't take them,\" said Kyrgios. \"Nowhere near my best tennis, but it is what it is.\"\n\nThe final set was on serve until Rublev got the only break of the match and immediately consolidated for a 5-2 lead that sent him on his way.\n\nKyrgios lost despite powering down 30 aces to Rublev's 12 and winning almost 90 per cent of his first-serve points while saving three of the four break points he faced.\n\n\"His serve is the best on tour. I was just trying to focus on me to serve also well to keep my serve and see if I win tie-breaks or not,\" said Rublev. \"Today was my day and I am happy.\"\n\nRublev came into the year's final Grand Slam with plenty of confidence after he earned the biggest win of his career when he beat Roger Federer in the third round at Cincinnati.\n\nAfter making headlines this week for both his comments and on-court behaviour, Kyrgios avoided controversy on Saturday but did shout \"whistleblower\" in the direction of a line judge who had gone to the chair umpire to report foul language.\n\nRublev, who reached the New York quarter-final two years ago, will face Italian Matteo Berrettini in the fourth round on Monday.\n\nReuters", "description": "Nick Kyrgios' eventful US Open ended in the third round as Russian Andrey Rublev turned aside the fiery Australian 7-6(5), 7-6(5), 6-3 in a battle of big servers on Saturday.
