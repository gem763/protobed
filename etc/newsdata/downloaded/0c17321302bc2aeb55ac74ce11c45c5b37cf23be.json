A true veteran of the sport in the U.K., Jackson began her career when women\u2019s MMA was still in its infancy on the global stage. Her dreams were much more modest early on, and it\u2019s only been more recently that the martial artist from Newquay in the southwest of England has had the opportunity to compete on the world stage.\n\nAnd, after a 10-year MMA career spent largely out of the spotlight, the prospect of the 33-year-old traveling to Hawaii and potentially capturing the Bellator women\u2019s flyweight title is one that would make Jackson immensely proud.\n\n\u201cIt would be amazing,\u201d she told MMA Junkie. \u201cWhen I started, Bellator, UFC \u2013 none of that was an end goal like it is now. They were opportunities that didn\u2019t even exist. I spent the first five years of my career just fighting for the hell of it, really \u2013 just for the wins on my record and nothing else. So it\u2019s kinda strange. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve dreamed of my whole life, or whole career, because it just wasn\u2019t there. But the fact that it now exists, and you can just about make a living out of the sport and train full-time, is pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nJackson fought through those early days of women\u2019s MMA in England, where opportunities for female fighters were scarce. But in 2016, she came close to her big break when she was included on Season 23 of \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d when she was the second pick for Claudia Gadelha\u2019s team. She reached the semifinals before being eliminated by eventual winner Tatiana Suarez and was never given a chance to test herself in the UFC.\n\nBut, a little more than a year after the TUF 23 Finale, Jackson signed with Bellator and made a winning debut at Bellator 182. And now, after claiming back-to-back victories over Anastasia Yankova and Lena Ovchynnikova at Bellator 200 and Bellator 223, respectively, she\u2019s been handed a shot at Macfarlane\u2019s title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to get my head around it,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was going to get one more fight and I\u2019d get a title opportunity if I picked up one more win. So I was kinda surprised to get the offer for December and this show in particular. It\u2019s an amazing opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity for Jackson isn\u2019t simply to become a champion, it\u2019s a chance to become the first British female athlete to hold a title with a major MMA organization.\n\n\u201cIt hadn\u2019t really crossed my mind until you mentioned it, to be honest,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool. But obviously getting the opportunity is one thing, actually winning is another. So there\u2019s a lot of hard work to go between now and then. It\u2019s definitely going to be interesting. I don\u2019t expect it to be easy, but she\u2019s not unbeatable.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s title shot represents the landmark moment of a career that spans the full growth curve of women\u2019s MMA in the U.K. And, for an athlete who admits that she went into the sport blind to what might follow, it has been a journey of genuine discovery and development as she has progressed from enthusiastic newbie to seasoned veteran and, now, Bellator title challenger.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, I\u2019ve been quite open on the fact that I didn\u2019t really have a clue what I was doing at the start,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sport was still in the very early days in the U.K., and there was no amateur scene worth speaking of. So I only had one amateur fight, which was old-school, semi-pro, whatever that entailed back in the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a while, but I\u2019ve definitely reached a point where I feel I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m confident in my ground game in particular. I\u2019m a brown belt, I\u2019ve competed a lot. So it\u2019s all finally come together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s finally come together for the sport in her part of the world, too, with MMA experiencing a noticeable uptick in popularity, with a host of promotions holding regular, well-run events throughout the year. And with Bellator themselves establishing a major European presence in 2019, with even more events to come in 2020, the opportunities for fighters to follow in Jackson\u2019s footsteps and make it to the big stage have never been greater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good to see the amount of European shows that are happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the November London show they announced recently, so that\u2019s really good news. In a way, logistically, it would be easier to fight on that London show, but Hawaii\u2019s pretty cool, as well.\u201d", "description": "After a 10-year journey, England's Kate Jackson is all set to face Ilima-Lei Macfarlane for the Bellator women's flyweight title in Hawaii.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kate-jackson-bellator-191.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
