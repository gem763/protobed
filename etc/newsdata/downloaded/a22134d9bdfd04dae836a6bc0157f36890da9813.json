But because more trucks and SUVs are now being sold, that number was reduced to 51.4, the EPA said in 2018.\n\nMARK LEVIN BLASTS DEMOCRATS, CNN OVER 7-HOUR 'SCAM': 'THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nLevin said it was a good thing Trump rolled back those standards: \"Can you imagine the number of people who would've been slaughtered on our roads as a result of such an insane and arbitrary figure.\"\n\n\"This was celebrated in the media,\" he said of the Obama-era increase of CAFE standards.\n\n\"So much depends on the priority of what we're told -- the agenda that is pushed... all we get is this endless propaganda.\"\n\nThe Trump administration said in 2018 people would drive more and be exposed to increased risk if their cars get better gas mileage, an argument intended to justify freezing Obama-era toughening of fuel standards.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOverall, \"improvements over time have better longer-term effects simply by not alienating consumers, as compared to great leaps forward\" in fuel efficiency and other technology, the administration argued. It contended that freezing the mileage requirements at 2020 levels would save up to 1,000 lives per year.\n\nNew vehicles would be cheaper \u2014 and heavier \u2014 if they don't have to meet more stringent fuel requirements and more people would buy them, the draft says, and that would put more drivers in safer, newer vehicles that pollute less.\n\nTransportation experts dispute the arguments, contained in a draft of the administration's proposals prepared in 2018, excerpts of which were obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Democratic politicians should consider revamping fuel efficiency standards instead of gun control laws if they want to help save lives in the future, according to Mark Levin.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Gun-Protest-Levine_Getty-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
