The Wallabies came back to 17-16 early in the second half but tries from Kyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson, to add to Jonny May\u2019s first-half double, sealed one of the most impressive victories in Jones\u2019s tenure.\n\nBut if they are to reach a third final in their history they must defeat New Zealand at a World Cup for the first time after the All Blacks thrashed Ireland 46-14 . England have faced New Zealand just once under Jones, going down 16-15 last autumn, and have not beaten them since 2012. They met at the semi-final stage of the 1995 World Cup but, inspired by the 20-year-old Jonah Lomu, New Zealand romped to a 45-29 victory.\n\nDynamic duo Sam Underhill and Tom Curry give England comic-book gusto Read more\n\n\u201cWe just want to keep challenging ourselves,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played our best yet and the challenge for us is how do we get better next week, how do we get better individually as a player, how do we get better as a team, and at these World Cups that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\u201cYou go from a quarter-final to a semi-final, and the semi-finals are always probably the toughest game of the tournament because you\u2019ve got two teams desperate to make the final. Everyone empties the tank, and you\u2019ve got to find a way in the week\u2019s preparation to get a little bit better. So our challenge this week as a playing squad and coaching squad is how do we find ways to get better.\u201d\n\nJones had earlier this week described the quarter-final as a \u201cdo-or-die\u201d encounter. The Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, questioned how appropriate the comment was against the backdrop of the deadly typhoon that hit Japan last weekend. Jones, however, repeated the claim after the victory. \u201cIt was a do-or-die game today,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone understands that and the best samurais were always the guys who had a plan but who could adapt, who had a calm head and they were full of aggression. I thought we were pretty much like that.\u201d\n\nJones was also full of praise for his captain, Owen Farrell, who he restored to fly-half after dropping George Ford to the bench in what came as a huge shock given how well the latter had played in the pool stages. Jones was pleased with how Farrell rallied his troops when Marika Koroibete scored his stunning try to bring the Wallabies back to within a point.\n\nEngland into World Cup semi-finals after bruising victory over Australia Read more\n\n\u201cI was really impressed by the players in their ability to refocus and reset after we had a problem in the game, and that\u2019s a great development of the team and a great job by Owen as captain.\u201d\n\nFarrell, meanwhile, praised his team\u2019s response after Australia clawed the contest back to a one-point game. \u201cThe boys were calm and in control, and we had clear messages about what we were going to do next,\u201d said Farrell, who landed four penalties and four conversions. \u201cThe lads ripped into that and we managed to get some points back straightaway. This was a good performance, but we don\u2019t feel we are at our best yet. We are probably going to have to be better next week, so we are looking forward to working that out.\u201d\n\nKoroibete was denied a second late try for a forward pass in the buildup but May pulled up when chasing back before going off and receiving attention to his left leg. He headed straight down the tunnel after the match but Jones said: \u201cHe just got a little bit of a twinge at the end of the game so we thought we\u2019d take him off, but he should be fine.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s head coach, Michael Cheika, bristled at questions over whether he would leave his role. Jones, however, insisted he had no sympathy for his compatriots. \u201cIt\u2019s tough when you lose a game and particularly at this level of the World Cup,\u201d said Jones. \u201cAt this moment, not a lot of sympathy no, because I\u2019m enjoying the win and I think I\u2019m allowed to enjoy the win. Maybe later in the week I might, so ask me that later in the week.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones has warned New Zealand that the best is still to come from his England team ahead of their World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d71f6debd2afd14372e67274890286bbe1be5c8/0_31_3959_2375/master/3959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b389b9b77d71abf8ee5c2b0c81e5486", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
