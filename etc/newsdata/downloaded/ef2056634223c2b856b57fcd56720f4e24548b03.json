They are named for the indigenous people who have inhabited them for hundreds of years.\n\nProtesters say a disaster declaration by Bolivia would remove bureaucratic barriers to the help needed from abroad to contain fires in the impoverished South American country.\n\nAuthorities did not give an official estimate of the number of protesters on Friday, but a local reporter working with Reuters said about 350,000 people marched through the city.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Ramos and Reuters TV; Writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Tom Brown)", "description": "SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, Bolivia (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Bolivia's largest city, turning up heat on President Evo Morales as they voiced outrage over his government's response to wildfires that have razed broad swaths of the country's forests this year.", "authors": ["Daniel Ramos"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
