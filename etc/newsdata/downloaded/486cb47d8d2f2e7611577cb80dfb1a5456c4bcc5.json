One of which was the link between SSRIs and suicide in young people.\n\nHowever, when they accounted for the fact young, depressed people may be more at risk of suicide anyway, 'no convincing evidence' remained.\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists today said the 'very large review of evidence' is 'reassuring in that it confirms antidepressants are generally safe'.\n\nThe NHS and the US Food and Drug Administration say some people have suicidal thoughts and a desire to self-harm when they first take SSRIs.\n\nThe latter agency requires all types of the antidepressant to come with a black box warning, the strictest labeling, on its packaging.\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists today said the 'very large review of evidence' is 'reassuring in that it confirms antidepressants are generally safe' (stock of Lustral, or sertraline)\n\nWhile the effectiveness of mood-boosting pills has long been known, investigations into their safety have thrown up mixed results.\n\nThe major review, carried out by Link\u00f6ping University, paints a clearer picture about the safety of SSRIs.\n\nOf the 120 'associations' between antidepressant use and 'adverse health outcomes', only 74 (61 per cent) were statistically significant.\n\nDr Elena Dragioti and colleagues then looked into the 'quality' of these studies and the weight of the evidence that supports them.\n\nJust three (2.5 per cent) had 'convincing evidence', one of which linked SSRIs to a 'risk of suicide attempt or completion among children and adolescents'.\n\nHowever, among the studies that adjusted for suicide being more common in these patients, the evidence vanished.\n\nThe other two found taking any antidepressant before pregnancy, or SSRIs during, may increase the risk of autism in children.\n\nThis 'may call for the restriction of antidepressant use during pregnancy', according to the scientists.\n\nScientists have found 'no convincing evidence' a commonly prescribed class of antidepressants increases the risk of suicide in children and teenagers (stock)\n\nThey stress, however, autism is still rare. Figures show the spectrum disorder affects less than one per cent of people.\n\nEleven (9.2 per cent) of the associations had 'highly suggestive evidence', including a link between antidepressants and hyperactivity in children.\n\nThese associations were also linked to cataract development, fractures, premature birth, and severe bleeding, including after birth.\n\nWriting in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, Dr Dragioti and her team point out many of these can be 'prevented medically'.\n\nOne association even suggested a reduced risk of 'suicide attempt or completion' in adults.\n\n'The advantages of antidepressant use in adults and older adults may well trump preventable safety issues given their efficacy,' the scientists wrote.\n\nThe risk of certain complications varied with age. For instance, fractures were more common in those over 65, who tend to have weaker bones anyway.\n\nThe team concluded 'antidepressant use appears to be safe for the treatment of psychiatric disorders' but added more studies are needed.\n\nTHE SIGNS YOUR CHILD MAY BE DEPRESSED AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT Signs of depression in children can include: Prolonged sadness\n\nIrritability\n\nLack of interest in things they used to enjoy\n\nFatigue and exhaustion\n\nInsomnia or sleeping too much\n\nPoor concentration\n\nIndecisiveness\n\nLack of confidence\n\nEating too much or too little\n\nInability to relax\n\nFeeling guilty or worthless\n\nNumb to emotions\n\nThoughts about suicide or self harming\n\nSelf harming Some also have physical symptoms, like headache or abdominal pain. Older children may misuse alcohol or drugs. Depression in children can occur due to family issues, bullying, other mental-health problems, or physical, emotional or sexual abuse. It can be triggered by one event, such as a bereavement, or a build-up of things. If you suspect your child is depressed, try to talk to them about how they are feeling. Let them know you are concerned and you are there if they need you. If they will not talk to you, encourage them to reach out to another relative, teacher or family friend. If this does not help, contact your GP, who may refer your child to a specialist mental-health service.

'\n\nDr Sameer Jauhar, an honorary consultant psychiatrist at King's College London, said the review should be welcomed.\n\nHe said: 'In summary, this is a high quality piece of work, summarises the evidence for adverse effects of antidepressants well, and concludes that a lot of the associations for these adverse effects are affected by the illness itself.'\n\nProfessor Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, said: 'It\u2019s important to note that, even though two of these relate only to SSRIs, that\u2019s no indication that the effects cannot occur with other antidepressants.\n\n'Also, we\u2019ve got to remember that all drugs carry a certain risk of adverse effects. The important thing is to try to get the right balance between the good and the harmful effects.'", "description": "Scientists from Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden analysed 45 studies, which together produced 120 'associations' linking antidepressants to a number of health concerns.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/16/19211394-0-image-a-22_1570031163427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
