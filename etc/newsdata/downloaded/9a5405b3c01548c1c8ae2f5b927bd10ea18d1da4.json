I\u2019ll have three kids under four years old.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve been off the tour the last few years my family has got bigger.\n\n(Image: JULIEN WARNAND/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cI need to get on the road so we\u2019re done before it gets out of control!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for the third kid. My wife has been a huge support in getting me back on the court.\n\nShe\u2019s helped me fight to keep playing.\u201d\n\nMurray said he chosen to play in Belgium because, with Kim pregnant, he wouldn't be too far from home.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cThe main reason is that it's the closest tournament to home for me and my wife is quite pregnant right now,\u201d said Murray on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe last time I was in this situation (2016) I found myself in Australia and I didn't want to be in that position.\"\n\nMurray, who was playing in his first final less than nine months after undergoing hip resurfacing surgery, triumphed 3-6 6-4 6-4 over Wawrinka in Antwerp.\n\nIn an on-court interview broadcast by Amazon Prime, Murray said: \"Obviously it means a lot, the last few years have been extremely difficult, both me and Stan have had a lot of injury problems the last couple of years.\"\n\nThe Scot had broken down in tears ahead of the Australian Open in January, explaining he could quit the sport due to his injury problems.", "description": "Murray says his family is getting bigger as he has spent more time at home due to career-threatening injury", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Julien Warnand Epa-Efe Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14129755.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2019-Cheltenham-Festival-Ladies-Day-Cheltenham-Racecourse.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
