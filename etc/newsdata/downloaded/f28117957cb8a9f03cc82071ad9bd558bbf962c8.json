National Iranian Oil Tanker Company via WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY\n\nThe Sabiti was hit in the morning about 60 miles (96 km) from the Saudi port of Jeddah, Iranian media reported. The National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) said the ship was damaged but stable and denied reports it had been set ablaze.\n\nThe incident, which has yet to be independently confirmed, is the latest involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf area, and is likely to ratchet up tensions between Tehran and Riyadh, long-time regional foes that have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen, which lies at the southern end of the Red Sea.\n\nReports of the incident, which have so far only come from Iranian sources, offered sometimes diverging accounts. State television, citing the national oil company, said it was hit by missiles while denying a report they came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nNITC said \u201cthe blasts were probably caused by missile strikes\u201d and said it was investigating the source, adding that the crew were safe. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the ship was struck twice, without saying what had hit the vessel.\n\nState television broadcast images from the deck of the ship saying they were taken after the attack, but they showed no visible damage. The sides of the hull were not in frame.\n\nThe Red Sea is a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. Crude prices jumped on the news and industry sources said it could drive up already high shipping costs.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for Friday\u2019s reported incident, which follows attacks on tankers in the Gulf in May and June, as well as strikes on Saudi oil sites in September.\n\nThe United States, embroiled in a row with Tehran over its nuclear plans, has blamed on Iran for those incidents. Tehran has denied having a role in any of the attacks since May.\n\nSaudi Arabia had no immediate comment on Friday\u2019s reports. The U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of the reports but had no further information.\n\nNIOC named the ship as the Sabiti, a Suezmax vessel, after initial reports said it was the Sinopa. Refinitiv ship tracking data showed the Sabiti in the Red Sea and heading south under its own power, bound for Larak, off Iran\u2019s southern Gulf coast.\n\nThe data put the vessel\u2019s draft, or how deeply it sits in the water, at 53%, indicating it is not fully loaded.\n\nPRICE JITTERS\n\nTensions with the United States have been running high since Washington withdrew from a deal between world powers and Iran that aimed to rein in Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. U.S. sanctions have slashed Iranian oil exports, on which Tehran relies.\n\nRussia said it was too early to assign blame for the tanker explosion. China, the top buyer of Iranian oil, said it hoped all parties would work to uphold peace and stability in the region.\n\nIran\u2019s ISNA news agency had earlier cited a source saying the Iranian tanker was struck in a \u201cterrorist\u201d attack.\n\nOil prices climbed 2% after reports of the tanker incident, with benchmark Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures both rising more than $1 a barrel. Brent was trading around $60 a barrel on Friday. [O/R]\n\nCrude prices had eased after spiking above $70 in response to the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi oil sites, which shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production, about half of Saudi output and roughly 5% of global supply. Output has since been restored.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for the Saudi attacks, but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran.\n\nIndustry sources said Friday\u2019s incident off the Saudi coast could drive up shipping costs, which have already surged.\n\n\u201cWar risk insurance premiums for the Red Sea will now likely go up significantly, as will likely the freight (rates),\u201d said Ashok Sharma, managing director of shipbroker BRS Baxi in Singapore.\n\nTanker rates have soared to multi-year highs in recent weeks after U.S. sanctions on units of Chinese shipping giant COSCO and after the Saudi attacks.\n\nDisruption to shipping through Red Sea would affect oil passing through the Suez Canal or SUMED crude pipeline, which has capacity for 2.34 million bpd and which runs parallel to the canal. It is used by tankers that cannot navigate the waterway.", "description": "An Iranian-owned oil tanker was struck, probably by missiles, in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia's coast on Friday, Iranian media said, an incident that if confirmed will stoke tension in a region rattled by attacks on tankers and oil sites since May.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Sylvia Westall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439649905&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0W9-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
