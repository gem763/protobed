It was a chance to build the trust needed for the documentary to be a success. We did our best to ignore that there were worlds between us: Rabbit was living with a fentanyl addiction that could kill him every time he used, getting through life one day at a time while coping with poverty and stigma, while I was living a comfortable, middle-class life where very little invites danger.\n\n\n\nEarly on, Rabbit asked me what kind of drugs I had been into myself. The occasional LSD trip 40 years ago was as high as I had ever gotten. Documentaries are supposed to give audiences insight into an unfamiliar world. If I, as director, was clueless in understanding what it means to stick a needle of potent drugs into your arm, how was I going to make the audience understand? That\u2019s why it was essential to ask questions, listen, observe and learn.\n\n\n\nOne of the first things I asked Rabbit was if he could describe what it\u2019s like to be on fentanyl. \u201cDo you recall the feeling as a kid coming out of a bath and your mom wraps you in a warm cotton blanket?\u201d he replied. I found that remarkable. An opioid up to 100 times more potent than heroin \u2014 feels like a warm embrace of cotton and motherly love?\n\nI followed up by asking what withdrawal felt like. \u201cImagine not being able to sleep for a week, and not eating anything because you can\u2019t keep food down,\u201d Rabbit said. \u201cYour bones feel like they are on fire, burning from the inside.\u201d When I imagined feeling that kind of agony, it seemed logical that going into detox \u2014 the necessary first step of recovery \u2014 was something he feared intensely. Rabbit made me understand that being high was his \u201cnormal.\u201d And that the opposite, not being on fentanyl, would be an unbearable state of body and mind.\n\nA witness to Rabbit\u2019s chaotic life\n\nIn the fall of 2018, with some trust built between us, Rabbit opened his world to our camera, starting with the chaos of his apartment, which was merely a reflection of his inner state.\n\nWatch as Rabbit talks about his addiction in his apartment.\n\nHe later introduced us to his parents and siblings, who had been living with a son and brother whose character had been dramatically altered by his addiction.\n\nWe followed Rabbit as he panhandled for the money he needed to score the fentanyl that would get him through the day, and he showed us how to \u201ccook\u201d the substance for injection in a public washroom. I carried several packs of naloxone on me, a medication that counters the effects of a fentanyl overdose, just in case.\n\n\n\nOver 18 months, I also experienced Rabbit in various states of desperation, including anxious phone calls at 4 a.m. because he felt he was being stalked. I visited him in hospitals, crisis centres and detox facilities, witnessing more tumult in that short time in his life than the average person experiences in a lifetime.\n\nHis life is a constant battle for survival\n\nThrough the filming process, I realized that Rabbit couldn\u2019t afford to hold on to the same ideas of truth and honesty most of us subscribe to. Some horrific stories he told me about his traumatic past didn\u2019t pass a rudimentary fact check, and that led me to start to doubt Rabbit and occasionally mistrust him.\n\nIt took me some time to realize that his life is a constant battle for survival. This means coming up with stories, either about his past, so he can give his addiction meaning, or in the present day, to gather the money he needs for food or fentanyl. He\u2019s controlled by an all-consuming addiction. For Rabbit, all of his stories are real and necessary.\n\nRabbit is a fierce advocate for harm reduction. He worked in a supervised injection site, staffed by professional nurses, that offered safe supplies to prevent communicable diseases. He knows how to respond quickly to an overdose. He told me that advocating for his community, helping others and saving lives is more satisfying than injecting fentanyl. Yet the Rabbit I observed while making the documentary was cascading from one drug-related crisis to the next. This was sometimes hard to reconcile.\n\n\n\nLife is a dance of contradictions, with people often moving one step forward and three steps back. Rabbit\u2019s story didn\u2019t unfold like a movie script. By the time we finished shooting, he was no closer to getting off the needle.\n\nBut one day in September, after we\u2019d finished and all but delivered the film, I received a phone call. The unimaginable had happened: Rabbit was on his way to detox and treatment. Perhaps he might just get that happy ending after all.\n\nWatch Saving Rabbit on CBC Docs POV.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Manfred Becker", "Director Of Saving Rabbit"], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/cbcdocspov/content/images/blog/rabbit_cover.jpg"}
