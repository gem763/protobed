You can download every poll here, down to the individual respondent data.\n\nRead more about how the Insider 2020 Democratic primary tracker works.\n\nTypically, we concentrate only on the fraction of Democrats who would be satisfied in the event a contender became the nominee. But because of additional polling questions we ask related to impeachment, we also knew which respondents had not yet decided whether they would support a Republican or a Democrat in the 2020 general election.\n\nIt's a subset that is of particular interest as Democrats argue for appeal beyond their party, and its support seems elusive for all but two contenders.\n\nThe Yang phenomenon\n\nOf the 268 undecided voters who knew of Yang, 46% said they would be satisfied with him as the nominee and 24% said they would not be satisfied, giving him positive net support of 21 percentage points among general-election voters who knew him and had not decided whether to vote Democrat or Republican.\n\nYang is possibly the most politically distinct candidate in the race \u2014 and this particular survey result shows how much it works in his favor.\n\nA political outsider, Yang is making waves in the primary by drawing on his unique expertise as an entrepreneur and businessman to sound the alarm about the rise of mass automation in America \u2014 a problem that, in his view, few other 2020 candidates or politicians have substantively addressed or tacked.\n\nAnd while Yang proposes big expansions in the size and scope of the welfare state, including a \"Medicare for All\" health-insurance system, he doesn't speak like a typical Democrat \u2014 or even like a politician. He frames his policy positions not in the language of politics but by creating a more humane version of capitalism.\n\nMore than any other candidate, Yang has warned that automation is destroying the availability of manufacturing, trucking, and retail jobs. His signature campaign proposal, which he calls the Freedom Dividend, is a universal-basic-income program that would give every American adult $1,000 a month.\n\nLots of Yang's loyal base of online support comes from liberals, but he also draws a sizable contingent of former supporters of President Donald Trump who are disappointed in Trump not fulfilling his campaign promise to bring jobs back to economically downtrodden areas.\n\nBiden's familiarity and electability\n\nThe next-highest performing Democrat, Biden, greatly benefits from high name-recognition and his association with former President Barack Obama, who is still extremely popular among Democrats.\n\nAcross the three Insider polls, Biden had positive net support among undecided general-election voters of 7 percentage points among the 620 voters who knew of him, with 42% of voters supporting him compared with 35% who didn't support him.\n\nBiden has been arguing on the campaign trail that he is uniquely suited to defeat Trump because he can build a diverse coalition of Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans.\n\nWhile it's too early for any Democratic primary polling or head-to-head general-election matchup polls to give us a good idea which of the Democratic candidates have the best shot at beating Trump, Biden's relatively strong support among general-election voters indicates he may be right.\n\nThe third-best-performing Democrat, Buttigieg, has a net positive support of 2 percentage points, with 32% of general-election voters supporting him compared with 29% who do not \u2014 within the poll's margin of error.\n\nGeneral-election voters polled by Insider don't overwhelmingly support most other Democrats. Our polling found that:\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have slightly negative net support among general-election voters at 2 percentage points underwater. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's net support is negative 1 percentage point. (All of those candidates' levels of net support are within the margin of error of the poll.)\n\nSen. Kamala Harris is underwater by 13 percentage points, and Tom Steyer and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro are both underwater by 14 percentage points.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke is underwater among general-election voters by 17 percentage points, and Sen. Cory Booker is underwater by 20 percentage points.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are still several months away, and the conditions of the race could drastically change, so the aforementioned candidates still have plenty of time to make up ground. But as of now, it seems as if Yang and Biden have the biggest edge in winning over the electoral segment of undecided general-election voters.", "description": "The former vice president and the former entrepreneur respectively represent the establishment and the insurgency of the Democratic Party in 2020.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EbzbwA3752a.sFKJPfMevg--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/30c0ed4ed3b01ffef72a916c3ce06491", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
