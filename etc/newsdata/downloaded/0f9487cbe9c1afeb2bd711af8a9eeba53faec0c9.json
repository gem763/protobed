AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Scotland\u2019s clash with Japan is at risk of being cancelled if conditions are deemed too unsafe to stage the match, even though Typhoon Hagibis will have passed through Yokohama by that point.\n\nThe match between Namibia and Uruguay also appears to be in danger, even though Kamaishi is not directly on the expected path of the typhoon.\n\nWhat happens when games are cancelled?\n\nThe match is ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points awarded to both teams.\n\nThat means England and France remain first and second in Pool C, with England progressing as pool-winners and France as runners-up.\n\nNew Zealand are also guaranteed top spot in Pool D, but Italy lose out heavily as they needed to beat the All Blacks to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stage. Ironically, it is the first time Italy have drawn with the All Blacks, standing as their best result against the side even though it ends their World Cup campaign.\n\nWhat happens if Japan vs Scotland is cancelled?\n\nBoth teams are awarded two points, which would be enough to secure Japan first place in Pool A, eliminating Scotland in the process.\n\nCurrently, Japan lead the group on 14 points, with Ireland in second on 11 points and Scotland third with 10 points, meaning Scotland need to beat Japan and prevent them from claiming two bonus points, or hope for Samoa to beat Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWhat have Scotland said?\n\nThey are understandably furious, given that there has already been the suggestion this tournament for matches to be relocated or rescheduled. A spokesman for the Scottish Rugby Union said: \"We are in regular dialogue with World Rugby at all levels to work to ensure our fixture against Japan on Sunday can be played as planned. Public safety is the clear priority.\n\n\"With potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\"\n\nWhat have World Rugby said?\n\nRugby World Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin said: \"We looked pretty exhaustively at all the options. What is important to note is that where we are is in accordance with what we said we would do before the tournament.\n\n\"Doing that on this scale, with so many teams to move around, and to be able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams after the pool stage, we couldn\u2019t guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can't do it for all, we can\u2019t do it for any.\n\n\"We have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly. Italy are in the same position as Scotland are in. It is a huge match and we would love to play that game. But we won\u2019t treat that match any differently.\u201d\n\nHow bad will the typhoon be?\n\nHagibis is already predicted to be the worst typhoon of the year, with the current tropical cyclone measured at 1,400km wide \u2013 1,000km more than Typhoon Faxai that devastated Tokyo and the Kanto region last month.\n\nWinds have been recorded at peaks of 160 mph, with sustained winds of 150 mph.\n\nThe expectation is that the tropical cyclone will weaken on its approach to the Tokyo Bay area, but it has been described by Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with the magazine Scientific American, as one of the most damaging typhoons in Japanese history. \u201cIf it hits Tokyo Bay like some of the current forecasts are saying, then it\u2019s going to be a multibillion dollar disaster,\u201d Dr Masters said.\n\nLast year, Typhoon Jebi proved the worst tropical cyclone for 25 years, killing 11 people, injuring hundreds and costing an estimated $12.6 billion worth of damage, while Faxai killed three people last month.", "description": "The Rugby World Cup has been severely impacted by Super Typhoon Hagibis, with games cancelled and teams left scattered across Japan.
