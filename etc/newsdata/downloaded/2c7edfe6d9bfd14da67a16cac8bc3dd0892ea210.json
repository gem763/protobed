Every Saturday you couldn\u2019t walk the street. What changed?\u2019 asks Emile Ntamack.\n\n\u2018Nothing. It\u2019s the same in French rugby. We know all about the wars. It\u2019s s**t but what do you do to change it? Nothing. One or two wins here in Japan changes nothing. The problems will come back.\u2019\n\nNtamack is here to watch his son Romain playing for France and despite family ties, he does not sugarcoat the state of affairs. France will book their place in the quarter-finals if they beat Tonga today but Ntamack sees a French team without identity.\n\nEmile Ntamack believes the French team are without identity despite quarter-final bid\n\n\u2018There have been so many questions about our team,\u2019 he says. \u2018Before they left, the newspapers talked about this being the first French team not to qualify from the group stage in history. Players live in the real world and hear these things.\n\n\u2018Everybody was saying \u201cOh, you\u2019re s**t\u201d. Now, they beat Argentina and people talk about winning the World Cup. First, let\u2019s get past Tonga. Nobody expects them to beat England but maybe there will be a nice surprise.\u2019\n\nProblems persist for France chief coach Jacques Brunel. But Ntamack says: \u2018The problem is not Brunel. The coaching staff is 16 people now. Everybody says something to the player but who is the chief? Who makes the decisions? With England, Eddie Jones chooses everything.\n\n\u2018Maybe sometimes he is stupid but he is the boss. With France, we don\u2019t know exactly who makes the decisions.\n\n\u2018Brunel at the moment but Fabian Galthie for the future. Who will command at the World Cup? We don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\nSelection policies have been erratic. Before the Six Nations, Antoine Dupont was tipped as the new star. He was the cover boy for a matchday programme but, when the opening match came around, was not selected. Their response? They chopped his head out of the picture.\n\nNtamack believes that France don't give their young rugby talent enough time to impress\n\n\u2018Sometimes we are prisoners of our own culture,\u2019 says Ntamack. \u2018We don\u2019t give talent time. I can remember when Andrew Mehrtens was coming to an end with the All Blacks and Dan Carter was coming through. Carter would play good, play bad, play good and they would stick with him.\n\n\u2018It was the same when Beauden Barrett was taking over from Aaron Cruden, or Sexton and O\u2019Gara. Not with France.\n\n\u2018They picked Romain to face Argentina and everyone said, \u201cWhy change now? He is too young. Jacques Brunel is a fool\u201d. But it proved the right decision.\n\n\u2018At the moment we have the incredible players but do we have the confidence and the collective genius? No.\n\n\u2018We live too much in the past with French flair and the great counter-attack. This was in the past. Now the coaches say, \u201cIn this area you kick... in this area you play\u201d. French rugby has too many plans.\n\n\u2018The coaches are telling you what you have to do in this area, after the scrum, after the line-out. Scotland, Australia, Wales, Ireland, Argentina all have some French flair. French flair is all around you... except in France.\u2019\n\nNtamack also connects Mathieu Bastareaud with the deterioration of the French identity\n\nWith a heavy heart, Ntamack connects heavyweight centre Mathieu Bastareaud with the deterioration of the French identity. Bastareaud \u2014 a battering ram in midfield \u2014 was the headline omission in France\u2019s World Cup squad.\n\nHe made his debut a decade ago, when Ntamack was part of the selection committee.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult for me to talk about Mathieu because his first cap was when I was with the national team,\u2019 says Ntamack. \u2018He was a symbol of a new generation when he started but at the same time, he needs to make more effort.\n\n\u2018In 2009, he started to get bigger. I said, \u201cMathieu, you have three months to lose four kilos\u2026 this is your challenge to stay in the French team\u201d. Easy. He came back to the French team and was two kilos more.\n\n\u2018He is a centre \u2014 a transition position between the 10 and the winger. For me, just to have power is not enough. He can survive in the Top 14, of course, but you can\u2019t be like that in the international game.\n\n\u2018He was captain of the French team. I do not want to attack the player but I will talk about the symbol. Bastareaud captain of the French team?\n\nNtamack feels more must be done to protect development of youngsters like Damian Penaud\n\n\u2018This is your rugby now? Your philosophy? In the past, you can be a Serge Blanco, Philippe Sella, Saint Andre, Dominici, Ntamack \u2014 these are symbols. Is Bastareaud a symbol of the game you play with your kids? I don\u2019t think so.\u2019\n\nAs for the new foreign legion, Ntamack feels more must be done to protect development of youngsters. His son is at the heart of the next generation, alongside the likes of Dupont, Demba Bamba and Damian Penaud. This year\u2019s World Cup may have come four years too early but Ntamack wants to see them given more chances ahead of foreign club players.\n\n\u2018France is a free land and we love that but at the same time you have to protect your French identity,\u2019 he says. \u2018If foreign players play in the Top 14 then maybe the French players don\u2019t play. Sometimes you lose your identity.\n\n\u2018For me, rugby in France is too confidential\u2026 private. You don\u2019t have enough Moroccan or Algerian guys. This is not the real face of the French. To play rugby you need a culture. There is still a lot of potential.\n\n\u2018France is multicultural. Roger Bourgarel was the first black player in 1951, then Serge Blanco, myself, Jimmy Marlu, but it is not enough.\n\nIt is likely to be a battle for first place for France with two teams up for grabs in the quarters\n\n\u2018Now you see Priso, you see Raka, Camara. You have a melting pot but there is more work to be done. Football proved that. Look at Paul Pogba, N\u2019Golo Kante. You need guys like that.\u2019\n\nYet France have already won their most important game and now it is likely to boil down to the battle for first place; a quarter-final against Wales or Australia.\n\nBut Ntamack says: \u2018Everyone knows England is the strongest team in the group. We would love to hurt their pride.\n\n\u2018We know the French team is not the best in the world but we don\u2019t care. They have nothing to lose. If you stay alive, anything can happen.\u2019", "description": "Ntamack is here to watch his son Romain playing for France and despite family ties, he does not sugarcoat the state of affairs.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19343554-0-image-a-73_1570310919272.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
