Samsonov made 29 saves, tested mostly early in the contest and late, when Toronto drew within a goal and was pushing for an equalizer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a good game for him, and it was a really good game for a young goaltender because things probably didn\u2019t go exactly the way he wanted in the first and he made an adjustment,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe made an adjustment. And for a young goaltender to make that adjustment in game with the amount of motion that he had in his game in the first, he completely settled down and let pucks again start to hit him. He was big. He was the presence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe victory may have come with a heavy cost, however. \u00adTeammates Jonas Siegenthaler and Richard Panik collided with 23 seconds left in the second period. Siegenthaler left the ice holding his left shoulder. Neither player returned, and the Capitals said both suffered upper-body injuries and will be reevaluated Thursday.\n\nThe Capitals (4-2-2) overcame a 2-0 deficit with four consecutive goals \u2014 including a three-goal flurry in a 1:18 span early in the second period \u2014 to gain a two-goal advantage entering the third.\n\nAD\n\nJohn Tavares\u2019s tally with 2:33 left trimmed it to one, but Samsonov didn\u2019t allow anything else past him to collect his third win.\n\nReirden said he wasn\u2019t concerned after his team allowed an early goal, saying the group had \u201cno panic\u201d and that it was just a matter of time before his players broke through.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is easy to maybe feel a little deja vu action happening,\u201d John Carlson said of the early two-goal deficit. \u201cAnd you know we didn\u2019t want to be where we were and having the meetings that we had and everything that we worked on. Everyone responded really well, and maybe we don\u2019t have to have those meetings again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals found their offensive footing after the first intermission. Most of Washington\u2019s core leaders got involved, with Evgeny Kuznetsov scoring at the 5:07 mark to tie the game, Nicklas Backstrom scoring 11 seconds later and Carlson beating Toronto goalie Michael Hutchinson on the power play with 6:25 gone in the period.\n\nAD\n\nCarlson finished with a goal and two assists, giving him 14 points (three goals, 11 assists) in eight games, the first defenseman in franchise history to get off to such a torrid start.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing really well, and that was something that we talked about this summer with the departure of some other guys and his leadership back there,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that does say things during the game. He does say things on the bench. He does say things in the locker room, and he lets his play do the talking.\u201d\n\nAs for the team\u2019s goaltending, Reirden said earlier in the day that Holtby remains \u201cour No. 1 goalie,\u201d but the coach was pleased with the rookie\u2019s play in relief of Holtby during Monday\u2019s 6-3 loss to Colorado, when the veteran allowed three goals in the first eight minutes of the contest.\n\nAD\n\nSamsonov proved himself worthy of his coach\u2019s confidence.\n\nThe Capitals continued to struggle in the neutral zone, leading to goals from Toronto\u2019s Kasperi Kapanen 4:37 into the first period and Ilya Mikheyev at 10:58. It was the third time this season that the Capitals have allowed a goal on an opponent\u2019s first shot. Kapanen\u2019s goal, which was shorthanded, came directly off a neutral-zone turnover. Mikheyev was able to catch Siegenthaler flat-footed in the neutral zone and beat Samsonov on a breakaway.\n\nAD\n\nForward Jakub Vrana cut the Capitals\u2019 deficit in half late in the first period, scoring a slick one-timer from the right circle off a cross-ice pass from Carlson. It was Vrana\u2019s third goal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe needed that first one, right? To get us started and we had a couple of good chances before that,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start and gave us some energy to go into the second [period].\u201d\n\nVrana, who was pushed down to the third line, hadn\u2019t scored since he recorded goals in each of the season\u2019s first two contests. Reirden had expressed his displeasure in Vrana\u2019s play the past few games, but the winger delivered Wednesday. Moments before the Capitals\u2019 three-goal flurry in the second period pushed the Capitals ahead for good, Vrana had a good chance on the power play, but his shot found the post and kicked out.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the loss of Siegenthaler and Panik could have roster ramifications. Siegenthaler was part of a defensive unit already without Michal Kempny (hamstring), and his departure left Washington with only five healthy defensemen for the remainder of the game. Panik, an offseason addition to help bolster the bottom-six, has recorded zero points through eight games.\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Rookie goalie gives up two early goals, then settles in as Washington uses a three-goal spurt in the second period to fuel a 4-3 win.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gst42erkb8N99bKK64ukL124SZ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PDSU3VHQQUI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
