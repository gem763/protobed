She was in prison for one and a half years for having an affair. When she was released from prison, she went to seek a divorce in court, as she was not allowed to do so in prison, and then she was shot.\n\n\u201cThe girl's own father responded to the killing by saying she received justice. He is supporting the perpetrator.\n\n\"Honour killing is accepted within the Kurdistan community,\" she said, adding that she believes \"the government there has a responsibility to take care of women instead of letting them be killed. Allowing a man to kill woman in daylight is wrong.

The government allows so many honour killings to happen. There is a great movement for women\u2019s rights in Kurdistan but the police are corrupt and there is no support or safety for women. Women, especially vulnerable women, are left to deal with problems alone.\u201d\n\nHonour killings are defined as the killing of a relative, especially a girl or woman, who is perceived to have brought dishonour on the family.\n\n\u201cBoth men and women get convicted for adultery and the penalty is five to seven years imprisonment,\u201d states a 2018 report by the Danish Immigration Service on honour-related conflicts in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. \u201cHowever, the convicted does not necessarily serve full time as the law permits shortening of the sentences on certain conditions.\u201d\n\nThe report says women who have a premarital affair known to their families or who get married without the acceptance of their family are at risk of being killed.", "description": "A man shot his wife dead outside a court in the capital of the Kurdistan Region on Sunday where they were dealing with their divorce, local authorities said.
