Huffman, 56, pleaded guilty in May.\n\n\u201cMy first apology is to you,\u201d Huffman, wearing a black dress, told the judge immediately before being sentenced.\n\n\u201cI realize now as a mother that love and truth must go hand in hand, and love at the expense of truth is not real love,\u201d the actress said. \u201cI will deserve whatever punishment you give me.\u201d\n\nHuffman was released from court after the judge ordered her to report to prison on Oct. 25. Her husband, actor William H. Macy, who had been seated in the courtroom and is not charged in the scheme, immediately approached her after court adjourned and rubbed her shoulders.\n\nThe scandal cast a spotlight on the advantages of wealth in college admissions and the lengths to which some rich Americans have gone to get their children into top universities at the expense of other applicants.\n\nHuffman was among 51 people charged in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents were accused of conspiring to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure for their children admission to prominent U.S. universities. These schools included Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas and Wake Forest.\n\nAfter the sentencing hearing, Huffman issued a statement expanding on her apology.\n\n\u201cI especially want to apologise to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children,\u201d Huffman said in the statement.\n\n\u201cMy hope now is that my family, my friends and my community will forgive me for my actions,\u201d Huffman added.\n\nActress Felicity Huffman leaves the federal courthouse with her husband William H.

REUTERS/Katherine Taylor\n\nProsecutors had recommended a sentence of one month behind bars after Huffman tearfully entered a guilty plea to conspiracy related to her payment of $15,000 to have someone secretly correct answers her daughter Sophia provided on the SAT standardized test used for college admissions.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen said incarceration was the only way to punish a wealthy person like Huffman whose real currency is fame.\n\n\u201cIn prison there are no paparazzi. It\u2019s the great leveler,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyer, Martin Murphy, said the actress and particularly her daughter Sophia had suffered enough and urged the judge to limit the punishment to probation. In the days after Huffman\u2019s arrest, her daughter\u2019s top choice college rescinded its acceptance of her.\n\nTRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES\n\n\u201cThere are consequences. Her daughter is not going to school. Consequences are likely to continue,\u201d Murphy told the judge.\n\nMore than 30 parents were charged in the investigation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues, also including actress Lori Loughlin, who starred in the TV series \u201cFull House,\u201d and her designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, as well as a host of corporate executives, financiers and lawyers. Unlike Huffman, Loughlin and Giannulli pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors said the accused parents acted with the help of William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, a California college admissions consultant who pleaded guilty in March to helping bribe university sports coaches to present clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits. Singer\u2019s sentencing is set for later this month.\n\nHuffman, who won an Emmy award for \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d and was nominated for an Oscar as best actress for her role in the 2005 film \u201cTransamerica,\u201d said the cheating scheme was proposed by Singer.\n\nHuffman said her daughter was unaware of the scheme until the actress was arrested on March 12.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cI find Motherhood bewildering,\u201d Huffman said in a letter to the judge before sentencing.\n\n\u201cMy daughter looked at me and asked with tears streaming down her face, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u2019 ... I have compromised my daughter\u2019s future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity,\u201d Huffman said in her letter.\n\nMacy, 69, said their daughter \u201ccertainly paid the dearest price\u201d when her desired school - which remained unnamed in court documents - rescinded its acceptance of her after Huffman\u2019s arrest.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman, the first parent sentenced in a wide-ranging U.S. college admissions cheating scandal, was given a 14-day prison term on Friday and made a somber apology in federal court for paying to rig her daughter's entrance exam.", "authors": ["Valerie Vande Panne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429593838&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C27K", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
