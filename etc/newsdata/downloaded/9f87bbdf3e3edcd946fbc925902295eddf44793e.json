REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\n\nNearly four decades later, many at home and abroad denounced him as a power-obsessed autocrat willing to unleash death squads, rig elections and trash the economy in the relentless pursuit of control.\n\nMugabe, who died in Singapore aged 95, was ultimately ousted by his own armed forces in November 2017.\n\nHe demonstrated his tenacity - some might say stubbornness - to the last, refusing to accept his expulsion from his own ZANU-PF party and clinging on for a week until parliament started to impeach him after the de facto coup.\n\nHis resignation triggered wild celebrations across the country of 13 million. For Mugabe, it was an \u201cunconstitutional and humiliating\u201d act of betrayal by his party and people, and left him a broken man.\n\nConfined for the remaining years of his life between Singapore where he was receiving medical treatment and his sprawling \u201cBlue Roof\u201d mansion in Harare, an ailing Mugabe could only observe from afar the political stage where he once strode tall. He was bitter to the end over the manner of his exit.\n\nOn the eve of the July 2018 election, the first without him, he told reporters he would vote for the opposition, something unthinkable only a few months before.\n\nEducated and urbane, Mugabe took power in 1980 after seven years of a liberation bush war and - until the army\u2019s takeover - was the only leader Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, knew since independence from Britain.\n\nBut as the economy imploded starting from 2000 and his mental and physical health waned, Mugabe found fewer people to trust as he seemingly smoothed a path to succession for his wife Grace, four decades his junior and known to her critics as \u201cGucci Grace\u201d for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,\u201d Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential liberation war veterans, told Reuters after Mugabe\u2019s removal.\n\n\u2018A JEWEL\u2019\n\nBorn on Feb. 21, 1924, on a Roman Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.\n\nReturning to then-Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics but was jailed for a decade four years later for opposing white rule.\n\nWhen his infant son died of malaria in Ghana in 1966, Mugabe was denied parole to attend the funeral, a decision by the government of white-minority leader Ian Smith that historians say played a part in explaining Mugabe\u2019s subsequent bitterness.\n\nAfter his release, he rose to the top of the powerful Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, known as the \u201cthinking man\u2019s guerrilla\u201d on account of his seven degrees, three of them earned behind bars.\n\nLater, as he crushed his political enemies, he boasted of another qualification: \u201ca degree in violence\u201d.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1980, Mugabe was elected the nation\u2019s first black prime minister.\n\n\u201cYou have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don\u2019t tarnish it,\u201d Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere told him during the independence celebrations in Harare.\n\nInitially, Mugabe offered forgiveness and reconciliation to old foreign and domestic adversaries, including Smith, who remained on his farm and continued to receive a government pension.\n\nIn his early years, he presided over a booming economy, spending money on roads and dams and expanding schooling for black Zimbabweans as part of a wholesale dismantling of the racial discrimination of colonial days.\n\nWith black and white tension easing, by the mid-1980s many whites who had fled to Britain or South Africa, then still under the yoke of apartheid, were trying to come home.\n\nNO CHALLENGES\n\nBut it was not long before Mugabe began to suppress challengers, including liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo.\n\nFaced with a revolt in the mid-1980s in the western province of Matabeleland that he blamed on Nkomo, Mugabe sent in North Korean-trained army units, provoking an international outcry over alleged atrocities against civilians.\n\nHuman rights groups say 20,000 people died, most of them from the minority Ndebele tribe from which Nkomo\u2019s partisans were largely drawn. The discovery of mass graves prompted accusations of genocide.\n\nAfter two terms as prime minister, Mugabe tightened his grip on power by changing the constitution, and he became president in 1987. His first wife, Sally, who had been seen by many as the only person capable of restraining him, died in 1992.\n\nA turning point came at the end of the decade when Mugabe, by now a leader unaccustomed to accommodating the will of the people, suffered his first major defeat at the hands of voters, in a referendum on another constitution. He blamed his loss on the white minority, chastising them as \u201cenemies of Zimbabwe\u201d.\n\nDays later, a groundswell of black anger at the slow pace of land reform started boiling over and gangs of black Zimbabweans calling themselves war veterans started to overrun white-owned farms.\n\nMugabe\u2019s response was uncompromising, labelling the invasions a correction of colonial injustices.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we made a mistake by not finishing the war in the trenches,\u201d he said in 2000. \u201cIf the settlers had been defeated through the barrel of a gun, perhaps we would not be having the same problems.\u201d\n\nThe farm seizures helped ruin one of Africa\u2019s most dynamic economies, with a collapse in agricultural foreign exchange earnings unleashing hyperinflation.\n\nThe economy shrank by more than a third from 2000 to 2008, sending unemployment above 80 percent. Several million Zimbabweans fled, mostly to South Africa.\n\nBrushing aside criticism, Mugabe portrayed himself as a radical African nationalist competing against racist and imperialist forces in Washington and London.\n\nROCK BOTTOM\n\nThe country hit rock bottom in 2008, when 500 billion percent inflation drove people to support the challenge of Western-backed former union leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nFacing defeat in a presidential run-off, Mugabe resorted to violence, forcing Tsvangirai to withdraw after scores of his supporters were killed by ZANU-PF thugs.\n\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe\u2019s neighbour to the south, squeezed the pair into a fractious unity coalition but the compromise belied Mugabe\u2019s grip on power through his continued control of the army, police and secret service.\n\nAs old age crept in and rumours of cancer intensified, his animosity towards Tsvangirai eased and the two men enjoyed weekly meetings over tea and scones, in a nod to Mugabe\u2019s affection for British traditions.\n\nOn the eve of the 2013 election, Mugabe dismissed cries of autocracy and likened dealing with Tsvangirai to sparring in the ring. \u201cAlthough we boxed each other, it\u2019s not as hostile as before,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nEven as he spoke, Mugabe\u2019s agents were busy finalising plans to engineer an election victory through manipulation of the voters\u2019 roll, according to the Tsvangirai camp.\n\nIt was typical of Mugabe\u2019s ability to out-think - and if necessary out-fight - his opponents, a trait that drew grudging respect from even his sternest critics.\n\nWriting in a 2007 cable released by WikiLeaks, then-U.S. ambassador to Harare Christopher Dell reflected the views of many: \u201cTo give the devil his due, he is a brilliant tactician.\u201d", "description": "Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was feted as an African liberation hero and champion of racial reconciliation when he first came to power in a nation divided by nearly a century of white colonial rule.", "authors": ["Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426793483&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850FE", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
