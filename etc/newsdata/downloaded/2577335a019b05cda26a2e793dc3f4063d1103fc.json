REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s rand firmed against the dollar on Friday, but traders expected the currency to remain range-bound ahead of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni\u2019s medium-term budget speech and Moody\u2019s rating review next week.\n\nAt 0630 GMT, the rand traded at 14.6510 per dollar, 0.32% firmer than its New York close on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe rand remains in a tight range as we head into the end of the week, with little global fallout witnessed during the course of this week,\u201d Bianca Botes, treasury partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions said in a note.\n\nBotes added that local markets will turn its attention to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) on Wednesday and Moody\u2019s rating review next Friday.\n\nMboweni is likely to raise the medium-term target for budget deficits because of costs related to the state-owned power utility Eskom, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nAs weak as the country\u2019s finances are, the poll predicted unanimously that South Africa would avoid a credit rating downgrade when Moody\u2019s reviews its status.\n\n\u201cA downgrade by Moody\u2019s, which is considered highly unlikely by most commentators, will push the rand back into the 15-area and maybe even 16 depending on market positioning, while another stay and an acceptable MTBPS and we should see 14.35 or even 14.20 swiftly afterwards,\u201d Warrick Butler, chief trader at Standard Bank, said in a note.\n\nIn fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 0.5 basis points to 8.21%.", "description": "South Africa's rand firmed against the dollar on Friday, but traders expected the currency to remain range-bound ahead of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's medium-term budget speech and Moody's rating review next week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444782045&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0G7-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
