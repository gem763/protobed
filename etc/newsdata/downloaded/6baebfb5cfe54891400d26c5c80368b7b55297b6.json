It would be of a piece with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation, which involved least a dozen requests for assistance from foreign governments by Mueller and his staff. If the aim of a negotiation was to lever information on the operations run against the United States in 2016, it\u2019s a legitimate ask.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hugh Hewitt", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions If-Republicans-Dont-Stand-By-Trump-They-Risk-Losing-Their-Base-Forever"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
