I\u2019ve had a lot of stress and I\u2019ve not been to the gym in two weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been unwell all weekend with a chest infection.\u201d\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nGemma is reportedly heading out to Dubai in the hope of taking a break from the problems that have dogged her ex in recent weeks.\n\nIt would seem that Gemma is going to keep her diet on the back burner while she enjoys a holiday in the sun.\n\nThe GC said: \u201cWhen I come back, I will get back on it.\n\n\"I always come out on top. My life always goes a bit t***-up but I carry on.\u201d\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nWhen she gets back, it looks like there will be plenty to keep Gemma busy, as she prepares too launch her singing career with a debut single produced by Naughty Boy and a return to Dancing On Ice, with a turn in the Christmas Special.\n\nSpeaking about her schedule, Gemma said: \"I\u2019ve got lots of projects on the table, so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
