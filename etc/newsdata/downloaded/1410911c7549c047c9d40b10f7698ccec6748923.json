Magazine in 2000, nine years after his death.\n\nMary said the months after Freddie's passing were \"the loneliest and most difficult time of my life.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe revealed that her loss was deeper that a friend passing, saying: \u201cI lost somebody who I thought was my eternal love.\"\n\nExplaining why she felt that way, Mary added: \"When he died I felt we'd had a marriage. We'd lived our vows. We'd done it for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health.\n\n\u201cYou could never have let go of Freddie unless he died - and even then it was difficult.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMary also spoke about Freddie's final days and how he \"chose the time to die,\" before stopping taking his medication.\n\nRecalling those \"distressing\" final days, Mary said: \"The quality of his life had changed so dramatically and he was in more pain every day.\"\n\nShe continued: \"He was losing his sight. His body became weaker as he suffered mild fits.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cOne day he decided enough was enough and stopped all the medical supplements that were keeping him going.\u201d\n\nMary revealed that Freddie passed away \"with a smile on his face,\" with close friend Dave Clark, of the Dave Clark Five by his bedside.\n\nAnother celebrity pal, Elton John, has also spoken out about Freddie's final moments and how he visited the star as he prepared to die.\n\n(Image: EX)\n\nIn his new autobiography, Me, Elton wrote: \"I visited him a lot when he was dying, although I could never stay for much longer than an hour.\n\n\u201cIt was too upsetting \u2014 I didn\u2019t think he wanted me to see him like that.\n\n\"Someone so vibrant and so necessary, someone that would have got better with age and gone from strength to strength, dying in such a horrible, arbitrary way.\u201d\n\n(Image: Alan Davidson/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nElton continued, writing that Freddie's sense of humour and love of gossiping was prevalent to his final moments.\n\nHe wrote: \"He was too frail to get out of bed, he was losing his sight, his body was covered in Karposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions, and yet he was still definitely Freddie, gossiping away, completely outrageous.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
