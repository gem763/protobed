This is the sad story of many Rugby World Cup fans at Japan 2019.\n\nSupporters across the Konto region woke up on Friday wondering if the previous day\u2019s events really happened. They were not the only ones to awake with that feeling, with players facing long days without matches, media making emergency plans to fill the pages and World Rugby desperately searching for a way out of the mess they\u2019ve landed themselves in.\n\nBut that pales in comparison to what the hundreds of thousands of supporters who have travelled to the Far East for what should have been a festival of rugby this weekend are now experiencing.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t know how many years this has been in the making and to have a contingency plan in place for nothing?\u201d said Peter, from Peebles in Scotland. \u201cEven if you play the games behind closed doors or put them back by a day or so. Three-, four-, five-day turnarounds are standard. We can all do it.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby can\u2019t though, at least not at the World Cup. Of course, these are extraordinary circumstances, as on Friday night the most powerful typhoon in 60 years bore down on the south-east coast of Japan. Hagibis will be destructive, disruptive and terrifying, and in all likelihood fatal.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\nA global sporting event on the level of the Rugby World Cup has never faced this threat before, which is why World Rugby do deserve some leniency on the obvious criticism that is heading their way. But that doesn\u2019t lessen the impact of the stories being told around the Tokyo Bay hotels, where a blend of anger, heartbreak, confusion and fear filled the air.\n\nPerhaps the saddest sight was the one witnessed at the Keio Hotel in Shinjuku. As 300 England supporters arrived to check-in, only to learn the game against France had been cancelled, the players boarded the team bus in front of them departing for Miyazaki, 600 miles away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently staying in Hakone and were originally meant to be here until Saturday morning before travelling to Yokohama for the match,\u201d said Ollie Bunting, who is staying in Tokyo with two friends.\n\n\u201cIn light of the weather this has had to change and we are now leaving Friday afternoon. Our flight out is meant to be at 2am on Sunday but it looks like this could be in serious jeopardy now. With no place booked to stay on Saturday night, we will now probably look to head straight to Haneda International Airport on Friday afternoon seeing as we have been advised not to venture outside all day Saturday.\n\n\u201cObviously we are all very upset about the rugby match but the mood has quickly changed as we try and comprehend what nature of events we might be about to face on Saturday. In terms of official advice locally, the RFU and British Foreign Office we have received very little information. Other than that, everything else seems to be up in the air.\u201d\n\nWith two games cancelled on Saturday and Sunday\u2019s Pool A decider between Japan and Scotland in genuine risk of being called off \u2013 which will spark its own major crisis if it materialises \u2013 suddenly fans have been left with a difficult decision: do they abandon ship and leave Tokyo now? Or do they wait it out, batten down the hatches and hope for the best with the dangled carrot of possibly the most important pool game in World Cup history.\n\nSouth African Ken Marshall and Englishwoman Rosie Marshall arrived in Japan this week on their honeymoon. Rosie has never seen England play before, and Saturday\u2019s \u2018Le Crunch was due to be her first.\n\n\u201cWhile we were looking forward to the game and especially the atmosphere due to the rivalry of England and France, we understand why the decision was made to cancel the game,\u201d said Ken. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair on all the wonderful volunteers and support staff to risk it.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky enough to have other tickets for games, but feel awful for those who have travelled a long way to miss out.\u201d\n\nBut the newly-married couple were able to hide any frustrations. Rosie added: \u201cWe\u2019re probably on the positive side compared to some of the people we\u2019ve spoken to.\u201d\n\nNot everyone shared their view though. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d said George from London. \u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to the locals and some say there is even a chance that the typhoon will miss.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t understand why the game couldn\u2019t be staged on Friday. Cancelling it seems ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThat said, there is a fair share of sympathy for World Rugby and the local organisers. Friday\u2019s headlines brought scathing assessments of the governing body\u2019s failure to put together a \u201crobust contingency plan\u201d that actually involved having the affected matches played, with serious questions set to be asked in the coming week \u2013 with or without Japan and Scotland\u2019s clash going ahead.\n\nYet with Hagibis bearing down on Japan, fans were able to deal with the events with a sense of realism. \u201cI\u2019m gutted, but can understand why they have done it,\u201d said Will, originally from Basingstoke but now living in Sydney and who travelled to Tokyo from Vietnam, taking one of the more scenic routes to the World Cup. \u201cDue to the amount of games being played I think it would have been difficult to change dates.\n\n\u201cI feel for Scotland though, they have a real chance. If their game gets called off it will be a terrible way for them to get dumped out.\u201d\n\nThe jury remains out on whether Japan vs Scotland will go ahead, but on Friday night that suddenly didn\u2019t matter. As shops, bars and restaurants shut down for the weekend and the streets emptied, the very real fear hit home that this is no longer about a rugby tournament anymore. This really will be a matter of life and death for thousands of people. The hope is those supporter stories of downhearted disappointment will turn to tales of courage and bravery for those who made it through Typhoon Hagibis. The tragic reality is not everyone will be so fortunate.", "description": "Stranded, scared and searching for answers.
