Brinkley praised Sailor with a heartfelt message on Instagram.\n\n\"Sailor Breezes In to Save the Day!\" Brinkley wrote. \"I just broke my arm into a 1000 pieces requiring surgery with a metal plate and screws to hold my arm together..I'm so sorry! Only something like that could stop me from continuing to dance with my wonderful coach...I was having a blast! It was quite literally a crushing disappointment, I never ever want to let anyone down, so I looked for a silver lining and i think this one is solid gold!\"\n\nBrinkley went on to praise Sailor for overcoming \"serious stage fright,\" and also hinted at who her professional dancing partner will be. The legendary supermodel hashtagged \"#teamsailaV,\" leading some fans to think her partner is Val Chmerkovskiy.\n\n\"Sailor always meets her challenges head on and realized she did not want to be defined by her fears so with just hours to learn my routine she is turning my defeat or should I say two left feat into her own victory of courage!\" she wrote. \"So Ladies and Gents I give you my beautiful Sunflower Sailor Lee. And I think you are all going to have a blast together on this season of @dancingab! Sorry for the typos it\u2019s my right arm! And Sailor Thank you for taking a very disappointing turn of events into something very special! you know Showbiz is all about getting a break and I guess you can say Sailor and I both got one on this season of @dancingabc.\" #teamsailaV c\u201dest la vie!\"\n\nOn Monday, Sailor told Good Morning America that her mom was definitely emotional over her sudden DWTS exit. Brinkley was Instagramming about her excitement for the show as late as Sunday night.\n\n\"She cries every five minutes over the fact that I\u2019m doing this and the fact that I\u2019m taking over,\" Sailor shared. \"She always calls it the \u2018silver lining.\u2019 We found the silver lining in a terrible situation.\"\n\nET spoke to Brinkley last month after the star-studded cast of DWTS' 28th season was announced, and she joked about how inexperienced she was.\n\n\"I literally don't know how to dance. Seriously, it's true\u2026 I really don't have the moves,\" she said. So I'm really excited to learn with the pros. It's a wonderful opportunity for me.\"\n\n\"I think whoever I get has his work cut out for him,\" she continued. \"I think they need to give me a really good one because I need a lot of work\u2026 All of the dancers on the show are incredible, really amazing.\"\n\nWatch the video below for more:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nChristie Brinkley Exits \u2018DWTS\u2019 Hours Before the Show\u2019s Premiere Due to Injury\n\nChristie Brinkley Says Her 'Dancing With the Stars' Partner Has 'His Work Cut Out for Him' (Exclusive)\n\nChristie Brinkley Walks the Runway With Daughter Sailor in New York Fashion Week Show\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "While Christie Brinkley is upset she won't be able to compete on this season's 'DWTS,' she couldn't be more proud of her daughter.", "authors": ["Antoinette Bueno"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1GpAT_lPmi6LKiIVbIN61Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/da12a3823f1d3484a6069f3bd530f491", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
