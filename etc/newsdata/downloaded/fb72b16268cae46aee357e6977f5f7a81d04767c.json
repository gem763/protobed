Magazine\u2019s October issue. The cover makes her the first \u201cvisibly pregnant CEO\u201d to grace the cover of a business magazine, she shared on Twitter.\n\nI\u2019m honored to be on the cover of @Inc\u2019s Female Founders issue and the first visibly pregnant CEO to be on the cover of a business magazine pic.twitter.com/2X2PY99X2L \u2014 Audrey Gelman (@audreygelman) September 18, 2019\n\nA writer for the publication tweeted about the history-making moment as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge day for @Inc as we debut the cover of our October issue, featuring the first pregnant CEO on the cover!\u201d wrote Inc\u2019s Christine Lagorio-Chafkin. \u201cIt was fascinating and an honor to profile @audreygelman of @the_wing as it reaches fast growth internationally.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a huge day for @Inc as we debut the cover of our October issue, featuring the first pregnant CEO on the cover!

Mayer was pregnant at the time, but declined to be photographed for the magazine, per The Atlantic. Due to this, Fortune opted for an older photo of Mayer in which she did not appear pregnant.\n\nThe Wing, a chain of co-working spaces originally intended to be a community for women \u2014 complete with pump rooms and a \u201cwomen-focused lending library\u201d \u2014 has weathered its share of controversy. The company was hit with a gender-discrimination suit in 2018. It now allows male members as well.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see, so I think it\u2019s so important for women to see that it\u2019s possible to run a fast-growing business and also to start a family,\u201d Gelman told \u201cToday\u201d of her decision to do the photoshoot with Inc.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that women see this and again feel the confidence to take greater professional risks while also not shelving their dreams of becoming a mother and starting a family,\u201d Gelman added.\n\nIt\u2019s an image that seems to be sorely needed in today\u2019s business landscape.
