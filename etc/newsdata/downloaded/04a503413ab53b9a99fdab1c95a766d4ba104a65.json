REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nMeng, 47, is charged in the United States with bank fraud and she is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings PLC bank about Huawei\u2019s business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.\n\nLawyers for Canada\u2019s attorney general wrapped up their oral arguments on behalf of the United States in a British Columbia courtroom on Wednesday. Meng\u2019s lawyers, who made their initial arguments last week, are set to return to court on Thursday to present their response.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyers are demanding emails, notes and other records from the Canadian government, arguing that they would support their case that Meng\u2019s rights were violated before her arrest at a Vancouver airport on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States.\n\nIf Canadian officials abused their authority, her lawyers say, the extradition proceedings should be halted.\n\nMeng\u2019s defense, in their application for additional disclosure, have tried to create a narrative of a grand conspiracy, public prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley said in court.\n\n\u201cNever let the truth get in the way of a good story,\u201d he added.\n\nGibb-Carsley said communications on Nov. 30 between members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) show there was no plan of action involving the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) until the following day.\n\n\u201cIn order to have a conspiracy, you need to have conspirators,\u201d Gibb-Carsley said. \u201cYou need to have a meeting of the minds.\u201d\n\nIn a document submitted to the court, CBSA admitted making an \u201cerror\u201d while sharing passcodes of phones belonging to Meng with Canadian federal police.\n\nThe passcodes were provided in error and could not be \u201cdisclosed as evidence nor used to access any of Meng\u2019s devices,\u201d according to the document.\n\nIt says that the RCMP confirmed that they did not access the devices, and do not intend to access the devices at any time as it was \u201cnot their investigation.\u201d\n\nBritish Columbia Supreme Court judge Heather J. Holmes quizzed government lawyers on why Canadian border guards would seize and seal Meng\u2019s phones in advance of her arrest without reviewing the contents of the phones.\n\nMeng attended court, taking notes continuously while seated next to an interpreter.\n\nGibb-Carsley said the CBSA had the authority to seize Meng\u2019s devices and seal them in mylar bags to protect them from remote wiping, but the border guards did not examine the contents of the phones before providing them to RCMP arresting officers.\n\nHe also said the additional disclosure that Meng\u2019s defense is seeking would not help their case and would only complicate the process.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyers argued last week that RCMP\u2019s plans changed for her arrest after a meeting between border and police officials, although the reasons for the change were not clear and, they said, resulted in Meng\u2019s constitutional rights being violated.\n\nGibb-Carsley said the RCMP had the right to delay arresting Meng until after she was questioned by CBSA upon her arrival at Vancouver\u2019s airport.\n\nThe extradition proceeding itself is scheduled to begin in January and experts say legal wrangling could go on for years.", "description": "Any errors in the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Canada last December were technical in nature and do not meet the requirements to suspend her extradition proceedings to the United States, government lawyers said in court on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Evan Duggan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436470338&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911CM-OCADN"}
