Britons driving into France could soon no longer be required by law to have an alcohol breathalyser kit in the car\n\nThe rule demanding that motorists carry at least one breathalyser in France has caused serious confusion since former president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande chose to scrap fines for not having them.\n\nUnder original plans, any motorist caught by police without a single-use breathalyser would have received an \u20ac11 penalty.\n\nHowever, the former president controversially opted to cancel on-the-spot fines before the rule came into force in March 2013.\n\nBut despite their being no penalty in place for failing to having a disposable testing kit, Hollande retained the law stating that motorists needed one in their car at all times.\n\nWith the implications of ignoring the law unknown, motoring organisations have since continued to recommend to drivers that they carry at least one of the disposable kits - which cost around \u00a33 in Halford or \u00a36 on P&O ferries - to avoid a ticking off from the Gendarmerie.\n\nThe rule demanding that all drivers have one breathalyser in the car was first introduced in March 2013, though there have never been fines in place if you're caught without one\n\nThe French National Assembly confirmed that the bill had been voted in on Tuesday afternoon\n\nThe law looks set to be abolished entirely as part of the 'Le projet de loi d'orientation des mobilit\u00e9s' bill, which MPs voted in favour this week with 364 votes to 130.\n\nIt's been reported that ministers are happy to see the rule removed due to its lack of impact on road casualties in the country.\n\nThe requirement for a breathalyser has been ineffective at cutting drink driving, which is believed to be responsible for around one third of road deaths in France.\n\nReacting to the news, RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: 'While the law governing drivers carrying breathalysers in France might be about to change, drivers heading across the Channel should still remember that the country has a much stricter drink-drive limit than in the UK \u2013 and anyone caught over the limit faces some very tough penalties.'\n\nThe disposable kits cost from around \u00a33 in Halford or \u00a36 on P&O ferries. Motoring groups have recommended that Britons have one in France to avoid a ticking off from local police\n\nWhile the drink drive limit in the UK is 0.8mg/ml of alcohol per litre of blood, it is almost half that across the Channel.\n\nIn France, the allowance is a maximum of 0.5mg/ml, reduced to 0.2 mg/ml for younger drivers.\n\nDennis added: 'The best advice is to never drink and drive, whether driving in France or elsewhere.\n\n'For any driver that still chooses to, it still makes a lot of sense to carry a portable breathalyser to check they are well below the relevant legal limit.'\n\nHunter Abbott, managing director of breathalyser manufacturer AlcoSense Laboratories, said the law would not be changed immediately and warned motorists it might still be a good idea to use the disposable devices if the obligation to carry them is eventually dropped.\n\n'It is still a legal requirement to carry an NF approved breathalyser in the vehicle while driving in France and that will be the case for a while yet,' he told This is Money.\n\n'With the French limit significantly lower than the English limit and the penalties harsher, it would still be advisable to carry a breathalyser to test yourself while driving in France and avoid unintentionally drink driving.'", "description": "The controversial rule, which was first introduced in March 2013, has meant that all Britons crossing the Channel in their vehicles have legally been obliged to have one of the breathalysers with them.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
