This guide can help with spotting subsidence.\n\nYou'll need to do your research carefully and listen carefully to advice from experts, including the solicitor you are using to complete the purchase.\n\nBen Marks, director of Tibber Marks Solicitors, replies: Hearing that a property has had subsidence and has been underpinned sets alarm bells ringing for many buyers - especially perhaps those less experienced first time buyers, and is an understandable concern.\n\nAs a first-time buyer, it is probably the biggest purchase you have ever made, and it's right to be cautious.\n\nHistoric subsidence means that the buyer needs to ensure that the works were undertaken correctly and the risks covered - active subsidence is another matter entirely and in all likelihood a solicitor would advise a buyer not to proceed.\n\nOn the basis that the subsidence here is historic, it doesn't always have to mean that the purchase of the property has to fall through but there are pragmatic commercial as well as legal considerations which need to be examined before an informed buyer can decide whether to pull out of the transaction or go ahead with the purchase.\n\nIt is important though to keep in mind that each property is different and so bespoke advice on the specific property will need to be obtained from your lawyer.\n\nIf historic subsidence has been found and the property has been underpinned, before deciding whether or not to proceed, the buyer's solicitor will need to make enquiries and obtain specific documentation such as a Building Regulations Completion Certificate and a Certificate of Structural Adequacy (CSA).\n\nThe Building Regulations Completion Certificate will evidence that the underpinning work was signed off as complete in accordance with the Building Regulations and adequately stabilised the movement of the building.\n\nThis is because if it was not carried out properly, underpinning poses very real risks and could cause further damage to the home.\n\nA CSA is typically issued under guidance of the Institute of Structural Engineers, following completion of any repairs and a period of monitoring.\n\nThat document explains the background to the structural damage experienced, the understood cause of the damage, the full extent of the repair work carried out, and by whom, and a statement confirming that the affected part of the property is now structurally sound.\n\nIn limited and specific cases (such as a Listed Building) a solicitor will also want to see evidence of planning permission for underpinning the property.\n\nThe buyer should refer these documents to their surveyor, who will be able to give their view on the current level of risk.\n\nWhen purchasing a freehold property, it is standard practice that the buyer is responsible for insuring the property from exchange of contracts.\n\nBuyers need to be aware that in the case of properties with a known history of subsidence, they can be harder and more expensive to insure, and may result in higher excesses.\n\nThe buyer should be prepared to look for a specialist home insurance provider.\n\nFrom a pragmatic perspective, if the first time buyer is not put off from purchasing the property, then they should not fail to take into account that when they come to sell the property in the future, buyers may well be cautious and the property may be much harder to sell, which may also have an impact on any future sale price.\n\nWith all of this in mind, if our first time buyer here obtains all the satisfactory documentation and is still happy to proceed with the purchase, they may well consider using the history of subsidence as a basis on which to renegotiate the purchase price.", "description": "There are many properties affected where remedial work has been undertaken, insurance continues to be granted, and that get bought and sold each year, but you must check it out properly.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/15/19256540-0-image-a-7_1570111785453.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
