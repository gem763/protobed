Our exports are not very diversified.\"\n\nFor how long can Australia maintain a First World lifestyle with a Third World industrial structure? \u2014 Business professor Roy Green\n\nCoverage of the data triggered an outpouring of angst. Even though Australia ranked eighth by wealth - suggesting economic simplicity may not be a curse - national pride, concern for their children's professional prospects and general sense of unease led many readers to express frustration that the success of the resources industries may have come at the expense of more sophisticated products - ones that require advanced degrees to create.\n\nOn social media, hundreds - many of them engineers, bankers and business managers - vented at the decline of manufacturing and the emergence of an industrial Australia that is, in the words of Industry Super Funds economist Stephen Anthony, little more than \"a quarry and a beach\".\n\n\"We're the opposite of economically agile,\" business strategist Andrew Leunig complained on LinkedIn. \"Our economy is too simple. An inch deep and a mile wide.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For how long can Australia maintain a First World lifestyle with a Third World industrial structure?\" business professor Roy Green tweeted.\n\nRarely is the gulf between economic orthodoxy and the national mood so wide. Australian economists are mostly sanguine about the nation's lopsided exports. Some are more worried about unleashing a rush to government intervention than trying to correct a false economic problem.\n\n\"It is far more important for a country to exploit its comparative advantage than to pursue complexity for complexity\u2019s sake, especially if such a pursuit requires government intervention to pick winners,\" said Brian Fisher, a former head of a government economic forecasting agency.\n\nFisher has reason to worry. Australian governments have wasted many billions propping up industries unable to survive on their own, and have eventually pulled back at great political cost.\n\n'Strategic bet' advice\n\nYet the Harvard analysis, under the guidance of Venezuelan economist Riccardo Hausmann, finds that Australian industry so lacks complexity and connections to other markets that a \"strategic bets\" approach is necessary - the same desultory advice it offers to Papua New Guinea, the Congo and Kuwait.\n\n\"With few nearby opportunities, growth can be pursued by making longer jumps into strategic areas with future diversification potential,\" Harvard concludes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hausmann analysis holds that countries that make complex products grow more quickly than those that don't. Harvard predicts the Australian economy will expand 2.2 per cent a year for the next 10 years, placing it among the most sluggish of developed economies.\n\nEven if Hausmann is wrong, and Australia can prosper by making a few essential products extremely efficiently, the narrow economy is exposed to the unexpected loss of one, such as coal.\n\n\"You wouldn't have your whole investment portfolio in one or two shares, would you?\" said Holden, the academic economist.\n\nHarvard has suggestions for expansion by Australian industry, based on its success in related goods. One is preserved meat, which includes salami, ham and corned beef.\n\nAustralia is the world's second-largest exporter of frozen beef, after Brazil, and a leading seller of lamb and cereals. Yet it has 0.6 per cent of the $US15 billion ($22.4 billion) global preserved meat market, a tiny share that highlights Australia's failure to translate a huge basic-food industry into the export of manufactured food products.\n\nSurely a country with great produce, brilliant chefs and smart scientists could sell the Germans a few sausages?", "description": "Australia is good at digging things from the ground or shipping meat, but not so great at processing or manufacturing. Harvard has noticed, what about Canberra?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4272%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_125/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/88fbb88729f28f2aae61a1c64a01c8b1d609aa6c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
