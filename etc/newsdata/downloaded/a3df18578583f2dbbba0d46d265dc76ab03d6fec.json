Will they ever get to that point? The answer, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, is all about politics not the technicalities of the deal.\n\nThere are two political facts to bear in mind. First, the government is a minority government. It can\u2019t control the parliament and the parliament won\u2019t agree to an early election.\n\nSecondly, a sizeable majority of MP\u2019s oppose Brexit even though the public voted for it.\n\nNow because the public wanted Brexit it would be politically fatal for MPs to oppose it outright. So what they\u2019ve been doing is come up with any number of objections to whatever deals the government agrees with the EU. It\u2019s cynicism on steroids. But the remainer MPs are cunning if nothing else. Let me explain why.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the overall picture of public opinion. On the face of it, the British public remain split around 50:50 on whether they want Brexit. But after over three years of fun and games, they\u2019re getting tired of the uncertainty. A private poll taken last Wednesday showed nearly 70 per cent of people wanted the latest agreement with Brussels to be accepted and if it was rejected 54 per cent wanted to leave with no deal at all.\n\nThat tells you Parliament should get on with ratifying the Boris deal, so why won\u2019t it? That\u2019s simple. If it does it will make Boris a hero. He will have delivered Brexit and could then move on to have a general election in the most propitious of circumstances. If Boris gets the UK out of the EU by the 31st October my guess is he\u2019ll win the ensuing election easily.\n\nBut if he fails and there\u2019s still an election, the prospect of a hung parliament is more likely. In that scenario, the prime minister is more likely to be the crypto-Marxist Jeremy Corbyn. So surprise surprise. Labour wants to frustrate Brexit then have an election and on winning it ... have yet another referendum. The minor parties - the Liberal Democrats (akin to our old Australian Democrats), the Scottish Nationalists (who curiously want to leave the UK but remain in the EU) and the Greens (you\u2019ve got the picture there) - always vote vigorously against Brexit. So they all vote with Labour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemainers are increasingly consolidating around the idea of a second referendum. It would be messy. There would be a fierce debate about what question to ask, when to hold the vote and even the details of the franchise. It wouldn\u2019t take place before next year. So there would be still more delay. And then there\u2019s the question of who would win. Hard as that is to predict my judgment is that Brexit would win again.\n\nAre you still with me? I\u2019ve left out still further complications - the 21 expelled Tories, the Northern Irish Democratic Union and other independents - to keep the saga as simple as I can for a short column! The 21 mainly support Boris\u2019s deal. The DUP support Brexit but not Boris\u2019s deal and the independents are Remainers.\n\nSo what you really want to know is what will happen next?\n\nBoris has been made by the parliament to send a letter to the EU seeking an extension of the deadline for departure beyond October 31. He\u2019s done it but told the EU he doesn\u2019t want the extension. And many EU leaders - reportedly including French President Emmanuel Macron - don\u2019t want to give it. So perhaps this doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\nI think the answer can best be put in percentage terms. I think this week there is a 70 per cent chance a combination of Conservatives, the 21 and Labour MPs in strong leave constituencies will form a majority to support Boris deal and the UK will leave the EU on Halloween - October 31.\n\nBut there\u2019s a 30 per cent chance the UK will end up with another referendum. And what then? I could be wrong but I think Leave will win again!\n\nIf that happens then on what terms would the UK leave? With Corbyn as PM leading a minority government then the UK would probably leave the political EU but be locked into its economic structure - the worst imaginable outcome. And domestically it would have a government committed to Venezuelan economics. That could happen!", "description": "The public want it. The EU wants it.
