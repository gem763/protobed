By that point Alabama in fact lay outside the storm\u2019s likely trajectory.\n\nIn a desperate effort to bolster Trump\u2019s inaccurate statement, a map of the hurricane\u2019s \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d was presented in the Oval Office that had been altered by Sharpie pen to extend the area of danger over a corner of Alabama.\n\nHours after Ross\u2019s intervention, the Noaa put out an extraordinary official statement that sided with Trump and admonished its own Birmingham office.\n\nThe news that a cabinet member in the Trump administration had threatened to fire politically-appointed staff at the agency in order to force the Noaa to contradict the advice of its own scientists prompted immediate condemnation.\n\nThe head of the environmental group the Sierra Club, Michael Brune, called on Ross to resign to \u201cmaintain the dignity of the federal government\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump displays an apparently altered map of the projected path of Hurricane Dorian during a briefing by federal agencies at the White House on 4 September 2019. Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Media\n\nBrune called the intervention a \u201cshameless abuse of power\u201d that could have \u201cdevastating results now and in the future\u201d. Democratic congress members Don Beyer from Virginia and Paul Tonko from New York also called on Ross to step down.\n\nAnd late on Monday, the New York Times amended its story to report that the commerce department\u2019s own Office of Inspector General has launched an inquiry into that official statement and whether it breached departmental rules.\n\nThat adds to an investigation initiated on Sunday by the Noaa\u2019s acting chief scientist, Craig McLean. He sent an email to colleagues announcing that he was looking into how the agency had come to disavow its own experts in backing Trump\u2019s inaccurate claim.\n\nThe email, obtained by the Washington Post, called the agency\u2019s response \u201cpolitical\u201d and a \u201cdanger to public health and safety\u201d.\n\nThe commerce secretary has denied that he threatened to fire staff. A statement made to the Hill called the New York Times story false and said: \u201cSecretary Ross did not threaten to fire any Noaa staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\u201d\n\nBut the denial did little to quell the anxiety of top scientists at the Noaa who are dismayed that scientific findings made at the height of a severe public emergency should have been overridden in order to spare Trump\u2019s blushes. On Monday the director of the National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini, praised the agency\u2019s forecasters in Birmingham for having rebuffed Trump\u2019s false tweet in an effort to avoid public panic.\n\n\u201cThey did that with one thing in mind: public safety,\u201d Uccellini told a meeting of the National Weather Association.", "description": "Commerce secretary reportedly made threats at Noaa after agency contradicted Trump\u2019s false claim on Hurricane Dorian", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c229a71585e917ad07d655497ed5a15cd8e8c0c6/0_343_5218_3132/master/5218.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e74c7afbf032fe8b1754cfe46fd816c0", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
