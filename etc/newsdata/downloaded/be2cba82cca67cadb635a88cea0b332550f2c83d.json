Here's Why.", "language": "en", "text": "Three of the Women's March original Co-Chairs \u2013 Linda Sarsour, Bob Bland and Tamika Mallory \u2013 stepped down on July 15th because of \"accusations of anti-Semitism, infighting and financial mismanagement \u2014 controversies some say have slowed the organization\u2019s progress and diminished its impact,\" the Washington Post reported. Co-Chair Carmen Perez, however, will remain on the board.\n\nOn Monday, the three were replaced by 16 new board members which include \"three Jewish women, a transgender woman, a former legislator, two religious leaders and a member of the Oglala tribe of the Lakota nation,\" a clear attempt at diversifying the organization ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\"The Women\u2019s March Board will enter into this next phase focusing on leadership development, rapid response, and building political power in partnership with the hard-working Women\u2019s March staff and chapter leaders around the country, allied organizations and partners, and alongside the efforts of millions of volunteers and marchers around the world,\" the group said in a press release. \"The first major action under the leadership of the new board will be a rally to #ReclaimtheCourt in Washington, DC on Oct. 6 to protest Brett Kavanaugh and his work to overturn Roe v. Wade.\"\n\nAlthough the organization has been plagued by anti-Semitism and close ties to Louis Farrakhan, the Women's March has reiterated their position that the board members stepped down because they \"served out their terms.\"\n\nDespite reports saying otherwise, our outgoing board members have simply served out their terms and are moving on to new ventures. We are more unified than ever and we thank them for their groundbreaking work and sacrifice. \u2014 Women's March (@womensmarch) September 16, 2019\n\nLet's review some of their anti-Semitic debacles, shall we?\n\nMallory called Farrakhan the \"GOAT\" (greatest of all time) and was confronted about it on \"The View\" in January.\n\nBack in February, Mallory defended Rep. Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitism, saying she was being attacked because she's a black woman.\n\nIn April, Sarsour and Mallory defended Omar's \"some people did something\" comments, saying they stood with the freshman Congresswoman.", "description": "Goodbye. .09/17/2019 4:22:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/306/414c62ae-b38b-447a-97cb-e35789ba3706.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
