Healy is managing director of Swire Coca-Cola Ltd.\n\nHong Kong is in its third month of protests that started in opposition to a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for a more democratic system.\n\nThe territory's chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced Wednesday she was withdrawing the proposed law. She said Hong Kong officials would talk with the public about other possible changes.\n\nBeijing earlier warned that Cathay employees who \"support or take part in illegal protests\" would be barred from flying to or over the mainland. Cathay said a pilot who was charged with rioting was removed from flying duties.\n\nSlosar said in August that Cathay didn't tell employees what to think, but that shifted following China's warning. Hogg threatened penalties including possible firing if employees took part in \"illegal protests.\"\n\nCathay Pacific serves more than 200 destinations in Asia, Europe and the Americas. It has 33,000 employees. Its parent, Cathay Pacific Group, also owns Dragonair, Air Hong Kong and HK Express.\n\nHong Kong was promised a \"high degree of autonomy\" \u2014 a system dubbed \"one country, two systems\" by Beijing \u2014 when the former British colony returned to China in 1997.\n\nGovernment critics say that is being eroded by Hong Kong leaders and the Communist Party.\n\n___\n\nCathay Pacific Airways: www.cathaypacific.com\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected fix CEO's name to Rupert instead of Ruper.", "description": "The chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday became the second top figure to resign from the Hong Kong carrier following pressure by Beijing over participation by some of its employees in anti-government protests.
