Our A look at the national polls indicate that impeaching and removing Trump from office is at, a minimum, a plurality position.

The average has the split closer to 48% for impeach and removal and 44% against it.\n\nBut as Democrats saw in 2016, presidential elections in the United States are determined via the electoral college, not popular vote. And because Republicans control the Senate and 67 Senate votes are necessary to remove Trump from office, the chance that Trump will be forced to leave the presidency is currently low.
