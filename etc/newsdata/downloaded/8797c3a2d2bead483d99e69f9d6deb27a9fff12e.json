Merkel said more work was needed on Northern Ireland customs and that, if necessary, EU leaders could meet again to discuss Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\nALL TO PLAY FOR\n\nTwo weeks before the latest date for the United Kingdom's departure from the world's largest trading bloc, the possible outcomes still range from an orderly departure to a chaotic exit or even another referendum that could reverse the entire endeavour.\n\nIt is unclear what Brexit will ultimately mean for the United Kingdom and the European project - built on the ruins of World War Two as a way to integrate economic power and thus end centuries of European bloodshed.\n\nJohnson, who was the face of the campaign to leave the EU in Britain's 2016 referendum, has repeatedly said he will not ask for a delay - even though parliament has passed a law to oblige him to do just that if it has not agreed and ratified a deal by Saturday.\n\nJohnson has no majority in the 650-seat parliament, and in practice needs 320 votes to get a deal ratified this Saturday - in what will be the first Saturday session since the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. The DUP have 10 votes.\n\nTo further complicate matters, Johnson wants to call a snap election, but needs opposition backing to do so.\n\nSterling, which generally falls in line with prospects of a smooth, negotiated exit, was down 0.4% on the day against the U.S. dollar at $1.2784.\n\nOfficials in Brussels said almost all the differences between the world's fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading bloc had been resolved after marathon talks that extended into the early hours of Thursday. A UK government source said the system of levying value-added tax remained an outstanding issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nSEEKING APPROVAL\n\nEU leaders will need to see the text of any agreement to allow them to give some form of approval.\n\nBut the British parliament, which defeated similar deals struck by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May three times, may present an even higher hurdle.\n\nJohnson won the top job by pledging to renegotiate May's agreement, though he is reviving the bulk of it now, with changes to the protocol on how to treat the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe conundrum was how to prevent the frontier becoming a backdoor into the EU's single market without erecting checkpoints that could undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - which ended decades of conflict in the province.\n\nUnionists such as the DUP - who profess loyalty to the union of Northern Ireland and Britain - fear that the EU's proposals would divide the United Kingdom and trap Northern Ireland in the bloc's orbit for years to come.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson's last-ditch attempt to clinch a Brexit deal was thrown into disarray hours before a European Union summit on Thursday when the Northern Irish party he needs to help ratify any agreement refused to support it.
