But recent snapshots show how construction is coming along. It looks like this area of the theme park will be impressive and noticeable.\n\nTwitter user L.C.A. Studios has been documenting progress. It\u2019s possible to see the Super Mario flagpole from different parts of the park, including Waterworld.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of distracting for that stage show! Peach\u2019s Castle seems like it could also be visible from the stands.\n\nThe new Mario-themed park will be located behind the Jaws attraction and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in what used to be a parking area.\n\nSee how it looms over Jaws?\n\nIt also looks like Super Nintendo World might be visible from Hogwarts, which might ruin the ambiance.\n\nThere appears to be an olive green barrier, but I\u2019m not sure that it will be enough to separate the two worlds visually.\n\nI also wonder how the Super Nintendo World will be blocked from Waterworld. Will a big wall be built behind the stunt show?\n\nIt\u2019s cool that the Mario Land is a proper, full-on theme area. But as amusement parks go, it highlights one of Universal Japan\u2019s great weaknesses.\n\nMany years ago, I hung out with Boing Boing\u2019s Cory Doctorow at Walt Disney World. He made an excellent point about Disney theme parks: In each area, you cannot see other parts of the park. This increases the feeling of immersion for parkgoers.\n\nI had never thought about this \u2014 which is probably the point. But after he said that, I noticed how Universal Studios Japan struggles with immersion. Throughout USJ, different areas are often clearly visible as are buildings outside the park.\n\nUSJ\u306e\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u3001\u30cf\u30c6\u30ca\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u65d7\u304c\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30022020\u5e74\u6625\u306b\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ba\u88cf\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\uff01 \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u4e57\u308c\u308b\u203c\ufe0e SUPER NINTENDO WORLD \u2122 is under construction behind JAWS Ride and will open in the spring of 2020\uff01#USJ #\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8 pic.twitter.com/vfuMiOa8p3 \u2014 USJ\u60c5\u5831\u5c40 L.C.A.STUDIOS (@LCASTUDIOS_USJ) September 28, 2019\n\nThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter has been the most immersive area at USJ until now, at least.
