They are believed to belong to family members of high priests.\n\nWaziri explained that excavations of the site in the 19th century had revealed royal tombs, but this latest discovery had yielded a collection of priests\u2019 burials.\n\nThe sarcophagi date back to the 22nd Dynasty, founded around 3,000 years ago in the 10th century BC.\n\nDespite their age, black, green, red and yellow paintings of snakes, birds, lotus flowers and hieroglyphics that cover the coffins are still clearly visible.\n\n\u201cWe only did remedial first-aid on these well-preserved coffins. They are considered to be in great condition because there were hardly any settlements\u201d around the site, local antiquities ministry restorer Saleh Abdel-Gelil told AFP.\n\nAccording to Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany, discoveries of ancient Egyptian relics had slowed after the 2011 Arab Spring revolution that toppled long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak and plunged the country in political turmoil.\n\nBut several high-level officials, including President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, have in recent weeks affirmed Egypt\u2019s stability following rare, small-scale protests in September that drew a heavy-handed response from security forces.\n\n\u201cSome people, we don\u2019t have to mention names, don\u2019t want us to have these discoveries\u2026 that impress the world,\u201d said Enany before throngs of tourists, referring to Egypt\u2019s detractors.\n\n\u201cThese discoveries are priceless for Egypt\u2019s reputation,\u201d he added.\n\nEnany said the \u201cimportant\u201d Asasif collection will be moved to the recently opened Grand Egyptian Museum next year.\n\nEgypt has sought to promote its archaeological heritage and recent finds in a bid to revive its vital tourism sector, which has suffered due to political insecurity and terror attacks.\n\nHowever, critics point to archaeological sites and museums suffering from negligence and poor management.", "description": "Luxor (Egypt) (AFP) \u2013 Egypt revealed on Saturday a rare trove of 30 ancient wooden coffins that have been well-preserved over millennia in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/86c283_coffins-asasif-necropolis-are-preseverd-ornate-decorations-visible-millennia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
