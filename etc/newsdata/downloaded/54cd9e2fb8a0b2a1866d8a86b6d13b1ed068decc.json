All our costs are going up, but the economy is not, and companies still have to compete on the international market, but they can\u2019t add to their pricing to increase the turnover otherwise they risk pushing themselves out of the market, so it becomes harder and harder to accommodate the additional costs.\u201d\n\nVeness said this is the reason the chamber had warned Msunduzi Municipality against double-digit tariff increases, which she said cripple local businesses.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s got to give and unfortunately it lands up being people because companies in the private sector have to operate on such knife-edge margins,\u201d said Veness.\n\n\u201cA lot of government increases have been double digits, which is twice the inflation, and it\u2019s irrational. Business is under massive pressure.\n\n\u201cAll sectors seem to be battling at the moment. With a slow growth rate, you are not likely to find people being successful.\u201d\n\nVeness said while the retrenchments were an indication of the current economic climate, in Pietermaritzburg the urban decay as well as unreliable supply of basic services such as water and electricity had also contributed.\n\n\u201cWhen there are power outages the factories lose production and sometimes the equipment is damaged and that can take time to repair because some of the equipment they are using is imported.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s mandate is to create conducive environments to work in. That means a steady supply of services. Without that support it makes it hard.\u201d\n\nNoma Kanyile, Hulamin group communications manager, confirmed that 200 roles may be affected.\n\nKanyile said since the end of 2018, market conditions for Hulamin\u2019s products had become notably more challenging. She said: \u201cCost reductions have become necessary and are likely to affect both direct and indirect employees,\u201d she added.\n\nCosatu regional co-ordinator Zima\u00adsile Giyama said it was concerning that employees were always \u201con the chopping block\u201d when companies face profit loss. \u201cWhy are profits being protected at the expense of the employees? No one says anything about the benefits of the executives. While the employees are retrenched, the captains of the industry continue racking up millions.\u201d\n\nJulie Smith of the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity Group said households will take strain as \u201cmoney is going to have to be spread further. The people who were working, were not earning enough to put aside savings, specifically in time for this. When you get retrenched you tend to leave with almost nothing.\n\n\u201cThere is enormous pressure on the breadwinner. Now all of a sudden to wake up and find that they no longer work is devastating. You really get thrown into very deep levels of poverty quickly and it\u2019s hard to get out of that.\u201d", "description": "While the sluggish economy has already cost the city hundreds of jobs this year, the Pietermaritzburg Chamber of Business has warned that more retrenchments are on the cards as companies downsize to remain profitable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8574/51dada041975458495f7e7e2a9fd9d45.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
