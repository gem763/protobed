Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) has made it very clear that he would have a mandatory confiscation of AR-15s in America as a means of addressing gun violence and mass shootings across the country. He said he didn't intend to have law enforcement knock on people's doors, demanding they hand over their firearms. He said he believes gun owners will follow the law (because, you know, gun owners are law-abiding citizens). But let's not forget that O'Rourke isn't the only one who wants firearm confiscation to become a reality.\n\nJust last month Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) made it very clear that she is more than willing to send law enforcement to gun owners' houses to confiscate banned firearms. And she cited her experience as a District Attorney in San Francisco and Attorney General of California as an example of how she'd implement a firearm registry nationwide.\n\n\u201cI also have as part of my background and experience working on this issue, when I was attorney general [of California], and we put resources into allowing law enforcement to actually knock on the doors of people who were on two lists \u2014 a list where they had been found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others,\" Harris said following a speech at an AFSCME forum.\n\n\u201cThey were on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction that prohibited that ownership,\" Harris explained. \"Those lists were combined and then we sent law enforcement out to take those guns, because, listen, we have to deal with this on all levels, but we have to do this with a sense of urgency.\"\n\nWhat politicians like Beto and Harris are calling for is dangerous. Our Founding Fathers established the Second Amendment to protect citizens from a tyrannical government. They wanted to make sure we had the means to protect and defend ourselves. And what's the first step in losing our civil rights and liberties? A disarmed society.\n\nSecond Amendment advocates have warned about a firearm registry because it's the stepping stone for firearm confiscation. The registration of every single firearm gives the government the upper hand in knowing exactly who has firearms, what makes and models and how many. And they can \u2013 and will \u2013 use that information to disarm law-abiding citizens.\n\nBut apparently politicians, like these two, have learned nothing from events like Ruby Ridge. They fail to see \u2013 or admit \u2013 that abuse will take place. And they can't seem to grasp the concept that Americans will fight like hell to keep their firearms.", "description": "Remember, remember..09/16/2019 20:51:12PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/41086303-a052-4713-87c8-e5a4f4988d5b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
