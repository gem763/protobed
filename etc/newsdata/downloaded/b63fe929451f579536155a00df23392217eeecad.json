That is rubbish! That is rubbish! We developed the dairy code. We developed the sugar code. We came in with a drought package,' he said.\n\n'We're fighting for the dams. We're actually doing it cos we've got the guts to sit on cabinet and fight for it!\n\n'We don't sit at the coffee shop and scream and yell like a carnival barker. We actually get to the place where we can make things happen.'\n\nNationals MP Barnaby Joyce (pictured) has lashed out at Sunrise host Sam Armytage after she accused his party of not doing enough to address Australia's drought\n\nArmytage and her co-host Natalie Barr both repeatedly questioned Mr Joyce about Mr McCormack's leadership throughout the segment.\n\nBut Mr Joyce appeared to avoid questions about whether the Nationals think Mr McCormack is a 'good leader' and if there were 'leadership rumblings' in the party.\n\n'The country people are starting to feel let down that the Nats are not behind them here, that the money for the drought stimulus is taking too long to roll out, that the Nats aren't defending country people, what is going on?'

And you can see it behind me, imagine waking up and seeing that,' Mr Joyce responded from Armidale with bushfire smoke behind him.\n\n'Where is Michael McCormack? Why is he not doing more?'
