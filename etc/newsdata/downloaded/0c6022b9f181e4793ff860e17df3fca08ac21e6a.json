The first day of the draft happened on the October 11 edition of Smackdown.\n\nMonday\u2019s draft featured six rounds with five selections in each one (compared to five rounds on Smackdown). Each round saw Smackdown get two of the five picks due to Smackdown being an hour shorter.\n\nThe night started with Charlotte Flair (representing Smackdown) in a match against Becky Lynch (representing Raw) with the winner earning the first overall pick for their brand.\n\nLynch was able to secure the victory via a roll-up to a frustrated Flair which gave the Monday night show the top selection.\n\nWrestling Online posted the list of superstars who were eligible to be drafted on Monday.\n\nDraft results from Raw 10/14\n\nFirst round\n\nRaw 1 (1) - Seth Rollins\n\nSmackdown 1 (2) - Brock Lesnar\n\nRaw 1 (3) - Charlotte Flair\n\nSmackdown 1 (4) - The New Day\n\nRaw 1 (5) - Andrade (w/ Zelina Vega)\n\nSecond round\n\nRaw 2 (6) - The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Saine)\n\nSmackdown 2 (7) - Daniel Bryan\n\nRaw 2 (8) - Rusev\n\nSmackdown 2 (9) - Bayley\n\nRaw 2 (10) - Aleister Black\n\nThird round\n\nRaw 3 (11) - Cedric Alexander\n\nSmackdown 3 (12) - Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nRaw 3 (13) - Humberto Carrillo\n\nSmackdown 3 (14) - Ali\n\nRaw 3 (15) - Erick Rowan\n\nFourth round\n\nRaw 4 (16) - Buddy Murphy\n\nSmackdown 4 (17) - Dolph Ziggler & Robert Roode\n\nRaw 4 (18) - Jinder Mahal\n\nSmackdown 4 (19) - Carmella\n\nRaw 4 (20) - R-Truth\n\nFifth round\n\nRaw 5 (21) - Samoa Joe\n\nSmackdown 5 (22) - The Miz\n\nRaw 5 (23) - Akira Tozawa\n\nSmackdown 5 (24) - King Corbin\n\nRaw 5 (25) - Shelton Benjamin\n\nSixth round\n\nMNR 6 (26) - Rey Mysterio\n\nSmackdown 6 (27) - Shorty Gable\n\nMNR 6 (28) - Titus O\u2019Neil\n\nSmackdown 6 (29) - Elias\n\nMNR 6 (30) - Liv Morgan\n\nTakeaways\n\nWhile the Universal Champion Seth Rollins going first in Monday\u2019s draft is no surprise, it is unclear how his rivalry with Bray Wyatt will continue. Wyatt was drafted to Smackdown, and there is no more wild card rule so both will be exclusive to their brand.\n\nAs per WWE\u2019s website, the two will square off in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Crown Jewel on October 31, a match that could end up being the final chapter of their rivalry.\n\nRaw really made it a priority to have a strong Women\u2019s Division, and they have what many would consider the two biggest headliners in the division in Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair. The Kabuka Warriors, Alexa Bliss, and Natalya are among the notables who add much depth on the red brand.\n\nThere were a lot of surprising names that came towards the end of the draft. High-profile superstars such as Samoa Joe, The Miz, King Corbin, and Rey Mysterio weren\u2019t taken until the last two rounds.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what is in store for Erick Rowan after his feud on Smackdown with Roman Reigns. Also, will Luke Harper be joining him to continue their partnership?", "description": "With the first overall selection, Raw picked Universal Champion Seth Rollins.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Ken Kluska", "Week Six Fantasy Stars Who Were Likely Unowned", "Including Sam Darnold", "Draft Results Wwe S Smackdown On October", "The Most Important Free Agent On Each Of The Teams Eliminated The Playoffs"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/15/os/b_1200x630/seth-rollins-was-taken-with-the-first-pick-in-mondays-draft-image-source-flickr-audrey-le-pennec_2339943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
