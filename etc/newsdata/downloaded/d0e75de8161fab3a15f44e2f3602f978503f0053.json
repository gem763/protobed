Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart had been in the frame until he pulled out of contention for family reasons, while the ECB were unimpressed by Kirsten\u2019s performance at Wednesday\u2019s interview.\n\nThe board\u2019s misgivings were compounded by Kirsten\u2019s apparent belief that he was favourite for the job, while further examination of his scratchy recent record as a Twenty20 coach did not inspire confidence, not least because T20 World Cups are scheduled for both 2020 and 2021.\n\nIt would be wrong, though, to suggest Silverwood will have earned the top job by default.\n\nHaving tasted success with Essex \u2013 he also steered them to promotion the year before they won the championship \u2013 he has made a good impression during his two years as England\u2019s fast-bowling coach.\n\nA Yorkshireman who won six Test caps as one of the quickest bowlers in the county game \u2013 he had a best of five for 91 against South Africa at Cape Town in 1999-2000 \u2013 he is close to captain Joe Root.\n\nChris Silverwood (left) has emerged as front runner for the role having impressed in interviews\n\nHis media profile has been low-key so far, with England\u2019s batting coach Graham Thorpe preferred during the summer as the backroom staff member most likely to attend a close-of-play press conference.\n\nBut the ECB believe he will feel more comfortable in the spotlight as his stature grows \u2013 a theory that now seems likely to be tested in the months and years ahead.", "description": "Chris Silverwood emerged from last week's interview process as favourite to replace Trevor Bayliss.
