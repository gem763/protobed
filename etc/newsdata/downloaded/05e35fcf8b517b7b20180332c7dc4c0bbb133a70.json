Numerous lawsuits have been filed, alleging products bought on Amazon.com are defective \u2014 for instance, causing a house to burn down or a person to go blind. A recent investigation by the Wall Street Journal found over 4,000 products sold on Amazon (AMZN) were deemed unsafe by federal agencies. U.S. senators have sent a letter questioning the company\u2019s practices on product quality control.\n\nAs the commander-in-chief for its marketplace, Amazon is not catching up with bad actors and relies too much on algorithms to flag product issues, 10 third-party sellers from around the world and three former employees at the company told Yahoo Finance. They say that Amazon has a reactive system and fails to enforce its own rules, which some sources argue encourages third parties to risk selling non-compliant products. Some sellers revealed to Yahoo Finance how they exploit existing loopholes. Others expressed frustration as they feel Amazon is doing little to punish unfair competition practices, which allows unsafe products to proliferate on its platform.\n\nPricing race to the bottom\n\nAmazon has been growing its online marketplace, which CEO Jeff Bezos says accounted for 58% of its total sales in 2018. By using Amazon services like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to handle shipping and return, sellers don\u2019t need to hold or see inventory before products have been delivered to customers' doorway.\n\nA lot of sellers use FBA services to import products from foreign countries like China to Amazon warehouses in the U.S. Despite inspection at customs and Amazon warehouses, there is little check on safety issues. Amazon checks to see if a product is what it claims to be, but rarely tests if it actually works or if it complies with U.S. federal requirements, according to multiple sellers.\n\nAs the sheer amount of sellers and products flood into its platform, Amazon has adopted a reactive approach to regulating them. It\u2019s easy for a seller to list a product on the site. Unless Amazon\u2019s algorithm flags a product after the listing has been created or someone reports a listing for quality or brand infringement issues, a product can be sold on Amazon.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Amazon directed Yahoo Finance to a blogpost published in August, in which the company claims it has \u201cindustry-leading safety and compliance program\u201d.\n\n\u201cEvery few minutes, our tools review the hundreds of millions of products, scan the more than five billion daily changes to product detail pages,\u201d the post stated. \u201cOur tools use natural language processing and machine learning, which means new information is fed into our tools daily so they can learn and constantly get better at proactively blocking suspicious products.\u201d\n\nCompetitive prices and good reviews are critical for products on Amazon. In a pricing race to the bottom designed by Amazon and played by third-party sellers, sellers worry spending money testing products or buying insurance could eat into their margins. As a result, many sellers ignore such expenses to be able to provide the best offer.\n\nPeter Koch, a Serbia-based seller who uses Fulfillment by Amazon to sell strollers on Amazon\u2019s U.S. site, said he needs to pay an extra $300 for testing and certification for each shipment he imports from China, while some of his competitors skip the inspection to cut the cost.\n\nToys, for example, are required to come with certificates like Children's Product Certificate (CPC) to be sold to U.S. customers. On a Chinese seller forum, toy sellers are currently scrambling to figure out how to obtain such a certificate after they received a random check from Amazon related to products they had already been selling for a while. Rice Cheng, a founder of a Chinese seller community, attributes selling non-compliant products to ignorance of the foreign country\u2019s safety requirements and negligent sellers who need to manage hundreds of products.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Yahoo Finance talked to Amazon sellers to find out the root of the product safety issues on the platform.", "authors": ["Krystal Hu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KrmLcK55NjnUTA1ni4EExw--~B/aD0yMzMxO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4eb56e60-d0b2-11e9-b7b9-f0f31f77ede0", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
