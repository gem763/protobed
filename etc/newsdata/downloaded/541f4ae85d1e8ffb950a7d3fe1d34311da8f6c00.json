[Hope] said Sarah had been on at him all day.\n\nTwo women every week across England and Wales are killed by a former or current partner \u2013 Office for National Statistics.\n\n\u2018You murdered her, and it was her fault? How does that work? I have no idea why anyone would see that like it\u2019s a defence.\n\n\u2018I just don\u2019t want Sarah to have died in vain. I want people to learn from her story.\u2019\n\nIan Hope told officers Sarah had been \u2018on at me all day\u2019 after he killed her (Picture: North News)\n\nJust over a year after Sarah\u2019s death, Andrew started touring the UK giving talks with his company, Innovative Enterprise, with a portion of proceedings donated to domestic violence support charity Refuge.\n\nAndrew has seen teenagers burst out crying during his sessions and although tragic to see, the talks are there to alert teachers to situations pupils may be silently struggling with at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe speaker tries to raise awareness of domestic violence and coercive control from two angles.\n\nOne woman in four experiences domestic violence in her lifetime \u2013 ONS.\n\nFirst, by getting young boys to recognise potentially damaging behaviour and stop it in its tracks, and showing young girls that what they are being subjected to might be coercive behaviour.\n\nAndrew gets teenagers to think about where they have seen domestic violence and whether it is ever seen as humorous in popular culture, or normalised in soaps and TV shows.\n\nAndrew said Sarah\u2019s death \u2018floored\u2019 their family (Picture: Andrew Bernard)\n\nAndrew now tries to teach children about what is a healthy relationship (Picture: Andrew Bernard)\n\nAndrew said: \u2018It\u2019s making sure people know that this is not a normal relationship \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s not their fault.\n\n\u2018They are doing things they have read in books or seen on films\u2026 But it\u2019s often subtle behaviour that can be destabilising and can become habit and culture.\u2019\n\nRecalling the moment when he found out his sister had died, Andrew said the family were shocked as they had no idea Sarah\u2019s partner of three years had been abusive.\n\n85% of those experiencing domestic violence sought help from professionals an average of five times before they received effective help to stop the abuse \u2013 Save Lives.\n\n\u2018It was very gradual the way it happened, their relationship was very tempestuous,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Sarah never told mum \u2013 she couldn\u2019t quite believe what happened. I was in disbelief. It completely came out of the blue and floored us all.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew admitted that he and his sister\u2019s relationship had been \u2018quite fractured\u2019 over the years and mostly consisted of them sending cards of well wishes at Christmas.\n\nMother-of-two Sarah had suffered at the hands of her partner long before she was killed (Picture: North News)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s part of the reason I do this \u2013 I feel I should do something to repair it,\u2019 he added.\n\nA two-week trial into Sarah\u2019s death heard how police had been at the house hours before her death, after receiving reports of a disturbance but left when the couple assured them all was okay.\n\nJust 13 days before Sarah\u2019s murder, Hope had been sentenced for common assault after hitting her with a rolling pin.\n\nBut a simple spelling error meant Hope\u2019s address had been saved incorrectly on Northumbria Police\u2019s system, meaning when officers arrived at their home they did not link him to his past crimes.\n\n41% of UK girls aged 14 to 17 in an intimate relationship experienced some form of sexual violence from their partner \u2013 University of Central Lancashire.\n\nIn a second mistake, the officers attending did not ask for Hope\u2019s name, nor did they run a police check on Sarah, as they thought what they were dealing with was an anti-social behaviour case.\n\nIf they had, data would have linked the couple to a catalogue of abuse.\n\nWhen officers were called back to the property that same night, they found Sarah\u2019s lifeless body.\n\nAndrew said he doesn\u2019t want his sister to have died in vain and wants others to learn from her story (Picture: Andrew Bernard)\n\nThe force acknowledged the error and has since made a number of changes since Sarah\u2019s \u2018tragic\u2019 death, it said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHope went on to plead not guilty at the trial, during which Andrew said the killer was like a \u2018shell of a human being\u2019 and was \u2018infuriated and upset\u2019 to hear his \u2018defence\u2019.\n\n\u2018He just seemed passive, he was just emotionless \u2013 it was very hard to take,\u2019 continued Andrew.\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t have any remorse whatsoever, that\u2019s what everyone found very difficult.\u2019\n\nIn the year after Sarah\u2019s death, Andrew said he \u2018thought long and hard\u2019 about what he could do to support people in his sister\u2019s position.\n\n\u2018After speaking to a teacher, who said it\u2019s important for teenagers to learn more about relationships, this seemed like the right thing to do,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018We want to make sure that if anything comes out of discussions, pastoral staff are better equipped to deal with it.\u2019\n\nAndrew added: \u2018Talking about this doesn\u2019t feel brave \u2013 people are not talking about it enough.\u2019\n\nTo learn more about Andrew\u2019s school talks, visit Innovative Enterprise.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
