On Tuesday, a senior U.S. official said Washington would threaten more sanctions to persuade Turkey to reach a ceasefire and halt its offensive.\n\nHowever, speaking to reporters on a flight back from Baku, Erdogan said the offensive would continue until it reaches its aims, and added that he was not worried about sanctions.\n\n\u201cThey say \u2018declare a ceasefire\u2019. We will never declare a ceasefire,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cThey are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan said he told Trump in a phone call earlier this week that he should send a U.S. delegation to Ankara to discuss their demands and try to reach an agreement. The White House said on Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence will meet with Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria after a phone call with Erdogan not only cleared the way for the Turkish incursion, but it also gives a free hand to Washington\u2019s adversaries in the world\u2019s deadliest ongoing war, namely Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies.\n\nSyrian army deployments into Kurdish-held territory mark a victory for Assad and Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swathe of Syria that had been beyond their grasp through much of its eight-year-old war.\n\nAsked about the deployment of Syrian forces to the northern town of Manbij, Erdogan, who has backed Syrian rebels fighting to oust Assad, said he was not bothered.\n\n\u201cThe regime entering Manbij is not very negative for me. Why? It\u2019s their lands after all. But, what is important to me is that the terrorist organisation does not remain there,\u201d Erdogan said, referring to the YPG.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan talks to journalists in Istanbul, Turkey, October 13, 2019.

If you are clearing Manbij of terrorist organizations, then go ahead, you or the regime can provide all the logistics. But if you are not going to do this, the people there are telling us to save them,\u201d he added.\n\nErdogan also said that an attack from Manbij on Tuesday, which killed one Turkish soldier, was launched by the Syrian government, and that Turkey \u201cmade the regime pay a heavy price\u201d in retaliation.\n\nSeparately, the Turkish presidency said late on Tuesday that Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call that Turkey\u2019s operation would contribute to counter-terrorism efforts, Syria\u2019s territorial integrity, and a political solution process.", "description": "President Tayyip Erdogan told U.S. President Donald Trump that Turkey will never declare a ceasefire in northeastern Syria and that it will not negotiate with Kurdish forces it is fighting in its offensive into the region.", "authors": ["Tuvan Gumrukcu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441260062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1WE", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
