There is the personal trainer he has known since he was eight, and the nutritionist and the Pilates coach and the yoga coach and the meditation guru. Even Hemsworth\u2019s stunt double is part of the gang. Collectively the army is known as \u201cThe Chris Hemsworth Wellbeing Team\u201d. Now they can be your wellbeing team too.\n\nEarlier this year Hemsworth launched Centr, a fitness app that offers \u201ceverything you need\u201d to \u201ctrain, eat and live better,\u201d according to the app\u2019s website. Its content, aimed at both men and women, has been developed by trainers either previously employed by Hemsworth or newly tapped up by the actor to contribute workouts, meditation routines and healthy-eating recipes. Like the patron saints of wellness before him \u2013 Paltrow, Motivator \u2013 Hemsworth is keen to spread the gospel of wellbeing: eat well, exercise, de-stress. He has spent the past few years being professionally required to learn how to make his body appear superhuman, and he thinks, admirably, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you learn too?\u201d \u201cI feel so fortunate to have worked with incredible experts in the fields of health, nutrition, mindfulness and training,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018Why not share that?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe upshot of the sharing is this: for \u00a315.49 per month, you can eat like Chris Hemsworth, work out like Chris Hemsworth and meditate like Chris Hemsworth. The app is a digital Rolodex of the actor\u2019s trainers and their tailored workouts and regimes. There is a recipe for sesame chicken stir-fry with broccolini (very filling) and another for a breakfast called Choc Magic Cherry Smoothie (sweet, also filling). There are workouts titled Hirt Strength: Push, Pulse and Power Up and Muscle Building: Pound It Out and a mindfulness exercise called Meditation: Forgive & Release. Centr\u2019s strapline is \u201cFor those in the making.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thor blimey!: unleash your inner god with Chris.

(People thought three Hemsworth Bros were enough; now there are thousands.) Centr users have watched more than 4.5m minutes of coached workouts which, the brand says, adds up to \u201c3,200 days\u2019 worth of squats, deadlifts and lunges\u201d.\n\nCentr\u2019s trainers argue that the app\u2019s appeal lies in the diversity of workouts it offers. There are high-energy exercises and low-energy mindfulness routines. But it is difficult to see past the Hemsworth draw \u2013 that people download the app in order to be more like him, a Hollywood star. How many regular fitness apps are out there in the digisphere? How many are fronted by Thor?\n\nThis is a world well populated by celebs. Fonda in the 80s. Crawford in the 90s. Not long ago, the athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill launched her own fitness app, named Jennis (at least Ennis-Hill has verifiable athletic credentials.) Davina McCall has one. So does the celebrity fitness instructor and fellow Australian Kayla Itsines, who has 11.8m followers on Instagram. Hemsworth is late to the game, really, in a long line of exercise-loving superstars who have used celebrity status to sell aspirational workout routines.\n\nIs this problematic? Probably. Hemsworth\u2019s appearance is not a realistic body standard. He has muscles on the backs of his arms. Large chunks of his day can be devoted to working out. He is reimbursed for time spent considering what to eat and how to train. His job demands it; his physical form might actually be a contractual obligation. In your line of work, do you need to achieve a passable resemblance to an over-muscular Norse god? Me neither! Who has that luxury? Who wants the anxiety of that requirement? Which makes the idea of the app seem pointless. Mega-huge biceps are not required for typing on a keyboard.\n\nStill, maybe Centr is worthwhile. The other night I launched the app and played a 30-minute video that involved me mimicking a series of jabs, hooks and squats. My wife appeared halfway through the workout and asked what I was doing. I was in the kitchen, punching the air with my fists. \u201cMMA: tap in!\u201d I said, over the voice of a trainer, sweet Jorge Blanco. She asked why. She had never seen me punch the air before, at least not in the kitchen, and, well, she was slack-jawed.\n\nI immediately thought, To be more Hemsworth! But I wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d understand, so I continued punching nothing in front of me and eventually she carried on with her evening. The routine lasted another 15 minutes. I was enjoying it. It felt good to punch the air. I am in the making, I suppose.", "description": "More than 1 million people have already downloaded Chris Hemsworth\u2019s fitness app. Why?
