I didn\u2019t know. It was just, you don\u2019t talk about it, and I think that is not helpful to the women who are going through it.\u201d Lucy Sajdak \u201cI will never be over the loss of that baby.\u201d Emma De Jesus Opinion You know someone who\u2019s had a miscarriage. Probably many such people. Maybe your grandmother had one. Your colleague at work. The barista you see every morning. As many as 15 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. That amounts to hundreds of thousands of miscarriages in America each year.\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard many of those stories, however, and you might not have shared your own. Many of the reasons for that silence are understandable \u2014 most miscarriages happen early, and it can be awkward to announce a pregnancy after it has already ended. Plus, some women simply don\u2019t want to broadcast intimate information about their efforts to have a child. But there are other forces at work: a society that sees women\u2019s bodies as shameful and that blames them, even criminalizes them, for pregnancies gone wrong. Policies that punish women for getting pregnant at all. Widespread ignorance about human reproduction. A health care industry that too often fails women, especially women of color. And a general unwillingness to grapple with complex emotions, like debilitating grief over the loss of a microscopic embryo \u2014 or a tinge of relief at the loss of a 16-week fetus.\n\nMiscarrying at nine weeks, I didn\u2019t feel entitled to the absolute devastation I felt. I was not able to attempt getting pregnant again; I didn\u2019t have the fortitude to risk that horrific pain a second time.\u201d Cindy Harkin\n\nThis was the \u2018me too\u2019 moment of my life. I have had several miscarriages, all very early, and the number of women who said \u2018me too\u2019 was staggering. It is just not spoken about.\u201d Molly W.\n\nIf it were men who went through this horrible emotional trauma, would insurance not cover them going to the hospital \u2014 perhaps to a special ward? \u2014 where their hands would be held, their discomfort alleviated, their grief recognized and listened to?\u201d Carol D.\n\nAs a result, when a miscarriage happens to you, many aspects of the experience can come as a shock. That\u2019s what we heard over and over again from the more than 500 people who shared their miscarriage stories with The Times. How did I not know this could happen to me? Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me what it would be like? We heard from straight women, from male partners and from same-sex couples. From people in every corner of the United States and in at least a dozen other countries. From women who had miscarriages in the 1960s and \u201970s and women who were miscarrying at the very moment that they were writing to us. From women who had one miscarriage and never got pregnant again and from women who had five or a dozen miscarriages and went on to have children.\n\nI wish I had prepared myself for how hard it would be to continue talking with my wife about her own pregnancy attempts immediately after I lost my pregnancy.\u201d Sara Haack\n\nAs the husband of a woman who miscarried, I wish there was more information for people like me to support my child\u2019s mother.\u201d Michael Lewis\n\nMy first pregnancy ended in miscarriage in May 1970 before abortion was legal. I had been pregnant for three months. When it became evident that the pregnancy was no longer viable, I was told by my obstetrician that there was nothing else he could do and that I would just have to go home and wait until I went into labor. When labor began, I went to the hospital, as I was instructed to do, and I was given very little other information about what to expect. My husband was not allowed to be at my bedside, and I spent long lonely hours through the night bleeding heavily until I was taken into surgery to have a D&C.\u201d Elaine B.\n\nWhat these women and families had in common was a desire, sometimes even desperation, to talk about what happened to them. Miscarriage might just be the loneliest experience that millions of women have faced. So let\u2019s get it out in the open. To start, what does a miscarriage really feel like? Despite how they\u2019re portrayed in movies, miscarriages can involve a lot more than a rivulet of blood. There are clots, sometimes the size of golf balls. There are cramps that feel more like labor contractions \u2014 an upsetting reminder, perhaps, of the birth one will not have. The process can go on for weeks, even months, leaving women in a strange purgatory between pregnant and not.\n\nI felt like my body was a walking tomb.\u201d Emma De Jesus\n\nI wish I had known how massively traumatic it could be. I was essentially in labor for 12 hours ... I think there should be miscarriage midwives.\u201d Jenna P.\n\nThere is no safe zone. It is not always obvious. Sometimes you feel you\u2019re safe being 19.5 weeks and go into a normal OB appointment to find out your daughter\u2019s heart has stopped.\u201d Kimberlee Budinger\n\nI was lying in bed and my water broke, and there was a ton broke, and there was a ton of blood. And you don\u2019t have to be of blood. And you don\u2019t have to be a medical professional to know a medical professional to know that at 16 weeks if that happens, that at 16 weeks if that happens, it\u2019s not good.\u201d it\u2019s not good.\u201d Molly Worthen at home in Carrboro, N.C. Ms. Worthen lost her second pregnancy in 2018. How silently it happens. For me, the only signal was For me, the only signal was that my morning sickness that my morning sickness decreased.\u201d decreased.\u201d Shubha Tewari, a senior lecturer in physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, miscarried during her second pregnancy. We went to the ER, and we were told that the baby no longer were told that the baby no longer had a heartbeat. And in had a heartbeat. And in that moment, I felt like mine that moment, I felt like mine had stopped as well.\u201d had stopped as well.\u201d Emma De Jesus at home in Boston with her husband, Ramon, and their son. Ms. De Jesus had two miscarriages before giving birth this July. Since it\u2019s such a taboo subject, we went into building subject, we went into building our family blind to the our family blind to the possibility of hearing \u2018sorry, possibility of hearing \u2018sorry, there\u2019s no heartbeat.\u2019\u201d there\u2019s no heartbeat.\u2019\u201d Jihan Donawa Gibson and her husband, Travis Gibson, at home in Jacksonville, Fla. Ms. Donawa Gibson miscarried earlier this year. I surprised myself by finding that I felt quite angry \u2014 at first that I felt quite angry \u2014 at first with my body and later with with my body and later with other people, where it seemed like other people, where it seemed like they had it easier than I did.\u201d they had it easier than I did.\u201d Diya Eggleston placed four stones, to honor each of her lost pregnancies, under a tree in a cemetery in Washington, D.C. She is expecting a child in January.\n\nJust as cruel is when there are no physical signs of miscarriage. When you\u2019re going about your life between checkups, assuming all is normal, assuming new life is growing inside of you. These \u201cmissed miscarriages\u201d can make women distrust their bodies. In the few seconds it takes to receive a diagnosis, it can feel like your body shifts from a garden to a graveyard. If you end up undergoing a D&C \u2014 a surgical procedure to remove the pregnancy material \u2014 your uterus might feel distinctly hollow afterward, a visceral reminder of your loss. For some, the emotional fallout from a miscarriage can eclipse the physical experience. Some women find themselves grieving their lost pregnancies decades after the fact. Others feel overwhelming guilt at what they might have done \u201cwrong.\u201d Even if you studiously avoid the long list of foods and activities that pregnant women are warned against, miscarriage can happen. Many losses are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that can\u2019t be prevented or controlled.\n\nFor years after (and even today to some extent) I felt like a complete failure. I couldn\u2019t even protect my unborn baby. I wasn\u2019t able to do what millions of women are able to do.\u201d Tracy P.\n\nUp to that point in my life, I would put in the work, do what I had to and for the most part see results. It was the first time where I felt I had very little control over the process.\u201d Lalai\n\nI had a D&C with my miscarriage. When I was coming out of anesthesia, my first thought was, \u2018I\u2019m not pregnant anymore.\u2019 As I sobbed, a nurse came into the recovery room to tell me my insurance was only covering $400 of the procedure, the outpatient max \u2026 In that moment, where I was overcome with the grief of realizing it was all truly over, I also had to process the prospect of being on the hook for $10,000, for a pregnancy that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Marla C.\n\nEveryone will tell you it\u2019s not your fault, that these things just happen. But even when you know that\u2019s true, it can be hard to feel it, hard to live with the not knowing. It can be difficult to even hope that you might get pregnant again; and if you do, those pregnancies can be anxiety-ridden. It doesn\u2019t help that the vernacular of pregnancy and miscarriage leaves much to be desired. Geriatric mother, blighted ovum, incompetent cervix. Who comes up with this stuff? Other women find themselves grateful, if not for the experience of miscarrying, then for the fact that they\u2019re no longer pregnant. Because miscarriages so often occur because of genetic complications, miscarrying can feel like a sign of your body\u2019s wisdom, that it has acted quickly to end a pregnancy that wouldn\u2019t have been viable, making way for what\u2019s next. Some women find themselves thinking, years later: If it weren\u2019t for my miscarriage, I never would have had my son or my daughter.\n\nI wish my doctor hadn\u2019t assumed I wanted the baby just because I was married. I wish she hadn\u2019t shown any reaction when I told her I was relieved that I wasn\u2019t pregnant anymore.\u201d Lisa T.\n\nI also came to hate the term miscarriage, because it inherently lays blame on the mother for \u2018badly carrying\u2019 the fetus \u2026 I chose afterward to call it a failed pregnancy.\u201d Jennifer S.\n\nI found myself completely unaware of how to talk about my loss in a socially acceptable way.\u201d Anna Floch Arcello\n\nAs a Catholic theologian, it is even more difficult because strangely, there is no ritual or sacrament for miscarriage.\u201d Heidi Busse\n\nThe underlying tragedy here, amid the individual heartaches, is that so many women go through these experiences alone. Or when they do open up, the reactions of others make them regret it. In fairness, there is no playbook for this sort of thing. But pressure to produce grandchildren or to manage other people\u2019s emotions can leave little room for families who\u2019ve experienced a miscarriage to process it all. Friendships crumble. Marriages fall apart.\n\nAn OB/GYN \u201ccompared me to a dog and how they often have multiple puppies and lose one or two along the way.\u201d Sarah Crawford\n\nI felt a little overwhelmed by managing other people\u2019s grief.\u201d Emily Rook-Koepsel\n\nA woman at work yelled at me because I had announced my pregnancy and then my miscarriage. She said it was cruel of me to put them through that.\u201d Paula Lee\n\nI wish there was some way to shield me from the constant reminders of the pregnancy that is no longer. Receiving emails about pregnancy, automated reminder phone calls for doctor appointments no longer needed, invitations to christenings.\u201d Jennifer V.\n\nThen there\u2019s the workplace, its own special hell for women who\u2019ve miscarried. It\u2019s awkward enough trying to hide a pregnancy, and all its side effects, in those tumultuous early weeks. How are you then supposed to explain why you need time off to heal or to grieve? And what if you don\u2019t get sick days at all, or your job requires manual labor? Maybe you\u2019re worried about being \u201cmommy-tracked\u201d \u2014 or worse \u2014 if your boss finds out you\u2019re trying to have a baby. Even being in the same room as your colleagues as they chatter obliviously about their children\u2019s lives can be excruciating. If you lose a pregnancy in the second or third trimester, this all becomes that much more harrowing.\n\nDuring my miscarriage, I returned to work two days after my initial collapse, still miscarrying.\u201d Christina Y.\n\nIf pregnancy in general was not still so detrimental to one\u2019s career maybe we could be more open about failed pregnancies.\u201d Kateri S.\n\nThough it might not help much at work, there seems to be a growing number of women eschewing the so-called 12-week rule \u2014 the period during which doctors have traditionally told families to keep their pregnancy news a secret, given the risk of miscarriage in the first trimester. But perhaps a more useful framework would be: If you were to lose your pregnancy, who would you want to know about it? Who would you want to be there to support you? Maybe entrusting the people on that list with one\u2019s news \u2014 however long or short the list may be \u2014 would help women feel less isolated.\n\nIf we don\u2019t share our stories and if we think of such a common occurrence as taboo, we are only alienating other women who may also miscarry, and we will continue an unhealthy cycle for a natural human occurrence.\u201d Sheila K.\n\nPerhaps the experience would be less difficult were it not considered socially acceptable to inquire about a woman\u2019s fertility plans in casual conversation. Because you never ever know.\u201d Susan G.\n\nThough I did not carry my baby to term, I still labored and delivered my baby. My baby came into this world surrounded by love.\u201d Emily M.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing shameful about having a miscarriage. So what if we stopped acting that way, in defiance of all the forces that have shaped our perceptions? We might not be able to change how society handles miscarriage overnight. But even opening up to a few new people can be healing for you, and possibly also for them.
