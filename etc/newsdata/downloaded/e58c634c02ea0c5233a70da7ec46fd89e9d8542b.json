That news, first reported in Variety, means that people who watch in bars, airports, offices or anywhere on their phones or tablets will be accounted for in the measurements used to set advertising rates.\n\nThat\u2019s been a long time coming for networks, which have been prodding Nielsen to find a way to pick up this extra viewership for years. CNBC stopped subscribing to Nielsen four years ago, feeling cheated because Nielsen didn\u2019t count people who watched business coverage in offices.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s important,\u201d said Scott Brown, a Nielsen executive, on Tuesday. \u201cWe know that this is real viewership that wasn\u2019t being counted or measured and our goal is to measure everyone that is watching.\u201d\n\nBased on its tests, Nielsen predicts that its count of people watching sports events will go up an average of 11 percent. News shows are averaging a 7 percent increase. For networks that traffic in that programming, that\u2019s real money - numbers that can be incorporated in what they charge for commercial time.\n\nFor example, Nielsen reported in February that 100.7 million people watched the Super Bowl. But with out-of-home viewership is counted, that added 12 million people.\n\nNielsen has spent years tinkering with the technology to achieve this, where viewership is counted through a portable device that picks up embedded audio signals. Typically, in-home viewership is counted through a device attached to television sets.\n\nAs the system has been tested for the past two years, Nielsen has been selling the out-of-home measurements to specific clients as an extra service.\n\nFootball is back in the picture now, and in last week\u2019s ratings NBC was the biggest beneficiary. The network\u2019s two prime-time NFL games helped it dominate the weekly competition, where NBC averaged 8.8 million viewers.\n\nCBS landed in second with 3.7 million viewers, ABC had 3.5 million, Fox had 3.3 million, ION Television had 1.3 million, Univision had 1.2 million, Telemundo had 1.1 million and the CW had 610,000.\n\nSerena Williams may have failed in her attempt to win a 24th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open, but she was a ratings winner. ESPN\u2019s coverage of the women\u2019s U.S. Open Final reached 3.22 million viewers, while the men\u2019s final had 2.75 million. The men competed against opening weekend of the NFL, however.\n\nESPN was the week\u2019s most popular cable network, averaging 2.58 million viewers in prime time. Fox News Channel had 2.15 million, MSNBC had 1.37 million, HGTV had 1.2 million and TLC had 1.07 million.\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8.4 million viewers. NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d was second with 7.5 million and the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d had 5.4 million viewers.\n\nFor the week of Sept. 2-8, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships:\n\n___\n\nABC is owned by The Walt Disney Co.
