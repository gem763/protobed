That's OK. He's slower than I'd like but it's fine. It's weird though. At the AAU trips when you're younger, you're playing 2K with your friends and teammates and you're having fun. You slide over to the right or to the left and you start pushing the button to switch teams, 'Boom, you're right there.' You don't have to create your player. Your player is already there. It's just like, 'Man, I'm here. But I want to stay here for a long time.' All this stuff just adds motivation to my fire.\"\n\nThe Duke product may not think the electronic version of himself is fast or good enough, but he can take solace in the fact that he is the highest-rated rookie in the league.\n\nThat is no surprise after he captured the nation's attention as a freshman at Duke with awe-inspiring aerial displays during dunks, powerful blocks on the defensive side and the ability to attack the basket like an All-Star. He will look to parlay that talent into an impressive showing in his rookie season.\n\nIf he does that, a bump in his NBA 2K rating is sure to follow.", "description": "If the chance to win Rookie of the Year, lead the  New Orleans Pelicans  to the playoffs and live up to sky-high expectations isn't enough for  Zion Williamson , he can draw motivation ...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/787/hi-res-19715f9e05b617f2af747c05fd1fc813_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
