Separate studies conducted following the report\u2019s initial release did not find a link between any vaccine and autism, ultimately debunking its claims.\n\n\u201cI made what I thought was an informed decision at the time,\u201d she said.\n\nEdward-Lasenby\u2019s son Cameron later contracted the measles, an experience she said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t wish on anybody\u201d and which she noted could have been prevented if her son had been vaccinated against measles with the MMR vaccine.\n\nAfter initially being diagnosed with the flu, Cameron\u2019s condition quickly worsened, Edward-Lasenby said. He suffered from a rash and conjunctivitis \u2014 common signs of measles.\n\n\"[The doctors] took one look at him and said, 'You can get him to the hospital first or we can get an ambulance here,'\" she said.\n\nOnce they arrived, Cameron was confirmed to have measles.\n\n\"I believe that it\u2019s important to immunize. We wouldn\u2019t be in that position [if we had]. I played Russian roulette with my son\u2019s health, which I\u2019m not proud of.\u201d \u2014 Ally Edward-Lasenby\n\n\u201cInitially, he had white spots on his mouth,\" she said. \"He had conjunctivitis. He was really unwell. He continued to deteriorate, and a rash came all over his body. Then they were talking about brain damage \u2014 potential brain damage \u2014 and the potential loss of life too because it was quite serious.\"\n\nThe measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes. Others can contract measles when they breathe the contaminated air or touch a contaminated surface, and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.\n\n\u201cInfected people can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears,\u201d says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.\n\nThe MMR vaccine can protect both individuals and other people from contracting the virus.\n\nYoung children are typically most at risk of contracting measles. The CDC recommends children get two doses of the MMR vaccination, but the first dose is typically given to children when they are between 12 and 15 months old, with the second occurring between ages 4 and 6.\n\nAPPARENT ANTI-VAXXER WEARING 'JESUS WASN\u2019T VACCINATED' SHIRT SLAMMED ON TWITTER\n\nAfter he was treated for measles, Cameron developed pneumonia, his mother said. As a result, he suffered from a compromised immune system for months.\n\n\u201cHe was in and out of school on a regular basis,\u201d she said.\n\n\"I believe that it\u2019s important to immunize.
