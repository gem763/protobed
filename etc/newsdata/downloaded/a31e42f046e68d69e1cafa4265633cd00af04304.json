Policy is not on a preset course,\" Powell said.\n\nWednesday's rate cut is the third of the year, coming after moves in July and September.\n\nPowell teed up the first rate cut by coining the \"act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\" language in June. The phrase had been included in each subsequent Fed statement before being removed after this week's two-day FOMC meeting.\n\nThe cuts have represented an about-face for the Fed, which had been indicating heading into 2019 that two additional rate hikes likely would be appropriate after nine increases since December 2015.\n\n\"Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market and inflation near our 2% objective as most likely,\" Powell said. \"Our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.\"", "description": "Powell indicated that the \"midcycle\" adjustment he has been talking about for the past five months is likely at an end.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105473028-1537988348850gettyimages-1041032772.jpeg?v=1572281573", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
