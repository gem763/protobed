Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on Tuesday afternoon, after joining Trump for a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan on Monday. \u201cI appreciate the phone calls yesterday with Erdogan, I think [Trump] reached out in a good way to let Turkey know they needed a cease fire right now.\u201d\n\n\"I blame Turkey but I look to President Trump to fix this,\" Graham added later on Fox News.\n\nIt was just a few days ago that Graham let loose on Trump as potentially \u201ctired of fighting radical Islam\u201d and compared him to the GOP\u2019s favorite bogeyman, Barack Obama. The president has since embraced sanctions, engaged with Erdogan and dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence to Turkey to start ceasefire talks. Trump\u2019s administration will spend the week shoring up Republican support.\n\nBut already, the GOP fury toward Trump is winding down \u2014 just the latest example of how eager Republicans are to avoid a breach with the president and a reminder of how difficult it will be for Democrats to win over Republicans in the fast-moving impeachment inquiry.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/65/8d/3f83b7734d87b86ea0e97722a109/trump-syria.png\"\n\n\u201cLook, Obama didn't have a strategy in Syria and unfortunately that's what President Trump inherited. This was an untenable situation in a civil war,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). \u201cI don't think the actual decision, itself, is surprising when you consider the alternatives.\u201d\n\nIt appears impossible for the U.S. government to ever fully reverse the consequences of Trump\u2019s abrupt decision: a bloody Turkish incursion that freed hundreds of Islamic State terrorists, a deal between the Kurds and the Syrian government long opposed by the U.S. and a rise in Russian and Iranian influence in the region. But the White House is going all-out to win over Republicans, with the president hosting lawmakers from both parties at the White House on Wednesday and scheduling an all-senators briefing for later in the week.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper met with House Republicans on Tuesday, where he explained the administration\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria\u2019s northern border, according to Republicans who were present. Esper told lawmakers that Trump received a phone call from Turkey\u2019s president that they were going to move ahead with their planned military offensive in \u201c48 hours,\u201d leaving the United States with few options.\n\nRepublicans are still dissatisfied with the situation overseas, and they may pass a tough sanctions bill against Turkey or vote to formally recommend the Trump administration reverse its position. But they are also taking aim at Democrats and leaving out the personal references to Trump.\n\nLast week, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) called out the \u201cbetrayal of the Kurds\u201d and said, \u201cPresident Trump should rethink this decision immediately.\u201d On Tuesday through a spokesman, he said he still \u201copposes the administration\u2019s withdrawal from Northern Syria [but] supports sanctions targeting Turkey\u2019s military, economy, and top officials.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas) backs a House resolution urging the administration to reverse its position. But he made clear that it\u2019s about policy, not Trump himself.\n\n\u201cIt does not condemn the president. It condemns Turkey. It condemns the policy of withdrawing but it does not condemn the president,\u201d McCaul said. The resolution does not directly reference the president other than in its recap of recent events that led to the chaos in Syria.\n\nBoth McCaul and Graham also turned the criticism away from Republican infighting and onto Democrats. McCaul complained that Democrats are treating a nonbinding resolution as a direct rebuke to Trump and Graham urged them to do more than write a resolution \u2014 \u201cnot just criticizing President Trump but being for the idea that we need a residual force\u201d in Syria.\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) saw an opportunity to hammer the Democratic presidential candidates. He noted Tuesday that 70 senators supported keeping a U.S. presence in Syria in a vote earlier this year \u2014 but not most of the party\u2019s 2020 contenders.\n\n\u201cI hope those aspiring commanders in chief are asked to explain how they reconcile their criticism of the administration today with their voters just a few months ago. Maybe they\u2019ll even be asked on the debate stage this evening,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nIt was a shift from when McConnell pressed Trump directly to rethink his position last week and said Monday that he was \u201cgravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation\u2019s apparent response thus far.\u201d By Tuesday, he was \u201cheartened\u201d that the administration was sending administration officials overseas.\n\n\u201cThe initial reaction by many Republicans reflected what they\u2019ve been saying to us behind the scenes for a long time,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \u201cIf they come back to town here and they\u2019re getting religion from the White House, it really is a sad commentary on the party.\u201d\n\nA group of Capitol Hill leaders \u2014 including McCaul and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise \u2014 will meet with Trump at the White House Wednesday to discuss the situation in Syria and a potential legislative response. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been in contact with Graham, while House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) is teaming up with McCaul on a package of sanctions that the Texas Republican described as \u201cvery targeted in scope.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans are keeping their powder dry until after they huddle with the president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of conversations that are still ongoing,\" Scalise said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham turned the criticism away from Republican infighting and onto Democrats. | Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images\n\nSenate Republicans were noncommittal on whether Graham and Sen. Chris Van Hollen\u2019s (D-Md.) sanctions bill or the nonbinding resolution will come to the floor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to be discussing a number of different options on the best approach there,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cAs you know there are very strong objections among our members to what\u2019s happening in Syria.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s plenty of lingering discontent in the party.\n\nThe sanctions deployed under Trump\u2019s executive authority are \u201cnot enough to counteract it but given the events that have happened at this point, it\u2019s probably the most you can do in the short term,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who did not mention the president directly on Tuesday. \u201cThere's no way to undo some of the damages from it.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials are planning to brief all senators on Thursday. They are sure to face a lot of questions from the GOP, but it\u2019s unclear how adversarial their GOP audience will be if the administration takes a tough approach toward Turkey, reassures senators on the Islamic State and commits to assisting the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWith the sanctions that we\u2019re proposing and other actions, I do support those. I am very cognizant of the fact that the Kurds worked so well with us,\u201d said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who said last week she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the administration's policies and urged them not to \u201cabandon\u201d the Kurds.\n\nDespite the more measured response on Tuesday, some Republicans who have sought distance from Trump kept the heat on the president on Monday. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said the administration\u2019s efforts were not enough thus far.\n\n\u201cI disagree very strongly with the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Collins said Tuesday.\n\nShe was one of the few willing to still castigate the president directly, little more than a week after Trump\u2019s decision inflamed most in his party.\n\nQuint Forgey contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/50/37/3f397b0d48e5b6ea1c9d904cc1c3/20191015-syria-kurds-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
