You could have killed her then you would have been facing a murder charge.\"\n\nThe judge said Gaffney had an unhappy childhood, adding: \"Your mother and father had a toxic relationship and eventually split up. Your mother had a number of relationships that were not long in duration and each one resulted in your four siblings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Your mother has had issues with drink and drugs and unsuitable relationships. That was something you resented.\"\n\nCraig Lowe, prosecuting, told Grimsby Crown Court said the mother was cooking supper when she went to her daughter's bedroom and found her playing with razor blades.\n\nAfter taking them from her, the mum was followed into the kitchen where Gaffney grabbed a 7in knife that her mother was using to chop vegetables.\n\nGaffney took the knife back to her room and she was followed by her mum, resulting in a heated row.\n\n(Image: scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk)\n\nThe teen pulled her mother's hair and \"plunged the knife into her mother's chest from behind,\" said Mr Lowe.\n\nOne of the mum's sons gave a towel to the injured woman, but Gaffney offered no assistance, the court heard.\n\nMr Lowe said the mother returned to the kitchen, sat on the floor and called a friend before passing out.\n\nGaffney then kicked her mother twice in the head and disposed of the knife.\n\nWhen the mother was on the phone Gaffney shouted \"I should have dug it in deeper\", said Mr Lowe.\n\nGaffney lied to police, claiming her mother - who made a swift recovery - had stabbed herself.\n\nIn her victim impact statement, the mum told how she was desperate to have a relationship with her daughter again.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nShe said: \"I just want to hug her. It is horrible not having contact. My life has gone downhill. The last two years have been horrible.\"\n\nShe added: \"I have been asked if I want a restraining order. I said no and just want to hug her. I still love her and want her to get the help she needs.\"\n\nGaffney wept as the statement was read out in court.\n\nMichele Stuart-Lofthouse, defending, said Gaffney had a \"difficult family background\" but had now found some stability after moving in with her partner and his family in Birmingham.\n\nThe judge told the court that Gaffney's mother did not want her to go to prison.\n\nHe said: \"It may be she [the mother] is no role model, but that is no reason to behave like this. You blamed her. You said it was nothing to do with you. She is forgiving.\n\nHe added: \"She wants a relationship with you and you with her and no doubt in time you will. That will depend on you showing everybody that you have changed.\n\n\"If she is able to forgive you for what you have done, you should be able to forgive her for the way she brought you up.\"\n\nGaffney was sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution, suspended for 18 months,\n\nShe was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work.", "description": "Paige Gaffney, who was 16 at the time of the attack, plunged a 7in kitchen knife into her mum's chest from behind in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire", "authors": ["Peter Craig", "Image", "Facebook", "Scunthorpetelegraph.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530119.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Mum-of-five-stabbed-by-own-teenage-daughter-lucky-not-to-have-been-murdered-and-has-forgiven.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
