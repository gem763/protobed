But the crowd did not disappoint him either and greeted him with chants of \"USA!\", most heard at Trump rallies.\n\nThe personal-touch diplomacy with Mr Modi's trademark bear hugs was played to perfection.\n\nThis rally has been called a win-win for both the leaders. For President Trump, it was a chance to court Indian-Americans for the 2020 presidential election race where Texas could emerge as a battleground state. For Mr Modi, a PR triumph and picture with the president of the United States may help him shrug off the criticism over his recent strong-arm polices at home.\n\nTrade talks and the UN General Assembly are on the agenda for Mr Modi during his week-long visit to the United States.\n\nHouston's NRG Stadium, where the event was hosted, was the first stop for Mr Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a landslide victory in this year's Indian elections.\n\nGreeted by a standing ovation, Mr Trump used his speech to heap praise on Mr Modi, who he said was doing a \"truly exceptional job for India\" and its people.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The event, dubbed \"Howdy, Modi!\", was attended by an estimated 50,000 people\n\nMr Trump also paid tribute to the Indian-American community, telling them \"we are truly proud to have you as Americans\".\n\nMr Modi, however, is expected to face a frostier reception at this week's UN General Assembly, where he may face criticism over tensions in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump described Narendra Modi as one of America's most \"loyal friends\"\n\nThe PM stripped Indian-administered Kashmir of its special status last month, promising to restore the region to its \"past glory\".\n\nNo stranger to nationalist rhetoric himself, Mr Trump compared security at the US-Mexico border to the tensions between India and Pakistan in the tinderbox Kashmir region.\n\n\"Both India and US also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders,\" Trump said.", "description": "The US president hails India's prime minister as \"exceptional\", firing up a 50,000-strong crowd.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p1rsf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
