The requested dates are \u201cnot feasible\u201d, he said.\n\nThe speed of the investigation raises \u201csignificant legal and procedural concerns\u201d, Pompeo wrote. \u201cI will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals.\u201d\n\nAfter Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry last week, the foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees have wasted little time in seeking documents and testimonies.\n\nCommittee chairs Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings dismissed Pompeo\u2019s criticisms.\n\n\u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2013 including state department employees \u2013 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cIn response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nThis is the same Pompeo who removed a career ambassador in Ukraine, and stood by as she was subject to smears Jeffrey Prescott\n\nFour of the five witnesses summoned are state department employees and can be prevented from appearing. They include Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, who was withdrawn from her post in May with Pompeo\u2019s consent after she was attacked in the rightwing press. She is currently on sabbatical at Georgetown University.\n\nThe only exception is Kurt Volker, the former special envoy on Ukraine who was acting as a part-time volunteer and resigned on Friday. Volker confirmed on Tuesday that he will speak to three House committees behind closed doors on Thursday, according to the Associated Press, who spoke with an anonymous official familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe official also said that Yovanovitch will appear on 11 October, a date newly agreed on with the committees after she was originally scheduled to appear on Wednesday.\n\nThe state department\u2019s inspector general is due to brief congressional staffers on Wednesday afternoon about documents from the department\u2019s office of the legal adviser. The documents being discussed are thought to be connected to relations with Ukraine and any collaboration between US diplomats and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, ABC News reported.\n\nPompeo was assailed by former officials who saw hypocrisy in his expressions of concern over intimidation of foreign service officers. As a congressman, Pompeo regularly cross-examined diplomats over the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in an attempt to show that Hillary Clinton had been negligent as secretary of state.\n\nState department employees are currently being subjected to questioning over emails they sent to Clinton\u2019s private server when she was in office. According to the Washington Post, the employees have been informed that the emails have been classified retroactively and therefore could represent security violations.\n\nJeffrey Prescott, a former special White House assistant to Barack Obama, said on Twitter: \u201cThis is the same Pompeo who removed a career ambassador from her post in Ukraine, and stood by as she was subject to smears.\u201d\n\nThe White House has stonewalled numerous congressional investigations. Last month it ordered Rob Porter, the ex-White House staff secretary, and Rick Dearborn, who was deputy chief of staff, to defy subpoenas regarding special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Analysts suggest Trump sees little downside in brazen displays of impunity.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kurt Volker, the former special envoy on Ukraine, will testify on Wednesday.

Pompeo received a subpoena from the committees to turn over documents related to the Ukraine investigation. He said he would respond by the deadline of 4 October.\n\nIt also emerged this week that Pompeo participated in the July phone call in which Trump, having frozen military aid, pressed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate baseless allegations against former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe three committee chairs said on Tuesday that if the report of Pompeo being on the call is true, he \u201cis now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry. He should immediately cease intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state began a four-nation tour of Europe on Tuesday in Italy. He was accompanied by the former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, who has a radio show and is travelling as a member of the press. Gorka is a hardline nationalist and former editor for the far-right Breitbart News. He has vehemently denounced the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump is also defying political norms by accusing opponents of treason and making threats to the intelligence community whistleblower who raised concerns about the Zelenskiy call.\n\nIn yet another round of volatile tweets on Tuesday, Trump wondered why he is not \u201centitled to interview [and] learn everything about\u201d the whistleblower, whose identity is protected by law.\n\nThe president also repeated his claim that the July call was \u201cPERFECT\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\u201d\n\nBut the Republican senator Chuck Grassley told reporters the whistleblower \u201cought to be heard out and protected\u201d and requests for confidentiality should be respected.\n\nTrump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nThe crisis has also cast a harsh spotlight on the attorney general, William Barr. The Washington Post revealed that he held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials, seeking their help in a justice department investigation Trump hopes will undermine his own intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe countries concerned were Britain, Australia and Italy.\n\nThe Republican senator Lindsey Graham defended the strategy.\n\n\u201cBarr should be talking to Australia,\u201d he told the Fox News host Sean Hannity. \u201cHe should be talking to Italy. He should be talking to the UK to find out if their intelligence services worked with our intelligence services improperly to open up a counterintelligence investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not doing that he\u2019s not doing his job. So I\u2019m going to write a letter to all three countries \u2026 asking them to cooperate with Barr.\u201d\n\nRichard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush, tweeted: \u201cImpeach Barr and Pompeo after impeaching \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069.\u201d", "description": "Pompeo signals he will not comply but House chairs say any attempt to block testimony would constitute obstruction of justice", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7809f46580e09e037279851520c19d7774c2e6e8/0_294_4413_2648/master/4413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4bfde3731b63d349a102dd8a0454e8e1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
