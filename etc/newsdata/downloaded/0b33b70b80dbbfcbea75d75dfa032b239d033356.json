It had previously guided for sales growth of 25%-30%.\n\nIt also upheld its guidance that its EBITDA margin would stay at around 10% this year, banishing fears that the need to invest in rapid upscaling would eat into profits as it has done among some of its rivals.\n\nThe shares rose as high as 285.95 pence before retreating to 277.36 by 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), still a gain of 14% on the day. They\u2019re now up 58% so far this year, with only German rival Zalando (DE: ) \u2013 which had fallen much more sharply at the end of 2018 \u2013 performing better in the fashion space.\n\nThe latest upgrade to Boohoo\u2019s forecasts comes only weeks after its latest acquisitions, which bolstered a growing reputation for snapping up brands on the cheap. It bought the online business of Karen Millen and Coast out of insolvency proceedings last month, in what could be a significant departure upmarket for a company that has previously concentrated on low-cost items for the younger audience.\n\nFurther afield, Europe\u2019s markets rose for a fifth day out of the last six, supported by hopes of trade d\u00e9tente between the U.S. and China after the Chinese Commerce Ministry said they would meet for talks in early October. The U.S. side said only the talks would take place \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nThe benchmark Euro was up 0.5% at 385.24, its highest since early August. It\u2019s now up 5.5% from the depths it plumbed after the escalation of the trade war at the start of last month.\n\nThe German was the biggest beneficiary, with exporters and cyclical goods pushing it to a 0.8% gain. That was despite a bigger-than-expected drop in manufacturing orders in July that puts Europe\u2019s biggest economy on track for a second straight quarter of contraction in the third quarter.\n\nThe rally in Italy also continued, the adding 0.4% as the new government of Giuseppe Conte was sworn in. In both Germany and Italy, chipmakers were the biggest gainers after a sectoral upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE: ) on Wednesday. Infineon (SIX: ) rose 4.3% while STMicroelectronics (PA: ) was up 4.0%.\n\nThe U.K. was the only major index in negative territory, reflecting further gains in sterling after the House of Commons voted to block a \"No-Deal\" Brexit on Oct. 31. The bill is likely pass into law by Friday, according to the Press Association, but that won\u2019t end the political uncertainty, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to press for a General Election.", "description": "StockBeat: Europe's Hottest Fast-Fashion Stock Is No Sob Story", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE8P0KP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
