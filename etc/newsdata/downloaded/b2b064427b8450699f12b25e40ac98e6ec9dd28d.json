The 'Golliwog' is an inherently racist caricature, influenced by the blackface minstrels of yesteryear - symbols of black oppression. The Golliwog entered into popular culture during the mid-20th century and some still claim it holds nostalgic memories, however, many businesses that have sold the dolls or the biscuits have been asked to remove advertisements or products from their shelves.\n\nNi**er Boy Licorice\n\nImage: Museums Victoria\n\nThe National Licorice company produced these licorice blocks throughout the 1950s and 1960s and, according to the Museum of victoria, these kinds of snacks show how racist African American stereotypes were once imported into the country. Looking through the advertisements for this snack in the Museums Victoria collection, it's pretty obvious why it doesn't exist anymore.\n\nRedskins\n\nThe debate around the term 'redskin' has been raging in the US for some time now - one of the major NFL teams are still known as the 'Redskins' - and Native Americans have been subject to the pejorative term since the era of slave labour in American plantations. Originally, the chewy lolly was wrapped with an image of a Native American in full headdress, but now Allen's has changed the logo to be a simple combination of red and purple typeface.\n\nFags\n\nImage: Riviera\n\nNow known as FADS fun sticks these days, this Australian musk-flavoured snack - shaped like a cigarette - is the double whammy of inappropriateness. Not only was the snack shaped like a cigarette, complete with a red tip (as if the cigarette was alight), it was also known as a 'fag'. Yes, it was a slang term for cigarettes back in the day, but it's also a homophobic slur. Attitudes have changed dramatically towards both smoking and same-sex relationships since fags were first introduced and they were rightfully renamed to Fads in the '90s.\n\nCreole Creams\n\nImage: Museums Victoria\n\nWhen Coles introduced a home brand Oreo-style chocolate biscuit with white cream filling back in 2009, they decided to name them 'Creole' creams. Someone from marketing definitely got fired for this one, because 'creole' had for years been a term used to describe a person of mixed heritage. Sam Watson, deputy director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Unit at University of Queensland, was quoted by the Brisbane Times as saying \"'The word Creole comes from a period when people's humanity was measured by the amount of white blood they had in their bloodstream.\" Coles stood by the branding initially, but public backlash eventually forced them to change the name.\n\nThis article has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "Plenty of iconic Aussie snacks didn't deserve to die but Australia has had a slightly sordid history when it comes to keeping our snacks free of racist and homophobic undertones.
