He\u2019s had a stable career with just that franchise, but he was involved in at least one significant trade.\n\nIn his father\u2019s fantasy football keeper league.\n\n\u201cMy dad actually did not draft me when I came out,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cOne of his buddies did, and my dad traded for me, so I\u2019m on his team to this day.\u201d\n\nThe image of a father rooting on his son because of the fantasy implications is amusing to think about, but Rudolph\u2019s endearing anecdote may be reasonably common nowadays. The 29-year-old tight end is part of a generation of players who grew up as fantasy leagues were becoming part of the mainstream sports culture in America.\n\nNo discussion of the modern NFL and its popularity is complete without acknowledging this phenomenon - in which fans all over the country compete for championships of their own as owners of virtual franchises.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably, as an offensive skill player, the most common thing that you hear out in public: \u2018Hey, I had you on my fantasy team last year,\u2019 or, \u2018Hey, I have you on my fantasy team this year,\u2019\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cFans are all about it, and it\u2019s really changed kind of the landscape of the sports fan.\u201d\n\nFrom 2007 to 2017, the number of people playing fantasy football more than tripled, from 13.8 million to 42.7 million, according to the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association. This past Sunday, ESPN\u2019s fantasy app drew 8.3 million unique users - its biggest day ever - according to ESPN and Adobe Analytics.\n\nNetworks, websites and even NFL teams all seem to understand the draw of fantasy leagues, and their importance to fans watching at home and in stadiums.\n\n\u201cAnything that\u2019s good for overall NFL fandom is good for the individual clubs,\u201d said Emily Griffin, vice president of marketing for the Detroit Lions. \u201cWe consistently hear from (fans): \u2018We want more fantasy stats, we want more out-of-town scores.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Rudolph describes his father\u2019s league, it sounds almost prehistoric compared to the internet-powered drafts and stat trackers of today.\n\n\u201cThey started playing in 1979 when they were seniors in high school,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously at that time, you don\u2019t have computers and internet, you get the scores on TV afterward and get the newspaper to get the box scores, and it was points only. So it didn\u2019t matter how many catches, how many yards, how many carries. \u2026 It\u2019s a keeper league, so my dad had played since 1979 and had Dan Marino for his whole career, Peyton Manning for his whole career.\u201d\n\nRudolph says his dad\u2019s league still keeps score by hand, but the internet has obviously revolutionized the way many people follow their fantasy leagues and research players.\n\n\u201cThere were certain things that, just, the internet was made for,\u201d said Rob Phythian, a co-founder of Fanball, which began producing the magazine Fantasy Football Weekly in 1993. \u201cThe internet was made for league management, right? It was a natural.\u201d\n\nPhythian identified three turning points in the growth of fantasy football.\n\n\u201cThe first one was, I think we can take some credit for improving the content to make it more current. The second one\u2019s league management online,\u201d Phythian said. \u201cThe third was the leagues and the big marketing channels embracing fantasy. That came later, it didn\u2019t come first. It came, I would say, 2003ish, where they finally gave up on saying that it\u2019s gambling and understood it was like office pool on steroids, really.\u201d\n\nNow that sports betting is legal and operating in nearly a dozen states, the next innovations may blur the line a bit between that and fantasy sports.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is coming next is we\u2019re going to see hybrid fantasy-gambling products in the marketplace,\u201d said Paul Charchian, president of the FSGA. \u201cAs the gambling companies realize that there\u2019s 50 million Americans that know and love fantasy, and that they want something that\u2019s a player-based outcome for sports betting, and so I think that\u2019s a huge area of potential growth.\u201d\n\nThe growth so far has already been substantial, and that\u2019s evident every weekend during the season. A sports bar on an NFL Sunday might include several different kinds of fans. Some might be watching their favorite team, and some might just be glancing from TV to TV, looking for their fantasy players. Some might be trying to do both.\n\n\u201cThe generation before ours, you were a fan of whatever team or wherever you lived or wherever you watched,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cNow people are growing up being just fans of players because they have them on their fantasy team, and it\u2019s amazing how fantasy has really changed the landscape in sports.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Dave Campbell contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Rudolph is now in his ninth season with the Minnesota Vikings, the team that drafted him in 2011.
