Biden.\n\nThe speaker brushed aside Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to release a transcript Wednesday that he said would prove his innocence. She said the president\u2019s admissions already demonstrate that he has broken the law.\n\n\u201cThe times have found us today,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to place ourselves in the same category of greatness as our founders, but to place us in the urgency of protecting and defending our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d\n\nNo president in modern history has been the target of impeachment in his first term heading into a reelection campaign. President Clinton was impeached in his second term but not removed from office by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned in his second term while facing certain impeachment.\n\nMr. Trump, attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York, dismissed the development as \u201ca continuation of the witch hunt.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Top House Republican: Pelosi impeachment inquiry empty gesture\n\nCongressional Republicans called Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s move an empty gesture because Democratic committees already said they were acting under the rubric of impeachment. They said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t change anything.\n\n\u201cWhat she said today is no different than what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican.\n\nIf Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s move didn\u2019t break any legal ground, it did signal a major shift among Democrats, with dozens of members rushing to climb aboard the impeachment train this week in the wake of reporting that Mr. Trump tried to rope Ukraine into boosting his political fortunes.\n\nHours before Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s announcement, the president authorized the release of an unredacted transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said the transcript will disprove Democrats\u2019 suspicions that he threatened to withhold $391 million in military aid from Ukraine unless its president agreed to investigate the role of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter in a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\n\u201cHow can you do [impeachment] and you haven\u2019t even seen the phone call?\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president predicted that the move will backfire on Democrats and be \u201ca positive for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s doing the best it\u2019s ever done. They\u2019re going to lose the election,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nTop Democrats said the phone transcript alone won\u2019t be enough to spare Mr. Trump. They also are demanding that the administration turn over to Congress a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against him pertaining to his reported attempt to shake down the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cSimply to release the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the American public and the Congress to see what actually happened,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.\n\nHe led the Senate to approve a resolution Tuesday demanding that the complaint be turned over to Congress. Republicans joined in that call, even though allies of the president pointed out that the unidentified whistleblower, a national security employee, wasn\u2019t listening in on the phone call and apparently got the information secondhand.\n\nThe White House was preparing to release the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the inspector general\u2019s report about the complaint, Politico reported Tuesday evening.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican, tweeted that \u201camazingly Democrats now say the whistleblower complaint is more important\u201d than the transcript of the phone call.\n\n\u201cFolks, the \u2018whistleblower\u2019 wasn\u2019t on the call,\u201d Mr. Meadows tweeted. \u201cThey think a secondhand account of the call will tell you more than the *actual call*.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged that he did discuss the Bidens during the call but said the transcript will prove he did not ask Ukraine\u2019s leader for any political favors. He said he withheld the military aid from mid-July until Sept. 11 because he was trying to persuade European allies to contribute their fair share to Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia.\n\n\u201cThere was never any quid pro quo,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI said, \u2018Hold it up. Let\u2019s get other people to pay.\u2019 I think that other countries should be paying also. I wanted to get other countries.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pelosi, though, said the president\u2019s confirmation of the call was a \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the whistleblower at the center of the controversy is looking to testify before his committee \u201cas soon as this week.\u201d Although the committee was still working to finalize a hearing, he told reporters that it would be behind closed doors.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly has dropped its objection to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony.\n\nIn Wilmington, Delaware, Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump\u2019s stonewalling would likely leave Democrats with no choice but to start impeachment proceedings. He said the impeachment of Mr. Trump \u201cwould be a tragedy of his own making.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not the conduct of an American president,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cIt is the abuse of power. It undermines our national security. It violates his oath of office, and it strikes at the heart of the sworn responsibility of the president.\u201d\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates who were reluctant to call for impeachment proceedings reversed themselves Tuesday. They said they now believe Mr. Trump went too far by trying to pressure Ukraine.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats who were agitating to begin impeachment proceedings said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s announcement was a watershed moment.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi is telling us that we\u2019re full steam ahead and the country will be with us if they aren\u2019t already,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, Maryland Democrat, told reporters.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what changes with Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s announcement. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, has been telling courts for two months that he has been conducting an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHis committee is looking into Mr. Trump\u2019s personal business dealings and retracing the trail of special counsel Robert Mueller, who said there could be reason to believe Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said she is directing Mr. Nadler and five other committee chairmen to continue their work under the \u201cumbrella of impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nRep. James A. Himes, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the intelligence committee \u2014 one of the six panels Mrs. Pelosi said is operating as part of the inquiry \u2014 said he figures they will forward all of their findings to Mr. Nadler, who as Judiciary Committee chairman would lead any impeachment proceedings.\n\nStill, some lawmakers said the investigations aren\u2019t enough. Based on what they have seen, they said, the House should skip the inquiry stage and draw up articles of impeachment.\n\nImpeachment is the equivalent of a political indictment and can be approved with a majority vote in the House. If articles of impeachment are approved, then the Senate holds a trial. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict and remove the president.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, signaled that the Senate isn\u2019t about to follow Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s lead. He said Democrats have made a \u201crush to judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt simply confirms that House Democrats\u2019 priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly 3-year-old fixation on impeachment,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic counts showed that an overwhelming majority of House Democrats support beginning impeachment, and polling shows Democratic voters are with them. Republicans and independents have consistently dismissed the idea of impeachment in surveys.\n\nDemocrats had been expecting that flash points, such as the release of the special counsel\u2019s report this spring, Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony to Congress in July and testimony by former top Trump aides over the past few months, would sway the public, yet polling hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday night showed that 37% of Americans think Mr. Trump should be impeached, down from 41% in the same survey a month ago. The polling was conducted after reports about the Ukraine controversy surfaced.\n\nMr. Trump on Tuesday insisted the real malfeasance belongs to Mr. Biden and his son, who earned about $3 million from the Ukrainian energy company. As vice president in 2016, Mr. Biden threatened Ukraine\u2019s leaders that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless they fired the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, whose office had been investigating the gas company. Mr. Biden and other Obama administration officials said they sought the prosecutor\u2019s removal for failing to pursue corruption, not to take any heat off Hunter Biden.\n\nMr. Trump said in a Twitter message that the transcript will show his call with Ukraine\u2019s president was \u201cvery friendly and totally appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. conference, said Tuesday that he respects Mr. Trump and wants the unceasing support of the U.S.\n\nMr. Zelensky said he expects his meeting with Mr. Trump \u201cwill be very warm.\u201d\n\nThe president pointed out that the money was released to Ukraine after a two-month wait.\n\n\u201cAs far as withholding funds, they were paid,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey were fully paid. I want other countries to put up money. People called me and said, \u2018Let it go,\u2019 and I let it go.\u201d\n\nA search of the White House website doesn\u2019t reveal any summaries, or readouts, of phone calls made by Mr. Trump with foreign leaders last summer in which he discussed further payments for Ukraine\u2019s defense.\n\nThe president said Tuesday that, similar to his complaints about NATO members not paying their fair share for the common defense of Europe, other European allies should be contributing more to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cWe paid the money,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut very importantly, Germany, France, other countries should put up money. And that\u2019s been my complaint from the beginning.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
