It underpins the growing power of these transnational crime groups.\u201d\n\nThe most valuable markets in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea account for $20 billion, or a third of the high-end estimate of the trade, the agency added.\n\nMore than 12 million users in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand consumed about 320 tonnes of pure methamphetamine last year and a record 120 tonnes was seized by law enforcement.\n\nCrystal meth is mostly consumed by middle-class party-goers in developed countries. In poorer nations, users take it as tablets mixed with caffeine, often to help cope with gruelling work in factories and at construction sites.\n\nMONEY LAUNDERING\n\nMushrooming poorly regulated casinos in Southeast Asia offer criminals an easy way to launder illicit earnings, the agency said, and such funds can go through the formal banking system in wealthy Singapore and the financial hub of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThere has been a proliferation of casinos, something that is rarely talked about and deserves attention,\u201d said Douglas, adding that Southeast Asian casino numbers have swelled to 230 after a money-laundering crackdown in the gambling hub of Macau.\n\nResponding to Thursday\u2019s report, a Thai senator offered to join hands with the agency and other nations to fight the menace.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to take a leadership role and work with UNODC and international partners to build resilience and address cross-border trafficking,\u201d said Prajin Juntong, who is also a former deputy prime minister.\n\nOrganised crime groups also fuel a rising trade in counterfeit goods and medicines, people-smuggling and trafficking of wildlife and timber, the report added.\n\n\u201cWildlife and timber trafficking is also an emergency,\u201d said Douglas, calling for a joint combat effort. \u201cExtinction is on the horizon.\u201d", "description": "Transnational crime groups are trafficking vast quantities of methamphetamine made in Southeast Asia, the United Nations said on Thursday, putting the value of the Asia-Pacific market for the drug between $30.3 billion (24.4 billion pounds) and $61.4 billion.", "authors": ["Tom Allard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
