Therefore, the votes from the Egyptian FA could not be counted.\u201d\n\nFIFA did not clarify if the final standings would have been any different if the votes had been valid.\n\nAlthough Egypt\u2019s votes from their captain and coach did not count, their media representative Hany Danial\u2019s choices (Sadio Mane, Cristiano Ronaldo and Salah) were listed on FIFA\u2019s website.", "description": "Mohamed Salah appears to have again fallen out with Egypt's soccer federation after the country's votes for FIFA's player of the year awards were deemed invalid and therefore did not count towards the striker's overall tally.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434165356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P191-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
