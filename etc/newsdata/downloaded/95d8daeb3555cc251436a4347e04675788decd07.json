Can\u2019t be possible!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut for many Republican lawmakers, the moves to discredit Vindman\u2019s character were a bridge too far \u2014 suggesting that the escalating attacks on the witnesses testifying about Trump\u2019s alleged misconduct may have a limit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). \u201cIt\u2019s shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process.\u201d\n\nThe competing messages reflect internal tensions among many Republicans as they seek to balance defending Trump with upholding some of their long-standing principles.\n\nWhile Trump has pushed for GOP lawmakers to \u201cget tougher and fight,\u201d he has embraced scorched-earth rhetoric that some in his party have struggled to defend. Over the past month, Trump has compared impeachment to a \u201clynching,\u201d described his GOP critics as \u201chuman scum,\u201d called for the unmasking of a federally protected whistleblower and accused administration officials testifying against him of being unpatriotic, or worse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs his attacks have escalated, the Republican response has been disjointed, with loyalists embracing offensive terms such as \u201clynching\u201d and others distancing themselves from the harsh language and tactics.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump\u2019s campaign to brand his opponents as part of a \u201cDeep State\u201d cabal of government officials working against him ran headlong into the biography of Vindman, who fled the Soviet Union with his family as a child and who received a Purple Heart after being injured by a roadside bomb in Iraq.\n\nVindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, found himself in the president\u2019s crosshairs as he prepared to tell Congress that he was concerned that Trump had sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Democrats. While his testimony was the latest in a string of damaging revelations by Trump administration officials, the effort by some Republicans to discredit him based on his birthplace created another fault line in the GOP\u2019s impeachment response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking on Fox News on Monday, former George W. Bush administration official John Yoo said he found it \u201castounding\u201d that Vinland had reportedly been speaking with Ukrainian officials who sought guidance on how to deal with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cAnd some people might call that espionage,\u201d said Yoo, after host Laura Ingraham said she found the Iraq War veteran\u2019s background, language skills and interactions with the Ukrainian government \u201cinteresting.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday, Yoo was walking back his comment after several elected Republicans said attacking Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the United States was inappropriate. Yoo told the Washington Examiner Tuesday that he was accusing the Ukrainian government of potential espionage, not Vindman.\n\nAD\n\nDuffy, who said on CNN that he did not know if Vindman was putting American interests above Ukrainian interests, also backtracked later Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, adding that he was only trying to highlight that Vindman was \u201can unelected advisor.\u201d\n\nThose retreats came after several elected Republicans admonished some Trump defenders for their willingness to denigrate a veteran.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to question Vindman\u2019s patriotism.\n\n\n\nIn his opening statement, which was obtained by The Washington Post, Vindman described himself as a \u201cpatriot\u201d and said he thought Trump\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to launch investigations targeting Democrats was inappropriate.\n\nAD\n\nHis testimony added to the growing collection of evidence implicating Trump in an apparent quid pro quo linking military aid or a White House visit for Ukraine to political investigations. It also forced Republican lawmakers to decide whether they would embrace a dual-loyalty smear being pushed by some conservative pundits and right-wing figures seeking to undermine Vinland\u2019s account.\n\nAD\n\nWhile many opted against taking that approach against a decorated veteran, Republicans continue to struggle with defending Trump on the substance of the allegations he faces, said Brendan Buck, who served as counselor to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\n\u201cThe ultimate problem is the substance is completely indefensible,\u201d he said. \u201cMembers can\u2019t stomach arguing the merits so you get attacks on credibility and the process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has already expressed his displeasure with Republicans\u2019 process-focused approach, calling for a more robust defense of his dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cSo one thing I said, I\u2019d rather go into the details of the case rather than process,\u201d Trump told reporters Monday, relaying a conversation with GOP lawmakers.\n\nDefending Trump on the allegations has become increasingly difficult as several members of Trump\u2019s administration have effectively testified against him.\n\nAD\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony echoed the opening statement delivered last week by William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor, a Vietnam War veteran and career diplomat, told lawmakers he was alarmed by the White House push for an improper quid pro quo shortly after the Trump administration tapped him to be the top liaison to the Ukrainian government in Kyiv.\n\nAD\n\nLike Vindman, Taylor used his opening statement to stress his bipartisan background and his decades of public service. Few Republican lawmakers have attacked Taylor personally after his testimony, which directly implicated Trump in an improper quid pro quo.\n\nTrump, however, has been more than willing to question whether his critics love the \u00adcountry.\n\n\u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats,\u201d Trump said last week after Taylor\u2019s testimony rocked Washington. \u201cWatch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs some Republicans distanced themselves from that description, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham expanded its meaning in an interview with Fox News.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe people who are against him and who have been against him and working against him since the day they took office are just that,\u201d she said, indicating that the slur applies to all of the president\u2019s opponents. \u201cThey deserve strong language like that.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has not attacked Vindman\u2019s heritage, many of his most ardent supporters have begun pointing to his Ukrainian background. The charge of dual loyalty \u2014 even that Vindman was acting as a \u201cdouble agent\u201d \u2014 quickly gained traction in right-wing corners of the Internet.\n\nThe conspiracy theory was advanced by Jack Posobiec, a far-right provocateur known for promoting the \u201cPizzagate\u201d lie. In a tweet, he falsely claimed that Vindman was working with his \u201chome country\u201d to thwart Trump\u2019s agenda. He cited the New York Times as his source, though the notion appeared nowhere in the newspaper\u2019s reporting.\n\nAD\n\nThe falsehood gained more than 10,000 retweets Tuesday, and the same claim was also repeated word for word by other accounts. Others amplifying the smear against Vindman included Ryan Fournier, the co-chairman of Students for Trump.\n\nLeon Panetta, who served as a defense secretary and CIA director in past Democratic administrations, said the campaign against Vindman amounts to \u201can attack on what America is all about as a nation of immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis combination of a commander in chief who demeans people who served this country, combined with other leaders criticizing those who served the country, are just contributing to an American decline,\u201d he said.", "description": "While Trump has pushed for GOP lawmakers to \u201cget tougher and fight,\u201d he has embraced scorched-earth rhetoric that some in his party have struggled to defend.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1hh9mHR_8DKp2vpREZNV-fqV5mY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H2TIHZHXJAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
