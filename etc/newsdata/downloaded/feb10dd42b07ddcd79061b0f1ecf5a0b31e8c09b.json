It\u2019s not just as easy to say \u2018we dropped sitters\u2019.\n\n\u201cThere are a few bits that we\u2019ll want to clean up with our performance but that\u2019s the whole point of the practice games: to get settled in.\u201d\n\nFast bowlers Mahmood and Brown were in England colours for the first time, as was Somerset opener Tom Banton.\n\nBrown went through his repertoire of variations but leaked 39 runs from his four overs while Mahmood\u2019s last two deliveries were both dispatched beyond the ropes to spoil his figures as he finished with nought for 35.\n\nBanton, meanwhile, launched his second ball for six as he partnered Bairstow at the top of the order before being dismissed for 11, trapped lbw by Lockie Ferguson, one of five current or former internationals who lined up for the hosts.\n\nAssessing the debutants, Bairstow said: \u201cIt went well. It was something to let the guys get settled in. This won\u2019t be the perfect performance from them, there\u2019s bound to be nerves, bound to be bits that they\u2019ll want to improve.\n\n\u201cBut the conditions, running into the wind from the (bowlers), it\u2019s a huge effort to be running in and trying to execute your skills the first time you\u2019ve played for England, so I thought they did really well.\u201d\n\nBairstow was omitted from the Test portion of the tour, following an average of just 20.25 in nine matches this year, but he is not dwelling on his axing.\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m on this tour to naturally score as many runs as possible, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be the key to winning games of cricket.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be going out there thinking \u2018let\u2019s get some low scores\u2019, you want to go out and get as many runs as possible.\n\n\u201cSelection is gone now, I\u2019ve got some things to work on, I\u2019m working very hard and I\u2019m really enjoying that challenge.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Jonny Bairstow insists the strong wind was a factor in England\u00a0dropping several chances during their Twenty20 warm-up win over a New Zealand\u00a0XI in Lincoln.
