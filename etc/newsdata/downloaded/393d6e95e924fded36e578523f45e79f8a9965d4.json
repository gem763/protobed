Mark Meadows, R-N.C., earlier this month, claimed Schiff has exposed himself as \"not a fair arbiter.\"\n\nHe said in order to have a fair impeachment inquiry, if there has to be one, it should be run by House lawmakers who are not \"biased\" as much as Schiff.\n\nThat list, he said, should also not include frequent Trump critics Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., or Maxine Waters, D-Calif.\n\nBiggs' movement to have Schiff recused from the impeachment proceedings is also not being coordinated in any way, but instead has been an organic response from Republicans upset with the process, the Arizona Republican told Cavuto.\n\n\"We're going forward with this because this is the right thing to do,\" he said, adding there is a \"requirement\" to follow House precedent set during past impeachment inquiries.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFormer Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeached by the House.

He is now as you know a fact witness,\" Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said.\n\n\"Nowhere in our justice system allows a fact witness to be the prosecutor.
