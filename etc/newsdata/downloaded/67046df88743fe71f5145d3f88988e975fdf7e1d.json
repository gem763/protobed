I see the same thing happening today for Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE, and I predict she will get the nomination for four of the same reasons: She has the better message. She has the focus. She has the symbols. And she is telling the better story.\n\nBoth candidates have a simple message: They are running against a broken system \u2014 a system that is unfair and leaves too many behind. Trump was going to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and fight for \u201cthe forgotten Americans.\u201d He was going to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and restore the American Dream. Warren is in a battle for the middle class. She is fighting for an America that \u201cworks for all of us, not just the wealthy and well connected.\u201d This fight gives her a platform to talk about what a system \u201cthat works for all of us\u201d looks like. With this, she can inspire her supporters and give them hope.\n\nAnd make no mistake: Her followers are inspired \u2014 just like Trump\u2019s were before hers. That\u2019s why they are waiting for 4-6 hours after a rally to get a selfie with her and hours to get in an arena for him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoth candidates also have simple, repeatable policies that easily turn fans into missionaries. Even four years later, my guess is that you can rattle off what Trump\u2019s policies were: immigration reform, tax reform, getting tough on China, creating jobs, and repealing Obamacare \u2014 Simple. Repeatable. Memorable.\n\nSimilarly, Warren doesn\u2019t give us a convoluted laundry list of policies, she tells us what she is going to do for us. On her website she says, \u201cElizabeth has a lot of plans, but they\u2019re really one simple plan: tackle the corruption in Washington that makes our government work for the wealthy and well-connected, but kicks dirt on everyone else.\u201d She then focuses her talking points on what she will do: end corruption, rebuild the middle class, strengthen our democracy, restore equal justice, and build a foreign policy for all.\n\nThe key here is that she isn\u2019t overwhelming us with details and wonkiness \u2014 though she has the ability. If she stays that course, her focus and discipline will pay off.\n\nThird, both use the power of symbols and visual language. Trump wasn\u2019t just going to get tough on immigration, he was going to build a wall. He didn\u2019t just say his slogan was \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d he made red hats and wore them everywhere. Did you ever imagine wearing a red hat was going to be a political statement?\n\nToday, Warren is creating a symbol out of being a policy wonk. Yes, she has a million ideas, so she\u2019s made a tag line out of that\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd at her rallies, you will see tee shirts with just that phrase on it.\n\nWhen Warren answers a question about how she will tackle a problem, she will start her response by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d It acknowledges a potential criticism with humor and authenticity while creating a positive emotion in potential voters. They want to feel that someone sees their problems and is going to make their lives better. Warren is telling them that person is her. Beyond that one example, it\u2019s clear that she is acutely aware of the power of language. She isn\u2019t running. She is, \u201cstarting a revolution.\u201d She isn\u2019t asking for your vote, she is asking you to, \u201cjoin the fight.\u201d\n\nVisual language. And it works.\n\nSo, despite their differences, if Warren ends up facing off with Trump in 2020, it will be a very equal match. You don\u2019t have to agree with either one of them to see that they both have a winning persuasion strategy. In fact, you can disagree with them entirely. But at least you know where they stand. And, if you disagree with both of them, follow the same formula and create a strategy that will make sure that your candidate wins in 2020.\n\nLee Hartley Carter is the President of maslansky + partners and the author of \u201cPersuasion: Convincing Others When Facts Don\u2019t Seem to Matter.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @lh_carter", "description": "If Warren ends up facing off with Trump in 2020, it will be a very equal match.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenelizabeth_trumpdonald_041919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
