Others were scaling the wire mesh, calling to us to help them.\n\nEx-model in Boris Johnson scandal feels 'betrayed' he hasn't been in touch\n\n\u2018There were no water bowls, just a few empty food bowls scattered around. We learnt the cats had been left without their owner for around a month.\u2019\n\nThe rescue centre stated that they didn\u2019t have the space to take on all the cats, but having seen the \u2018horrific prison they were forced to live in\u2019 they could not walk away.\n\nThey then set about removing all the cats from the house, discovering that \u2018most were underweight and malnourished\u2019, while others had cat flu.\n\nThey are now desperately seeking homes for the cats (Picture: Gainsborough Feral Rescue)\n\nSome of the cats had cat flu (Picture: Gainsborough Feral Rescue)\n\nSome of the animals also had urine burns on their back legs, while one ginger and white cat\u2019s ear had partially rotted away.\n\nWorkers at the rescue centre later discovered the owner had previously been prosecuted and banned from keeping animals in the past.\n\nThe rescue centre set up their crowdfunding page to help them cover the cost of their vet bills for the cats, as well other items, such as litter and food, needed for their care.\n\nThey are also urgently seeking foster owners who will be able to take the animals home.\n\nAt the moment, four of the cats are living in a caravan, while 11 others are in a bedroom at the centre\u2019s headquarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo donate towards the cats click here, and for more information about fostering click here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
