I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said during a Monday morning interview with Fox News. \"He is willing to do it, I think. There is a lot of other people, lawyers and such that may have a problem with it. We will see what happens.\" It is rare that a transcript of a president\u2019s call with a foreign leader would be made public, but this case us unusual because the call is reported to be part of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nPHOTO:President Donald Trump walks over to talk with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Sept. 22, 2019, as he prepares to board Marine One. (Susan Walsh/AP) More\n\nMembers of the White House counsel\u2019s office have been discussing since last week what options are available to them in order to get ahead of any potential legal battle -- one of which includes releasing the transcript either in full or with some redactions.\n\nAdministration sources tell ABC News that the whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint to the inspector general that they learned of the contents of the call between Trump and Ukraine's president second-hand.\n\nPresident Trump on Sunday referenced that reporting in an attempt to undermine the whistleblower's account.\n\nNow the Fake News Media says I \u201cpressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.\u201d This supposedly comes from a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who they say doesn\u2019t even have a first hand account of what was said.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019\n\nHowever, the White House has to date provided no information that calls into question the validity of the information included in the complaint. In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on Sep. 17, DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that after a 14-day preliminary review he believed the complaint \"met the definition of an urgent concern\" and that it \"appeared credible.\"\n\nWhile President Trump has sought to discredit the whistleblower as \"partisan,\" he has not directly disputed any specific reporting on what is alleged in the complaint. And on Sunday, Trump confirmed that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in his call with the Ukrainian President, while defending the call as \"absolutely perfect.\"\n\n\"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory,\" Trump said. \"It was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place. Largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\"\n\nIn a letter over the weekend to her Democratic colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration \"will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\" Pelosi has given a Thursday deadline to the administration to provide information related to the complaint. The deadline is tied to a scheduled appearance by Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire who is expected to testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a readout released from the White House just after the call occurred on July 25, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"to congratulate him on his recent election.\"\n\nA more extensive readout from the Ukrainian president's office, also released after the call, noted that the two also spoke about \"investigations into corruption cases that have hampered interaction between Ukraine and the U.S.A.\"", "description": "Some of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisers are discussing whether to release the transcript of a call the president had with the president of Ukraine in July that is the subject of a whistleblower complaint, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to see,\u201d Trump", "authors": ["John Santucci", "Katherine Faulders", "Alexander Mallin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4KAYjXMP5U3.LtT9C1.NoQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/donald-trump-oval-office-01-ap-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
