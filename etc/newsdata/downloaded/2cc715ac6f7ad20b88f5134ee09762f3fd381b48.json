Players quickly noticed that the new matchmaking queued players up across different platforms, even though this wasn\u2019t mentioned in the patch notes. Today, Epic addressed the issue and said that things are working as intended.\n\nIn a blog post titled \u201cMatchmaking, Bots, Controls, and the Combine Update,\u201d Epic touched on the cross-platform issue. The developer wrote:\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of discussion about potentially unfair competitive advantages from pooling players together across platforms and input devices. The new matchmaking system, however, accounts for various skill levels across different platforms and control inputs, and groups players of similar skill levels together. Our goal with the new matchmaking system is to create fairer matches for all of our players, which includes special considerations for each platform. This means that where similar skill exists, players may be paired against opponents from ALL platforms \u2014 whether they\u2019re using mouse + keyboard, a controller, or touch input. We are closely monitoring match analytics and your feedback, and we\u2019ll make adjustments to ensure everyone is playing a fair match.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a Polyanna-ish response, basically telling players not to worry about facing off against opponents whose platform or input device might give them a gameplay advantage by saying that it\u2019ll all even out somehow. Cross-platform matchmaking introduces some tricky questions.\n\nFor example, does the potential framerate difference between console and PC give PC players an advantage? As a Reddit commenter notes, \u201cA switch player capped at an unstable 30 FPS is still going to be at a disadvantage to a pc player that can play at over 60 FPS. It doesn\u2019t matter the skill level.\u201d\n\nAre a mobile phone and PC player of similar \u201cskill\u201d actually equally matched given their inputs? As another commenter points out, \u201cPC has massive hardware advantages compared to Switch, phone or console. As it is I\u2019m paired against a lot of pc players on console, and despite their lack of game sense, they still aim well due to having a mouse.\u201d This has been an issue that\u2019s riled up a lot of Fortnite\u2019s player base, and Epic telling players to just trust their opaque system doesn\u2019t seem to be helping.\n\nToday\u2019s post contains some additional interesting Fortnite nuggets. Chief among them is that The Combine, a new limited-time obstacle course against bots, is sticking around for the long haul. \u201cWe intend to keep The Combine as a core mode to Fortnite Battle Royale for the foreseeable future,\u201d Epic wrote. I\u2019ve only played through The Combine\u2019s course a couple of times, but I\u2019ve found it to be a great way to warm up and practice my aim, so I\u2019m glad to see it remain in the game.\n\nEpic also provided some answers about adding bots to the main game modes, which is set to happen in the new season that launches next week. The initial implementation of bots will be somewhat limited at first: they won\u2019t be able to drive vehicles or perform a tricky build move called a 90, though Epic writes that \u201clong term we\u2019re looking to see how far we can push our Bots.\u201d Players won\u2019t be able to squad up with or spectate bots.\n\nInterestingly, under a section titled \u201cCan I play a match entirely against Bots?\u201d, Epic wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re looking into a \u2018vs. Bot\u2019 mode as a means to sharpen your skills, explore the map, and help elevate your game to the next level.\u201d Being able to play a whole practice match against bots \u00e0 la Overwatch would be a welcome addition to Fortnite.\n\nSeason 11 starts next weekend, on October 14. We\u2019ll see how the bots pan out, as well as how the matchmaking system evolves.", "description": "Fortnite got skill-based matchmaking in a recent patch, a system that intends to put players of similar skill in games together.
