They kept saying soon. They then just locked me out. They\u2019re literally squatting in my house.\"\n\nHe has since been able to live with his daughters in Basildon and Barking.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nHe claims to have asked his local council and police for help, and says officers told him to change the locks.\n\nHe said he doesn't think that will get rid of them, adding: \"I'm so stressed. It's getting ridiculous.\"\n\nA Basildon Council spokesperson said: \u201cSince this is a civil matter, the council does not have the power to take any action.\n\n\"However, as a gesture of goodwill we have put the owner of the property in contact with the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau to begin the legal process, which we understand is ongoing.\n\n\"The police have also been to the property several times to assist.\u201d\n\nEssex Police said the force was unable to comment as it is believed to be a civil matter.", "description": "The 60-year-old Good Samaritan claims a couple with three kids he took in turned on him and locked him out of his own home in Basildon", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585355.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Confused-Senior-Man-Trying-To-Find-Door-Key.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
