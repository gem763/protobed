I would come home and cry.\u201d\n\nThe woman says that when she turned Lauer and the other man down, she was punished. \u201cMy career took a sharp nosedive,\u201d she said.\n\nThe woman described in the Page Six report says she did not go to NBC human resources with her complaint, but that she did tell co-workers who have corroborated her complaint.\n\nLauer has stringently denied claims of coerced sexual relationships, saying instead that all of his affairs were consensual.\n\nNBC responded harshly to Farrow\u2019s book, insisting that they did not cover up for Lauer. NBC News president Noah Oppenheim\u2013himself under pressure over essays he wrote at Harvard, wrote a staff memo Monday. \u201cFarrow\u2019s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer\u2019s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow\u2019s allegation of a \u2018cover-up,\u2019 and he offers no further evidence,\u201d Oppenheim went on to say. \u201cThere is no way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.\u201d\n\nThe network has not said whether it will seek legal action against Farrow\u2019s allegations.", "description": "A new report suggests the disgraced NBC \u2018Today Show\u2019 anchor coerced a well-respected newscaster into having an affair under threat he would ruin her career if she said no.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_204/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571212875/RTXZ8YV_iilg0e", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
