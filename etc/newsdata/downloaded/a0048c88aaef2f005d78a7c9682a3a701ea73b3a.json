Pinafore, from 1878, the captain diligently sings to us, \u201cI never use a big, big D___\u201d\u2014or \u201chardly ever,\u201d he specifies. As late as 1935, Thomas Edison\u2019s assistant Miller Hutchison was eliding hell in letters, quoting Edison in 1915 saying, \u201cI want to be able to tell an Admiral to go to h___ if he is in the wrong.\u201d And of course, David O. Selznick had to get the Hollywood Production Code amended to allow Rhett Butler to say \u201cgive a damn\u201d in Gone With the Wind in 1939.\n\nOn the ground, however, certainly by the time of David O. Selznick but in certain circles long before, the great many hardly abided by these antimacassar restrictions. In the 1880s, Joseph Pulitzer was fond of saying things like \u201cinde-goddam-pendent\u201d on the job. A woman named Virginia Stopher, describing her days being homeless in the 1910s, noted that the men used damn and hell constantly, but shielded her from other bad words. As Hutchison\u2019s letter shows, Thomas Edison tossed hell around quite freely. Early talkies, before the Production Code had teeth, reveal the reality of common speech: In the 1929 movie Glorifying the American Girl, a stage mother casually growls \u201cDamn\u201d when her glasses don\u2019t open. Even cartoon characters got in on the action, such as an anthropomorphic mirror in 1930 grunting \u201cDamn!\u201d when having trouble waking up Flip the Frog.\n\nGraeme Wood: Trump\u2019s El Paso photo is obscene\n\nThe old sensitivity about damn and hell was rooted in medieval discomfort with swearing to or about God and Jesus, or daring to take part in actions consecrated to them, such as damning people to hell. However, across the 19th century a new concern with euphemizing matters of sex and the body gradually overran these old anxieties. Hence the idea that words like fuck and shit are profane\u2014which once upon a time they truly were. In the pre-code talkies, just for instance, actors didn\u2019t mess with the F-bomb.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while, however, since the F-bomb really caused an explosion. In 2003, when Bono erupted with \u201cThis is fuckin\u2019 brilliant!\u201d at the Golden Globes, what most of us heard, if we were honest with ourselves, was genuine joy and warmth, not a vulgar prod of \u201cobscenity.\u201d Of course the Federal Communications Commission deemed this \u201cindecent and profane\u201d and explored fining NBC, which had broadcast the ceremony. However, this looked priggish and even trivial to most\u2014the gap had already settled between the formal grounds for the FCC\u2019s take and how the word was used in real life.\n\nThe idea that the F-word is \u201cbad\u201d persists today mostly as an unthought habit of mind\u2014quite like children are acculturated through kids\u2019 books to believe that geese and sheep are default parts of existence, as if most people still lived on farms.\n\nRead: The art of giving a damn\n\nIn an America in which a hit children\u2019s book can have the F-word in its title, as can a hit pop song by CeeLo Green, when WTF is emblazoned on T-shirts and countless people utter the relevant phrase as virtual punctuation even in formal settings, and when someone like me can openly attest that I use it freely in circumstances where my grandfather would have said damn or hell, it becomes clear that the F-word today is spicy, but hardly evil or taboo. By contrast, today some well-meaning students believe their white professors shouldn\u2019t even mouth the N-word when referring to historical usage. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what profanity means.", "description": "In today\u2019s world, slurs are the real profanity, not the use of an \u201cF-bomb\u201d to describe a mass shooting.", "authors": ["John Mcwhorter", "Contributing Editor At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2MMMR/facebook.jpg?1567717228", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
