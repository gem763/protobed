It doesn\u2019t have popular applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, for example.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider South Africa, Zhao said the company would prefer using Google\u2019s Android with the Google app store in the future, but if it remains blocked, future devices will come with Huawei\u2019s operating system.\n\nIn November, Zhao said, the company will host a Huawei Developer Conference in South Africa to encourage local developers to develop applications specifically for Huawei.\n\n\u201cWe understand the ecosystem will be a big challenge, but we will focus on our local partners to extract benefits for them and our consumers,\u201d Zhao said.\n\n\u201cIn South Africa, some of our strategic partners are already developing their applications based on Huawei\u2019s [mobile operating system].\u201d\n\nZhao said their South African sales have remained steady despite the US ban, as devices with Google\u2019s Android already installed will not be affected.\n\nHe said they have developed a strategy for South Africa which include exploring other consumer categories such as wearable, routers, smart speakers, smart glasses and the company\u2019s laptop range.", "description": "Huawei lost its Google licence after the American government banned US companies from doing business with the Chinese company - so the Mate 30 series probably won't come to South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8876/f69fb3d4e8884a92847deb90904ab145.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
