(Brandon Wade/AP)\n\nWe have all seen the headlines. We remember the names: Oscar Grant. Michael Brown. Alton Sterling. This story has played out hundreds of times through grainy cellphone videos, police dash-cam cameras and frantic 911 recordings. And over and over, from the death of Eric Garner in New York to the death of Stephon Clark in California, officers across this country have rarely been held responsible for killing black men.\n\nNow, in Texas, a white police officer is going to jail for shooting an unarmed black man. It is something that seemed almost impossible before.\n\nWhen charges were first announced against Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, it seemed like a straightforward case. Certainly parts of the story were familiar: a young black man who was taken from his family too soon, an officer protected by the blue wall, a mourning black mother.\n\nYet so many people, including me, couldn\u2019t help but to shake the feeling that this case was going to end differently. This age-old narrative would finally change. From the beginning, the fact that Guyger was even charged at all could be considered progress, as not a single Dallas Police Department officer from 1973 to 2016 was charged with murder for killing a civilian.\n\nAnd unlike many previous cases, the basic facts of this case were not in dispute. Shortly before 10 p.m. on Sept. 6, 2018, Guyger walked into Botham Jean\u2019s unlocked apartment, mistaking it for her own, and shot Jean while he was eating ice cream in his living room.\n\nGuyger somehow overlooked that she was on the wrong floor, standing at a door with a bright red doormat that she didn\u2019t own. Prosecutors argued that she was distracted by sexts from her partner. Defense attorneys claimed she was tired from a 14-hour shift. Regardless of the forces that brought Guyger to that door, an innocent 26-year-old was killed in his own home.\n\nDuring the trial, Judge Tammy Kemp permitted jurors to consider the \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d in Guyger\u2019s defense, which states that a person is allowed to use deadly force in the protection of their home or \u201ccastle.\u201d Of course, Guyger wasn\u2019t in her own castle; she was in Jean\u2019s. But it nonetheless led to widespread fears that Guyger would be able to avoid responsibility for her actions. An acquittal would surely follow, and once again, it would confirm that black lives are valued less than others.\n\nBut the jury found Guyger guilty of murder. The Jean family\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Crump, called the verdict \u201chistoric,\u201d saying: \u201cWe hope that it sends the message to the police departments that your officers should be following the policies of de-escalation. \u2026 We pray that it will be a precedence to reaffirm what the United States Constitution has emblazoned on our society, that it is equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\nA day later, Guyger received her sentence: 10 years in prison. After the verdict was read, the Jean family was reportedly silent \u2014 \u201calmost shell-shocked,\u201d according to CNN. Later, Botham\u2019s 18-year-old brother, Brandt, said he forgave Guyger and asked to give her a hug. Shortly afterward, the judge also gave Guyger a hug and a Bible, and the two prayed together.\n\nAs remarkable and extraordinary as those actions may seem, this isn\u2019t the first time victims of violence against black people have displayed forgiveness and compassion. The members of the congregation at Emanuel AME Church forgave Dylann Roof after he shot and killed nine people during bible study. Teen Vogue columnist Jenn M. Jackson has even argued that the black community is expected to express forgiveness in the face of violence.\n\nSo often in these cases that capture the nation\u2019s attention, we search for clarity on what lessons can be learned. We want there to be some overarching message that can help explain the episode or avoid future situations. We look for some small fact that can validate our world view.\n\nAfter unwrapping the facts in Guyger\u2019s case, I keep coming back to the most basic lesson of all: Some things just never change. During sentencing, Guyger\u2019s attorney Toby Shook said: \u201cThis event is so unique, you\u2019ll never see it again in the history of the United States.\u201d I disagree. What happened in this situation has happened many times before. Sure, some parts of the story have been remixed and plot twists were added, but it\u2019s still part of the same book. And until there is action and accountability in the system, it will continue to happen. A conviction and 10-year sentence might provide some measure of justice, but Botham didn\u2019t deserve to die. Touching moments in a courtroom don\u2019t change that fact.\n\nThere are still too many guns, and people are still too likely to use them. There is still too little accountability for police officers and departments. The criminal-justice system is still mistrusted. There are still too many grieving mothers and fathers who can only ask \u201cwhy?\u201d There are still not enough people who can give them answers.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The silence on Bijan Ghaisar\u2019s killing is a scandal.
