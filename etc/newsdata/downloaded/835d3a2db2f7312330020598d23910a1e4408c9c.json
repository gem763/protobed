But we just got a Brexit deal and Wall Street looks ready to celebrate too.\n\nOur combined chart and call of the day delves into the debate about whether we\u2019ve reached the end of the bull run for stocks or if more big gains are possible. It comes from the founder and chief executive officer of Ciovacco Capital Management, Chris Ciovacco, who sees the latter scenario unfolding if some stars align.\n\nIn a See It Market blog post, Ciovacco looks at historical charts to gauge the current market. He points to three periods that saw major trend reversals \u2014 a change in price direction \u2014 that wiped around 50% off the S&P from peak to trough. Those were 1973-74, 1999-01 and 2007-2008, and the charts all look similar. Here\u2019s one:\n\nBut those charts look nothing like the S&P right now:\n\nIt looks more similar to these:\n\nIn the above two charts, the S&P consolidated \u2014 basically stuck to a range \u2014 then broke out and resumed a bullish trend, two years of gains in those cases, he said.\n\n\u201cThe market is setup to break out. It needs one more piece of the puzzle \u2014return of animal spirits,\u201d Ciovacco told MarketWatch in follow-up comments. As for those spirits, he\u2019s referring to the stock buying that can be spurred when investor uncertainty is replaced by confidence.\n\n\u201cThree drags have been trade, economic weakness and Brexit,\u201d he adds, noting that China trade progress is the most important factor in determining upside or downside. As for the former, he says \u201dif the market believes China moving in right direction with a long-term path forward... that could do it.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump delaying planned December tariffs on China would be a good start, he said.\n\nThe market\n\nA Brexit deal definitely is triggering some high spirits. Dow YM00, +0.33%, S&P ES00, +0.35% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.44% futures are up solidly, along with the pound GBPUSD, +0.3976% and Europe stocks SXXP, +0.26% .\n\nThe tweet\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Where there is a will, there is a #deal - we have one!
