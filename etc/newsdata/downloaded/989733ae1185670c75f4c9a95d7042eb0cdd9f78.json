Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy husband and I have a great toddler, and after some medical challenges in trying to have a second child, we\u2019ve decided to adopt. We\u2019re excited! But we\u2019re dealing with two sets of issues.\n\nThe first is that the logistics of adopting seem confusing at the moment. I\u2019ve done some research, I\u2019m in touch with some people who\u2019ve experienced adoption from all sides (kids, birth parents, adoptive parents, etc.), we\u2019re going to an info session at a full-service agency soon, and I\u2019ve asked my therapist to help us find a specialist for some couples sessions to prepare. But compared to the resources when I was pregnant, I\u2019m having trouble finding information to walk through what to do, what it\u2019s like, and what weird or unexpected circumstances or feelings might bubble up.\n\nMore painfully, we\u2019re dealing with some negative reactions from family. When I brought it up to a close relative, I was shocked to get a version of \u201cWith adoption, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d I ended the conversation, but subsequently this relative brought up instances of adopted kids who had \u201cproblems\u201d or insisted I talk to someone they knew who had a biological child and an adopted one so I will \u201cknow what I\u2019m getting into.\u201d\n\nMy husband hasn\u2019t talked to his family about our plans yet but anticipates similar problems. This breaks my heart. I think it comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice. I don\u2019t want this attitude to taint my relationship with my family, I don\u2019t want these talking points brought up around my toddler or with any child we adopt in the future. I need scripts to shut this down in the moment, educate people who bring this up, and protect my family.\n\n\u2014Adoption Issues\n\nDear Adoption,\n\nCongratulations on the decision to grow your family. You\u2019re only at the first step of a lifelong journey but already approaching it with an eagerness to learn\u2014I feel this bodes well for your family. I think you\u2019re right: There are a million pregnancy books out there, but comparatively fewer on the experience of adoption. But there are great resources available, and your agency will likely provide a syllabus that will prove helpful. If they don\u2019t as a matter of course, ask your social worker.\n\nI\u2019m a parent by adoption, and I\u2019ve found adoption-related communities on Facebook to be helpful, so poke around there. It\u2019s hard to reduce adoption to a single set of concerns, because every individual experience of it is informed by specific circumstances. It\u2019s too soon yet to know what you need to know more about\u2014whether you\u2019ll be raising a child of a different race, or forging a connection with your child\u2019s birthmother and possibly other relatives, and so on. But you understand that this will be new territory for your family. That is important.\n\nOne thing your social worker and agency will probably provide is some clarity on how to handle hurtful or poorly informed comments from friends and family. Because those, alas, are inevitable. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re there already.\n\nYour relative is right: With adoption, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. I wonder if they realize the same is true with biology. I wonder whether they realize that any person proceeding through life as though they know what it has in store for them is deluded.\n\nYour relative is right: With adoption, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. I wonder if she realizes the same is true with biology.\n\nI understand that what your relative is saying\u2014that an adopted child is somehow lesser, or a risk, or some kind of problem you ought to avoid. I wish I could promise that your relatives\u2019 ignorance (at best) or prejudice (at worst) will not taint your relationships with them. But they will.\n\nFor now, in these early days, you can counter this gently\u2014when someone says \u201cWith adoption, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d you could agree that in life there are no guarantees. You could decide to teach anyone who requires it just how adoption works and why it\u2019s important that they respect your choice and the family you make.\n\nThe challenge is that your child will be your child, not an object lesson in racial harmony or an opportunity to educate on human empathy. You are rightly invested in making sure that your toddler and their future sibling don\u2019t hear these things.\n\nYou may find over time that simply shutting down these conversations is best for your own sanity, and the well-being of your children. (\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss this\u201d is a great all-purpose conversation-ender.) While the arrival of an actual child, not a theoretical subject of conversation, might change people\u2019s attitudes, the tough truth is that protecting your family may mean sacrificing some of your relationships or seeing them forever changed. I hope it does not come to this, but it\u2019s probably best to acknowledge that it might. Still, I\u2019m excited for you. Good luck in all that lies ahead.\n\nGet Slate Parenting in Your Inbox Introducing Slate\u2019s Parenting newsletter, featuring the best of Care and Feeding, Mom and Dad Are Fighting, and Slate\u2019s family coverage.

His allergies include common ingredients like dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame. I am anxious all the time because he is still a toddler and puts things in his mouth regularly. I watch him closely, and monitor ingredients and allergy statements, and assess risk of cross contamination for everything he eats. If he ingests these allergens he will go into anaphylaxis, and I learned this the hard way.\n\nUnfortunately, my family is very old-school and dismisses my concerns. I go so far as to email allergy action plans from the doctor so they can take it seriously but they don\u2019t, partly because my parents don\u2019t read English and partly because my sister is dismissive and is convinced I am exaggerating. I cannot count the number of eye-rolls when I explain what he can and cannot eat, and offer to bring his food to family dinners. (I do this because my parents cannot read food labels.)\n\nI now feel that whenever I try to explain things to my parents, they tell my sister, who in turn sends me nasty emails saying how horrible I am not trusting our parents with my child. I feel like my family is turning against me, but I refuse to put my son\u2019s safety at risk because they refuse to take me seriously. I feel like I\u2019m going to lose it on them soon and need advice for how to proceed. Can you help?\n\n\u2014Don\u2019t Want to Be the Peanut Police\n\nDear DWtBtPP,\n\nI am terribly sorry. I know firsthand that it\u2019s incredibly stressful to parent a child with a serious food allergy, and it sounds to me like you are doing a great job.\n\nScience does not depend upon our belief. I can understand why you\u2019d want to respect your parents\u2019 authority, but anaphylaxis doesn\u2019t give a shit if your parents are \u201cold-school.\u201d You have tried to make your family understand how important this is; that they do not is their failing and not yours.\n\nYou rightly refuse to put your son\u2019s safety at risk. If I were you, I would take \u201closing it\u201d off the table because that would accomplish nothing. If your family refuses to take you seriously, try simply allowing them to not take you seriously. Let them mock you as overprotective; let them talk about how nutty you are.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this won\u2019t be hurtful, but it will be infinitely more tolerable than something happening to your son through his grandparents\u2019 neglect. I would continue to remind your family of your son\u2019s dietary needs as often as necessary. I would bring food (and utensils or whatever else will set your mind at ease) to family get-togethers. Furthermore, I would decline to leave your son with his grandparents or his aunt unattended by you.\n\nPerhaps this will help them see you\u2019re absolutely serious about your son\u2019s dietary needs. Perhaps you will continue to get nasty emails from your sister. Perhaps there will come a time when you won\u2019t feel bothered by your family\u2019s ridiculous treatment of you and your son. I don\u2019t think you can win this battle, but maybe declining to fight it will start to feel like a victory. I\u2019m really sorry for this, but hang in there.\n\n\u2022 If you missed Monday\u2019s Care and Feeding column, read it here.\n\n\u2022 Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have an 8-year old Girl Scout. A few times a year, her troop has overnight events, and parents are welcome to attend. I always feel like I\u2019m missing out on some mother-daughter bonding time, but I really don\u2019t want to attend these things.\n\nSleeping on the floor in a room full of little girls doesn\u2019t appeal to me\u2014I\u2019m an introvert, and the whole idea is stressful. The troop always seems to have enough chaperones, and my daughter never asks me to go, and doesn\u2019t seem to mind I\u2019m not there. My daughter and I have opportunities to do other things with just the two of us. Plus, I feel like this is a chance for her to be a little more independent and do things with other people besides her parents. Am I a terrible mother for not wanting to do Girl Scout overnights?\n\n\u2014Scouting\u2019s Not My Thing\n\nDear Scouting,\n\nYou are not a terrible mother! If your daughter wanted you to come to these sleepovers\u2014if she begged and pleaded and got loopy with excitement about this special mom-and-all-my-friends time\u2014then I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have written this letter. You\u2019d probably have put a smile on your introverted face and forced yourself to deal with a sleepless night on the floor surrounded by farting little girls. Let your daughter go and have a great time with her friends; you have many other opportunities to do something special, just the two of you.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have a unique problem. I work at a small nonprofit with a progressive boss. So progressive that since my daughter was born, he has allowed (encouraged!) me to bring her to work twice a week. The other three days, I work from home.\n\nIt is a perk I am fortunate to have. Day care is expensive, and even if I had the money, my commute would leave me with barely any time with her before bed. I love getting to be with her all day and feel grateful. But\u2014I feel so guilty about this\u2014there is a not-insignificant part of me that feels overwhelmed and swallowed.\n\nThough she is a sweet girl most of the time, she\u2019s still a 6-month-old. I am lucky to have co-workers who do not mind when she cries, and will mind her while I take a conference call, and offer support and encouragement.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have a lot to entertain her with at work. Also, even when I\u2019m working from home, I\u2019m at work. I have to get things done and feel increased pressure to go above and beyond\u2014like I need to compensate my employer in some way.\n\nFinally, though I love her more than anything, I feel like I am never off-duty. I can\u2019t zone out in my office for five minutes; she doesn\u2019t nap and generally prefers to be sitting in my lap. When I get home, my husband takes over, but those hours before bedtime are consumed with caring for our pets, doing laundry, washing bottles, and all the other stuff that goes into having a home.\n\nI hate to admit being burned out, but I am. I feel like I never get enough rest, though she sleeps ten hours a night like clockwork, and like I haven\u2019t been \u201cwith\u201d myself in forever. I don\u2019t want to be away from my daughter, but I recognize that having a stressed out, overworked mom doesn\u2019t do her any favors. I guess my question is: Am I doing the right thing(s) for my daughter? I would sacrifice anything for her well-being, but I wonder if my desire to be with her has led me to a position where I\u2019m physically with her, but not as emotionally present as she needs me to be. Please help.\n\n\u2014Needing Some Space\n\nDear Needing,\n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through. You are working full-time at a job and also working full-time as a parent, and doing the two simultaneously. It all sounds like a blessing, but it\u2019s not. Yours is a fresh spin on a common problem\u2014the challenge of balancing work and life when your children are very small.\n\nOf course you love your daughter more than anything! And of course you want to have the occasional moment of being off duty! You know that you\u2019re lucky to have a flexible schedule and an understanding boss, but you\u2019re also confronting that even under those circumstances this is a tough balancing act.\n\nYou cannot always have it all\u2014reading every bedtime story, being satisfied by your job, coming home to a clean house. But you can still have a lot. I\u2019m going to assume you like your work or that you need the salary. And I\u2019m going to note that it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to enjoy what you do for a living, even if it\u2019s only because it offers a respite from the task of being a mother\u2014the five minutes alone in the office you mention. It\u2019s not selfish to want to still feel like the human being you were a year ago.\n\nI think you\u2019ll agree an office isn\u2019t a place for a baby. She demands your focus, and understanding colleagues are great, but it\u2019s fine to admit that the baby is an impediment to doing your job. Even if she\u2019s cooperating\u2014distracted by a toy, or on a co-worker\u2019s lap\u2014your kid\u2019s presence is going to steal your focus. Day care is an investment, but perhaps worth it for those two days you spend at the office. It\u2019s absolutely awful to miss bedtime; I know that well. But it\u2019s also the case that sometimes those moments alone on your commute can be kind of \u2026 nice?\n\nAnother option is to do the inverse and rely on day care the days you work remotely. That might seem indulgent to those who don\u2019t know what it is to work from home, but you\u2019re feeling incredible pressure to make those hours count while juggling a baby. If you found a day care near your house, your commute wouldn\u2019t eat into your time together.\n\nSince you have a supportive boss and partner, you have options. You owe it to yourself and your family to find a balance that makes you happy, and I\u2019m convinced that you can. First, though, you need to take the pressure off yourself to be the kind of superhero working mom who only exists in myth. You\u2019ve got this. Good luck.\n\n\u2014Rumaan\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nWe are so excited to send our son to our neighborhood public school.
