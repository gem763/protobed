REUTERS/Dylan Martinez\n\nThe novel, made into an award-winning television series in 2017, presents a totalitarian future in the state of Gilead, where the few remaining fertile women are forced into sexual servitude as \u201chandmaids\u201d to repopulate a world facing environmental disaster.\n\n\u201cFor years and years people were saying will there be a sequel, please write a sequel, tell us what happened, and I always said I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Atwood told British broadcaster the BBC in an interview.\n\n\u201cBut then a couple of things happened. Instead of going away from Gilead as I thought had been happening in the 1990s, we started going back towards Gilead in a number of places in the world including the United States.\u201d\n\nRecent moves to curtail access to abortion in the United States have caused huge division and galvanised women\u2019s rights activists.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who was elected in 2016, has said he opposes abortions in most cases and he has joined many of his fellow Republicans in seeking to limit them.\n\nMany doctors and rights groups are fighting these efforts as harmful to women\u2019s health and in breach of a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nAtwood said she was already conceptualizing a sequel to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d when Trump was elected. At the time, the television series based on her novel was being filmed.\n\n\u201cThe frame around the show changed, and we knew at that moment it would be viewed differently, which it was. So instead of fantasy \u2014 ha ha it will never happen \u2014 it got much closer to reality, because of the kinds of people backing Trump,\u201d Atwood said.\n\nThe series helped the original novel shoot back up the bestseller lists, and made the handmaid\u2019s uniform of a long dark red cloak and large white bonnet a symbol of female protest and resistance.\n\nFans gathered in London at midnight on Tuesday to hear Atwood read from her new book, hailing it as a timely and necessary response to an increasingly menacing world for women.\n\n\u201cThe world in some ways is becoming a worse place for women and particularly in the United States and so this is very current, and very relevant and very necessary,\u201d said Anne Enith-Cooper, 57, who attended the launch.\n\nAnother fan, 40-year-old Stacey Morris, said: \u201cMy daughter is 12 and she\u2019s just starting to understand feminism and the importance of being a woman... I\u2019d really like for her to read this in the future and to be able to share this with her.\u201d\n\nAsked if she was nervous about the huge anticipation of her new book, Atwood told the BBC: \u201cThere is that feeling that you have - a lot of fanfare, the mountain roars and out comes this mouse. Will they say \u201cwhat?\u201d, \u201cis that what all this fuss has been about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do have to point out it is a book, it is not regime change, it is not something that is going to physically impact the lives of many people, it is not riots in Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Testaments\u201d has already landed Atwood a nomination for one of the publishing world\u2019s top accolades, the Booker Prize.", "description": "Canadian author Margaret Atwood said a deterioration in women's rights in some parts of the world including in the United States prompted her to write a sequel to her best-selling 1985 novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428421111&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8919K-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
