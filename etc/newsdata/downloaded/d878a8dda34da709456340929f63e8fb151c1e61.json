At first, I didn't really want to study traditional Chinese medicine, I liked martial arts,' Ms Yuan told MailOnline.\n\n'My parents told me not to give up my medical studies because they said it was a career that could benefit me for all my life,' the medic added.\n\nInitially Ms Yuan took yoga class, but she soon realised it couldn't help her grow muscles which was her goal at the time, so she hired a private instructor for a year to give her training\n\nHer fate changed when she met Zhang Wei, a professional bodybuilder, through work. Mr Zhang encouraged her to compete in bodybuilding contest and trained her systematically\n\nMs Yuan followed her parents' advice and pursued an academic route until she obtained a doctor's degree.\n\nBut when her school days were over, the keen sports lover finally decided to listen to her own heart.

I have never given up my martial arts dream'\n\nMr Zhang encouraged her to compete in bodybuilding contest and designed a training system for her.\n\n'Because I am a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, I don't need to work shifts. Therefore I get to go to the gym at 5:30pm when I finish work. I go there four to five times a week no matter it rains or not,' Ms Yuan said.\n\n'I have thought of giving up. Training is a tough, painful, tiring and lonely process.\n\n'But when I saw my muscles becoming more and more toned, I felt it was worth it,' said Ms Yuan who also does modelling on the side.\n\nLast month, the determined gym-goer tasted success when she won the second place of women's Class-A competition in a national championship held by the Chinese Bodybuilding Association.\n\nYet, Ms Yuan has never given up her dream of becoming a Kung Fu fighter.\n\nSpeaking of future, Ms Yuan said she wanted to learn martial arts.\n\n'After I make some money, I will use it to hire a master and learn martial arts.
