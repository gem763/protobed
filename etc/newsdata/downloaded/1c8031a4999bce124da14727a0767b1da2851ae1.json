And that\u2019s something that Michele Kryger, head of AIG\u2019s Elder and Vulnerable Client Care unit, says is a problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know about these common scams and the red flags,\u201d she tells MarketWatch, adding that knowledge of the scams can be a first defense against them. (Of course, it\u2019s important to point out that if you have a family member with cognitive decline like Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, simply being aware of the scams might not be enough to prevent them getting defrauded.)\n\nRead: Can\u2019t take the robocalls anymore? Here are ways to fight back\n\nSome of the scams that more than half of older Americans aren\u2019t unaware of, according to AIG\u2019s research, include invoice scams, prepaid credit/debit card scams, romance scams and the \u201cpigeon drop\u201d scam.\n\nThe invoice scam is when the \u201cvictim is contacted by someone claiming to work on behalf of a company such as a utility to collect fees,\u201d AIG explains. The romance scam is where a victim is wooed romantically online and then asked for money, and the prepaid credit card/debit card scam is when \u201cthe victim is asked to make payments to a utility or other company to address a debt,\u201d AIG says. Finally, the pigeon drop scam is when the \u201cvictim is told that a considerable sum of money was found and will be shared with them if an upfront payment is received.\u201d\n\nRead: Scam of the month: Beware of lottery and sweepstakes tricks\n\nOn the plus side, there are other scams that most older people are aware of, including lottery scams (where swindlers claim you\u2019ve won the lottery), IRS scams (where they pretend to be the government and claim you owe back taxes), charity scams (where they pretend to be a charity to get you to donate) and more.\n\nWhile many of us think we won\u2019t be the ones to get defrauded, experts say these criminals are getting more savvy. So how can you protect yourself?\n\nOne huge red flag, says AIG\u2019s Kryger, is \u201canytime someone is asking you to pay for something urgently\u201d and/or with a prepaid debit or credit card or money order. In these \u2014 and plenty of other \u2014 instances, \u201cdon\u2019t make a payment over the phone\u201d or via email, she says. Instead, hang up or get off the email, go on the company\u2019s website and look for the phone number of the company there; call that number directly and ask about the issue.\n\nRead: Senior rip-offs are soaring \u2014 and you won\u2019t believe who the crooks are\n\nYou should also avoid picking up the phone for any number you don\u2019t recognize (even if it seems familiar-ish) and don\u2019t give any personal information like your Social Security number or credit card number over the phone or on email, as MarketWatch details here.\n\nAnd even if an email from a company seems legitimate, beware, as I recently reported: \u201cFraudsters often set up websites that look real but may be fronts to sell you stolen goods and steal your credit card information.\u201d For example, if a retailer\u2019s name was Hill and its legitimate site was Hill.com, the fraudulent site might add an \u201cs\u201d to the end of that. If you\u2019re not sure if a site is real, here\u2019s a browser extension that can give you an overview of a site, as well as reviews and traffic. Finally, check out this resource from the Justice Department that details common elder financial fraud scans and how to protect yourself.\n\nWorried that you might have been defrauded despite all your precautions? Check your bank accounts and credit and debit card accounts for any suspicious activity. Also, look at your credit reports (you get one free each year from each credit agency by going to AnnualCreditReport.com) and use sites like WalletHub and Credit Karma, which now offer free credit report monitoring, to get alerts when there are changes on your credit reports.\n\n\u201cWith people living as many as four decades in retirement, it\u2019s paramount to safeguard hard-earned savings against scams and exploitation,\u201d Kryger says.", "description": "Billions of dollars are at stake.
