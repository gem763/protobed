He has previously accused the whistleblower of being \"partisan\" and said he knew all his phone calls to foreign leaders were listened to by US agencies.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: \"It's a partisan whistleblower\"\n\nWhile Mr Trump suggested a transcript could be released, senior Trump administration officials said it would be inappropriate for private conversations between world leaders to be made public.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has quoted sources as saying Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky about eight times to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani on an investigation into Hunter Biden, but had not offered anything in return.\n\nThe Bidens deny any wrongdoing.\n\nWhat's being said about impeachment?\n\nDemocrats have been split on whether they should seek to impeach Mr Trump over alleged wrongdoing.\n\nHowever this latest story - which Mr Trump's opponents allege could amount to inviting foreign interference in the 2020 election - appears to have pushed some senior Democrats closer to backing such a move.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that if the whistleblower complaint was not turned over to Congress the Trump administration would \"be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation\".\n\nMs Pelosi, like Mr Schiff, has thus far resisted demands for impeachment.", "description": "The admission fuelled calls for Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against the president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8BCE/production/_108909753_mediaitem108908964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
