REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nBut in Hong Kong, Li\u2019s fondness for extended metaphors are well known and have made the charismatic former offshore oil worker, lawyer, journalist and investment banker a popular figure at public events.\n\nLi has run Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (0388.HK) since 2010. Under his supervision, the exchange presents itself as a gateway between China and the rest of the world, and has benefited from a wave of IPOs as giant Chinese companies raised billions from international investors.\n\nThe exchange has been the world\u2019s largest capital-raising venue in five of the past 10 years \u2013 an honor it split with the New York Stock Exchange. Li also oversaw the creation of \u201cstock connect,\u201d in 2014, a mechanism for Chinese investors to trade Hong Kong-listed shares and international investors to trade shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. It is now the main channel into China for investors overseas.\n\nA Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing representative declined to comment for this article.\n\nDEALMAKER\n\nMarket participants say Li\u2019s previous roles inform his approach to running the exchange. \u201cHe is more of an investment banker than a traditional CEO of an exchange. Since taking over, he has been pursuing this bolt-on as well as transformational acquisitions approach,\u201d said a financial M&A banker in Hong Kong, who was not authorized to speak to the media. Recently, HKEX has focused on buying small fintech players to boost technology and data capabilities.\n\nBut Wednesday\u2019s shock announcement recalls HKEX\u2019s 2012 purchase of the London Metal Exchange (LME), which ran into trouble when HKEX raised trading fees. After an angry response from traders, a change of course, and LME leadership, steadied the ship. LME traders now generally speak well of Li. \u201cHe is a big personality, a great front man; he likes getting on the stage and being bombastic and loud and the center of attention,\u201d said the London-based head of one metals brokerage, who also declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \u201cThis latest move is hugely ambitious, but if anybody can pull it off, it\u2019s Charles.\u201d JPMorgan bankers say that when he was chairman of JPMorgan China between 2003 and 2009, he was known for his willingness to trust colleagues.\n\nOne said he often explained his attitude with a Chinese proverb: \u201cIf you use a man, don\u2019t suspect him. If you suspect him, don\u2019t use him.\u201d\n\nNAVIGATING HONG KONG Beijing born-Li, despite speaking little Cantonese, has managed to balance the competing demands of global investment banks, the Hong Kong government, which approves six of HKEX\u2019s 13 board members, and Beijing, whose goodwill is crucial for its gateway role. After a multi-year campaign, Li in 2018 won approval to allow companies to list in Hong Kong with different classes of shares - a more relaxed standard of governance. Before the change, many Chinese tech companies chose a New York listing, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, whose 2014 $25 billion IPO is still a global record.\n\nLi has not won over all groups in Hong Kong, though, notably the city\u2019s army of small brokers, who have their own representative in the 70-seat Legislative Council.\n\n\u201cI think Charles Li is capable when it comes to developing and promoting HKEX internationally. But he doesn\u2019t take care of small and medium brokers. This takeover is only one example,\u201d said Christopher Cheung, a stockbroker and Hong Kong lawmaker, who said adapting to LSE systems would be a financial burden.\n\nMore important for the success of LSE takeover is whether Li can adapt to the requirements of London-based traders, as he did eventually at the LME.\n\nA senior China banker, who has played football with Li, an avid fan of the game, said the exchange chief was well equipped to pull off the LSE bid.\n\n\u201c[Li\u2019s] sharp and direct views, exactly like his strength on the football field as a striker, can always bring success to the team, the region and its businesses,\u201d the banker said.", "description": "When Hong Kong Exchange chief executive Charles Li described his company's surprise offer for the London Stock Exchange this week as a \"a corporate tale of Romeo and Juliet,\" listeners outside Asia may have been surprised by the colorful analogy.", "authors": ["Alun John", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429010669&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0KW-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
