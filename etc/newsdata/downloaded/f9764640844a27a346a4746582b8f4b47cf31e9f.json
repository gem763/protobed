It was the third time we know of that he has done so.\n\nThe first time, when Trump asked Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing emails,\u201d his campaign insisted he was joking. The second time, when Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to launch two other politically convenient investigations, we learned about it only after the administration tried to keep it under wraps.\n\nNow, for his third act \u2014 this one involving China \u2014 Trump just came out and said it.\n\nThis might be Trump\u2019s most problematic request of this sort, for a number of reasons.\n\nTrump on Thursday publicly said China should launch an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country. \u201cAnd by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe added later that he had not brought the matter up with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but that he might.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy. All of a sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what Trump is alleging here, nor has it been when Trump has previously invoked China while talking about the Bidens. But arguably, even more than his request to Ukraine, this one has the potential for a really corrupt appearance.\n\nThe chief reason for that: Trump is currently engaged in a trade war with China.\n\nTrump certainly had \u2014 and has \u2014 leverage over Ukraine, both by virtue of hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to that country and because of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s quest for a personal meeting with Trump. Neither was mentioned on their July 25 call as being part of an explicit quid pro quo, but it\u2019s not difficult to see Zelensky having come away with that perception. Right before Trump asked for the investigations, he made a point of emphasizing how \u201cvery, very good\u201d the United States is to Ukraine, and then he asked for \u201ca favor.\u201d Trump also appeared to grant Zelensky\u2019s long-sought White House meeting after Zelensky suggested he would pursue the investigations Trump requested.\n\nThe U.S.-China relationship does not include such a power imbalance, in which it might look like Trump is picking on a small country to force it to bend to his will. But he does have significant leverage when it comes to China, notably because of the trade war he launched.\n\nMost of the most provocative moves in the trade war have been made by Trump, who started this whole thing and has been more anxious to ramp things up. China could very logically now believe that further escalations might be tied to whether it takes the actions Trump wants. Any future decisions could be colored accordingly.\n\nAnd indeed, shortly before delivering the above quotes, Trump was explicitly talking about his leverage over China.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of options on China, but if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power,\u201d Trump said. Thirty seconds later, he was talking about the investigations. If you\u2019re China, you have to wonder if those things might be related in Trump\u2019s mind.\n\nWhere this could lead to an even stickier situation, though, is if there is a trade war resolution before the 2020 election. Some Trump advisers have urged him to come to some kind of deal by then, for fear of the gambit backfiring in the November election. Let\u2019s consider for a moment that China investigates the Bidens (and we learn about it), and then Trump cuts some kind of deal with China. How would we ever know that a very personal political favor wasn\u2019t a factor in Trump giving China a deal with more favorable terms than he might have otherwise?\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of ifs built into that. We don\u2019t even know whether China would be willing to \u201cplay ball,\u201d as the Ukraine whistleblower put it. (For what it\u2019s worth, we have not seen signs that Ukraine has actually given Trump what he wants.) But that\u2019s the unholy setup.\n\nAnd even if you set aside the trade war, this is still a U.S. president suggesting that a foreign country do something that is transparently geared toward his own reelection bid. Trump has intermittently argued \u2014 however implausibly \u2014 that his effort to get Ukraine to launch investigations is about rooting out corruption in that country; his now-public request of another investigation involving the Bidens makes clear what this is really about.\n\nRepublicans have been somewhat muted about condemning Trump\u2019s request of Ukraine. And for their troubles, they have now got him very publicly doing the kind of thing they would formerly condemn at the drop of a hat \u2014 and complicating a trade war in the process.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Trump insisted he was joking about \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening.\u201d Even then, that was considered beyond the pale.
