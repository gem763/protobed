It needs a simple majority in parliament.\n\nIn a move that aligns the stars for an election after months of Brexit discord, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the condition of ruling out a no-deal Brexit had been met so he would support an election.\n\n\u201cLabour will back a general election,\u201d said Corbyn, a veteran socialist campaigner. \u201cThe Labour Party loves a debate but they also love the end of the debate, and this is the end of the debate: We are going out there to win.\u201d\n\nThe first Christmas election in Britain since 1923 would be highly unpredictable: Brexit has variously fatigued and enraged swathes of voters while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nSome politicians feel an election so close to Christmas could irritate voters, while campaigning and getting the vote out could be hampered by cold weather.\n\nUltimately, voters would have a choice between an emboldened Johnson pushing for his Brexit deal or a socialist government under Corbyn renegotiating the deal before a referendum.\n\nIf no party wins conclusively, the Brexit deadlock will continue.\n\nCHRISTMAS ELECTION?\n\nAfter four years of arguing over Brexit, almost all British politicians now agree an election is needed to break the cycle of inaction that has shocked allies of a country once considered a bastion of stable Western capitalism and democracy.\n\nAn election, though, could decide the fate of Brexit as well as the main players - PM Johnson, 55, and his rival Corbyn, 70.\n\nWhen Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, bet on an early election in 2017, she lost her slender majority - a failure that ultimately prevented her from ratifying her Brexit deal and sank her political career.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, though pollsters underestimated the support for Brexit in 2016 and admit that the models they use are wilting beside the Brexit furnace.\n\nBoth major parties face a fight on at least three fronts: The Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage will seek to poach Brexit voters while the Liberal Democrats will seek to win over opponents of Brexit.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons in London, Britain, October 28, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\n\u201cThis will probably be the most unpredictable election I have ever known,\u201d Anand Menon, director of The UK in a Changing Europe, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIs it Brexit or is it not? We don\u2019t know. Second, the election is as volatile as ever and, thirdly, the potential for tactical voting - and tactical voting to go wrong - is very high given the leave-remain split,\u201d he said.\n\nVOTES ON VOTES\n\nLawmakers on Tuesday approved the timetable for Johnson\u2019s \u201cEarly Parliamentary General Election Bill\u201d without a formal vote. Two votes on the bill itself will take place from around 1730 GMT.\n\nLawmakers could still bring significant changes to Johnson\u2019s bill. Opposition parties are squabbling over which day in early December is best for an election,\n\nJohnson told his cabinet of senior ministers that there was not enough time to change who could vote in the election, ruling out ideas put forward by some opposition parties to lower the voting age and allow EU citizens to vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the legislation enacting Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has been put on hold, pending an election, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who oversees the government\u2019s legislative agenda in the House of Commons, said.\n\nBehind the bickering, though, Johnson is closer to an election than he has ever been in his tumultuous 3-month premiership.\n\nAmong voters, there was some relief that the Brexit debate might be ending soon.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to bring this to some sort of resolution,\u201d commuter Matt Finch, 36, told Reuters outside London\u2019s Charing Cross rail station. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many votes in the last 12 months in parliament and I think a general election might be a way to sort it all out.\u201d\n\n(The story is refiled to clarify headline)", "description": "Britain was heading toward its first December election in almost a century after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's bet on breaking the Brexit deadlock with an early ballot gained support from opposition parties on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446109359&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0FU", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
