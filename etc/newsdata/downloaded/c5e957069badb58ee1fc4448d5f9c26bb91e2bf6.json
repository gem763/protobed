(NASDAQ: JRVR) stock plummeted on Wednesday, dropping more than 20%, after the company said it is canceling all insurance policies with its largest customer, a subsidiary of Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER).\n\nThe decision led one sell-side firm to downgrade the stock to sell, although another said it was a good move and reaffirmed a more bullish stance on the insurer.\n\nThe Analysts\n\nB. Riley FBR\u2019s Randy Binner downgraded the stock from Neutral to Sell and lowered the price target from $45 to $40.\n\nJMP Securities analyst Matthew Carletti reiterated a Market Outperform rating and $50 price target.\n\nThe Takeaways\n\nJames River Group, a Bermuda-based insurance company, said after the close Tuesday that it will cancel all policies held by Uber subsidiary Rasier LLC because of unfavorable loss experience.\n\nThe insurer\u2019s third-quarter results will include a $55 million to $60 million adverse reserve charge related to the cancellation of the Uber account.\n\nThe reserve charge will amount to about $2 a share, Binner said in a Wednesday note. While \u201cmanageable,\u201d the analyst said concern around reserve adequacy is likely to suppress James River's share price in light of the significant cancellation.\n\nJMP: Excess, Surplus Lines More Profitable\n\nBut Carletti found a positive and said James River is shedding a line of business that has fallen short of profit goals.\n\nThe company\u2019s core Excess and Surplus lines of business are \u201cseeing the best market conditions in decades,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nCarletti acknowledged a larger-than-expected charge, and said it's unclear whether there will be further reserve charges.\n\n\"We continue to believe that in the intermediate term (beyond what could be a difficult day ahead for the stock) the market focus on strengthening conditions in the core E&S business will ultimately win out.\"\n\nCanceling the Uber contract made sense, the analyst said.\n\n\u201cThere was not enough margin to be had in Uber\u2019s business to continue forward, particularly when the core E&S business is seeing significant opportunities,\u201d Carletti said.\n\n\u201cWhile the removal of Uber\u2019s $300 million net premiums written will lead to a reduction in 2020 EPS, we believe it will be short-lived as the fast-growing core E&S business is much more profitable.\u201d\n\nPrice Action\n\nJames River stock was down 22.67% at $37.84 at the time of publication.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nMid-Afternoon Market Update: Dow Rises Over 200 Points; Ocugen Shares Spike Higher\n\nBenzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For October 9, 2019\n\nLatest Ratings for JRVR\n\nDate Firm Action From To Oct 2019 Downgrades Buy Hold Oct 2019 Downgrades Neutral Sell Jun 2019 Maintains Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for JRVR\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
