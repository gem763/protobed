Some reports have suggested Borrell will name a special envoy for the dialogue, which could have minimized his direct involvement in the issue.\n\nBut Borrell made clear he saw reviving the stalled dialogue as one of his priorities.\n\nAsked if he would push Spain to recognize Kosovo, Borrell said that \"recognition of Kosovo is a competence of member states.\"\n\n\"My first visit will be to Pristina,\" he told the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. \"I've never been in Kosovo, for obvious reasons, but my first trip will be there.\"\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a decade after a conflict that ended Serb rule of the territory. More than 100 countries have recognized Kosovo, including the United States, Germany, France and Britain. But Belgrade continues to regard Kosovo as a rebel province \u2014 and other countries, including Belgrade's ally, Russia, and five EU member states, take the same stance.\n\nSpain's refusal to recognize Kosovo is tied to concerns that such a step would embolden separatists at home, such as the Catalan independence movement.\n\nAsked if he would push Spain to recognize Kosovo, Borrell said that \"recognition of Kosovo is a competence of member states.\" But he said that while EU members diverged on Kosovo's status, they are \"united in engagement.\"\n\n\"One thing is clear: Kosovo and Serbia have to reach an agreement. This is the important thing. And I will do utmost in order to fulfil this priority,\" he said.\n\nHe said if the EU was not able to solve a problem in its immediate vicinity, \"it's very hard to believe that we are going to be a geopolitical power.\"\n\nBorrell, who is widely expected to be confirmed in the EU post, also said he was happy Kosovo had held \"full, democratic elections\" on Sunday. Opposition parties triumphed in the parliamentary poll while parties that emerged from the guerrilla movement that fought Serb rule fared badly, with voters blaming them for widespread corruption and cronyism.", "description": "Deal between Belgrade and Pristina will be priority, Spanish foreign minister says.", "authors": ["Andrew Gray", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174221870-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
