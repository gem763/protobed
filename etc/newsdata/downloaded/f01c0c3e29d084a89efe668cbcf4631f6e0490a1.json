(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nHundreds of scientists are about to strand themselves in sea ice in the North Pole \u2014 an ambitious effort to understand the consequences of a changing climate in the fastest-warming part of the globe.\n\nThe effort begins Friday, when the German icebreaker RV Polarstern sets sail from the Norwegian port of Tromso with scores of researchers and hundreds of tons of scientific equipment onboard. As winter darkness descends on the Arctic, the adventurers will allow the sea to freeze around their vessel, trapping them. The Polarstern will spend the next 12 months drifting slowly across the pole, as scientists collect crucial observations on the water, the ice, the air and the living inhabitants, until summer melting finally sets the ship free.\n\nThe Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) is the largest Arctic research project in history and one of humanity\u2019s greatest efforts to understand how melting at the pole will affect the rest of the planet.\n\n[Adrift in the Arctic: Nowhere on Earth is warming as fast. Scientists will spend a year trapped in sea ice to understand what that means for the world.]\n\nA decade in the making, the project costs at least $134 million. Its members come from 60 institutions in 17 countries, led by Germany\u2019s Alfred Wegener Institute.\n\nSoon after departure, the project\u2019s coordinators will face a crucial decision: To which floe should they link their fates? If it drifts too far in any direction, the Polarstern could end up beyond the reach of emergency rescuers, or in waters where Russia prohibits the collection of scientific data.\n\nDrawing on historical records, oceanographers have developed sophisticated models aimed at understanding where a given piece of ice will travel over the course of the year. But the Arctic\u2019s past is not always a good predictor of its future; the Arctic sea ice extent in the summer fell to near record lows.\n\nOnce locked into their chosen floe, the scientists will build a gigantic, floating research station around the ship. Each research division will have its own \u201ccity\u201d on the ice, connected by wooden walkways designed to ensure that no meteorologist accidentally stumbles through a biology experiment and alters the results. Via snowmobile and helicopter, scientists will be able to venture farther afield \u2014 but always under the watchful eye of an armed guard trained to ward off polar bears.\n\n\n\nThe German icebreaker and research vessel Polarstern is shown at shore in Norway on Sept. 18.

Virtually their only link to the rest of the world will be the ships and aircraft scheduled to arrive at the end of each leg \u2014 winter blizzards and stormy seas permitting \u2014 to swap out passengers and restock food and fuel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Christmas Eve sense for all of us right now,\u201d said Dartmouth geophysicist Don Perovich, co-lead for the project\u2019s sea ice investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to think about what we\u2019re going to get to see in the next year.\u201d\n\nExpedition head Markus Rex calls the Arctic \u201cthe epicenter of global warming.\u201d Nowhere on Earth is changing as fast as there, where temperatures are an estimated 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they were 150 years ago.\n\nBut the deep cold and impenetrable dark of the central Arctic make it almost impossible to study during the winter; planes can\u2019t fly, and even the strongest icebreakers can\u2019t traverse the frozen seas. Drifting with the ice, as the Polarstern is doing, is the only way to access this remote part of the planet in its harshest season. But a successful transpolar drift has been achieved just twice before, and never by a modern research vessel.\n\nNow, for the first time, scientists will be able to watch as open water freezes white and still, as the sun dips behind the horizon and stays there, as life goes quiet while the auroras dance. They\u2019ll be there to bear witness when the light returns, when the days lengthen, and plants and animals start to flourish in increasingly open waters. They\u2019ll be able to track the Arctic\u2019s transformation across the seasons and make sense of small-scale processes that can have dramatic large-scale consequences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like spending years reading a random chapter from a book and trying to figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Perovich said. \u201cIn this case, we\u2019ll be there from page one to the last page.\u201d\n\n\n\nByron Blomquist climbs on a ridge of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean beyond Utqiagvik, Alaska, on April 10. Blomquist was among a group gathered to prepare for the upcoming year-long MOSAiC expedition. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nBut MOSAiC is \u201cnot just an intellectual exercise,\u201d Perovich added. Research suggests that rising temperatures and declining sea ice in the Arctic are having dangerous ripple effects across the globe.\n\nFor centuries, the persistent cold at the top of the world has been like a keystone in an arch \u2014 it stabilized the entire Earth system. Its absence, said Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at Woods Hole Research Center, could cause long-established weather patterns around the planet to topple like dominoes.\n\n\u201cWe should all be worrying,\u201d Francis said.\n\nSea ice reflects the majority of sunlight that hits it back into space; without this reflective power, climate change is expected to accelerate. Already, it\u2019s thought that global warming is 25 to 40 percent worse than it would be if the Arctic ice hadn\u2019t melted so much.\n\nAn increasingly open Arctic ocean also contributes to wild fluctuations in the jet stream, the atmospheric river that pushes weather across the Northern Hemisphere. Francis\u2019s research suggests that recent extreme weather events \u2014 the polar vortex that gripped the Midwest in the winter, the lasting drought in California, heat waves in Europe and Asia \u2014 are the product of these waves.\n\nAlthough she will not travel aboard the Polarstern, Francis was involved in developing the science plans for MOSAiC. Her research and the work of many others depend on the information the expedition collects, she said. The exchange of heat between water and air, the interactions between ice and clouds, even the exhalation of gases by microscopic Arctic algae all factor into phenomena that could reshape our world.\n\nRead more:\n\nMost American teens are frightened by climate change, poll finds, and about 1 in 4 are taking action\n\nThis ancient climate catastrophe is our best clue about Earth\u2019s future\n\nExtreme climate change has arrived in America", "description": "Hundreds of researchers will be trapped in sea ice to understand climate change in the Arctic.", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "September At Am", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
