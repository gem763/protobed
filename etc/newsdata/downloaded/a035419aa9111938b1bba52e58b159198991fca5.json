I had no idea what to do.\"\n\nMaybe you\u2019re all for ballet class for your child - but your partner thinks it\u2019s a waste of time.\n\nAnd it results in an endless argument with the two of you screaming at each other over a seemingly-menial issue.\n\nAs hard as that moment is \u2013 there is a big difference between a silly tiff - and realising that you and your partner have completely different ideas about how to raise a child.\n\nThis is what Kaitlyn realised when she told the guy that she had first met on Tinder that she was pregnant.\n\n\u201c\u2018My biggest fear is falling into the traps of normalcy,\u2019 he said, stone serious,\u201d the then-25-year-old American woman first wrote onLove What Matters.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh really? Because my biggest concern is raising a healthy human being\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt made my blood burn in my veins.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn realised that she was pregnant when she was just 25.

We could move on with our lives. It would be fine.\u201d\n\nThe pregnancy was hard, even after Kaitlyn decided put her son up for adoption.

This trust.\n\n\u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t ready to do it on my own.\n\n\"I also knew I could find a family who would love my child the way I was loved, it didn\u2019t matter that we weren\u2019t biological family.\u201d\n\n\"I didn\u2019t love it. Until the doctor told me it was him\". Source: Kaitlyn Buhrman\n\n\"I pushed through\"\n\nKaitlyn struggled with her pregnancy \u2013 especially as she was living alone in a city where she didn\u2019t know anyone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she was told that she was carrying a baby boy that things started to get easier.\n\nShe moved back in with her mum \u2013 and worked to make sure her son would be the healthiest baby possible.\n\n\u201cI was terrified of my body, of the small life inside of it. I didn\u2019t want to love it. I didn\u2019t love it. Until the doctor told me it was him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThen he was Wilder, and nothing else mattered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d pushed through. My son was growing strong and healthy in my belly.\u201d\n\nThe first time Kaitlyn held baby Wilder.

Just pressure and the loudest silence.\n\n\u201cThere are also\u2014more often now days, when I\u2019m reminded constantly why I made the choice I made.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn gave Wilder up for adoption shortly after he was born. Source: Kaitlyn Buhrman\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be okay\"\n\nWilder is now two years old \u2013 and Kaitlyn has been able to visit him twice since he was adopted.\n\nAt the most recent visit, she was terrified that he wouldn\u2019t know who she was.\n\n\u201cWhat I am continually realising during this process is that that is OK,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be OK. He has a mother, father and older sister, and he also has me. \u2018Two mothers,' his sister says with a smile.\n\n\u201cI gave them to him - and him to them - and it\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ve ever done, ever will do, because in the end, it wasn\u2019t about me or my ego.\n\n\u201cThis is a lesson in feeling all ways at once, but most of all, the depth of power a mother\u2019s love wields, regardless of blood.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn will always be part of Wilder's life.
