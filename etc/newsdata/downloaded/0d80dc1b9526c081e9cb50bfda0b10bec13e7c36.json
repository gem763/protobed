Williams suggesting that the apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein was somehow tied to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhy it matters: This is not the first time the president has amplified baseless conspiracy theories, having risen to political prominence in part thanks to the \"birther\" campaign that claimed President Obama was not born in the United States. Trump also suggested during the 2016 presidential campaign that Sen. Ted Cruz's father was somehow involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.", "description": "This is not the first time the president has amplified unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/b6tngP2SsNRrsEocWwZ8IPkVut4=/0x0:452x254/1920x1080/2019/08/11/1565525613855.png", "published_at": "2019-08-11"}
