Though she began her campaign before many of her high-profile competitors, Warren was stuck in the middle of the pack for a good portion of the early primary season behind the likes of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. But she\u2019s made steady gains through the summer, releasing a series of bold, detailed policy proposals and nipping at the heels of Biden, whose frontrunner status has appeared in jeopardy as the Massachusetts Senator draws nearer. A star turn at the Iowa State Fair encapsulated her growing momentum; while the former vice president stumbled numerous times in the key caucus state, Warren electrified the audience of thousands that came to see her call for a wealth tax on the richest Americans. \u201cIs it more important to leave the two cents for the bazillionaires?\u201d she asked at the state fair, \u201cOr use that two cents to invest in all of our kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo cents, two cents!\u201d the crowd yelled back.\n\nIf the fair suggested a growing momentum around Warren, her rally in Seattle over the weekend confirmed it. Speaking at the city\u2019s International Fountain Park on Sunday, she drew what her staff believed to be the largest crowd of her campaign about a week after bringing in 12,000 supporters in Minnesota. Crowd size isn\u2019t necessarily a perfect predictor of political success, but there\u2019s a reason Donald Trump consistently lies and brags about his attendance numbers. Massive crowds can be a real gauge of enthusiasm. They can show how well a message is resonating. And as Warren works her way up the polls, it\u2019s clear that what she\u2019s saying resonates. \u201cThey understand they\u2019ve got a government that\u2019s working great for the bazillionaires, but just not working for them,\u201d she told reporters after the Seattle rally. \u201cTo change that it\u2019s going to take all of us. Nobody gets to stay on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n\u2014 The Trump-baiting Anthony Scaramucci interview that roiled the president\n\n\u2014 Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?
