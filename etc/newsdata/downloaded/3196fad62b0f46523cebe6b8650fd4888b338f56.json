Almost all of the adverts, paid for using public funds, prominently state that the UK will be leaving at the end of October and many feature a calendar counting down to the end of the month.\n\nDespite the expectation that Brexit will again be delayed by up to three months, a government spokesperson confirmed that the \u201ccampaign is still live\u201d and spending will continue. It could take some time to redesign the hundreds of different adverts in all formats that prominently feature the 31 October date. Decisions will also have to be taken on whether to bin recently produced marketing material emphasising that it is the date the UK will definitely leave the EU.\n\nMPs condemn 'misleading' no-deal Brexit publicity campaign Read more\n\nThe advertising campaign has been widely reported to cost about \u00a3100m, although actual figures have not been released by the government. Doubts have been raised within the advertising industry about the likelihood of spending that much in just two months, given major British companies such as Tesco spend less than \u00a375m on traditional advertising in an entire year.\n\nHowever, the wider Get Ready public information campaign has expanded to include stalls on British high streets, other forms of marketing, and adverts in local languages across Europe, potentially pushing up the cost. On Wednesday, the UK embassy in Belgium shared photos of a Brexit information point it had opened at a service station under the title \u201cSoyez pr\u00eat pour le Brexit,\u201d while some baffled Spanish users of Spotify say they have been bombarded with the adverts \u2013 potentially in an attempt to reach British emigrants living there.\n\nUK in Belgium\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea (@UKinBelgium) First #Brexit Transport Information Point in Belgium opened this morning in the Total service station in @gemeentejabbeke.

On Thursday night the i ran a story claiming the campaign had been pulled, but has since deleted the article, noting it \u201cdid not meet our editorial standards\u201d.\n\nEarlier this month a report from the National Audit Office suggested the campaign could be too late to prepare the public and businesses for a no-deal Brexit: \u201cAt this late stage and with ongoing uncertainty about the prospect of no deal on 31 October, this may have limited impact.\u201d", "description": "Government says campaign to prepare the public for Brexit on 31 October is still live", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcacc2458c7c83dffd345bbb5b30b548aeea8a28/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e1dba9b64e2fabbe7a59ad698704be2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
