Terry Graham, asked Steinaker to come to the cockpit so that he could leave to use the restroom. Southwest Airlines policy requires two crew members in the cockpit at all times, so Steinaker was asked to staff the cockpit with co-pilot Ryan Russell in Graham's absence.\n\nThe suit states that when Steinaker entered the cockpit, she spotted an iPad mounted to the windshield to the left of the captain\u2019s seat. On it, she reportedly could see a live stream of what appeared to be Graham in the bathroom.\n\nThe filing states that Russell looked panicked and told her the cameras were a new top-secret security measure that had been installed in all Southwest Airlines planes, which Steinaker did not believe to be true.\n\nSouthwest Airlines More\n\n\"They led her to believe that she and others had been filmed \u2014 had been videotaped if you will \u2014 while they were using the lavatory. It's really hard to imagine a more outrageous kind of conduct,\" aviation attorney Ronald L.M. Goldman, who is representing Steinaker, told the USA TODAY network.\n\nAccording to the court filing, Steinaker took a photograph of the iPad with her cellphone to document the incident.\n\nUpon landing, the pilots violated airline protocol and \"disembarked, leaving the aircraft unattended by piloting staff,\" Steinaker alleges in the suit. It also claims that Graham \"left a loaded firearm unattended in the cockpit, a violation of FAA regulations.\"\n\nSteinaker and other crew members reported the incident to the airline. The suit claims the pilots were allowed to proceed to their next flight and they continue to fly with the airline today.\n\nSteinaker claims she was told not to talk to anybody about the incident and was warned that \"if this got out, if this went public, no one, I mean no one, would ever fly our airline again.\"\n\nGoldman also represents Steinaker's husband David, also a Southwest flight attendant.\n\nThe suit alleges the Steinakers have faced retaliation through stalking, being monitored by managers in a \"threatening and bizarre manner\" and being subjected to an increased number of performance audits.\n\n\"In my view, Southwest Airlines has treated this as 'how dare they report it' rather than 'thank you for letting us know,\" Goldman said.\n\nSouthwest Airlines responds\n\nIn an emailed statement to the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, a representative for Southwest Airlines said:\n\n\"The safety and security of our employees and customers is Southwest\u2019s uncompromising priority. As such, Southwest does not place cameras in the lavatories of our aircraft. At this time, we have no other comment on the pending litigation.\"\n\nWe reached out to the attorney representing the two pilots named in the suit by email and phone. We will update this story when we receive a response.\n\nIn court, attorneys for the pilots have denied that the two engaged in livestreaming the lavatory. Court filings also deny that the two violated any airline policy or protocol.\n\nTo Goldman, the incident indicates both privacy and safety concerns.\n\n\"In my opinion as an aviation lawyer with many years of experience, this does compromise the safety of flight and the safety of passengers, not even to mention for the potential of violating the privacy of all of the passengers as well as the crew,\" Goldman said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Lawsuit says Southwest Airlines' pilots livestreamed plane bathroom", "description": "A Phoenix-based Southwest Airlines flight attendant says she was retaliated against after reporting two pilots for livestreaming a plane's lavatory.", "authors": ["Melissa Yeager", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N4b1FOk0SElM8K1HmbTCng--~B/aD0xOTk5O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_travel_320/f94008678d2822f14000024051cf6f8a", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
