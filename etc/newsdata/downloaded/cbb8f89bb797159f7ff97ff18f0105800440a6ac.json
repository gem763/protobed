He said that the Kurds, long Washington\u2019s ally against ISIS, were \u201cno angels\u201d and that some were in fact worse terrorists than ISIS itself. And he described mounting violence that has killed scores of civilians and has included multiple reports of war crimes, as a fight over sand that didn\u2019t concern the U.S.\n\nIt was a dizzying series of statements by the President that contradicted policies touted by Trump\u2019s own administration as recently as two weeks ago. The result, said worried foreign policy experts, was not just a short term danger of a resurgent ISIS and the human cost as foreign forces swept through the power vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal, but a larger shift in power in the region. \u201cThe world sees a U.S. President with no plan or understanding of the lasting and severe consequences of both his actions and inactions,\u201d said Chuck Hagel, a former U.S. Defense Secretary and Republican Senator from Nebraska.\n\nTrump\u2019s sharp break with his own recent policies reflected how rapidly and unfavorably events in Northern Syria have unfolded in the wake of his Oct. 6 phone call with Turkey\u2019s leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

On Tuesday, Russians were already sleeping in bunks at bases that American troops had spent years building and provisioning only to abandon them in haste just hours earlier. Trump\u2019s former counter-ISIS envoy Brett McGurk wrote on Twitter that U.S. forces were \u201cexecuting [an] emergency \u2018break glass\u2019 evacuation procedure reserved for an extreme worst-case scenario.\u201d The result, says Hagel is a big win for Russian president Vladimir Putin. \u201cRussia comes out the big winner in the Middle East,\u201d Hagel said. \u201cPutin now is the go-to guy in the Middle East. Assad will do what Putin wants.\u201d\n\nTrump likewise downplayed his abandonment of the Kurds, who had fought ISIS alongside U.S. troops since 2015. Following the U.S. retreat, the Kurds switched military allegiances for their own survival, aligning themselves this week with Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe Kurds are very well protected,\u201d Trump said, \u201cPlus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senators like Lindsey Graham were particularly vocal in criticizing Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds in the fight against ISIS. \u201cI worry we will not have allies in the future against radical Islam, ISIS will reemerge, & Iran\u2019s rise in Syria will become a nightmare for Israel,\u201d Graham tweeted, \u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making.\u201d Although ISIS is no longer in control of any major city in Iraq or Syria, the fighting is not over. The U.S. had been relying on the Kurds to destroy remaining underground ISIS cells and to guard more than 30 detention facilities that hold about 11,000 ISIS detainees spread across northern Syria.\n\nTrump also dismissed reports of mounting violence, which the U.N. said has displaced 130,000 people and killed scores of others. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem we have very nicely under control,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not our problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of sand they can play with.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how Trump describes the developments, he and his aides spent much of Wednesday scrambling to contain the damage.\n\nTrump sent Erdogan a remarkably undiplomatic letter, first reported by Fox Business, cajoling and threatening the Turkish president. Trump wrote, \u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are scheduled to travel to Ankara in search of a ceasefire in coming days. But Erdogan has already publicly dismissed the idea. By unleashing chaos and then declaring the U.S. will play no role in containing it, says Anthony Cordesman, a former Pentagon intelligence official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Trump has left Erdogan \u201clittle to gain from backing down from an operation that is extremely popular in Turkey.\u201d If Erdogan halts now, Cordesman says, there \u201cis no clear prospect of the U.S. doing anything to actually bring stability back to the Kurdish parts of Syria.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats joined in a desperate effort to constrain Turkey. The House delivered a rare bipartisan condemnation of the decision to abandon the Kurds with a 354-60 vote. The measure, which is largely symbolic, calls on Turkey to immediately end the military assault in northern Syria. \u201cAt President Trump\u2019s hands, American leadership has been laid low,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, who introduced the measure and serves as Foreign Affairs Committee chairman.\n\nTrump held a contentious meeting with leaders from both parties in Congress at the White House, during which he argued he was ensuring American security through the withdrawal. Trump told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that fewer that 100 ISIS fighters had escaped, and claimed they were the least dangerous of those who had been detained, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting.\n\nSchumer asked Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who was present at the meeting, whether the escapees were in fact not dangerous, and Esper said he could not confirm that, according to the Democratic source. When Trump said his plan was to keep Americans safe, Pelosi retorted that wasn\u2019t a plan, it was a goal, according to a senior Democratic aide familiar with the meeting. Trump later called Pelosi a \u201cthird-grade politician\u201d according to the source, at which point Pelosi and other Democrats left.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the United States\u2019 calls for a ceasefire and instead advanced deeper into Syria. Turkey, a NATO member, has long wanted to launch a military offensive against the Kurdish militias in Syria because they consider them terrorists. The U.S. had for months promised the Kurds ongoing U.S. support, but Trump backed down when Erdogan threatened invasion during the Oct. 6 call.\n\nAs for Trump, he dismissed the fallout of his decision to withdraw the troops. \u201cWe\u2019re 7,000 miles away,\u201d Trump said Wednesday, \u201cI campaigned on bringing our soldiers back home, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d To the regional powers scrambling to take advantage of the hasty American retreat, he added: \u201cI wish them all a lot of luck.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, after U.S. forces left a military base they had established at a cement facility in Northern Syria, two F-15 fighter jets hit the base with an airstrike to obliterate an ammunition cache and to \u201creduce the facility\u2019s military usefulness.\u201d\n\n\u2013with reporting by Alana Abramson and Tessa Berenson\n\nWrite to W.J.
