Britain planned to make 10 of the mines and position them with the British Army in West Germany to counter a feared Soviet attack\n\nHowever the mine was scrapped in 1958 after just two prototypes had been manufactured, and was never used.\n\nMilitary chiefs are said to have been reluctant to place nuclear weapons in allied countries, fearing the possible fallout.\n\nThe Cold War plans were hatched after the first UK nuclear bomb was detonated on islands off Western Australia in Operation Hurricane, in October 1952.\n\nThe 1950s testing produced the Blue Danube bomb, Britain's first nuclear weapon, which was transported by RAF planes.\n\nBritain later switched away from air-launched weapons, introducing the Polaris submarine-based system in 1968.\n\nThe final air-launched nuclear weapon was abandoned in 1998, according to the MoD, leaving Trident as the UK's deterrent.", "description": "Military chiefs planned to use the explosives, codenamed Blue Peacock (pictured), to devastate Soviet forces if they forced the western Allies into retreat during an invasion of Europe.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/01/13/8016470-0-image-a-38_1546349156524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-01"}
