Biden, and Mr. Biden\u2019s son with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats suspect that Mr. Trump withheld military aid to the country to try to pressure Mr. Zelensky into investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, though Mr. Trump has denied that he exerted undue influence.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
