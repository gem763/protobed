The 40 best albums to listen to before you die 1/40 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn\u2019t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child\u2019s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is a love song. European Son is rock\u2019n\u2019roll turned sonic shockwave. That\u2019s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called \u201cthe future of music\u201d. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground & Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey 2/40 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha Franklin When Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he \"took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself\". The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown 3/40 Master of Puppets (1986), Metallica Despite not featuring any singles, Metallica\u2019s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they\u2019d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like \u201cDamage Inc\u201d and \u201cOrion\u201d. This album is about storytelling \u2013 the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener \u201cBattery\u201d should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up \u2013 they ripped Dungeons & Dragons clich\u00e9s out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O\u2019Connor 4/40 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads \u201cFacts are simple and facts are straight / Facts are lazy and facts are late\u2026\u201d sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB 5/40 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the Wailers The album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life \u201cwhere the living is hardest\u201d in \u201cConcrete Jungle\u201d and looked back to Jamaica\u2019s ignoble slaving past \u2013 \u201cNo chains around my feet but I\u2019m not free\u201d. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as \u201cHigh Tide and Low Tide\u201d, and rhythmic dance tracks like \u201cKinky Reggae\u201d. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CH 6/40 Revolver (1966), The Beatles An unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFor No One\u201d and the psychedelia of Lennon\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d and \u201cShe Said, She Said\u201d can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HB 7/40 Like a Prayer (1989), Madonna It may be the most \u201cserious\u201d album she\u2019s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible \u2013 pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna\u2019s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in divorce, and she was causing controversy with the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener\u2019s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her \u2013 Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly & the Family Stone, and Simon & Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience \u2013 and the press \u2013 to like her. RO 8/40 Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Led Zeppelin Millennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page\u2019s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant\u2019s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it\u2019s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB 9/40 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-Las Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwith their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs\u201d. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. \"Leader of the Pack\" (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH 10/40 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David Bowie Flamboyance, excess, eccentricity \u2013 this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock\u2019s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album \u2013 musically and thematically \u2013 that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. \u201cI\u2019m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to pretend I\u2019m a radio. I\u2019d rather go out and be a colour television set.\u201d RO 11/40 Unknown Pleasures (1979), Joy Division In their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs \u2013 \"Disorder\", \"She\u2019s Lost Control\" and \"New Dawn Fades\" \u2013 and for those who\u2019d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook\u2019s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on \"I Remember Nothing\" is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CH 12/40 Hejira (1976), Joni Mitchell Though her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of \u201cstrange pillows\u201d and solitude. HB 13/40 Body Talk (2010), Robyn The answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of \u201cHang With Me\u201d (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since \u201cI Feel Love\u201d, \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH 14/40 Off The Wall (1979), Michael Jackson \u201cI will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,\u201d wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HB 15/40 Illmatic (1994), Nas How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music \u2013 not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d RO 16/40 Trans-Europe Express (1977), Kraftwerk This is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk\u2019s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter\u2019s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two\u2019s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \"I Feel Love\", Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH 17/40 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles Davis With the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world\u2019s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis\u2019s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale \u201cwithout having to meet the deadline of a particular chord\u201d. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB 18/40 Astral Weeks (1968), Van Morrison \u201cIf I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream\u2026\u201d To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting \u2013 double bass, classical guitar and flute \u2013 make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH 19/40 West Side Story Soundtrack (1961) \u201cLife is all right in America / If you're all white in America\u201d yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music; Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB 20/40 Sign o' the Times (1987), Prince Sign o\u2019 the Times is Prince\u2019s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks \u2013 a double album spanning funk, rock, R&B and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion \u2013 the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o\u2019 the Times, the bass is king \u2013 Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like \u201cAdore\u201d, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. RO 21/40 Pet Sounds (1966), The Beach Boys Caught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HB 22/40 Ys (2006), Joanna Newsom Weave a circle round her thrice\u2026 Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart\u2019s depths \u2013 \u201cStill, my dear, I\u2019d have walked you to the edge of the water\u201d. Ys\u2019s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom\u2019s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you\u2019re bewitched, Ys\u2019s spell never wears off. CH 23/40 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public Enemy Public Enemy\u2019s second album is hip-hop\u2019s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions\u2026 is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, \u201cHere is a land that never gave a damn / About a brother like me,\u201d raps Chuck D on \u201cBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos\u201d. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH 24/40 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd It\u2019s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and \u201cquiet desperation\u201d of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB 25/40 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn Hill Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. RO 26/40 Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), Serge Gainsbourg The great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn\u2019t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier\u2019s heavenly string arrangements. \u201cBallade de Melody Nelson\u201d, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CH 27/40 In My Own Time (1971), Karen Dalton There\u2019s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton\u2019s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge\u2019s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB 28/40 Let England Shake (2011), PJ Harvey \u201cGoddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.\u201d PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Words That Maketh Murder\u201d, \u201cArms and legs are in the trees.\u201d Musically, though, it\u2019s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that\u2019s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH 29/40 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee Rascal It\u2019s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO 30/40 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate Bush Proof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush\u2019s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HB 31/40 Blue Lines (1991), Massive Attack A uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective\u2019s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation\u2019s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky\u2019s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson\u2019s exhilarating improvisations. HB 32/40 Surfer Rosa (1987), Pixies It only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges\u2019 Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies\u2019 sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (\u201cyour bone\u2019s got a little machine\u201d). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal\u2019s softer melodic tone won\u2019t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its \u201cloud, quiet, loud\u201d tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain would later say he \u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies\u201d. CH 33/40 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world\u2019s cultural divisions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California\u2019s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HB 34/40 The Great Gospel Men (1993), Various artists Compared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can\u2019t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener \u201cMove on Up a Little Higher\u201d by Brother Joe May, you\u2019re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from \u201cLord, Lord, Lord\u201d by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland\u2019s \u201cMy Soul Looks Back\u201d are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH 35/40 Hopelessness (2016), Anonhi \u201cA lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,\u201d said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club\u2019s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HB 36/40 In Utero (1993), Nirvana Kurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the \u201ccandy-ass\u201d sound on Nevermind \u2013 the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet \u2013 and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies\u2019 producer Steve Albini to oversee production. It didn\u2019t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. \u201cGO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY\u201d he screams on \u201cScentless Apprentice\u201d, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. RO 37/40 Curtis (1971), Curtis Mayfield Curtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield\u2019s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon\u2019s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of \u201c(Don\u2019t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We\u2019re All Going to Go\u201d; doleful horns give the politically conscious \u201cWe the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\u201d a profound emotional undertow; \u201cMove On Up\u201d is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CH 38/40 Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac Before they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time; its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. RO 39/40 Are You Experienced? (1967), Jimi Hendrix A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RO 40/40 We Are Family (1979), Sister Sledge Disco\u2019s crowning glory is this album that Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and \u2019Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them \u2013 We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal \u201cGood Times\u201d by Chic \u2013 and this album has four of them, \u201cLost in Music\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s the Greatest Dancer\u201d, \u201cThinking of You\u201d and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH 1/40 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn\u2019t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child\u2019s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is a love song. European Son is rock\u2019n\u2019roll turned sonic shockwave. That\u2019s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called \u201cthe future of music\u201d. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground & Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey 2/40 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha Franklin When Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he \"took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself\". The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown 3/40 Master of Puppets (1986), Metallica Despite not featuring any singles, Metallica\u2019s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they\u2019d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like \u201cDamage Inc\u201d and \u201cOrion\u201d. This album is about storytelling \u2013 the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener \u201cBattery\u201d should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up \u2013 they ripped Dungeons & Dragons clich\u00e9s out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O\u2019Connor 4/40 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads \u201cFacts are simple and facts are straight / Facts are lazy and facts are late\u2026\u201d sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB 5/40 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the Wailers The album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life \u201cwhere the living is hardest\u201d in \u201cConcrete Jungle\u201d and looked back to Jamaica\u2019s ignoble slaving past \u2013 \u201cNo chains around my feet but I\u2019m not free\u201d. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as \u201cHigh Tide and Low Tide\u201d, and rhythmic dance tracks like \u201cKinky Reggae\u201d. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CH 6/40 Revolver (1966), The Beatles An unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFor No One\u201d and the psychedelia of Lennon\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d and \u201cShe Said, She Said\u201d can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HB 7/40 Like a Prayer (1989), Madonna It may be the most \u201cserious\u201d album she\u2019s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible \u2013 pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna\u2019s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in divorce, and she was causing controversy with the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener\u2019s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her \u2013 Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly & the Family Stone, and Simon & Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience \u2013 and the press \u2013 to like her. RO 8/40 Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Led Zeppelin Millennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page\u2019s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant\u2019s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it\u2019s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB 9/40 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-Las Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwith their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs\u201d. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. \"Leader of the Pack\" (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH 10/40 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David Bowie Flamboyance, excess, eccentricity \u2013 this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock\u2019s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album \u2013 musically and thematically \u2013 that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. \u201cI\u2019m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to pretend I\u2019m a radio. I\u2019d rather go out and be a colour television set.\u201d RO 11/40 Unknown Pleasures (1979), Joy Division In their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs \u2013 \"Disorder\", \"She\u2019s Lost Control\" and \"New Dawn Fades\" \u2013 and for those who\u2019d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook\u2019s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on \"I Remember Nothing\" is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CH 12/40 Hejira (1976), Joni Mitchell Though her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of \u201cstrange pillows\u201d and solitude. HB 13/40 Body Talk (2010), Robyn The answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of \u201cHang With Me\u201d (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since \u201cI Feel Love\u201d, \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH 14/40 Off The Wall (1979), Michael Jackson \u201cI will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,\u201d wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HB 15/40 Illmatic (1994), Nas How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music \u2013 not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d RO 16/40 Trans-Europe Express (1977), Kraftwerk This is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk\u2019s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter\u2019s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two\u2019s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \"I Feel Love\", Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH 17/40 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles Davis With the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world\u2019s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis\u2019s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale \u201cwithout having to meet the deadline of a particular chord\u201d. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB 18/40 Astral Weeks (1968), Van Morrison \u201cIf I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream\u2026\u201d To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting \u2013 double bass, classical guitar and flute \u2013 make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH 19/40 West Side Story Soundtrack (1961) \u201cLife is all right in America / If you're all white in America\u201d yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music; Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB 20/40 Sign o' the Times (1987), Prince Sign o\u2019 the Times is Prince\u2019s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks \u2013 a double album spanning funk, rock, R&B and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion \u2013 the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o\u2019 the Times, the bass is king \u2013 Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like \u201cAdore\u201d, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. RO 21/40 Pet Sounds (1966), The Beach Boys Caught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HB 22/40 Ys (2006), Joanna Newsom Weave a circle round her thrice\u2026 Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart\u2019s depths \u2013 \u201cStill, my dear, I\u2019d have walked you to the edge of the water\u201d. Ys\u2019s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom\u2019s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you\u2019re bewitched, Ys\u2019s spell never wears off. CH 23/40 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public Enemy Public Enemy\u2019s second album is hip-hop\u2019s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions\u2026 is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, \u201cHere is a land that never gave a damn / About a brother like me,\u201d raps Chuck D on \u201cBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos\u201d. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH 24/40 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd It\u2019s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and \u201cquiet desperation\u201d of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB 25/40 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn Hill Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. RO 26/40 Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), Serge Gainsbourg The great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn\u2019t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier\u2019s heavenly string arrangements. \u201cBallade de Melody Nelson\u201d, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CH 27/40 In My Own Time (1971), Karen Dalton There\u2019s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton\u2019s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge\u2019s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB 28/40 Let England Shake (2011), PJ Harvey \u201cGoddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.\u201d PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Words That Maketh Murder\u201d, \u201cArms and legs are in the trees.\u201d Musically, though, it\u2019s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that\u2019s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH 29/40 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee Rascal It\u2019s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO 30/40 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate Bush Proof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush\u2019s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HB 31/40 Blue Lines (1991), Massive Attack A uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective\u2019s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation\u2019s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky\u2019s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson\u2019s exhilarating improvisations. HB 32/40 Surfer Rosa (1987), Pixies It only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges\u2019 Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies\u2019 sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (\u201cyour bone\u2019s got a little machine\u201d). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal\u2019s softer melodic tone won\u2019t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its \u201cloud, quiet, loud\u201d tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain would later say he \u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies\u201d. CH 33/40 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world\u2019s cultural divisions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California\u2019s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HB 34/40 The Great Gospel Men (1993), Various artists Compared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can\u2019t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener \u201cMove on Up a Little Higher\u201d by Brother Joe May, you\u2019re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from \u201cLord, Lord, Lord\u201d by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland\u2019s \u201cMy Soul Looks Back\u201d are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH 35/40 Hopelessness (2016), Anonhi \u201cA lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,\u201d said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club\u2019s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HB 36/40 In Utero (1993), Nirvana Kurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the \u201ccandy-ass\u201d sound on Nevermind \u2013 the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet \u2013 and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies\u2019 producer Steve Albini to oversee production. It didn\u2019t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. \u201cGO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY\u201d he screams on \u201cScentless Apprentice\u201d, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. RO 37/40 Curtis (1971), Curtis Mayfield Curtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield\u2019s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon\u2019s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of \u201c(Don\u2019t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We\u2019re All Going to Go\u201d; doleful horns give the politically conscious \u201cWe the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\u201d a profound emotional undertow; \u201cMove On Up\u201d is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CH 38/40 Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac Before they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time; its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. RO 39/40 Are You Experienced? (1967), Jimi Hendrix A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RO 40/40 We Are Family (1979), Sister Sledge Disco\u2019s crowning glory is this album that Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and \u2019Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them \u2013 We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal \u201cGood Times\u201d by Chic \u2013 and this album has four of them, \u201cLost in Music\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s the Greatest Dancer\u201d, \u201cThinking of You\u201d and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH\n\nBB is a nickname\n\nThe musician\u2019s real name was Riley B King, but he found his professional name after working as a DJ on Tennessee radio station WDIA. There, he was nicknamed Blues Boy, which was later shortened to BB.\n\nHe was one of the musicians to put Beale Street on the map\n\nKing was an integral part of the blues scene on Beale Street in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He performed alongside Bobby Bland, Johnny Ace and Earl Forrest in a band called The Beale Streeters, and would later credit the location with kick-starting his career. A blues club was opened there in his honour in 1994.\n\nMusic wasn\u2019t his only talent\n\nAs well as singing and playing the guitar, King became a certified private pilot after learning to fly in 1963.

Shape Created with Sketch. 18 of the greatest gigs ever \u2013 according to our critics 1/18 David Bowie, Rainbow Theatre, 1972 The long gone Rainbow in London\u2019s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even finished building the stage,\u201d I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with David/Ziggy walking out to the drums of \u201cFive Years\u201d and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven\u2019s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act \u2013 a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister) Getty 2/18 Dolly Parton, Dominion Theatre, 1983 Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London\u2019s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of \u201cDo I Ever Cross Your Mind?\u201d and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqu\u00e9 jokes and blue banter. There\u2019s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton) Rex 3/18 Live Aid, Dominion Theatre, 1985 You don\u2019t usually realise you\u2019re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing \u201cRockin\u2019 All Over The World\u201d. There were numerous stand-out moments; perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of \u201cLet It Be\u201d, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d and \u201cRadio Ga Ga\u201d to \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d and \u201cWe Are The Champions\u201d. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister) 4/18 BB King, Hammersmith Odeon, 1985 Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London\u2019s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of \u201cThe Thrill is Gone\u201d. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell's Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King's face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton) AP 5/18 Rollercoaster Tour, Brixton Academy, 1992 When The Jesus & Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey\u2019s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that\u2019s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like \u201cColin Zeal\u201d while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single \u201cPopscene\u201d, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I'd seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn\u2019t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont) Getty 6/18 PIxies, Brixton Academy, 2004 When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs \u2013 and music just doesn\u2019t get better than that \u2013 it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. \u201cTame\u201d sent me feral, \u201cGigantic\u201d was titanic, \u201cBone Machine\u201d crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through \u201cGouge Away\u201d, \u201cMonkey Gone To Heaven\u201d and \u201cDebaser\u201d, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was; Kim Deal\u2019s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago\u2019s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan\u2019s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order. (Mark Beaumont) EPA 7/18 Foals, Buffalo Bar, 2007 North London\u2019s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees \u2013 or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious; it\u2019s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you\u2019ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: \"The French Open\", \"Balloons\", \"Hummer\u201d, \u201cMathletics\u201d, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent \"new wave\" vocals. I\u2019d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read \"Math is for Everyone\"), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we\u2019d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray) Rex 8/18 Crystal Castles, Camden Crawl, 2008 Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass\u2019s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe; singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as \u201cCourtship Dating\u201d. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of \u201crock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u201d \u2013 or whatever the hell it is \u2013 most of the time, they\u2019re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There\u2019s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey) PA 9/18 Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008 It used to be that rock\u2019n\u2019roll was a young person\u2019s game; anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer\u2019s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I\u2019ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was \u2013 and indeed remains \u2013 untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges) Rex 10/18 Leonard Cohen, Benicassim Festival, 2013 Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It's sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as \"Dance Me to the End of Love\" and \"So Long, Marianne\" \u2013 are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of \"Hallelujah\". The song's been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it's surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith) Getty 11/18 Bobby Womack, Latitude, 2013 The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we\u2019ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. \u201cAll soul singers come from gospel,\u201d he told them. Womack\u2019s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn\u2019t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special. (Chris Harvey) PA 12/18 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014 Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival \u2013 a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier \u2013 her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty 13/18 Kate Bush, Hammersmith Apollo, 2014 After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I've ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a \"greatest hits\" section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of \"The Ninth Wave\". Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of \"Aerial\", \"The Sky of Honey\", was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones) Rex 14/18 Patti Smith, Field Day, 2015 Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dark glasses,\u201d Smith said by way of introduction. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be cool, it\u2019s just, you know\u2026 the sun.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the f***ing coolest!\u201d a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled; tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn\u2019t matter if she messed up, as she did on \u201cBreak it Up\u201d, because she offered the instantly immortal words: \u201cI don\u2019t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.\u201d You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Getty Images 15/18 D'Angelo, Hammersmith Apollo, 2015 When D\u2019Angelo released his surprise third record \u2013 the politically fraught Black Messiah \u2013 it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000\u2019s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to \u201cSugah Daddy\u201d, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who's live shows to join in the fun. At one point D\u2019Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D\u2019Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a divine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled \"The Second Coming\". (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Corbis 16/18 Lorde, Brighton Centre, 2017 A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde\u2019s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance \u2013 the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she'd chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance \u2013 and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty Images 17/18 David Byrne, Brighton Centre, 2018 When you\u2019ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations \u2013 some mind-blowing, others not \u2013 on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne\u2019s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance \u2013 no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones \u2013 and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges) EPA 18/18 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018 Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier \u2013 known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the \"Chris\" for her second album \u2013 tweeted: \u201cI think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!\u201d She delivered on that promise \u2013 falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet \u2013 as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: \u201cVive everyone!\u201d We left thrilled and elated.

At End of the Road Festival \u2013 a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier \u2013 her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that.

Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I've ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a \"greatest hits\" section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of \"The Ninth Wave\". Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of \"Aerial\", \"The Sky of Honey\", was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am.

The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dark glasses,\u201d Smith said by way of introduction. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be cool, it\u2019s just, you know\u2026 the sun.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the f***ing coolest!\u201d a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled; tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn\u2019t matter if she messed up, as she did on \u201cBreak it Up\u201d, because she offered the instantly immortal words: \u201cI don\u2019t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.\u201d You felt you were in the presence of something momentous.

It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to \u201cSugah Daddy\u201d, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who's live shows to join in the fun. At one point D\u2019Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D\u2019Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a divine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled \"The Second Coming\". (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Corbis 16/18 Lorde, Brighton Centre, 2017 A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde\u2019s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance \u2013 the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she'd chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance \u2013 and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty Images 17/18 David Byrne, Brighton Centre, 2018 When you\u2019ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations \u2013 some mind-blowing, others not \u2013 on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne\u2019s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance \u2013 no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones \u2013 and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges) EPA 18/18 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018 Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier \u2013 known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the \"Chris\" for her second album \u2013 tweeted: \u201cI think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!\u201d She delivered on that promise \u2013 falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet \u2013 as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: \u201cVive everyone!\u201d We left thrilled and elated.
