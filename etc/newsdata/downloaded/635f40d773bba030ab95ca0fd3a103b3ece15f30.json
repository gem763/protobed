The FAA is about to find out.", "language": "en", "text": "This year, over the course of 12 days, 720 volunteers will go through the motions of every air traveler\u2019s nightmare: an emergency evacuation.\n\nThe testing will take place in November at the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, in Oklahoma City, and authorities will use the results to collect 3,000 data points. They will use that information, as mandated by last year\u2019s FAA reauthorization, to determine how small airplane seats can safely get, and how close rows of seats can be to one another. Under federal regulations, planes must be able to be evacuated within 90 seconds.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said it was required to \u201cissue regulations to establish minimum dimensions for airplane seat width, length and pitch that are necessary for the safety of passengers.\u201d But the statement did not commit to any changes, saying that the FAA planned to finish evacuation testing by the end of the year to \u201cdetermine what, if any, regulatory changes are necessary to implement the requirement.\u201d\n\nThat has safety advocates bracing for potentially bad news.\n\n\u201cA bad outcome would be for them to keep the seats essentially as they are or even allow them to shrink further,\u201d says Paul Hudson, president of the consumer organization Flyers Rights. \u201cA good outcome would be for them to require the seats and passenger space be sized in order to accommodate the demographic profiles that we now have.\u201d\n\n[FAA says: We\u2019re a safety agency, not a creature comfort agency]\n\nFAA Deputy Administrator Daniel Elwell laid out some details of the testing for members of Congress at a hearing last week. But several people wanted to be sure the tests would include volunteers who resemble the actual traveling public.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to get these people?\u201d asked Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). \u201cYou\u2019re not going to go to Slim Fast, are you?\u201d\n\nElwell replied: \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to use a good demographic sampling, and we\u2019ll maybe invite you.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Washington Post illustration; iStock)\n\nCohen said that would be good, citing his bad leg. He added: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got people in this country who are larger, but you\u2019ve also got people with disabilities who fly, and you need to have a representative sampling.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said space on planes is shrinking. Some budget carriers offer 28 inches of pitch, or the distance between the point on one seat and the same point on the one behind it.\n\n\u201cI want to get the CEOs here someday, and I\u2019m going to get some of those seats,\u201d he said during the hearing. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to put them in them, and we\u2019re going to keep them here for four or five hours and see what they think about what they\u2019re doing to people.\u201d\n\n[How to evacuate a plane]\n\nEd Coleman, an assistant professor of safety sciences at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the FAA should study the flying population before doing the tests, and base the demographics of its subjects off that. And, he said, those volunteers should not be aware in advance of the evacuation scenarios they\u2019ll have to take part in.\n\nHe said so much has changed since the initial 90-second rule was set that rigorous testing is warranted under current conditions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re flying the airplanes really close to full,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, we didn\u2019t fly at 90-plus percent full, so there was a little extra space in there.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue of pitch. Flyers Rights argued in a 2015 petition that average seat pitch had shrunk from 35 inches to 31 inches.\n\n\u201cNowadays, my knees are in the back of the seat in front of me whenever I get on an airplane,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cAm I going to get out in 90 seconds? I have my doubts.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNo, you won\u2019t have a standing seat on an airplane anytime soon\n\nSenate gives final approval for FAA reauthorization, sends bill to White House\n\nThis airline\u2019s baby map allows passengers to avoid young fliers.
