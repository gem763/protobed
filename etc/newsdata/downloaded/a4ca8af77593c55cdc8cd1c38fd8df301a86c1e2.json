But we have a huge advantage with the phone itself.\u201d\n\nThe Mate 30 Pro\u2019s three-camera array is able to bring images to life in low light. Its on-board video camera has a fine definition of 40 megapixels and, in super-slow motion, a speed of 7,680 frames per second that is several times that of its nearest rival.\n\nThe 6.53-inch flex OLED screen wraps further round the body than earlier models, making it possible to fit a display larger than the one on the iPhone 11 Pro Max, onto a smaller device.\n\nThe Mate 30 will ship to Europe next month, and will be available in China from next week, said Yu. It will be priced from 799 euros ($884), the top-end Mate 30 Pro from 1,099 euros and the Mate 30 Pro 5G from 1,199 euros.\n\nHuawei also has a luxury Porsche Design model for 2,095 euros.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 5G retails at $1,299, and the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999, but lacks 5G connectivity.\n\nRichard Yu, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, launches the Mate 30 smartphone range at the Convention Center in Munich, Germany September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Michael Dalder\n\nOWN-BRANDED APPS\n\nThe build-up to the Huawei launch was overshadowed by uncertainty over whether buyers of the flagship Android device will be able to use apps supported by Google, a unit of Silicon Valley giant Alphabet.\n\nInstead, the new devices will carry Huawei\u2019s own app gallery, while the company will spend $1 billion to promote the system around it. In another incentive to boost its appeal, Huawei is charging app partners a commission of 15% - half the cut taken by Apple and Google.\n\nMate 30 users will be able to download Facebook (FB.O), WhatsApp and Instagram from other app stores. But it would only be possible to access Youtube, Google\u2019s mobile video app, via a web browser, said Yu.\n\nThe phones will run on an \u2018open-source\u2019, or generic, version of the Android operating system - like Huawei\u2019s phones in its Chinese home market. That option means that some apps may not work properly or run smoothly, say experts.\n\nHolding the launch in Europe underlines the importance of the 500 million consumers in the region, where Huawei lost five percentage points in market share since the U.S. ban, even as buyers rallied to its brand at home.\n\nWithout Google on board, however, analysts say Huawei may struggle to win over consumers.\n\n\u201cEven though this phone is filled with lovely features we don\u2019t think it will sell like past generations,\u201d said Annette Zimmermann of consulting firm Gartner.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cThe average user will not accept that they do not have easy access to their favorite apps,\u201d added Zimmermann, who attended the event.\n\nHuawei says the phone\u2019s \u2018brain\u2019 - the Kirin 990 chipset unveiled at a recent tech fair in Berlin - outperforms the Qualcomm-powered (QCOM.O) 5G rivals already on the market from Samsung.\n\nIn particular, the \u2018big core-tiny core\u2019 configuration of the hardware means it can run power-hungry applications like artificial intelligence or support online gaming, while saving battery on routine tasks.\n\n\u201cHuawei has Apple soundly beaten when it comes to form factor design but even these beautiful-looking devices are going to struggle to see any volume without the Google ecosystem,\u201d analyst Richard Windsor said in a note ahead of the launch.", "description": "Huawei [HWT.UL] unveiled its new smartphones to challenge Apple's iPhone 11 on Thursday, talking up slick design and best-in-class features while playing down concerns about the lack of access to Google's popular apps.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431600684&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I10F", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
