I call on all citizens of Israel to come vote,\u201d Netanyahu said, his voice hoarse after weeks of campaigning, as he cast his vote in Jerusalem shortly before 10 a.m.\n\nGantz voted shortly afterwards in Rosh Haayin, and wished everyone luck.\n\nThe two main parties\u2019 campaigns in Israel\u2019s second parliamentary election in five months point to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, ties with the Palestinians and the United States, and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to lead to a big change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nNetanyahu has announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians seek statehood. But Blue and White has also said it would strengthen Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel\u2019s \u201ceastern security border\u201d.\n\nGraphic: Israel's annexation plans - here\n\nThe election was called after Netanyahu failed to form a coalition following an April election in which Likud and Blue and White were tied, each taking 35 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament. It\u2019s the first time Israel has ever had two general elections in a single year.\n\nNetanyahu, 69, has cast himself as indispensable and blighted by voter complacency over his tenure - the longest of any Israeli prime minister. He was prime minister from June 1996 until July 1999 and has held the post since March 2009.\n\nWarning he may be replaced by \u201cleftists\u201d who would weaken Israel in the eyes of both foes and friends, Netanyahu has flooded the airwaves and social media with calls on his Likud faithful to turn out in force.\n\nTRADING BARBS\n\nPolling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and will close at 10 p.m. when Israeli media will publish exit polls giving a first indication of the outcome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be close. It\u2019s going to be a close election,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday in the Oval Office.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Gantz, 60, have tried to energize their bases, and poach votes from smaller parties.\n\nNetanyahu portrays Gantz as inexperienced and incapable of commanding respect from world leaders such as Trump. Gantz accuses Netanyahu of trying to deflect attention from his possible indictment on corruption charges that the prime minister has dismissed as baseless.\n\nHagit Cohen, a 43-year-old social worker, said she would back Blue and White rather than her former favorite, the now fringe Labour party: \u201cI don\u2019t want my vote to be wasted. Gantz may not be perfect, but enough is enough with Bibi (Netanyahu).\u201d\n\nGantz also worries about public apathy. Interviewed by Army Radio, he urged Tel Aviv residents to \u201cput down their espressos for an hour\u201d and vote - a nod to the secular, middle-class constituency he hopes to mobilize against pro-Netanyahu religious-nationalists.\n\n\u201cThere is a definite sense of fatigue. Many Israelis are fed up with the politicians, or expect more of the same,\u201d said Amotz Asa-El, research fellow at Jerusalem\u2019s Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nNetanyahu, Asa-El said, \u201chas always divided the electorate into \u2018theirs\u2019 and \u2018ours\u2019. This time he\u2019s reading the political map even more closely and knows that he needs every extra vote.\u201d\n\nIn the Israeli-Arab town of Taybeh, residents showed up to vote without incident. In April, there was some controversy when election monitors from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party turned up with cameras in Arab areas. Locals accused them of voter intimidation with Likud saying they were trying to prevent election fraud.\n\nBefore the last election, Trump gave Netanyahu a boost with U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. This time, the White House seems more preoccupied with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration plans soon to release an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that may prove a dead letter: The Palestinians have rejected it in advance as biased.\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinians awaited the results of the vote.\n\n\u201cThis election affects many things in our life,\u201d said Mohamad Abdul Hay Hasaneen, a janitor in the city of Khan Younis. \u201cThere might be limited escalations after the election, but I don\u2019t think this would result in a full war.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nStill, the telegenic Netanyahu\u2019s open door in Washington and other world capitals, at a combustible time on Israel\u2019s borders with Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon, remains a big draw domestically.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one else running who is worthy of being prime minister,\u201d said Alon Gal, a 53-year-old hi-tech manager who plans to vote Likud after previously supporting a party further to the right. \u201cWith him, at least I know who I am dealing with.\u201d\n\nWeeks of wrangling over who should be tasked with forming the next government could follow the election. Opinion polls indicate Yisrael Beiteinu could hold the key to the next coalition because it is forecast to win double its representation in the Knesset, from five seats to 10.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a battle for political survival in a closely fought election on Tuesday that could end his 10-year domination of national politics.", "authors": ["Dan Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430720855&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0D7", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
