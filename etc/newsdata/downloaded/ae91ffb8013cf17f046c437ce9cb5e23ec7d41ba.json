That\u2019s their position at the moment, and that\u2019s the one that\u2019s of grave difficulty to us.\u201d\n\nDowning Street banned media from attending the talks and refused to disclose where they were taking place.\n\nNo 10 was insisting on Wednesday that the prospect of a deal is still possible, with plans being made to let parliament sit on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands war to vote on any possible deal that emerges out of the EU summit on 19 October.\n\nWhat might Johnson do when MPs gather for Brexit showdown?

Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, told the European parliament: \u201cWe\u2019re not really in a position where we\u2019re able to find an agreement.\u201d\n\nAfter rejecting the imposition of a customs border on the island of Ireland, and the plans for Stormont to have a veto on Northern Ireland\u2019s alignment with the EU\u2019s single market in goods, Barnier said: \u201cThe proposal of the British government as things stand isn\u2019t something we can accept. It replaces an operational, practical, legal solution [with] one that is simply a temporary solution.\u201d\n\nDowning Street has declined to say how it will react if Johnson does not get a deal at the EU summit, as it insists it will not request a delay to Brexit required by the Benn act. But Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, told ITV\u2019s Peston that Johnson suggested it would be \u201cabsolutely\u201d reasonable to send a separate message to the EU undermining any official request for an extension to article 50.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the government\u2019s policy is that we do not want a delay. I don\u2019t think anybody can be in any doubt about that. So I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to make that point very clearly.\u201d Asked if it meant saying that to the EU, she replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nBarnier also suggested Johnson needed to rein in the Downing Street aide responsible for accusing the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of making a deal almost impossible by demanding that Northern Ireland stays in a customs union.\n\n\u201cIn this moment, where we are now, we will remain calm, we will remain constructive and we will be respectful of the UK and those who lead it,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cThat is our approach and we hope that with this attitude on both sides we will be able to come to an agreement that works for everyone.\u201d\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, said he would not be as \u201cdiplomatic\u201d as the bloc\u2019s negotiator. \u201cI think that the proposal that Boris Johnson one week ago put forward was not serious at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI call it a virtual proposal, not a real proposal.\u201d\n\nThe European commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told MEPs: \u201cWe are not accepting this blame game which started in London. We are not to be blamed but we will see in the next coming days how things will develop.\u201d\n\nVerhofstadt most clearly expressed the anger felt by many at the briefings from Downing Street, in which it was claimed that the EU was \u201cwilling to torpedo the Good Friday agreement\u201d. Merkel was said in the anonymous briefing to have also refused to allow Northern Ireland to leave the bloc\u2019s customs union.\n\nVerhofstadt said: \u201cIt is a blame game. A blame game against everybody. A blame game against the [European] union, against Ireland, against Mrs Merkel, against the British judicial system, against Labour, against Lib Dems, even Mrs May.\n\n\u201cThe only one who is not to be blamed is Mr Johnson apparently. All those who are not playing his game are traitors, are collaborators, are surrenderers.\n\n\u201cThe real traitor is he or she who risks bringing disaster on his country, its economy and its citizens by pushing Britain out of the European Union. That in my opinion is a traitor.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, will meet Barnier for a working lunch in Brussels on Friday. But the focus is now on Johnson\u2019s planned meeting with Varadkar at around the same time.\n\nEU diplomats for the 27 other member states were briefed by the European commission on Wednesday morning that there had not been any change in the UK position in recent days to give hope that a deal could be signed off by leaders when they meet next Thursday.\n\nAccording to EU sources, the French representative in the meeting warned in response that \u201cthere can be no assumptions\u201d about a free-trade deal with the UK after Brexit, given the British wish to remove all level playing field conditions, such as non-regression on environmental standards, from the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIn a forceful intervention, the point was made that free-trade agreements were always decided on a case-by-case basis with the final result not automatically certain.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government has promised a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d deal with the EU and wants to end the UK\u2019s close alignment with the bloc on standards regarding health, environment and workers\u2019 rights.", "description": "Pair to meet in north-west England on Thursday and discuss Northern Ireland", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4437bbffbfd5fad8287bd7bd62522afbe19235bb/60_164_2143_1286/master/2143.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c0a9b432e5d8efcceaca2905135e939", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
