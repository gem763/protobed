If you don\u2019t have those benefits, then you\u2019ll look elsewhere for them \u2014 and today, \u201celsewhere\u201d probably means the government. You\u2019re also likely to be unfriendly to socially conservative messages that suggest you ought to be married.\n\nWhich explains why unmarried women are among the Democratic Party\u2019s strongest constituencies, having gone for Hillary Clinton by 31 points over Donald Trump in 2016. (Married women also supported Clinton, but by a narrow margin, 49 to 47 percent.) And unmarried women with children are even more overwhelmingly Democratic; 74 percent of them voted for Barack Obama in 2008, long before Trump arrived, with news of his adult-film-star payoffs and bragging about molesting women.\n\nBut the IFS study also shows that conservatives do value marriage more than moderates or liberals. Among conservatives, 80 percent say marriage is needed to create strong families; among liberals, that figure is only 33 percent. It\u2019s possible that the causation runs in the other direction \u2014 that conservatives congratulate themselves for a lifestyle they chose for other reasons \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to imagine what those other reasons might be. No, it seems reasonable to assume that more conservatives get married because more conservatives think it\u2019s important to be married, especially before having children.", "description": "", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Conservatives-Say-I-Do-Liberals-Say-Why-Bother-Thats-Problem"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
