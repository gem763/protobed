He wants the operation. Is this where he signs up for the trans operation, he wants to be trans?'\n\nWhen questioned, Lord Stone told the watchdog he meant no offence.\n\nHe added: 'I wouldn't call somebody a n***** in, like, in an aggressive way.\n\n'But let us say I was at some meeting, which I often am, particularly in Israel with black people or whatever, I would say, 'We are all n*****s, I am' - what do you call it - 'an honorary n*****', yes.\n\nThe Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, upheld the complaints\n\n'And they would say, 'Yes, Andrew is just as n***** as we are' \u2026 but people feel that if you are not trans or if you are not gay, or if you are not lesbian, then you are not part of that group and therefore you can't speak in an open way.\n\n'No, I feel I am part of that group. I am heterosexual. There are people who are gay, there are people who are lesbian and I feel there is no difference between all of us.'\n\nThe case was dealt with by way of 'remedial action' with Lord Stone agreeing to take part in a course of 'bespoke training and behaviour coaching sessions'.\n\nA Labour Lords spokesman said: 'The chief whip has informed Lord (Andrew) Stone that he is suspended from the Labour peers group until further notice.\n\n'Further discussions will be had with Andrew once he has completed the training and coaching recommended by the commissioner.'", "description": "The Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, upheld four complaints about the conduct of Lord Stone of Blackheath, a former joint managing director of Marks and Spencer.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/02/20111122-0-image-a-15_1571879674915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
