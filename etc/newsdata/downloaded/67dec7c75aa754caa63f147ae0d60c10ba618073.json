It will backfire.", "language": "en", "text": "Well, people engaged in impartial investigations aimed at finding the truth don\u2019t violate every precedent and standard of due process set during previous presidential impeachments.\n\nContrast today\u2019s partisan inquiry with the Nixon impeachment. As American Enterprise Institute President Robert Doar has pointed out, the Nixon inquiry was a model of bipartisan cooperation. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Peter Rodino (N.J.), assembled a unified staff (including Doar\u2019s father, John, a Republican whom Rodino appointed as special counsel). The full House voted on authorizing the inquiry. The minority was given joint subpoena power. The president\u2019s counsel was allowed to be present during depositions, given access to all of the documents and materials presented to the committee, allowed to cross-examine witnesses, and even permitted to call witnesses of his own. Most important, the committee did not leak or release selective documents cherry-picked to make the president look bad.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same was true during the Clinton impeachment inquiry. As former House speaker Newt Gingrich explained in a recent interview, Republicans \u201cadopted every single rule that Rodino had used in 1973.\u201d Yet today, Rodino\u2019s party is systematically undermining every principle of fairness and due process he put in place in 1973.\n\nTake this week\u2019s testimony by acting ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., who alleged that President Trump made U.S. aid contingent on \u201cinvestigations.\u201d He was deposed inside a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in the Capitol, a room that is designed to protect the government\u2019s most highly classified information. Cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF. Yet somehow what appear to be cellphone photos of his prepared statement were leaked to the news media.\n\nBut the full transcript of his deposition \u2014 including his answers to questions from Republicans challenging his accusations \u2014 remains under lock and key in that SCIF. The president\u2019s counsel is not allowed to see it, much less be present at the deposition to cross-examine the witness. So, Democrats are leaking derogatory information about the president, while restricting public access to potentially exculpatory information, all while denying him the right to see or challenge testimony against him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoreover, they are abusing the system to do it. One of the charges Democrats have leveled against Trump is that the White House improperly put the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president on a special server used to protect highly classified information. Yet Democrats are doing the very same thing, conducting impeachment depositions inside a SCIF, improperly using a classified system to restrict access to nonclassified information not just to the public but to members of Congress. Talk about hypocrisy.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: There is nothing wrong with holding hearings behind closed doors as long as there is due process. During the Nixon impeachment much of the evidence was presented in closed-door sessions. But there was not a flood of leaks from those executive sessions, as we are seeing today. And unlike today, the minority could issue subpoenas, and the president\u2019s counsel was present to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence. Secrecy and fairness go hand in hand. One without the other is corrupt.\n\nThe partisan nature of the Democrats\u2019 inquiry will backfire in a number of ways. For one thing, it allows Republicans to make the case to the American people that the process is unfair, and if there is one thing Americans demand, it is fairness. If the facts are on the Democrats\u2019 side, they have nothing to fear from transparency and due process. Second, their partisan behavior has given the president justification to refuse to cooperate with the investigation, just as President Dwight D. Eisenhower refused to cooperate with the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. And finally, it has made it easier for congressional Republicans to rally around the president. Right now, Republicans are more torn about Trump\u2019s Syria policy than they are about his impeachment inquiry. By failing to show even a modicum of fairness, Democrats have turned impeachment into a game of shirts vs. skins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 conduct shows that they are not serious, and that the entire impeachment inquiry is a blatantly political exercise. Given the Constitution\u2019s requirement of a supermajority in the Senate to remove the president, it is impossible for one party to remove the president of another party from office without buy-in from the other side. Yet Democrats are making no effort to win over Republicans, much less make an impeachment vote difficult for their GOP colleagues. And that means they\u2019ll have a hard time getting buy-in from the American people.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The entire impeachment inquiry is a blatantly political exercise.", "authors": ["Marc A.
