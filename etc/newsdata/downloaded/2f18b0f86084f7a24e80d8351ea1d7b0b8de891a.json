REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe ructions in the money market come as Fed policymakers met and cut interest rates again on Wednesday to combat risks from U.S.-China trade tensions, a slowing global economy and sluggish domestic inflation.\n\nThis puts pressure on Fed officials to come up with long-term fixes - such as a standing repo facility and cutting interest on what they pay on excess reserves (IOER) and growing its balance sheet - to avert further volatility in funding markets and to add more permanent reserves into the banking system, analysts said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed lowered the interest it pays on IOER by 30 basis points, to 1.80%.\n\nOn Tuesday, the \u201ceffective\u201d or average interest rate in the federal funds market, which the Fed aims to influence, hit 2.30%, above the top-end of the Fed\u2019s current range of 2.25%.\n\nSuch a move, which has not happened since 2008, if it persists would rattle investor confidence in the Fed.\n\n\u201cIt gives the impression, or confirms some of the market\u2019s fears that the Fed is not in control of its target policy rate because it has lost control of money market liquidity,\u201d said Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cIn that respect, it can be a confidence-sapping development unless they get it under control relatively quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve said it will conduct a repurchase agreement operation early Thursday \u201cto help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range of\u201d 1.75% to 2.00%.\n\nNOT ALARMING YET\n\nConcerns over problems in money markets spreading have been muted so far.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is a signal of concern, I think it is an aberration,\u201d said Ken Polcari, managing principal at Butcher Joseph Asset Management.\n\nDollar money markets have wobbled this week as banks and Wall Street dealers scrambled to find daily funding for their trades and loans.\n\nAnalysts have blamed quarterly corporate tax payments and settlement on $78 billion in coupon-bearing Treasury securities on Monday for a severe drop in cash for wholesale lending.\n\nThese factors sent borrowing costs in the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement (repo) market soaring to 10% at one point on Tuesday, about four times the Fed\u2019s policy rate.\n\n\u201cThe question really becomes how is the Fed going to make sure we don\u2019t have this volatility in the repo markets,\u201d said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.\n\n(For a graphic on 'Bank excess reserves held at the Fed' click tmsnrt.rs/2BiDDzx)\n\nFED ACTS\n\nWith evidence that market distress would push the federal funds rate above its target early Tuesday, the Fed deployed a maneuver it had not used since the credit crunch to add liquidity into the bank system.\n\n\u201cThis is what caused them to jump into action,\u201d said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve, which conducts open market operations for the Fed system, held an overnight repo operation on Tuesday, resulting in a $52.15 billion cash infusion into the banking system.\n\nIn an overnight repo operation, banks borrow cash from the Fed using Treasuries and other securities as collateral.\n\nAnother repo operation on Wednesday injected $75 billion.\n\nThese operations have reduced repo rates, which were last quoted at 2.10%-2.25% midday Wednesday.\n\nThey also seemed to lower the rates in other money market instruments such as Treasury bills.\n\n(For a graphic on 'U.S. repo rate' click tmsnrt.rs/31ynGQQ)", "description": "The Federal Reserve injected another $75 billion into the U.S. banking system on Wednesday, restoring a measure of order after a bout of extreme volatility inside the bank funding market drove the central bank's benchmark interest rate above its targeted range for the first time since the financial crisis.", "authors": ["Richard Leong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431287880&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H19Q", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
