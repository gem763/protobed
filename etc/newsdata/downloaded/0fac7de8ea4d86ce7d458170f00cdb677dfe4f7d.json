Not only has China decided to send a team of negotiators to Washington to break a vicious cycle on retaliatory tariffs, they have also made the first gesture to reverse the cycle. Through its official ministry, China announced tariff exemptions on sixteen US imports, with more to come soon, the New York Times reports today:\n\nChina extended a modest olive branch to President Trump on Wednesday, publishing a short list of products that it will exempt from its retaliatory tariffs on American-made goods. But the list does not include big-ticket items, like soybeans and other agricultural goods, that the Trump administration would likely consider key to getting a trade deal done with China. Cancer drugs, lubricants, pesticides, shrimp meal and a number of other products will be excluded from a list of American goods subject to tariffs, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website. China first threatened to place tariffs on many of those goods last year, as the trade war began to heat up. Tariffs that have already been imposed will also be refunded, the ministry said. It added that further exemptions will be announced in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe Washington Post sniffed, calling the gesture a \u201ctwig\u201d rather than a full olive branch. One analyst told them that it was about shaping the public-relations battlefield ahead of the negotiations:\n\nChina extended an olive twig, rather than a branch, to the United States in their trade war Wednesday, announcing it would exempt 16 American-made products from tariffs as a sign of goodwill ahead of talks scheduled for next month. \u2026 \u201cChina wants to claim the moral high ground before the October talks and to send a message of goodwill,\u201d said Yao Xinchao, professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s all about molding public opinion\u201d to portray the United States as the aggressor, Yao added.\n\nSure, but that and five bucks will get them a caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9 at Starbucks in October. No one doubts that Trump is the aggressor in this trade war; he\u2019s the one who slapped tariffs on in the first place. China\u2019s keeping tariffs on ag products in an attempt to force Trump into backing down to protect his political support in rural America, but PR on that point won\u2019t help the PRC until fourteen months or so from now \u2014 if it does at all. American farmers also have lots of frustration with China\u2019s sharp limits on US agricultural products, which means farmers have some good reasons to stick with Trump for a while in this fight.\n\nThe issue for China is getting tariffs lifted before supply chains for US businesses get relocated permanently. Right now, American companies are riding out the first waves of tariffs with price increases passed along to consumers, but at some point it will just be cheaper to relocate their supply chains to other countries. Most of them won\u2019t end up in the good ol\u2019 USA as Trump would like, but they\u2019ll go to other countries that don\u2019t use trade to conduct espionage and steal intellectual property.\n\nThe bottom line from this concession is obvious: China sees the need to resolve this quickly. The exemptions are meant to highlight the risk to the ag sector here too, but they\u2019re first aimed at scaling back the risk to their own priorities when the rest of the US tariffs come into effect. Once the supply chain exodus begins, it won\u2019t be easy to reverse the damage \u2014 and both Trump and China know it.", "description": "Blink II.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/xi-trump.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
