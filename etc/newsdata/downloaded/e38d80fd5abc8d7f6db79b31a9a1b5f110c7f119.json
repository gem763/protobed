'It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement.'\n\nMr Johnson met his Cabinet for crisis talks after the conversation this morning.\n\nDowning Street had already painted a grim picture of the consequences of rejecting the UK's 'fair and reasonable' blueprint.\n\nOne explosively claimed the government will make clear that any EU country supporting a delay to the October 31 Brexit deadline would be engaging in 'hostile interference' in British politics.\n\nAny hope of cooperation will be 'in the toilet' and the Tories will end all negotiations to fight an election, switching to a policy of leaving the EU immediately with No Deal.\n\nThe Tories will win because Parliament and Remainer MPs are 'as popular as the Clap'.\n\n'They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals,' the source told the Spectator. 'This won't happen. We'll either leave with No Deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with No Deal.'\n\nThe brutal assault - which former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed came from maverick No10 aide Dominic Cummings - emerged after Mr Johnson's proposals hit a huge roadblock.\n\nEU politicians have branded them a 'joke' and Emmanuel Macron set a deadline of Friday for the UK to make more concessions.\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured visiting a hospital in Watford yesterday) is holding a crisis meeting as aides admit the Brexit talks are set to break down dramatically this week\n\nIn a crunch moment for negotiations, the PM and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured in Berlin today) clashed brutally in an early morning phone call\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss were among the ministers gathering in Downing Street today\n\nFormer Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed maverick No10 aide Dominic Cummings (pictured in Downing Street last week) was behind the explosive briefing\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom and housing minister Esther McVey were at the Cabinet meeting in No10 today\n\nAs the situation threatened to spiral out of control, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds put the blame squarely with Ireland.\n\n'It looks difficult at the moment - I am very, very sad about that,' he told Bloomberg Television.\n\n'What it does flush out is that the original backstop proposals were clearly something that certain Dublin politicians particularly in the government really felt was the end destination.'\n\nHe said Ireland was turning landmark peace deals upside down by dismissing the Northern Irish consent idea of Johnson's Brexit proposal.\n\nVoters 'are more likely to blame Remainer MPs than Boris Johnson if Brexit is delayed' Voters are more likely to blame Remain-backing MPs and Parliament than Boris Johnson if Brexit is delayed, according to a new poll. A survey conducted by ComRes shows that if the UK's departure date is pushed back beyond October 31 then the PM will be at least partially blamed for the extension by just over half of voters. But crucially for the PM the numbers show that voters will blame other groups far more than they will the premier if he is unable to stick to his 'do or die' Brexit pledge. The statistics represent a boost for Mr Johnson and Downing Street because they come as the chances of a Brexit deal appear to be shrinking while the possibility of an extension past Halloween increases. Number 10 is adamant that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal but the government has also conceded that it will have to comply with the so-called Benn Act. That anti-No Deal law states that the PM must ask the EU for a delay if the two sides have not struck an accord in the run up to the October 31 deadline. However, Downing Street has made clear that while it will ask for a delay in such circumstances it will also make plain to the EU that it does not want an extension. Should a delay be agreed, the ComRes poll for The Telegraph suggests Mr Johnson would have to shoulder some of the blame. But he is likely to be heartened by the fact other groups would be blamed more than he would.\n\n'Dublin is now it seems turning the Good Friday Agreement, the Belfast Agreement, the St Andrews Agreement - all the agreements that we made in the last 20 years as part of the political process - on its head,' Mr Dodds said.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the government was trying to 'sabotage' the talks.\n\n'This is yet another cynical attempt by No 10 to sabotage the negotiations,' he said.\n\n'Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n'It is now more important than ever that parliament unites to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month.'\n\nWhile technical talks between officials continued yesterday, EU leaders have so far refused to hold face-to-face talks with Mr Johnson on his plan for replacing the controversial Irish backstop.\n\nThe PM said Brussels had been presented with 'a big step forward, big advance, big compromise by the UK Government', but complained the EU was not engaging with the details.\n\nHe added: 'What we're saying to our friends is, this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer we've made. What we'd like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are. And if you have issues with any of the proposals that we've come up with, then let's get into the detail and discuss them. It's time for us to get together and really thrash this thing out.'\n\nHowever, EU officials responded last night by leaking to The Guardian a rejection of the UK's offer.\n\nThe 'confidential' report said the Prime Minister's plan to take Northern Ireland out of the customs union would cause 'major disruption to the all-Ireland economy'.\n\nAnd it said Brussels did not accept that the people of Northern Ireland should be asked to consent to the idea of the province remaining aligned to EU rules after Brexit.\n\nThe report is said to have been delivered last Friday to Mr Johnson's chief EU adviser David Frost.\n\nA UK official responded: 'Rather than writing documents in order to leak them, the EU's time would be better spent on engaging with our sensible and fair proposals, so the UK can leave with a deal when we exit the EU on October 31.'\n\nThe senior No10 source told The Spectator Irish PM Leo Varadkar had reneged on promises to make concessions alongside the UK.\n\nMr Varadkar 'said if we moved on manufactured goods then he would also move but instead he just attacked us publicly'.\n\nThe source said they would make it clear in public and in private that the interference is not welcome, and any attempt to delay is pointless as Britain will leave regardless on 31 October.\n\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar and EU negotiator Michel Barnier have given short shrift to the UK's Brexit blueprint\n\nA survey conducted by ComRes showed 83 per cent of voters would blame Parliament if Brexit is delayed beyond October 31\n\nThey suggested the government has still not given up on trying to get round the Benn Act, but insisted: 'We will make clear privately and publicly that countries which oppose delay will go to the front of the queue for future cooperation...\n\n'Supporting the delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics, and over half of the public will agree with us.'\n\nWhy is the EU's Northern Ireland customs union demand so problematic? Angela Merkel reportedly told Boris Johnson this morning that there could only be a Brexit deal if the UK agreed that Northern Ireland will permanently stay in the EU's customs union. Ms Merkel apparently said that if Britain could not agree to that then a deal was 'overwhelmingly unlikely'. Meanwhile, a Number 10 source said that if that was the EU's negotiating red line then a deal is 'essentially impossible'. The reason the customs demand is so significant, and potentially deal-wrecking, is that it would effectively mean Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK forever. Under the plan put forward by Mr Johnson, Northern Ireland would stay in the EU's single market for goods but would leave the customs union at the same time as the rest of Britain. That would enable the province to benefit from any future UK trade deals. If it was kept in the customs union while the rest of the UK left, then it would be excluded from those trade deals. As a result, critics would argue that keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union would leave it out in the cold and isolated - technically still a part of the UK but on a very different path. That is why Mr Johnson - or any other UK PM - would struggle to agree to such a proposal. It would also prompt fury from Unionist politicians who are adamant that Ulster must not be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Labour's Brexit plan would see the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU and so the question of treating Northern Ireland differently would not arise.\n\nDefence and security cooperation could be affected if the European Union attempted to keep Britain in against its wishes.\n\nThe source added: 'Those who supported delay will face the inevitable consequences of being seen to interfere in domestic politics in a deeply unpopular way.'\n\nSpelling out that the Tories will need to harden up their Brexit stance even further to outflank Nigel Farage - who has been demanding a clean break - the source said: 'To marginalise the Brexit Party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of 'No more delays, get Brexit done immediately''.'\n\nIn a vicious swipe at Remainer MPs, they added: 'Those who pushed the Benn Act intended to sabotage a deal and they've probably succeeded.\n\n'So the main effect of it will probably be to help us win an election by uniting the leave vote and then a no-deal Brexit. History is full of such ironies and tragedies.'\n\nAsked if the source quote came from Mr Cummings, Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think Dominic Cummings, yes, because otherwise it would have been heavily denied and heads would have rolled.\n\n'So clearly it's come from them, it's in their style.\n\n'It reveals that there doesn't appear to be an actual plan at all. Instead, what they're doing is angrily, apparently, begging the EU not to support a delay which will be required because of the position that Parliament has taken.'\n\nWith both sides anxious to avoid the blame for a breakdown in talks, Government sources said officials were drawing up their own report setting out concessions Mr Johnson had made after the EU's previous demands.\n\nThese include asking Northern Ireland to remain in the single market for goods after Brexit to reduce the need for border checks.\n\nNo10 sources last night confirmed Mr Johnson might even boycott next week's summit unless EU leaders agree to discuss his plans.\n\nAnd EU diplomats suggested leaders could use the summit to instead discuss another Brexit extension, despite the fact Mr Johnson has ruled out asking for one.\n\nDowning Street yesterday insisted it had not abandoned hopes of a last-minute breakthrough, with Mr Johnson speaking by phone with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland.\n\nThe PM's official spokesman said: 'We are ready to have discussions at pace, but for that to happen the EU needs to engage.' But Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok yesterday said the UK needed to provide 'more realism and reality'.\n\nBut one EU official said the most that could be offered with the time left would be reverting to a tweaked 'off-the-shelf' model, such as the Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nThis is a red line for Mr Johnson as it would involve Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union.", "description": "In a crunch moment for negotiations, Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel clashed brutally in an early morning phone call.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19434486-0-image-a-47_1570525057597.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
