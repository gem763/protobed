This PoC shows how IOTA can be used not only to enhance transparency and promote cost-efficiency but simply make using a car more convenient and stress-free.\u201d\n\nIn related news, on September 22, 2019, BTCManager informed that IOTA had launched a decentralized and autonomous industry marketplace as part of plans to promote interconnectivity between humans, machines, and machine-readable contracts.", "description": "IOTA (MIOTA), a distributed ledger technology (DLT) for the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, has been used by EDAG, a Germany-based engineering firm and d-fine, to develop a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a Tangle-powered smart parking ecosystem, according to a blog post on September 26, 2019.
