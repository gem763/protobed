The searches involved personal data including emails and telephone numbers of private citizens.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2026finds that the FBI\u2019s querying procedures and minimization procedures are not consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in the ruling, which was released Tuesday in partially redacted form.\n\nBoasberg said the Trump administration failed to persuade the court that adjusting the program to more efficiently protect American citizens\u2019 privacy would impede the FBI\u2019s ability to counter threats.\n\nFederal law limits searches on such databases to to those that are explicitly related to the collection of evidence of a crime or foreign intelligence.\n\nIn one case revealed in the ruling, an FBI official used a database to search for information on himself, his relatives and other FBI personnel.\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Service Act has come under scrutiny in recent years after the FBI obtained a FISA warrant to conduct an investigation into former Trump-campaign adviser Carter Page. The FBI maintains it suspected Page may have been working with Russian officials to interfere with the 2016 presidential election campaign, while President Trump has said the FBI \u201cillegally spied\u201d on his campaign.", "description": "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has ruled that an FBI program intended to target foreign suspects violated Americans' privacy.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
