Now, he\u2019s unexpectedly in the middle of a presidential scandal.\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s chief watchdog, Michael Atkinson, is known to his peers and colleagues as a highly cautious \u201cstraight shooter\u201d who tends to keep his head down.\n\nSo when he sounded the alarm to Congress earlier this month about an \u201curgent\u201d complaint he\u2019d received from an intelligence official involving Trump\u2019s communications, those who\u2019ve worked with him were surprised \u2014 and took it seriously.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw that it was Atkinson, I thought, \u2018Oh shit, this is real,\u2019\u201d said one of Atkinson\u2019s former Justice Department colleagues. \u201cHe\u2019s not a political guy. He\u2019s a classic career prosecutor who\u2019s only going to call balls and strikes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that commitment to the letter of the law, according to people who know him, that has landed the typically cautious lawyer at the center of a political firestorm.\n\nAtkinson, formally the Intelligence Community Inspector General, was nominated by Trump in November 2017 after serving 16 years at the Justice Department. The ICIG conducts investigations and reviews of activities within the purview of the Director of National Intelligence, and also handles whistleblower complaints from within the intelligence community.\n\nWith two red-alarm letters to the congressional intelligence committees \u2014 flagging the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and outlining why it \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important\u201d of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities \u2014 Atkinson has gone from a virtually unknown career official to sitting on potentially explosive information that Democrats hope will fuel their incipient impeachment fight. He\u2019s also irked Republicans who have accused both him and the whistleblower of being partisan actors.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence Atkinson is a political partisan in either direction \u2014 a search of campaign finance records, for instance, finds no evidence that he\u2019s ever donated to a candidate.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N.

U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. \u201cI\u2019d put him into the Bob Mueller school of prosecutors \u2014 very traditional, with a no-stone-unturned approach. I\u2019d assume he\u2019s doing that here.\u201d\n\nThe dispute centers on a mysterious whistleblower complaint that multiple reports have said concerns the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader \u2014 namely, the president of Ukraine.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to share the substance of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint with Congress, as is normally required by law after the IG determines that the complaint is of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nThe ODNI\u2019s general counsel, Jason Klitenic, told Congress that after consulting with the Justice Department, the ODNI had concluded that \u201cno statute requires disclosure of the complaint to the intelligence committees.\u201d\n\nAt a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee last week, Atkinson stonewalled Democrats\u2019 attempts to get answers \u2014 but only, he said, because his hands were tied by the Justice Department\u2019s opinion, which was that the complaint \u201cdid not concern allegations of conduct by a member of the intelligence community\u201d or an intelligence activity under ODNI\u2019s supervision and is therefore outside the ODNI\u2019s purview.\n\n\u201cI understand that I am bound by the determination reached as a result of the acting DNI\u2019s consultations with DOJ,\u201d Atkinson wrote to lawmakers on Sept. 17. And he noted that he will continue to abide by that determination, even though he disagrees with it.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint that has roiled Washington for nearly two weeks reportedly centers around a conversation Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymor Zelensky, in which he allegedly pressured him to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nAtkinson deemed the complaint to be credible and \u201curgent,\u201d but has not received authorization to share even \u201cthe general subject matter\u201d of the complaint with lawmakers, he told them in the Sept. 17 letter.\n\n\u201cAs it now stands, my unresolved differences with the Acting DNI are affecting the execution of two of my most important duties and responsibilities as Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\u201d to both whistleblowers and to Congress, he wrote.\n\nThe impasse has highlighted the fact that whistleblower protection laws never envisioned a scenario in which the director of national intelligence would withhold a complaint from lawmakers \u2014 especially one the inspector general had deemed \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nAtkinson was nominated by Trump to serve as the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general after a long legal career, in private practice and in senior positions at the Justice Department. And he was confirmed by the Senate with the understanding that the intelligence committees wanted someone who could restore some order to the IG\u2019s office and reinvigorate the whistleblower program, which had effectively been gutted by his predecessor.\n\n\u201cWhen Atkinson took over, the chairman and I specifically charged him with fixing an office that had been through years of churn and increasing dysfunction,\u201d Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told POLITICO in a statement. \u201cHe's really worked hard to correct a lot of those problems over the last year or so. I've been extremely impressed by his work, so much so that I wrote a letter to [former DNI] Dan Coats this summer praising the ICIG\u2019s work.\u201d (A spokesperson for Richard Burr, the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, declined to comment.)\n\nA Democratic House Intelligence Committee aide likewise praised Atkinson, saying the committee has been \u201cincredibly impressed with Atkinson\u2019s professionalism, but even more so his independence and neutrality in adhering to the strict letter of the law to protect the whistleblower and the whistleblower process.\u201d\n\nA former U.S. intelligenc official said the office was also \u201cfairly pleased\u201d with Atkinson\u2019s appointment, especially because the ICIG \u201chad been in turmoil for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey felt Atkinson was a professional with IG experience who came from a good office,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were relieved.\u201d\n\nBut Atkinson likely couldn\u2019t predict that, just 16 months into his tenure, he\u2019d be in the middle of an unprecedented standoff between Congress and DOJ and moved to address a novel legal predicament: What happens when an intelligence agent blows the whistle on the president?\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

As such, the substance of the complaint may never reach Congress\u2014at least not through formal channels.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t underscore this enough: The fact that Atkinson determined this complaint to be serious enough to notify Congress really carries weight,\u201d said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst for the Government Accountability Project who has worked with Atkinson on whistleblower protection cases.\n\nMcCullough said that while he\u2019s been disappointed in the past with some of Atkinson\u2019s work, \u201cthe one time we got into a statutory argument\u201d about whistleblower protections \u201cit became clear he has a very good understanding of the law. While he drew conclusions I disagreed with, I still trusted him to come to those conclusions,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s a good-faith actor.\u201d\n\nThe issue of whistleblower protection was a central focus of Atkinson\u2019s confirmation hearing, where he pledged to establish \u201ca safe program where whistleblowers do not have fear of retaliation and where they\u2019re confident that the system will treat them fairly and impartially.\u201d\n\nHe also testified that he would consider resigning if he were prevented from pursuing an investigation that he found significant or to be a potential abuse of the ODNI. But he indicated that it would be a last resort.\n\n\u201cI would consider it, but I think the process is in place that people who\u2014 can disagree without necessarily having to resign,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I felt strongly enough and it really went to a core principle, yes, I would consider resigning. That would be part of my thought process.\u201d\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: Steve Bunnell\u2018s name was misspelled in an earlier version of this article.", "description": "President Trump appointed Michael Atkinson, a widely respected career DOJ official, to keep the intelligence community accountable.
