But what is the movement all about? And who\u2019s behind it?\n\nBest known for shutting down the streets of London in April, Extinction Rebellion upped its game on Thursday, with a protester affiliated with the group grounding an Aer Lingus flight from London City Airport to Dublin. Another protester \u2013 Paralympian James Brown \u2013 clambered onto the roof of a British Airways plane and refused to budge, prompting police to eventually remove him.\n\nJust about to take from London city airport. Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protestor. #londoncityairport#ClimateChangepic.twitter.com/eWBeeUiGHM \u2014 Warren Swalbe (@wazzas) October 10, 2019\n\nThe disruptions came as Extinction Rebellion threatened a \u201cHong Kong-style\u201d occupation and shutdown of the airport, and as similar protests hit more than 60 cities worldwide.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it is part of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s aim to get people arrested,\u201d read a flyer circulated by activists in Dublin. To that end, the group has been successful. More than 1,000 activists have been arrested in London alone this week, including 50 at London City Airport.\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nThe group\u2019s demands are threefold. First, they call on governments to \u201ctell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency,\u201d a similar demand to that made by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York last month. A seemingly benign demand, but one that paints opponents as \u2018anti-truth\u2019.\n\nSecondly, they demand that \u201cgovernment must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.\u201d Finally, the group demands that government partner up with activists, and \u201ccreate and be led by the decisions of a Citizens\u2019 Assembly on climate and ecological justice.\u201d\n\nWhile a \u2018Citizens\u2019 Assembly\u2019 would draw on a cross-section of society, it would be government-created and guided by a collection of NGOs and academics, as was the case in Ireland when the government convened such an assembly to pave the way for referenda on gay marriage and abortion in recent years. Extinction Rebellion make no mention on whether NGOs with opposing views will be included in the deliberation.\n\nAt XR\u2019s rallies, protesters have called for any number of ways of meeting these goals and more, including government bans on meat and private cars, abolishment of the airplane, boycotts of the fashion industry, and disbandment of the military. Disrupting commerce is fair game for making their points, as is disrupting vital services. As a cancer patient in London was forced to walk to hospital treatment due to XR\u2019s roadblocks, spokesperson Savannah Lovelock told Sky News that while she was \u201creally sorry,\u201d such action is necessary for the good of the planet.\n\nAn appeal to authority\n\nCentral to all of the group\u2019s demands is a radical expansion of state power. Reducing greenhouse gases to net zero \u2013 if a state-led effort \u2013 would give government the power to restrict or outright deny its citizens freedom of travel, freedom to choose their own diets, and freedom to build their homes however they want. In the US, drafttext of \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 legislation gives a sneak-peek at just how all-encompassing this would be, working wealth redistribution and reparations for \u201chistoric oppression\u201d into the mix for good measure.\n\nAlso on rt.com Establishment & media sympathize with Greta\u2019s \u2018Fridays for Future\u2019 movement\u2026 So how is that a \u2018protest\u2019 exactly?\n\nA potent illustration of the group\u2019s appeal to authority came last November, when XR co-founder Gail Bradbrook marched on Buckingham Palace and read aloud a message to Queen Elizabeth \u201cwith great humility,\u201d calling on the monarch to save the planet by royal decree.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to live a life of voluntary simplicity,\u201d academic and XR campaigner Rupert Read wrote at the time. The implied meaning is clear: people will have to be coerced into complying.\n\nWho\u2019s behind it all?\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. Exploding onto the scene with a recognizable logo, coherent imagery across multiple continents, a dominant social media presence and a slick website, the leaders of Extinction Rebellion are no rabble of bong-smoking malcontents.\n\nEspecially not Dr. Gail Bradbrook. The co-founder of the movement told the BBC that she came up with the idea after praying \"in a deep way\u201d while under the influence of \u201cpsychedelic medicines\u201d on a retreat last year.\n\nIn truth, Bradbrook has made a career out of activism, and has for two decades worked as a professional campaigner. Speaking at a talk in 2016, she admitted that this role is \u201cmostly about securing your own paycheck.\u201d As director of Citizens Online \u2013 a charity campaigning for \u201cdigital inclusion,\u201d Bradbrook has worked with BT to lobby the British government.\n\nJoining Bradshaw are former organic farmer Roger Hallam, and also involved are Occupy London veteran Tasmin Osmond \u2013 a granddaughter of British nobility \u2013 and ex-UN worker Laura Reeves.\n\nBehind the movement is a bulwark of elite cash. Heiress Aileen Getty has kicked in nearly \u00a3500,000 of her family\u2019s oil wealth to the group via the Climate Emergency Fund, claiming that \u201cdisruption\u201d is necessary to take on climate change. According to its own data, Extinction Rebellion has raised just short of a million pounds in large donations since March, from groups like the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation, set up by a hedge fund manager and run by a former vice-chairman of billionaire financier George Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\n\nWhat has the group achieved?\n\nAside from annoying motorists and boosting superglue sales, Extinction Rebellion has achieved some of its aims. Eleven countries and dependencies, beginning with Britain and Ireland, have declared a state of \u201cclimate emergency,\u201d even if Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar did say afterwards that the declaration was a \u201csymbolic gesture.\u201d\n\nWhat Extinction Rebellion has also been successful in is pandering to the wishes of global financiers and the new captains of green industry. The group\u2019s call for \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions is echoed by the World Bank, and a host of investment firms, including HSBC, JP Morgan Chase and Citi, that see \u201cprofits to be had\u201d in \u201cclimate-related sectors.\u201d\n\nNone of this is a bad thing on the surface, except that these groups \u2013 which have banded together to form the Climate Finance Partnership and Blended Finance Action Taskforce \u2013 want access to taxpayer money and pension funds to do this. This Western money, according to the groups, will be funnelled into projects in Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\nAlso on rt.com Greta Thunberg wants you to be afraid, and big business will make a killing off it\n\nRarely do the demands of activists and the will of international finance line up, but not everyone is happy. In London, Police Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has warned that the current protests will hamper officers\u2019 ability to tackle \u201cstreet-based violence,\u201d and leave the city more vulnerable to terrorism.\n\nStreet blockages and airport disruptions may put Extinction Rebellion at odds with the majority of the population, but majority support is unnecessary. XR co-founder Roger Hallam has repeatedly referenced Gene Sharp as an inspiration. An American political scientist, Sharp\u2019s theory of nonviolent action \u2013 that only 3.5 percent of a population need to back a protest movement before it reaches critical mass and triggers change \u2013 has been adopted and put into practice by \u2018color revolutionaries\u2019 around the world, from US-sponsored student protesters in Serbia at the turn of the century, to Arab Spring revolutionaries more recently.\n\nCelebrities have lined up to endorse Extinction Rebellion \u2013 from gloom-rockers Radiohead chipping in \u00a3300,000 to Benedict Cumberbatch joining protesters camped in Trafalgar Square. With elite cash and backing, as well as round the clock media coverage, Extinction Rebellion is well on its way to Sharp\u2019s tipping point, and has well and truly glued itself to the public consciousness already.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
