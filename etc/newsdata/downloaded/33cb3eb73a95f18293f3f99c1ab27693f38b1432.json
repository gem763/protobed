Generous donors from both inside Japan and abroad, including X-Japan front man Yoshiki, swiftly contributed over one billion yen, hoping to do so some sort of good after the tragedy that left 36 Kyoto Animation employees dead and injured nearly as many.\n\nAt the time the donation account was set up, Kyoto Animation had yet to specify exactly how the funds would be used, but it seems the company has now reached a decision. In a tweet from Shinichi Isa, head of the House of Representatives Finance Committee, the politician announced that Kyoto Animation will not be using any of the money for the recovery of its business operations, and will instead be using the complete sum for the sake of the human victims of the attack.\n\n\u201cKyoto Animation will not be applying any of the money it received from donors around the world for business recovery, but will be using all of it for the bereaved, the injured, and their families. The company itself will not retain any of the financial support, including funds coming from government institutions, and will move forward under its own power.\u201d\n\nIsa\u2019s report of the decision, which has yet to be officially announced through Kyoto Animation\u2019s website, was met with overwhelming support from other Twitter users, whose reactions included:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from Kyoto Animation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a company that always puts people first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made multiple donations, and I\u2019m grateful that they\u2019re using the money in this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cKyoto Animation is so cool to come to this resolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re showing how strong their company really is.\u201d\n\nIsa also tweeted that Kyoto Animation will be holding memorial services, which fans can attend, on Nov 3 and 4, at Kyoto\u2019s Miyako Messe conference center, with more details to come in the near future. The company also listed the names of all of the arson victims in the credits for its recent \"Violet Evergarden\" theatrical feature, the first stage of the company\u2019s \u201cultimate counterattack\u201d of continuing to produce passionate works of art.\n\nSource: Twitter/@isashinichi via Jin\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Kyoto Animation to release full list of arson attack victim names in credits of new anime movie\n\n-- Kyoto Animation releases details on official donation bank account for overseas, Japanese donors\n\n-- \u201cWe will not go quietly into the night.
