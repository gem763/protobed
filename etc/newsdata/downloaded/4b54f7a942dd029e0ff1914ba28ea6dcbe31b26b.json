She travels from Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn state carriage, escorted by the Household Cavalry.\n\nBefore she arrived, the priceless Imperial State Crown and other regalia used in the ceremony was brought to Parliament in a separate heavily-guarded carriage.\n\nThe crown includes 2,868 diamonds, including the Second Star of Africa diamond, and many other gems. The crown was made for King George VI\u2019s coronation in 1937, based on a crown designed for Queen Victoria in 1838.\n\nThe heavy crown is a powerful symbol of the queen\u2019s authority, but Elizabeth chose not to wear it. It was instead placed on a cushion nearby.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brexit may have Britain's political system in turmoil, but the State Opening of Parliament Monday provided a return to reassuring rituals dating back centuries.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gregory Katz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/britain_politics_queens_speech_85349_c0-236-5254-3300_s1200x700.jpg?14b3ceaee177618136361fa097541d2f94fa3a98", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
