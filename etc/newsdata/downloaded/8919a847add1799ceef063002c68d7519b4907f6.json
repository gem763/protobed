This is opposed to decades of left-leaning influence that existed prior to the status quo followed by a relatively brief time with a somewhat centrist influence. Such is the nature of the Supreme Court. While it may have been envisioned by to be non-partisan, the truth of the matter is that justices were always going to have some degree of bias. It\u2019s just human nature.\n\nYet for the moment, the Court has a rightward lean to it, and that\u2019s good news for gun rights advocates.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s good news for us has led to continued talk of packing the Supreme Court should Democrats get the chance.\n\nPerhaps encouraged by Democratic senators in August warning the Supreme Court to \u201cheal\u201d itself or face restructuring, one progressive group has doubled down on advocating court-packing, while another liberal group this week released a \u201cSupreme Court shortlist\u201d of 32 prospective judicial nominees for a future Democratic president, filled mostly with activists but only a few judges. It would appear that the left is increasingly focused on the Supreme Court, and many of the groups expressed annoyance that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates\u2014one of whom could be in a position to fill the next high court vacancy\u2014have had little to say on the topic. Progressive groups Take Back the Court, Demand Justice, the Committee for a Fair Judiciary, the American Constitution Society, Women\u2019s March, and Indivisible recently called on the news media to ask the 2020 presidential candidates about the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s be clear here. Much of this stems from the fact that these groups believe they already know how the Supreme Court would rule on cases involving things like the Second Amendment.\n\nFrankly, they\u2019re probably right. At least, they are if the Court deigns to hear the cases in the first place. That hasn\u2019t been a slam dunk in recent years and while Justice Kavanaugh may change that\u2013the Court has agreed to hear a gun rights case coming from New York City, for example\u2013we don\u2019t know for certain that it will.\n\nThese progressive groups, though, think they do and they don\u2019t like it.\n\nSo, their goal is to regain all of Congress as well as the White House, then pack the Supreme Court with progressive justices until they can tip the balance of power in their favor. They can offer all kinds of rationalizations why they\u2019re just in doing so as well.\n\nAlthough he wants to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court beyond the current nine, he doesn\u2019t know how many more justices there should be. \u201cThat would depend in part on how many justices President Trump seats, since President Trump acquired the presidency illegitimately,\u201d [director of Take Back the Court Aaron] Belkin said. \u201cIt is not possible to know at this point how many more. But, since Mitch McConnell stole the court, this is the only means to restore credibility.\u201d\n\nNot only does Belkin think that McConnell somehow broke the law by breaking with tradition and not giving Garland Merrick a hearing but also that President Trump didn\u2019t legitimately win the presidency.\n\nRemember Hillary Clinton talking about how stuff like this was a threat to our nation? Ah, good times. Good times.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s make no mistake. While this is being discussed in broad terms, much of this revolves around the right to keep and bear arms. Not all, but a lot. Progressives know that assault weapon bans or many other gun control laws wouldn\u2019t survive judicial scrutiny by a right-leaning Supreme Court, so they simply want to make it so such a Court cannot exist.\n\nAs if you needed another reason to rally for the 2020 elections.", "description": "Democrats and their aligned groups seem determined to push a court-packing scheme in part to undermine the Second Amendment.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
