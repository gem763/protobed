As his friends entered the clubhouse, my father sat on a bench and collapsed from a fatal heart attack.\n\nThe shoes, for reasons I no longer recall, wound up in my closet. I rarely think of them until I\u2019m rummaging for something on the shelf and spot the clear bag by a pile of wrinkled T-shirts. I really should get rid of those shoes, I tell myself. And almost instantly I think . . . Nope. Can\u2019t do it.\n\nIn her Netflix series and best-selling book, \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,\u201d Marie Kondo preaches a simple decluttering strategy: If an object doesn\u2019t bring you joy, get rid of it. But what if an object brings you pain? And what if pain is the reason you keep it? Is that unhealthy? Is it normal to keep a 14-year-old symbol of loss? Or just morbid?\n\nI\u2019m hardly alone in clinging to a loved one\u2019s possessions. A friend keeps a tweed hat and scarf that belonged to her father, who died in 1979. \u201cTo lose those objects,\u201d she said, \u201cis to lose the connection.\u201d\n\nAnother friend, who lost her father 25 years ago, treasures his handkerchief: \u201cIt still carries his scent \u2014 or maybe I\u2019m imagining it \u2014 and the cloth is soft on my cheek. Just like when I was a child and needed to be comforted.\u201d\n\nYehuda Jacobi, author of the grief memoir \u201cBeyond the Opened Door,\u201d has kept his mother\u2019s bottle of Chanel No. 5 for 19 years. \u201cIt is mostly evaporated, but when I smell what little scent is there, it is almost as if she is in the room,\u201d he said.\n\nMy dad\u2019s golf shoes do not evoke such pleasant memories. So why keep them? Megan Devine, a psychotherapist in Portland, Ore., has addressed this question in her own life. In 2009, Devine\u2019s partner drowned, three months before his 40th birthday. The brown T-shirt he wore that day is still in a drawer. \u201cI\u2019ve moved four times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nToo often, she says, grief is pathologized and treated like an illness. Yet not all pain is bad.\n\n\u201cThose golf shoes are a reminder of what happened,\u201d said Devine, author of \u201cIt\u2019s OK That You\u2019re Not OK\u201d and founder of the company Refuge in Grief. \u201cSometimes you need evidence that your person lived, evidence that this happened, especially in a culture that wants to erase the person, particularly after a sudden or traumatic death.\u201d\n\nErase the person? Really? That seems harsh, but when we grieve, we\u2019re often pressured to stop feeling sad and move on with our lives, she says. Remarkably, at her partner\u2019s funeral, people asked Devine when she would start dating again.\n\n\u201cThere is a cultural idea that any kind of pain, but especially grief, is something you\u2019re supposed to master quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the implication of that cheerleading \u2014 Be strong! Push through this! Put the past behind you! \u2014 is that if you still miss your person after six weeks, there\u2019s something wrong with you. We don\u2019t talk about grief and pain and sadness as normal, healthy things, so we don\u2019t know how to respond. And when we tell someone, \u2018Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you\u2019ve moved on?,\u2019 that\u2019s a shaming response based on our own discomfort.\u201d\n\nWe also engage in what she calls internalized shame.\n\n\u201cI can hear it in the language you used,\u201d she told me. \u201c \u2018Isn\u2019t it time I do this? Isn\u2019t this kind of ridiculous?\u2019 \u201d\n\nDiscarding loved ones\u2019 things can often spur a second round of loss, says Los Angeles decluttering expert Tracy McCubbin, author of \u201cMaking Space, Clutter Free.\u201d \u201cClients often tell me, when they say goodbye to someone\u2019s stuff, they\u2019re saying goodbye to that person all over again,\u201d she said.\n\nIronically, our lost loved ones probably don\u2019t expect us to cherish their stuff. Kelli Kehler, the executive editor of DesignSponge.com, lost her father to cancer in 2011 and tells the story of one of his pillows.\n\n\u201cWhen you have cancer and you have a lot of pain, your comfortable positions become the center of your life. So this was his special silver pillow,\u201d she said. In the years since his death, her 5-year-old daughter had kept the pillow on her bed. One night she got sick, and as Kehler cleaned the mess, she realized the pillow had to go. She felt anxious about it. But she also knew what her father would say: \u201cIt\u2019s just a pillow.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure my dad would say the same thing about his shoes, but he wore them as he took his last steps on Earth, and those links to final moments carry a powerful, emotional weight.\n\nAs time passes, our connection to objects can diminish, as grief counselor Claire Bidwell Smith has found. When Bidwell Smith was 18, her mother died, followed by her father\u2019s death seven years later. An only child, she experienced despair, depression and anxiety after their deaths.\n\n\u201cAs a grief counselor, I believe that you can never fully be prepared, but I really was not,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom had largely been in denial about how sick she was, which meant that I was also in denial. With my father\u2019s death, it was a double whammy.\u201d\n\nBidwell Smith kept a variety of her mother\u2019s possessions, including a large ceramic Mexican serving bowl. Two years ago, she broke the bowl while scrubbing it in the sink \u2014 and couldn\u2019t bring herself to throw away the pieces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the only proof that she was real, that our time together was real, because it\u2019s so long ago now,\u201d said Bidwell Smith, author of \u201cAnxiety: The Missing Stage of Grief.\u201d \u201cWhen these things break, all I see around me are objects from the life I\u2019ve led without her.\u201d\n\nAnd yet in recent years, as Bidwell Smith and her family have moved to different cities, she has said goodbye to certain objects.\n\n\u201cThe meaning has dissipated a bit over time,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s even ready to relinquish the broken bowl as her family moves from California to South Carolina.\n\nIn my own case, I think I understand now why I\u2019m so reluctant to give the up the golf shoes. If I give away his shoes, I\u2019m severing a final emotional link to my father\u2019s life. And if I lose that link, it\u2019s like I further lose him. Pain is real. Pain lives on. I can feel it when I see the shoes and the tag on the bag with his name and date of death. I\u2019m not ready to lose that raw reminder. And according to grief experts like Devine and Bidwell Smith, that\u2019s fine.\n\nAs McCubbin said, you have to ask yourself: Why do I value this?\n\n\u201cMaybe every once a while, you need to touch it or smell the leather,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s funny coming from the declutter expert, but I don\u2019t think we always have to get rid of something.\u201d\n\nMaybe, Devine suggested, the question is not whether something brings you joy, as Kondo believes, but whether it feels important. For me, the golf shoes still feel important. And so they will continue to sit in my closet, largely forgotten, until I\u2019m again reminded of a special man and a very bad day. And I will welcome the pain.\n\nKen Budd is the author of \u201cThe Voluntourist,\u201d a travel memoir.\n\nRead more\n\nWhen her daughter died, she turned to exercise to quell her grief\n\nTidying up tamed my anxiety as much as my stuff\n\nWhy anxiety should be added to the five stages of grief", "description": "Links to final moments carry a powerful and emotional weight, even as they remind us of a painful loss.", "authors": ["Ken Budd", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Zdyim02L7SlVEAw4UJXG5JQxthc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R44OMLW7H4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
