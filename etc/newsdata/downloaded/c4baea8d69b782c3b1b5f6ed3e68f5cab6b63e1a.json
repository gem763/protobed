The long soft silicon tubes can be filled with water, causing them to curl around the jellyfish without harming it\n\nThe device is made with six long silicone tubes that are designed to act like fingers.\n\nEach tube can be filled with water, which causes the tubes to curl upward toward a 3D printed, palm-like rectangular housing.\n\nThe silicone tubes for a soft, cage around the jellyfish and keep it immobile without damaging its soft outer surface.\n\nHOW DO JELLYFISH BREED? Jellyfish even reproduce in different ways during their life cycles. Adults spawn, releasing a huge quantity of eggs and sperm into the water. The fertilised eggs sink to the ocean depths before hatching a small polyp, which can then clone itself. When vast numbers of jellyfish mass together it is known as a 'bloom'. In the past these would happen at regular intervals, every 12 years in the Mediterranean, for example. Due to a variety of human-caused phenomena, this is now happening every year.\n\n'If we aren't able to safely hold and handle these animals without damaging them, then it makes it really hard to study them,' Hannah Stuart, a mechanical engineer at University of California, Berkeley, told Science News for Students.\n\nJellyfish were among the first complex lifeforms on Earth, having evolved an estimated 500 million years ago.\n\nIn the past, jellyfish would gather in what scientists call a 'bloom' at different locations around the world.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, this would happen every twelve years.\n\nToday, these blooms occur every year, something scientists still aren't sure they understand.\n\nTo date, scientists have identified 200 different species of jellyfish, but some believe there could be thousands that haven't yet been identified.", "description": "Jellyfish are among the oldest life forms on Earth, but they're still a mystery.
