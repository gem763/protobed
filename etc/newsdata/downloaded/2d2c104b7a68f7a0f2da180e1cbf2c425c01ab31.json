Rules are adapted to the circumstance. The only result that we were happy with was to award the prize this year to both.\n\n\u2018There are things they shared. They are both fully engaged novels. They address the world today.\u2019\n\nWho won the 2019 Booker Prize?\n\nCanadian author and poet Margaret Atwood and British writer Bernadine Evaristo were the joint winners of the Booker Prize this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtwood won for her The Handmaid\u2019s Tale sequel The Testaments, and Evaristo won for the polyvocal Girl, Woman, Other, which explores modern black British womanhood.\n\nThe writers will split the \u00a350,000 prize money.\n\nWith this win, Atwood has become the fourth person and the second woman ever to win the Booker prize twice, joining JM Coetzee, Peter Cary and Hilary Mantel. At 79, she is also the oldest person to have won the prize.\n\nShe previously won the Booker Prize for her 2000 novel, The Blind Assassin.\n\nOn the subject of Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, Florence said: \u2018Now it looks more politically urgent than ever. There is a need now to look at what complicity and what resilience and what resistance might look like.\u2019\n\nMargaret Atwood poses with her book \u2018The Testaments\u2019 (Picture: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBoth authors expressed their happiness at sharing the prize, with Atwood saying: \u2018It would have been quite embarrassing for a person of my age and stage to have won the whole thing and thereby have kept a younger one, at a different stage of their career, from going through that door\u2019\n\nWith this win, Evaristo, 60, has become the first black woman to take home the Booker Prize, an honour which she said she hopes \u2018doesn\u2019t last too long.\u2019\n\nBernardine Evaristo poses with her book \u2018Girl, Woman, Other\u2019 (Picture TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFlorence said Evaristo\u2019s work gave readers a \u2018wonderful spectrum of black British women today. This book is groundbreaking\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the subject of her win, Evaristo said she was \u2018absolutely delighted to share it with the legend that is Margaret Atwood.\u2019\n\nBooker Prize shortlist for 2019 Margaret Atwood (joint winner) \u2013 The Testaments Bernardine Evaristo (joint winner) \u2013 Girl, Woman, Other Lucy Ellmann \u2013 Ducks, Newburyport Chigozie Obioma \u2013 An Orchestra of Minorities Salman Rushdie \u2013 Quichotte Elif Shafak \u2013 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World\n\nBooker literary director Gaby Wood said she respected the jury\u2019s choice to rebel, despite an order from foundation chairwoman Helena Kennedy that the rules must be abided by.\n\nWood said: \u2018It is always the jury\u2019s decision. I support the means by which the judges arrived at their decision.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t a fighting gesture. It was a generous one.\n\n\u2018If someone makes a revolutionary gesture, you have to accept it. You don\u2019t have to say, \u2018I agree with it\u2019.\u2019\n\nThe Booker Prize has previously been split twice \u2013 first between Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton in 1974, and again between Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth in 1992.\n\nRules were since brought in to prevent any further divisions of the prize.\n\nMORE: Children\u2019s book teaches young Muslim girls to get into sports\n\nMORE: Woke Babies offers \u00a320 book subscriptions to give black children the representation they need", "description": "Two writers have made history by both winning the 2019 Booker Prize, despite the rules forbidding it.", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89900791_1571132158.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
