That is excellent in theory but it needs to be put into practice and yet again on Sunday there was little evidence of that. Arsenal won but they did not play well and the most glaring issue is the lack of an obvious plan. Are Arsenal meant to press aggressively, and if so why did that part of their game drop off so alarmingly? Are they meant to dominate possession, and if so why do their midfielders appear to spend more time running than playing passes? It is confusing and while injuries are an issue for Emery, particularly in regards to his first\u2011choice full-backs, it is fair to expect that after more than a year in charge his vision for the team would be much clearer.

He used a 4-4-2 system, with his defenders squeezed high and the strikers, Aaron Connolly and Neal Maupay, encouraged to play off the shoulders of the Belgian pair. It worked brilliantly, with Brighton finally winning at home and scoring goals. They might have had more, such was their fluency and the ease with which they played through Spurs. It added up to a headache for Mauricio Pochettino \u2013 is it time to recall D\u00e1vinson S\u00e1nchez or even Juan Foyth? \u2013 but Potter could revel in a plan that came together. There was a fine performance off the left from Aaron Mooy and a two-goal full Premier League debut from Connolly. The 19-year-old has now been promoted into the senior Republic of Ireland squad.

I don\u2019t believe things have changed.\u201d Silva\u2019s assessment of Everton\u2019s performance, however, was wildly upbeat. Everton, with a starting lineup costing more than \u00a3250m, were woeful from start to finish. The clock is ticking on the uninspiring manager of an uninspiring team and given Moshiri\u2019s track record of poor appointments, the director of football, Marcel Brands, should be left with responsibility for finally getting one right.

The rather prosaic truth is that with better finishing his side would have been out of Leicester\u2019s reach long before the end, with Roberto Firmino, Andy Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum all failing to put away excellent chances at 1-0. To an extent Liverpool got lucky, though it is also true to say that for all their feistiness Leicester were fortunate to still be in the game. If Klopp\u2019s team are to equal the record of 18 straight wins at Old Trafford in their next game they will hope to be more clinical.

When it ends Kevin De Bruyne should be fit and Pep Guardiola\u2019s hope will be the midfielder can unlock defences, which the team could not do on Sunday. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cWolves were very defensive in the last 10, 15 minutes. It was difficult to play. When you are not able to score the first goal, maybe we get nervous and don\u2019t 100% feel the confidence is there and we have to be patient. We know how we can play and our qualities. We could not put that on the pitch.\u201d De Bruyne\u2019s brand of direct, destructive play should return at Crystal Palace on 19 October. But given Liverpool\u2019s eight-point lead is the biggest of the Premier League era at this stage the Belgian has to help ensure the team go on a long run of consecutive wins while hoping J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s slip up too.

It is not that the talent is absent, more too much is being demanded of them while those more senior struggle to set the example required. The academy graduates are not just filling in the gaps at United, instead Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is having to turn them into the team\u2019s spine and as the weeks go by it isproving a flawed concept and the morale of the teenagers will likely quickly drop. The manager will need his leaders to come to fore, otherwise the worst start for 30 years could result in a season \u2013 and managerial era \u2013 to forget at Old Trafford.

Last season Fulham sank without trace but Dean Smith appears to be making a far better fist of evolving his team. This demolition job was achieved via a mix of old and new. Wesley scored twice and had a penalty saved, while Douglas Luiz\u2019s curled fifth came after goals by Jack Grealish and Conor Hourihane. Bj\u00f8rn Engels impressed in defence while Marvelous Nakamba, the Zimbabwean gaining cult status, dominated midfield. Norwich, by contrast, spent little after promotion and their defensive naivety is being exposed. Nobody has conceded more than their 21 goals and last month\u2019s defeat of Manchester City no longer looks as mighty a feat as it did then.

It was the Belgian striker\u2019s first Premier League goal for Chelsea since October 2017 and reward for his hard work on the training ground in recent weeks. Earlier this season Frank Lampard was critical of Batshuayi\u2019s fitness and those words seem to have struck a chord with the 26-year-old, who has not given up hope of making it work at Chelsea after loans with Borussia Dortmund, Crystal Palace and Valencia. He will have to wait for his chance, of course, as Tammy Abraham is first choice. Abraham\u2019s goal against Southampton, his ninth of the season, was spectacular. But Batshuayi also has something to offer and his confident finish in the dying stages showed he can be a useful option.

Afterwards the Austria defender revealed that one of the reasons he had not played for so long was a falling-out with Javi Gracia, the Spanish manager sacked by the Premier League\u2019s bottom side a month ago. He declined to elaborate \u2013 \u201clet it be history, maybe there will be a book one day\u201d \u2013 but said he is enjoying life under the new manager, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, whose first spell in charge began the month that Pr\u00f6dl joined the club, June 2015. \u201cHe is very demanding,\u201d the 32-year-old said of Gracia\u2019s compatriot. \u201cWe are training a lot. I like that. There is a good atmosphere and it is much better than it was.\u201d Paul Doyle\n\n\u2022 Match report: Watford 0-0 Sheffield United\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Foster pulls off a spectacular save to deny Sheffield United.

An impressive performance which helped nullify West Ham\u2019s attacking threat for large parts of the game illustrated that Crystal Palace could have pulled off a clever piece of business in signing the 28-year-old from Everton in the summer for just \u00a33m. The only issue with McCarthy, who played in the same side at McArthur for eight seasons at Hamilton and Wigan before moving to Goodison Park for \u00a313m, is whether he can stay fit. \u201cWe\u2019ve been holding him back a little bit trying to build up that intensity,\u201d said the manager Roy Hodgson. \u201cIt was a big day for him and he has to be 100% delighted with his performance.\u201d Ed Aarons\n\n\u2022 Match report: West Ham 1-2 Crystal Palace", "description": "Manchester City need De Bruyne fit, Connolly is a rising star at Brighton and Everton\u2019s Silva should beware the international break", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30883dc64db4fa2f8a533af3056ee4fb94fdcac/0_121_2925_1755/master/2925.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=66d8d37c676dcf9edf1c4149166adfd7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
