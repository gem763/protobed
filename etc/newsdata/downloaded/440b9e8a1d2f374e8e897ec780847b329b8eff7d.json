Some of them, like astrophotography mode, will be coming to older Pixel devices. But two will apparently remain exclusive to the brand-new Pixel 4 and 4 XL: dual exposure controls, which let you adjust highlights and shadows right from your viewfinder, and Live HDR+, which gives you a live preview of what your photo will look like with Google\u2019s HDR processing applied.\n\nGoogle confirmed that these features are Pixel 4 exclusives in a reply to a customer\u2019s tweet (via 9to5Google):\n\nHi Mahfooz, Dual Exposure Controls and Live HDR+ require low-level capabilities in the hardware that are only available on Pixel 4, so they will not be available on older Pixel devices. \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) October 21, 2019\n\nIt seems possible that the \u201clow-level capabilities in the hardware\u201d that Google is referring to involve the Pixel 4\u2019s new Pixel Neural Core co-processor. We\u2019ve asked Google for more information and will update this article with anything the company shares.\n\nThe Pixel 4 hits stores and carriers this week, and it\u2019s a pretty good Android phone. But if you\u2019re planning to stick with a Pixel 3 or 3A, you\u2019ll still be getting some of the new software capabilities introduced last week, according to this handy list compiled by 9to5Google, such as astrophotography mode and Live Caption.", "description": "Google introduced a lot of cool new Pixel camera features at last week\u2019s event, but two will apparently remain exclusive to the brand-new Pixel 4 and 4 XL: dual exposure controls and Live HDR+.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLWHIrmLxVP08JxClHlZLjdcCeo=/0x150:2040x1218/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19303910/vpavic_191016_3730_0090.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
