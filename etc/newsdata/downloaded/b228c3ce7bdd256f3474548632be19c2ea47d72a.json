YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nThere are some strange things to be seen at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nWhile most parts of the ocean remain unexplored, you don't have to venture too deep to see some of Earth's most spectacular animals. And when you get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to Terceira Island in the Azores Archipelago, you'd be pretty stupid to pass up on the opportunity to dive its incredibly clear waters - especially a shipwreck.\n\nREAD: Add scuba to your holiday activities: What you should know about doing your PADI certification\n\nWhile you do need special skills to dive into a shipwreck normally, you only dive around the degraded Lidador, making it quite safe for any skill-level. This was my first dive since doing my PADI Open Water course last year, but I was lucky to have a super patient divemaster from Deep Blue Azores Diving Centre.\n\nOnce under, it's a blue mirage of creepy crawlies, surprisingly colourful fish and a few shy giant crabs that flourish under the region's strict fishing regulations. It's very different to a tropical or Indian Ocean dive (definitely a bit colder), but it remains a beautiful world as you have to look just a little bit harder than in coral reefs to spot its inhabitants.\n\nWATCH: I walked inside this ancient, extinct volcano\n\nWhile I opted for the easier dive, the island has many more stunning dive sites - including sea caves where a fever of stingrays float above a 20-metre trench.\n\nFor any avid diver, the Azores is a must-do bucket list item that will be a thrill to tick off - and with the unique land-based activities offered by Terceira, you won't hesitate to start saving for this trip to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing-up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
