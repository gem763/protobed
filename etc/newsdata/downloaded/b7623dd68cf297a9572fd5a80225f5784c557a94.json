REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/File Photo\n\nIn what the State Department called \u201cone of the largest sanctions actions the U.S. has taken\u201d since curbs were re-imposed on Iran in November last year, two units of COSCO were named alongside other companies in claims of involvement in sanctions-busting shipments of Iranian oil.[\n\nThe surprise move, affecting one of the world\u2019s largest energy shippers, operating more than 50 supertankers, comes as President Donald Trump seeks to exert maximum pressure on Iran to drop nuclear programs.\n\nAs some Asian oil buyers rushed to the shipping market to secure vessels, rates for chartering supertankers, or Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), to load crude oil from the Middle East to north Asia in October surged nearly 19% overnight to about 75-76 points on Worldscale, an industry tool used to calculate freight charges, shipping and industry sources said.\n\nThat means an increase of about $600,000 for each ship, a Singapore-based crude oil trader said.\n\n(Graphic: Global oil freight rates rocket as U.S. sanctions tanker units of Chinese giant COSCO - here)\n\nThe rates for loading Middle East crude to west coast India in the second week of October jumped 28% to 80-92.5 points after Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS) booked two supertankers overnight, industry sources said.\n\nBut there was also uncertainty over how widely the sanctions on the COSCO units - COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co, Ltd and its subsidiary COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co, Ltd - will be implemented. Industry sources said some oil buyers were holding off hiring COSCO tankers while they check with legal teams to better understand the impact of the sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe market is fearful of sanctions so refiners are taking some preventive measures. We\u2019ll have to see how widely implemented the sanctions will be,\u201d said KY Lin, spokesman for Taiwanese refiner Formosa Petrochemical (6505.TW), a major crude oil buyer in Asia.\n\nFriday\u2019s jolt left shipping rates springing back to levels not seen since mid-September drone and missile strikes on key Saudi Arabian oil production facilities roiled global markets. The COSCO vessels are equal to about 7.5% of the world\u2019s fleet of supertankers, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\u201cCharterers are in trouble,\u201d a North Asian shipbroker said, declining to be named citing company policy. \u201cIt was terrible news for every one of us with the Saudi drone attack, and now the market has to deal with U.S. sanctions on COSCO.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood news for owners, good time for them to earn money,\u201d the broker said.\n\nWhile diplomatic tensions between the United States and Iran remain high, a British-flagged tanker that had been detained by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday left Bandar Abbas port heading for international waters.\n\n(Map: Global oil shippers reel after U.S. sanctions world\u2019s largest oil tanker fleet - here)\n\nOn Thursday, Unipec, the trading arm of Asia\u2019s largest refiner Sinopec (600028.SS) and India\u2019s largest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), canceled bookings of some COSCO ships and scrambled to find alternative ships to move their crude on.\n\n\u201cRates have definitely been pushed higher by these sanctions,\u201d said an executive at a top shipbroker in Singapore, adding that ships carrying Middle East and U.S. crude to Asia were subject to the biggest impact. The broker declined to be identified, citing company policy.\n\nCrude shipments from the United States to Asia have also been affected. Industry sources said provisional bookings for VLCCs Cosmerry Lake and Yuan Qiu Hu to load U.S. oil in the second half of October had been scrapped. Cosmerry Lake is owned by Cosmerry Lake Maritime Inc and managed by Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian), while Yuan Qiu Hu is owned and managed by Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian).\n\nFILE PHOTO: Containers are seen on a China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) ship at the San Antonio port in Chile August 6, 2019.
