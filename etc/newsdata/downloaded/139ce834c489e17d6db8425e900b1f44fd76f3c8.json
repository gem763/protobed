It all started with a cheesy allegation.", "language": "en", "text": "A high-stakes food drama playing out in the French Alps might all boil down to the cheddar. Or lack thereof.\n\nRenowned French chef Marc Veyrat on Tuesday announced he had sued the France-based Michelin Guide after the restaurant guidebook authority demoted his La Maison des Bois in Manigod, France, from three stars to two earlier this year. Veyrat claimed Michelin\u2019s reviewer wrongly determined a cheese souffle as having cheddar in it; Veyrat said the color was from saffron used in the dish and is now seeking documentation from Michelin to explain its decision.\n\n\u201cThey dared to say that we put cheddar in our souffle of reblochon, beaufort, and tomme,\u201d Veyrat told French magazine Le Point in July. \u201cThey have insulted our region; my employees were furious.\"\n\nA court hearing is set for Nov. 27 in Nanterre, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nVeyrat\u2019s restaurant, roughly 100 miles east of Lyon, was first awarded the coveted three-star Michelin ranking in 2018. Much of the food in the $330-to-$430 tasting menu comes from the restaurant\u2019s own botanic gardens and orchards.\n\nThe famed chef learned in January that his restaurant was losing a star just one year after it had achieved the three-star ranking \u2014 widely considered among the most prestigious distinctions in the fine-dining business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a depression for six months. How dare you take hostage the health of cooks?\u201d Veyrat lamented during his July interview with Le Point, during which he blamed the \u201camateur\u201d nature of the Michelin reviewers.\n\n[Suspected suicide of \u2018world\u2019s best chef\u2019 highlights pressure-cooker of haute cuisine]\n\n\u201cIt scares me for the new generations to come. In fact, the only reason given was confusion over the Reblochon and Beaufort emulsion with cheddar,\u201d he said. He went on to call the Michelin reviewers \u201cimpostors\u201d who deliberately stir up fights for \u201ccommercial reasons.\u201d\n\nAmong Veyrat\u2019s grievances is his belief that reviewers \u2014 in violation of Michelin\u2019s own stated best practices \u2014 did not visit the restaurant multiple times. He\u2019s demanding receipts from Michelin to prove that their independent, anonymous reviewers dined at Le Maison des Bois more than once.\n\nThe receipts are among the records Veyrat\u2019s lawsuit is hoping to compel from Michelin, his lawyer Emmanuel Ravanas told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFor decades, Veyrat has been used to having his cooking graded, evaluated and compared, and he knows quite well that you don\u2019t own a star for life. He accepts it all, as long as the criticism is accurate,\u201d Ravanas said.\n\nIn a statement, Michelin spokesman J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bourret said: \u201cWe understand the disappointment of Mr Veyrat, whose talent no one [contests], even if we regret his unreasonable persistence with his accusations. Our first duty is to tell consumers why we have changed our recommendation. We will carefully study his demands and respond calmly.\u201d\n\n[The Inn at Little Washington earns its third Michelin star, a first for the D.C. region]\n\nThe annual Michelin \u201cRed Guide\u201d evaluates mostly fine dining restaurants in cities around the world and awards what it considers the very top-tier establishments with between one and three stars; there are just 27 three-star restaurants in France and fewer than 140 in the world. And among European diners, the rankings hold particular sway, said Helen Rosner, the roving food correspondent for the New Yorker.\n\n\u201cThe American relationship to Michelin stars is very different than the European and the Asian one in terms of the dining public: In Europe and Asia, three stars is the highest pinnacle a restaurant can receive,\u201d Rosner explained. While she noted the same can be true for U.S.-based chefs, European diners have a 100-year history (and awareness of) the Michelin brand; Michelin didn\u2019t publish its first American guide until 2005.\n\nThere are also economic and emotional considerations for chefs whose restaurants hit the coveted three-star mark.\n\n\u201cFor a restaurant to have three stars, it means they\u2019re never going to have trouble filling seats; the gift of three stars is economic security. Even one star can be a make or break element for a young restaurant,\u201d Rosner said. The downside is that some chefs can view stars as \u201can assessment of culinary and creative quality and that if you don\u2019t have three stars, you\u2019re not doing a good job.\u201d\n\nThe pressure on chefs to achieve and then maintain Michelin stars and other haute cuisine status can be intense. When award-winning French chef Bernard Loiseau killed himself in 2003, those close to him speculated that one factor was his fear over losing a Michelin star after being downgraded by another rating authority.\n\nFor as much as chefs covet Michelin stars, some have started to reject the recognition. Veyrat tried to \u201cgive back\u201d his rating after he was downgraded this year (Michelin said it would still list his restaurant, though they can\u2019t force chefs to acknowledge the honor).\n\nWilliam Wan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe 25 best casual restaurants in the D.C. area\n\nKFC\u2019s new fried chicken and doughnut sandwich is terrifying and delicious\n\nFood plays a starring role in the Downton Abbey movie", "description": "\u201cThey dared to say that we put cheddar in our souffle of reblochon, beaufort, and tomme,\u201d Marc Veyrat said in July. \u201cThey have insulted our region; my employees were furious.\"", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Kim Bellware Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
