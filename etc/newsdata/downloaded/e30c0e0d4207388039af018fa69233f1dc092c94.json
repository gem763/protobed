The man who approved terror plots worldwide, who inspired jihadists, who lied about his own religion, ended his bloody reign by dragging 3 of his own children into a tunnel and blowing them, and himself, to pieces.\n\nAnd Trump gets to look like a leader. A man who can win wars, and most importantly against an enemy that does not have the courage to fight in the open - an enemy chased into a tunnel by dogs.\n\nThe past two US presidents managed much the same. But the actions of those presidents created the conditions that gave rise to al-Baghdadi and his cruelty, and Trump is now making it worse.\n\nGeorge Bush invaded Iraq on a false pretext, to look tough, and without a plan, a year before he wanted to get re-elected. Al-Baghdadi was radicalised, jailed in first Abu Ghraib then Camp Bucca, and joined a jihadist network in the prisons. Obama pulled out troops a year before his re-election, leaving the wound to fester, and released al-Baghdadi to do what he fancied. Trump abandoned the Middle East to Russia, on one condition - the right to kill one man, and claim one good headline.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe had muttered for months about pulling out the final 2,000 US troops, which would look good with his base. But Trump had to remain engaged in protecting the Kurds from Syrian and Turkish vengeance in the vaccum he would leave behind.\n\nHe was helped by the fact the war against ISIS had been declared won, repeatedly, by the US, Russia, Syrian independence fighters and others. But in January his own military officials warned that ISIS could return \"within 6 to 12 months\". Trump was forced to leave 400 fighters as a buffer, and a watchman.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump announced he was finally bringing them home. The world watched as Turkey invaded, the US president claimed the Kurds weren't worth saving, and Russia took control as the region's peacekeeper.\n\nBut it is now known that, just days before, US forces had uncovered evidence of al-Baghdadi's whereabouts. Faced with massive unpopularity at home, an election next year and scandal over asking the Ukrainian government to interfere in it, Trump would have been desperate to claim the scalp of a terror leader in the same way his predecessors did, just when he wants a second term.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAs Trump released his own, stiff and staged Situation Room photo - with a time stamp showing it was taken 90 minutes after the raid he claimed to be watching - it was revealed that the US helicopters flew over Russian-controlled areas and into Al Qaeda territory to get to al-Baghdadi's compound.\n\nMoscow had been informed of a US operation, but not the target. The more cynical might wonder if abandoning the Kurds was the price that Trump was asked, told, or decided to pay in return for a clear run at the ISIS leader. The timing is undoubtedly convenient, for all sides.\n\nIt's particularly welcome for ISIS, a criminal enterprise which once controlled the lives of 8million people and raked in billions of dollars in ransoms, robbery and oil cash.\n\nBecause it has expanded from merely operating in Iraq and Syria to activities in more than a dozen countries worldwide. The United Nations Security Council has been told that it has \"substantially evolved into a covert network\" in Iraq, organising cells, carrying out kidnappings and assassinations, and attacking infrastructure the West spent millions rebuilding.\n\nISIS is thought to still have 18,000 militants, access to heavy weapons, and up to \u00a3231m in cash.\n\n(Image: whitehouse /Instagram)\n\nAl Qaeda doesn't like ISIS, on the basis it's too mental. A number of other jihadist groups formed the Army of Conquest, which thought ISIS was too soft, and they started fighting each other. The current coalition of crazies is called Tahrir al-Sham, with another dozen salafist brigades operating in land seized from somebody else.\n\nExperts reckon there's at least 20,000 such militants, and they form around half of all Syrian rebels. Taking out one cleric from that mix will make bugger all difference.\n\nISIS was not a snake, and al-Baghdadi was not its head. Jihadists do not operate like a professional, Western army, with orders coming from the top. They are all about chaos - someone who inspires them to create it, provides a twisted justification for whatever idea they come up with, and then claims it as a victory if it works. There's often a paper trail between them, movement of money and wives and phone calls, but it's not a simple beast that is easy to kill.\n\nIt's a sponge, which absorbs whatever it finds, and reforms no matter how many times you chop it up. And all Trump has done is give it space to grow.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nKilling ISIS militants does not kill its ideas, in the same way that killing teenagers at an Ariana Grande concert, or cartoonists in Paris, or World Trade Centre staff, does not kill the things that teenagers, cartoonists or Americans believe in. It merely creates resentment, and a burial issue.\n\nIf you want to defeat the aims of jihadists, you need to prove your way of doing things is better. You need to deprogramme the faithful, prosecute the criminal, close down the money, and find a way for the Muslim world to heal the centuries-old religious schism which gives the deranged all the excuse they need to pick a fight.\n\nMost of all, you need to show the acolytes that their apocalypse has not arrived. To kill a death cult, they need to NOT die. They must be disappointed, instead.\n\nLetting Russia oversee their evolution won't work. Too many jihadists were created on its watch in Afghanistan, too much corruption and greed follows in Putin's wake. The only things he can fix are elections.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWith al-Baghdadi dead, there's no trial. No disappointment. No deradicalisation.\n\nThe Middle East is no better. The 6.6m internally displaced Syrians are no safer, the 5.6m refugees who fled the country are made no more welcome, and the poison al-Baghdadi spewed merely seems, to those ready to believe it, more heroic.\n\nJihadis are still a thing. And the hate is multiplying - a brigade of Uyghurs, escaping 're-education camps' in China, have been fighting in Syria since 2013, desecrating Christian churches and carrying out atrocities.\n\nTrump has merely made the same stupid mistakes as the past two US presidents - a quick military win for a quick headline - with some more of his own thrown in for good measure. He coupled a move made for his own political ends with one that destroyed the hopes and lives of his one useful ally in the region, the Kurds. He closed his eyes while children were burned with white phosphorus weapons. And he's probably stupid enough to believe all of this won't come back to bite him on his wide, wobbly arse.\n\nThe fact he needed to send in US troops proves he should have kept some there. The fact he had no allies trusted to do the job for him proves he has no means of return.\n\nAnd that fact that, today, the hellhole that was once known as the Islamic State is no less hellish, is proof that those special forces soldiers risked their lives for nothing more than presidential retweets.", "description": "If you cut the head off a fundamentalist monster, it's just an angrier monster", "authors": ["Fleet Street Fox", "Image", "Getty Images", "Whitehouse", "Instagram", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741625.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_FSF-TRUMP-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
