(Photo: Sony)\n\nWhen Zombieland: Double Tap opens in theatres later this month, it\u2019ll be a decade since the original was released. That\u2019s not an unheard-of amount of time between original and sequel, but for a goofy horror comedy like Zombieland, it certainly feels that way. And it seems like the movie is well aware of that.\n\nSony has just released a new red-band trailer for the film, and it\u2019s filled with cursing, violence, all the kind of stuff you\u2019d expect from a red-band trailer. Fair warning: There\u2019s also a cameo or two that gets ruined in here, and as well as those jokes about the amount of time that has passed between movies.\n\nCheck out the new trailer below.\n\nSo, obviously, there\u2019s the Luke Wilson joke at the end winking at the decade that\u2019s passed. But there\u2019s also the way the trailer really plays up the fact all four leads are Oscar nominees and one, Stone, is an actual winner. (Interestingly, all of Eisenberg and Stone\u2019s nominations came after Zombieland; Breslin\u2019s came before and Harrelson had one before and two after.) That kind of mainstream critical success usually means you don\u2019t have to do movies like Zombieland: Double Tap any more, but it\u2019s a credit to the filmmakers that the cast wanted to come back. Their agents too, probably.\n\nI have to admit, though: This trailer is the first one that got me excited about the film. I\u2019m a huge fan of meta-humour, as well as the work of writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, but up until now the trailers just looked like more of the same. Zombies, slow motion, we got it. But here, the fact that \u201cthat guy\u201d appears (I won\u2019t spoil it in case you didn\u2019t watch) and the way the film pokes fun at its mere existence have both swayed me. Here\u2019s hoping the team leans into those kinds of things and Double Tap changes things instead of repeating them.\n\nWe\u2019ll find out October 17.", "description": "When Zombieland: Double Tap opens in theatres later this month, it\u2019ll be a decade since the original was released.
