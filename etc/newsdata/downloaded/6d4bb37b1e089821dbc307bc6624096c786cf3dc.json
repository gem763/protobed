It\u2019s also a good deal for investors when the earnings of the company are significantly higher than the dividends paid out. This allows the company to grow its dividends even further.\n\nBeating these averages on a single basis is not that hard. But using all three criteria, it is difficult. The average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.9%. The average dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by earnings per share) is 35%. The median P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 14.8 times.\n\nSo finding high-yield stocks that have all three traits is actually not that easy. Part of the reason is that most high-yield stocks also tend to have high payout ratios. Their high yields may signal the fact that the market thinks that earnings do not cover the dividends. The fear is that the company will have to cut the dividend in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut I have chosen five stocks selling with dividend yields of 6%+ and with low payout ratios. The dividends of these stocks represent just 50% or so of earnings per share on a forward-looking basis. This is slightly higher than the average payout ratio of the S&P 500. But this is much better than typical high-yield stocks that have very high payout ratios. In addition, the dividend yields are three times higher than the average.\n\nIn addition, these high-yield stocks have low P/E ratios, significantly below the average.\n\nThese high-yield stocks are cheap and worth investing in over the long term. You can rely on them to continue to pay their dividends. Also, you get paid with these high-yield stocks to wait until the stock price rises.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-Yield Stocks: Invesco (IVZ)\n\nDividend Yield: 8%\n\nPayout Ratio: 51%\n\nP/E Ratio: 6.4\n\nInvesco (NYS:IVZ) is an investment manager based in Atlanta, Georgia. As of Sept. 30 its assets under management were $1,184 billion \u2014 over $1.1 trillion.\n\nIVZ stock trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 6.4 \u2014 based on my calculations \u2014 and is a very high-yield stock. IVZ pays out about half its earnings in dividends.\n\nThe market has priced IVZ stock cheaply based on the flow of funds fears. Investors have been worried about the long-term outflow of funds from active investment managers like IVZ. Nevertheless, Invesco has had consistently higher AUM over each of the past 10 years.\n\nIVZ\u2019s dividends have been growing consistently over the past three years (+34%) and five years (+7%). Moreover, its payout ratio has been consistently between 50%-55% of its earnings.\n\nLook for IVZ stock to follow this consistent trend. IVZ has raised its dividend for 11 years. IVZ\u2019s dividends have plenty of room to grow given its low payout ratio history.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeredith Corporation (MDP)\n\nDividend Yield: 7%\n\nPayout Ratio: 43.6%\n\nP/E Ratio: 6.2\n\nMeredith Corporation (NYSE:MDP) publishes People, In-Style, Better Homes and Gardens and Martha Stewart Living. In 2018 MDP also bought Time Magazine. It also owns 17 TV stations. Meredith Corporation is recognized as the number-one magazine operator in the U.S.\n\nMDP stock is very cheap at just 6.2 times forward earnings.\n\nMoreover, its $2.30 dividend rate is only 43.6% of projected earnings. That is a very low payout ratio. It allows room for MDP to continue to raise its dividend.\n\nThe chart above shows that its payout ratio has been consistently low. This has allowed MDP to raise its dividend over the past 26 years.\n\nConcerns about the company\u2019s weak earnings outlook and missed expectations have kept MDP stock cheap. Despite underperforming growth expectations, MDP stock continues to offer a high dividend yield, low P/E and low payout ratio. This is the kind of formula to which value investors are very attracted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chemours Company (CC)", "description": "High-yield stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios tend to do well over time.
