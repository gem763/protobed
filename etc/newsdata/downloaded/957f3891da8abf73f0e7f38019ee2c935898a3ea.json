Channel 1 placed Likud and Blue and White neck and neck.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The official elections results are expected on Wednesday.\n\nThe country was forced back into fresh elections just five months after the April polls when Mr Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government.\n\nHis former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, the head of right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu, in the eleventh hour refused to join forces with the Likud meaning the prime minister could not nudge past a 61-seat majority.\n\n\n\nThe exit polls suggest there may be similar deadlock this time, with no side showing a clear majority.\n\n\n\nRachel Broyde, a Likud spokeswoman, said that it was too early to draw any conclusions, telling The Independent: \u201cThey are merely exit polls and are notoriously off in Israel. We just have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nIn the headquarters of the Blue and White Party, where the mood was subdued, party officials were cautiously optimistic.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

No exit poll has shown [Netanyahu] come close to a majority, in none of them does he have the 61 seats to build an immunity coalition for himself. This is a huge success for Blue and White,\u201d Yair Zivan an adviser to Yair Lapid, one of party\u2019s leaders told The Independent.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are also the largest party in the exit polls. This says the public has had enough with Netanyahu. He pulled out all the stops today \u2013 he went even further than he did in the last campaign and didn\u2019t get the support of the public.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr Zivan reiterated Blue and White's call that they forge a national unity government with Likud but without Mr Netanyahu because of his likely indictment.\n\nThe exit polls also indicated that far-right ultra-nationalist Jewish Power party, led by followers of the late rabbi Meir Kahane, who advocated expelling Arabs from Israel and creating a Jewish theocracy, was unable to cross the electoral threshold. The third biggest party was the Arab Joint List, polling between 11 and 15 seats, the most they have ever received.\n\n\n\nAll suggested that the Soviet-born Lieberman could once again play kingmaker, with his party sweeping between eight and 10 seats which could easily nudge either the right bloc or centre-left past the threshold.\n\n\n\nMr Lieberman, who has twice caused Mr Netanyahu's ruling coalition to collapse, vowed on Tuesday to avoid a third election.\n\n\n\nHe instead said he would try to force a secular unity government between his party, Likud and Blue and White that would leave out the ultra-Orthodox parties.\n\n\u201cWe only have one option: A broad, liberal, national government made up of Yisrael Beiteinu, Likud and Blue and White,\u201d he said late Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver six million people were eligible to vote in the polls. As of 4pm Israel's central election committee said 44.3 percent had cast their ballots marking a slight increase over the figure at the same time in April.\n\n\n\nIn April, overall turnout was just under 70 per cent, slightly below the 72 per cent figure in a 2015 election.\n\n\n\nMr Netanyahu, desperate to cling on to power, campaigned furiously right up until the final hours.\n\n\n\nIn the week leading up to the polls, he promised to annex the occupied West Bank, he nearly launched a military offensive in Gaza, he tabled a military defence pact with the US president, Donald Trump, flew to Russia to meet President Putin and agreed to a slew of interviews.\n\n\n\nThroughout the day of the election he frantically begged supporters to vote and repeatedly warned of a high \u201cArab and Left\u201d voter turnout.\n\n\n\n\"It's not in the bag. But if you go (vote), we will win,\" Netanyahu blared through a megaphone to shoppers at a Jerusalem market after stopping at other Likud strongholds in the city.\n\nMeanwhile Facebook punished his page for the second time during the campaign, briefly suspending his automated chat function after it illegally published an opinion poll in the days before the election. Last week, the account was suspended for 24 hours after a post claimed that Arabs want to \u201cannihilate all of us.\u201d\n\nAt the polling stations voters expressed frustration at having to vote for a second time in under six months.\n\n\u201cThis change has come because [Netanyahu] is now apparently stressed. He sees that things aren\u2019t going this way, and people understand this,\u201d Ali Jaffaly, an Arab-Israeli who owns a store in Jaffa and was voting for the Joint List.\n\n\u201cHe feels that he\u2019s gotten weaker, that there\u2019s a change happening,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAvi , 41 who voted for ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, that is part of Mr Netanyahu's Right bloc, said: \u201cHe seems to be trying everything to get supporters to vote. He is the only man credible enough to be prime minister but no one understands why we are voting again, especially since nothing has changed.\u201d", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen short of securing a parliamentary majority with his hard-right allies in Israel\u2018s unprecedented second election, according to exit polls.
