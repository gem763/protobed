Rand Paul and Rep. Liz Cheney, both Republicans, have been trading barbs online (and on television) over foreign policy and who is in better standing with Trump.\n\nThe shameless spat began when Paul shared a week-old Washington Examiner op-ed from Wyoming state legislators telling Cheney to \u201cstop carping at Trump for rejecting endless war.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree! Why do some neocons continue to advocate for endless wars? I stand with @realdonaldtrump on ending wars,\u201d the libertarian senator added in light of the firing of hawkish national-security chief John Bolton. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on America First, not Afghanistan!\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s shot at Cheney was also likely spurred on by the Wyoming congresswoman\u2019s mild criticism earlier this week of the president\u2019s Camp David invitation to the Taliban, which was scheduled days before the anniversary of 9/11.\n\nCheney, meanwhile, quickly fired back by noting that while she stands with Trump and \u201cour men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists,\u201d Paul \u201cseems to have forgotten that today is 9/11.\u201d\n\nPaul restarted the slap-fight on Thursday morning, insisting the president recognized Cheney\u2019s \u201cNeverTrump warmongering\u201d and \u201cpro-Bolton blathering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for a president who, unlike you, supports stopping these endless wars,\u201d he added.\n\nIn response to Paul\u2019s jab, Cheney fired back by reminding the libertarian-leaning senator that he was trounced by Trump in the 2016 Republican primary. She also quoted an old tweet in which Trump attacked Paul, dubbing him \u201ctruly weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi @RandPaul I know the 2016 race was painful for you since you were such a big loser (then & now) with a dismal 4.5% in Iowa,\u201d she tweeted in Trumpian fashion. \u201cNo surprise since your motto seems to be \u2018Terrorists First, America Second.\u2019\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone, Paul replied by taking a shot at the congresswoman\u2019s father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, a notoriously hawkish Republican like his daughter.\n\n\u201cHey \u2066@Liz_Cheney\u2069 I feel like you might just be mad still about when Candidate Trump shredded your Dad\u2019s failed foreign policy and endless wars,\u201d he tweeted, attaching a recap from the 2016 GOP primary debates.\n\n\u201cWeird. I don\u2019t see you on stage here, @RandPaul,\u201d Cheney shot back minutes later. \u201cOh, right. My bad - you had already lost. #weirdRand\u201d\n\nFrom there, Paul absolutely unloaded in a seeming effort to get the last word in vying for Trump\u2019s affirmation, firing off a tweetstorm taking aim at the Cheney family:\n\nNot content on keeping this battle royale for Trump\u2019s love contained to Twitter, Paul also appeared Thursday afternoon to take it to the airwaves.\n\nCNN anchor Brianna Keilar, however, confronted Paul head-on and mocked the senator to his face.\n\n\u201cDo you worry this is devolving a bit into this butt-kissing contest that\u2019s a little unbecoming of two members of Congress?\u201d Keilar asked.\n\nAnd as if this spat couldn\u2019t get any more insufferable, members of Paul\u2019s and Cheney\u2019s staffs got involved in the online dog-pile. In response to a Politico reporter snarking that the two sparring lawmakers will eventually have make-up luncheons, Cheney aide Natalie Johnson tweeted: \u201cMy boss doesn\u2019t sit at the kid\u2019s table.\u201d Paul\u2019s chief strategist Doug Stafford fired back: \u201cSure she does. What do you think the House is?\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
