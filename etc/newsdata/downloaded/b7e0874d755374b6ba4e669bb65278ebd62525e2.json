(AP) - When Kentucky faces South Carolina on Saturday night, the winner will let out a sigh of relief and the loser will be in all-out free fall.\n\nWelcome to what could be aptly dubbed the Panic Bowl.\n\nThe Wildcats (2-2, 0-2 Southeastern Conference) and the Gamecocks (1-3, 0-2) are each looking to end two-game losing streaks and finally break into the win column in conference play. A loss would also set already nervous fans bases a-Twitter with questions and calls about what\u2019s gone wrong in what looked like promising seasons.\n\nKentucky, which expected to build on a 10-3 season last fall, has dropped a tight game against Florida before getting handled on the road at Mississippi State.\n\nWildcats coach Mark Stoops has heard the critics and believes his team can quiet the noise as the season continues.\n\n\u201cPeople like to panic,\u201d Stoops said. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily panic in our building. We like to get back to work and get better.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina also is at a pivotal point in its season. Following Kentucky is an open week, seven more days for outsiders to snipe and pick away at a so-far underachieving program this season.\n\nThe Gamecocks blew a 11-point second-half lead to lose to North Carolina in the opener and, after an anticipated blowout, 47-23, loss to Alabama, were ineffective most of the way in an ugly, 34-14 loss at Missouri.\n\nThey\u2019ve lost five straight to Kentucky and No. 6 would leave South Carolina off to its worst start since the 1999 team went 0-11 in Lou Holtz\u2019s first season.\n\n\u201cWe have pressure every single week,\u201d South Carolina coach Will Muschamp said. \u201cEvery single week, there\u2019s a lot of pressure, and you know what? There\u2019s more pressure internally than there is externally, I can assure you of that.\u201d\n\nKentucky has a young team that\u2019s still adjusting to not having last year\u2019s leaders and playmakers, SEC defensive player of the year linebacker Josh Allen and tailback Benny Snell Jr., who was second in SEC rushing with 1,449 yards. Stoops said he talked to his players at halftime trailing 21-3.\n\nThe Wildcats played better the final two quarters, but that was too late, Stoops said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough. It wasn\u2019t up to our standards and expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got to go back and try to get them fixed.\u201d\n\nSome other things to watch when Kentucky faces South Carolina:\n\nSTREAKY SERIES\n\nThe Wildcats have won five in a row over South Carolina. But before this most recent turn, the Gamecocks had won 13 of 14 in a run from 2000 through 2013.\n\nBACKUP QBS OUT FRONT\n\nBoth Kentucky\u2019s Sawyer Smith and South Carolina\u2019s Ryan Hilinski became starters due to season-ending injuries to quarterbacks who started the season. Smith is a junior transfer from Troy who took over for Terry Wilson, out for the year with a left patella tendon injury. Hilinski, a freshman who enrolled in January, was put in following Jake Bentley\u2019s left foot fracture in South Carolina\u2019s opener.\n\nPORTAL TALK\n\nSouth Carolina lost starting safety Jamyest Williams to the NCAA transfer portal this week, the junior deciding to end his season, redshirt and prepare for two more years elsewhere. Williams said on social media he gave the program all he had. Muschamp wished him well moving forward.\n\nCALLING SNELL?\n\nKentucky is certainly sorry to see Benny Snell Jr. gone. The Gamecocks aren\u2019t. Snell rushed 76 times for 274 yards and four touchdowns the past three games - all Wildcat wins. A.J. Rose is Kentucky\u2019s top tailback this season, averaging 74 yards a game.\n\nBOWDEN\u2019S RISE\n\nKentucky receiver Lynn Bowden Jr. became the first Wildcat with six or more receptions in the first four games of a season since James Whalen in 1999. Bowden is only the second Kentucky player in history with 125 yards receiving in two road games, joining Larry Seiple who played at Kentucky from 1964-66 before winning a pair of Super Bowl titles with the Miami Dolphins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Kentucky faces South Carolina on Saturday night, the winner will let out a sigh of relief and the loser will be in all-out free fall.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pete Iacobelli"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/kentucky_mississippi_st_football_82240_c0-156-3740-2336_s1770x1032.jpg?17e73b705c99d484afc5032fc61156cd15d36c6f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
