The doctors, surveyed by the West Australian branch of the Australian Medical Association, want to see nearly 30 changes made to the bill. More than 90 percent of the doctors surveyed seek some change. Among sought-after amendments, doctors want to ensure a patient who wants to access voluntary assisted dying sees a specialist in the disease they have. The laws will be considered by the state's upper house in mid-October. If the legislation is successful, West Australia will become the second state in the country to legalise voluntary assisted dying following Victoria\u2019s decision to pass similar laws in 2017.
