Nevils, who weighed in on Twitter Wednesday, said she reported the incident to NBC afterward.\n\nBut Lack, in a memo to employees obtained by THR, wrote that Lauer was fired within 24 hours after NBCUniversal leaders learned of his \u201cappalling and reprehensible\u201d conduct.\n\n\u201cFollowing Lauer\u2019s firing, NBCU\u2019s legal team did an exhaustive investigation of available records and conducted dozens of interviews of past and present staff,\u201d the memo states. \u201cThey uncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired. Only following his termination did NBCU reach agreements with two women who had come forward for the very first time, and those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose.\u201d\n\nThe memo came the same day that Lauer released an open letter denying the allegations against him, writing that the sexual encounters described in Farrow's book were \u201ccompletely consensual,\u201d FOX News reported.\n\nFarrow also wrote that Weinstein \u201cmade it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer\u2019s behavior and capable of revealing it\u201d in an effort to get NBC News to stop working on a story about his own sexual harassment allegations. Farrow had been working on the Weinstein story for NBC, which eventually declined to air it. The story was later published in The New Yorker instead.\n\nLack responded in the memo that NBC News \u201ccompletely supported\u201d Ronan\u2019s reporting on the Weinstein story \u201cover many months with resources \u2014 both financial and editorial,\u201d THR reported.\n\nHowever, Lack wrote that Farrow didn\u2019t meet the network\u2019s standards after seven months, with no victims or witnesses on the record, according to the report.\n\n\u201cNot wanting to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by The New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away,\u201d the memo states. \u201cReluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead. Fifty-three days later, and five days after The New York Times did indeed break the story, he published an article at The New Yorker that bore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News.\u201d\n\nA representative for Farrow disagreed with the memo, calling statements by NBC senior management \u201csimply not true,\u201d according to THR.\n\n\u201cIn fact, relevant sections of the book confirm not only how many women were named, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered,\u201d the rep said. \u201cImportantly, it documents the lengths to which NBC executives went to thwart the reporting efforts of Ronan and his producer Rich McHugh and why they did so.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Ronan Farrow's \"Catch and Kill\" includes new details on allegations against Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/12/0/0/Matt20Lauer20FBN20320Reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
