Poised \u2014 meaning not yet committed. Did you get that? Suspects were apprehended pre-crime, based on figments of psychics\u2019 imaginations.\n\nThis is how the Democrats\u2019 and Nancy Pelosi\u2019s \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d into President Donald Trump rings.\n\nThe precog forces of the far left are demanding Trump\u2019s impeachment for impeachable crimes he\u2019s not even committed \u2014 for what \u201cMinority Report\u201d would have chalked up as pre-crimes.\n\nSound stupid? It is. But just look at the Democrats\u2019 own words.\n\nWhat is an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d after all, except the left\u2019s special way of announcing they\u2019re going to go on a hunt for impeachment-worthy crimes this president has supposedly committed, so they can then punish him for those crimes by impeaching him?\n\nThey believe Trump \u2014 they want to believe Trump \u2014 has committed offenses worthy of impeachment. So they\u2019re going to search and search and search until they can destroy.\n\nIn that regard, Democrats, and shamefully, even some Republicans, have been staging an impeachment inquiry into Trump since Day One. Since before Day One. In April of 2016, Politico ran a report that speculated on all the pundits, politicians and media types who were busily speculating on the chances of Trump to be impeached; Trump, it should be noted, wasn\u2019t even nominated as the Republican Party candidate of presidential choice until July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention \u2014 fully three months after this Politico report was published.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for a president to raise red flags of criminal behaviors, or even questionable deeds, to heights that warrant deeper scrutiny.\n\nIt\u2019s another thing entirely for a faction of the political forces in this country to use their hatred of a president to justify constant queries and inquiries and investigations in hopes of turning up the goods.\n\nThe latest look-see involves Ukraine and a whistleblower \u2014 a whistleblower who wrote a nine-page document outlining information that may or may not point to Trump\u2019s crossing of legal lines, that may or may not indicate impeachable offenses committed by Trump, but that definitely were based on hearsay, and that were definitely based on the hearsay of unidentified sources. That The New York Times has identified this whistleblower as a CIA official doesn\u2019t exactly bolster the allegations on the truthfulness scale.\n\nJohn Brennan, who headed up the CIA until January of 2017, when Trump took office, has spent his down time filling his Twitter feed with as much anti-Trump messaging as can fit in the allotted character count. In one of his latest, he wrote, just weeks ago, \u201cThe stain Donald Trump leaves on our Nation\u2019s soul should be a constant reminder that we cannot assume candidates for public office have the competence, integrity, & decency Americans deserve. In 2020, we need to elect someone to safeguard & strengthen democracy, not trample it.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget: Jim Comey. Peter Strzok. Lisa Page. Not to mention the ones we still don\u2019t know working steadily, secretly and silently to unseat this president.\n\nAt this point in time, is it even feasible to expect the American people to believe anything that comes out of U.S. intelligence agencies? Particularly when the things that come are cloaked in anonymity, carried by an openly anti-Trump press? It\u2019d be nice to believe. But honestly, the hostility of the left and the contamination of our intel agencies make it tough.\n\nAs a smart guy just said to me: \u201cImpeachment inquiry\u201d is a phrase the anti-Trumpers can use to keep \u201cimpeachment\u201d talk going, well into election season, even knowing full well they don\u2019t have the goods to impeach. That\u2019s a concise summary.\n\nJust so the voters are clear, though: Impeachment inquiry is not really a real thing. It\u2019s a hunt for an impeachable offense.\n\nIt\u2019s tantamount to a fantasy Hollywood movie drama about pre-crime. If the left actually had the stuff to impeach, there would be no talk of inquiry. There\u2019d be votes and action. There\u2019s be nothing secretive or speculative about it.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
