Total income rose 6% to EUR12.47 billion.\n\nThe lender had said previously that the charge was mostly due to a challenging regulatory environment, such as the negative impact of \"ringfencing\" rules, under which U.K. lenders must separate retail banking from riskier investment-banking operations. Another EUR103 million charge was booked on missold payment protection insurance.\n\nThe bank's core Tier 1 ratio--a key measure of balance-sheet strength--was 11.30% in September, unchanged from the end of June.\n\nWrite to Pietro Lombardi at pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com and Carlo Martuscelli at carlo.martuscelli@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 02:24 ET (06:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
