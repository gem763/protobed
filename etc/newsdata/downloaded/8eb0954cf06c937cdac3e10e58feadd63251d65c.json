It shouldn't be controversial to say that", "language": "en", "text": "Ever since the news of Jacques Chirac\u2019s death broke, my Twitter feed has looked rather strange. People I would never have thought of as consummate Chirac fans have been sharing and liking clips highlighting some of our former president\u2019s past speeches. One of them shows him issuing a stark warning about climate change at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. It was a great address, by the way, which included the following statements: \u201cOur house is burning down and we\u2019re blind to it. Nature, mutilated and overexploited, can no longer regenerate and we refuse to admit it. Humanity is suffering. \u2026 If the whole of humanity were to behave like the Northern countries, it would take two more planets to satisfy our needs.\u201d\n\nAnother popular clip making the rounds shows Chirac urging the French never to \u201cmake concessions to extremism, racism, antisemitism or the rejection of others\u201d.\n\nSuch affectionate outpourings led the Associated Press to note in its coverage of Chirac\u2019s death that French mourners are \u201clooking past his problems to share grief and memories of a man who long dominated France\u2019s political scene\u201d. And look, sure, if you only watch the aforementioned videos, Chirac sounds pretty great. Several other aspects of his legacy are certainly deserving of praise, as well. He was the first leader to acknowledge France\u2019s role in the Holocaust. He opposed the invasion of Iraq by the US in 2003.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYou can certainly recognise that and still see his tenure for what it was: a flawed, imperfect 12 years that paved the way for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s presidency \u2014 something no one can reasonably be thankful for.\n\nAnd so, as someone who came of age in the Chirac-Sarkozy era, I must ask: when will the sudden-onset amnesia that immediately follows the death of a powerful man stop? Chirac, after all, is also the man who (very infamously) referred to the supposed \u201cnoise and smell\u201d of immigrants in a 1991 speech as mayor of Paris (a statement outrageous enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page, in both French and English). He was also found guilty of corruption in 2011 when a Paris court convicted him of misusing public funds and abuse of trust. For context: Chirac was the first former French president to be prosecuted (and convicted) since Philippe P\u00e9tain was found guilty of treason in 1945 after collaborating with the Nazis.\n\nSome might think it distasteful to look back on a person\u2019s least glorious moments at the time of their death. I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect the 2011 conviction or the 1991 speech to be brought up during any private ceremony honouring Chirac\u2019s memory among his friends and family. But as far as public discourse is concerned, we have a duty to acknowledge the full picture, because only by seeing our leaders for who they truly are can we hope to choose them wisely in the future. There is room in our public consciousness for a discussion about a leader's flaws, and it doesn\u2019t have to amount to a full-on \u201cDing dong, the witch is dead\u201d moment.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
