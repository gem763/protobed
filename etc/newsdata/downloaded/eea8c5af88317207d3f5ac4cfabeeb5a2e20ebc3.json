Reid and Associates stems from the Netflix miniseries \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d which dramatizes the case of the so-called Central Park 5, five black and Latino teenagers who were convicted and imprisoned in the brutal beating and rape of a jogger before DNA evidence and another man\u2019s confession exonerated them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe company claims the movie, which depicts the five teens\u2019 coerced confessions, wrongly portrays the method, developed in the 1950s by a former Chicago police officer, as \u201cuniversally rejected.\u201d\n\n\u201cVitally important to the instant case is that the Reid Technique does not involve and prohibits: striking or assaulting a subject, making any promises of leniency, denying a subject any rights, conducting excessively long interrogations, and denying a subject any physical needs,\u201d the suit reads.\n\n\u201cReid also urges that extreme caution and care be taken when interviewing or interrogating juveniles or those with mental impairments,\u201d it says.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites a line in the miniseries equating the method with the teens being subjected to a 40-hour questioning session without food, bathroom access or parental supervision. The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages and for the line in question to be edited out of the program.\n\nCritics of the method have long contended that it lends itself to false confessions. In 2015, Reid & Associates was one of eight organizations to settle with Juan Rivera, a man who was wrongfully convicted of raping a child after an interrogation that included two polygraphs administered at Reid & Associates.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Netflix for comment.", "description": "A lawsuit by the company behind the widely-used \u201cReid technique\u201d of police interrogations is accusing Netflix and filmmaker Ava DuVernay of defamation in their depiction of the method,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/netflix_091414getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
