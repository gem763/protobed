It is generally contracted by herbivores and is a common cause of death for both wild and domestic animals around the world.\n\nThe environment ministry said it would be burning \"anthrax related carcasses\" to prevent the disease from spreading to other animals.\n\nIt warned the public not to touch any animal carcasses they might find and report them to the authorities.", "description": "More than 100 elephants have died in two months in Botswana's Chobe National Park due to drought, which has also affected wildlife in other countries in the region, the government said Tuesday.
