I\u2019m just saying that you can\u2019t rule things out right now because you\u2019ve got to find some way of unblocking the blockage,\u201d said Cameron, in his first interview since he resigned the day after Britons voted in the referendum by 52% to 48% to leave the EU.\n\nBritain has been mired ever since in complex divorce talks with the EU. The country, first under Theresa May and since July under Boris Johnson, who was one of the leading campaigners for Leave in the 2016 vote, remains deeply divided on the issue.\n\nCameron said he worried \u201cdesperately\u201d about what is going to happen next, but defended holding the referendum in 2016 as necessary to achieve a renegotiation of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU.\n\nJohnson says Britain must now leave the EU on Oct. 31 whether or not he reaches an exit deal. But parliament passed a law last week over his objections ordering him to seek an extension if he fails to reach an agreement with the bloc.\n\nJohnson said on Friday there was \u201cthe rough shape of a deal to be done\u201d over Brexit, but Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar played down the prospects, saying the gap between Britain and the EU remained \u201cvery wide\u201d.\n\nIn his interview, Cameron was critical of Johnson\u2019s decision to expel 21 Conservative lawmakers from the party for voting against the government as well as his move to shut down, or prorogue, parliament until mid-October. The decision to suspend parliament is now being challenged in the British courts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t support either of those things,\u201d Cameron said.\n\nHe also said Johnson and Michael Gove, currently the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, and who was also a prominent Leave supporter in the referendum, had \u201cleft the truth at home\u201d during the campaign.", "description": "Former British prime minister David Cameron, who took the decision in 2016 to hold a referendum on the country's membership of the European Union, said another vote may be needed to resolve the Brexit impasse.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429853265&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C261", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
