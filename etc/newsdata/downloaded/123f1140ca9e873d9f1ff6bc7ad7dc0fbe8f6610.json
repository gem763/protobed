He has built successful businesses. It is hard to visit a corner of the Earth without finding a building topped with his name, in 10-foot letters. Not a little of the criticism of him comes from envy at his success, combined with a distaste for his endless bravado. This resentment was magnified hugely by his astounding success in coming from political nowhere to beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and become president of the United States.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn objective assessment might conclude that he has built a better record of results in domestic and foreign policy in three years than his predecessors each achieved in eight years. Arguably, he has made America safer through a stronger defense and achieved real equality and civil rights progress through bringing down the unemployment rates of African American and Hispanic citizens. Women, too, have experienced more economic opportunity.\n\nBut, in the dark of night (or day), Trump often merges with that strange beast, \u201cMr. Tweet\u201d \u2014 a reckless creature who goes well beyond self-congratulatory bravado. No, he careens far more to the dark side, issuing more than 45,000 tweets and associated pronouncements that often spew venom at targets across the world and societal spectrum.\n\nOne recent tweet-threat to apply his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d to \u201cdestroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey\u201d created yet another low standard in diplomacy and international political decorum. Politicians and diplomats across the political spectrum were quick to express puzzlement over his Syria/Turkey strategy and condemn or ridicule his language. Of course, the authoritarian regime of Turkey has taken a hard turn toward Russia, undermining NATO and compromising advanced military technology that the U.S. shared with it, and Trump is on firm ground in taking a tough line with Turkey \u2014 but that strategic positioning gets lost in his Twitter launch.\n\nHe aimed a similar Twitter-tornado at Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff MORE (D-Calif.), calling out his fabricated account of Trump\u2019s Ukraine phone conversation, labeling Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Four companies reach 0M settlement in opioid lawsuit | Deal opens door to larger settlements | House panel to consider vaping tax | Drug pricing markup tomorrow Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him MORE (D-Calif.) as \u201ctraitors\u201d and urging appropriate punishment. While a more thoughtful dissection of the facts might have supported Trump\u2019s case, the tweets again crossed the river Styx and took the country into social media hell.\n\nAnother recent hit was Trump\u2019s quote of a pastor\u2019s comment that impeachment might bring \u201ccivil war.\u201d While a significant portion of the country believes the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push is ill-founded and purely political, the tweet has become an issue of its own as a purported call for widespread violence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost presidents understand that everything from mean caricature to hostile criticism comes with the job and generally needs to be overlooked, or responded to with calm and reason. Even though the media have been more hostile to Trump than perhaps any president in recent history, most advisers would recommend patience and steadiness. Even the hypersensitive Presidents Clinton and Obama let a lot slide.\n\nTrump, however, does not understand or accept any of that. The result, in this social media age, is the most complicated political calculus ever.\n\nTrump has scored domestic and foreign policy successes, while his \u201cMr. Tweet\u201d side has controlled the news cycle; many staunch Republicans are appalled but do not see a more attractive alternative for president. For Democrats, Trump\u2019s success in domestic policy has left little room for thoughtful moderates; advancing traditional liberal policies leaves them open to \u201cit failed under Obama\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve already addressed and solved that problem,\u201d which the strong Trump economy actually has. Looking for air time, Democrats have been forced to the extremes, which may lead to political disaster with a centrist electorate.\n\nOur new age of technology has bred some odd creatures in Silicon Valley and in Washington. To be effective, presidents need to embrace the newest approaches to control the political narrative and move public opinion. In that vein, perhaps history will not think of Trump\u2019s duality as strange at all, but simply as political Darwinism.\n\nGrady Means is a writer and former corporate strategy consultant.
