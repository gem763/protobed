Mayock spoke with assembled media members Thursday, but only for 13 seconds:\n\nHead coach Jon Gruden also didn't provide much information in a Thursday press conference but noted the team has been forced to prepare sans Brown.\n\nOakland's offense may have encountered a difficult contest against the Broncos even with Brown, but it now faces an even taller task to overcome a stout defense led by star edge-rushers Von Miller and Bradley Chubb, who combined for 26.5 sacks last season.\n\nDenver is also led by first-year head coach Vic Fangio, who was the coordinator for the Chicago Bears' No. 1 scoring defense in 2018.\n\nAs for the Raiders' passing attack, Tyrell Williams will move up to the No. 1 spot on the depth chart, and rookie wide receiver Hunter Renfrow figures to see more targets. Wideout J.J. Nelson is another candidate for increased looks, as is starting tight end Darren Waller.\n\nCaesars Palace lists Denver as a two-point road favorite.\n\nOn the latest edition of The Lefkoe Show, Adam Lefkoe is joined by his new weekly gambling co-host Warren Sharp, one of the smartest NFL analysts working today, to break down everything that YOU need to know in order to MAKE MONEY this week and throughout the NFL season.
