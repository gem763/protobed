Members of the group have been subject to mass detentions in what China calls \u201cvocational training\u201d centers and widespread state surveillance.\n\nA website that was hosting the Android tools, meanwhile, had also served malware to Uighur Android phones in an operation exposed this month by security firm Volexity lurking on websites frequented by Uighurs.\n\n\u2018NEXUS WITH CHINA\u2019\n\nThe two spying efforts have now been conclusively linked to each other and to the Tibetan hacks, said lead Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak.\n\n\u201cThis is likely one operator or a small number of operators working closely together,\u201d Marczak said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very clear nexus with China. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s the government, it\u2019s kind of hard to say from a technical point of view. Maybe it\u2019s likely,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Uighur hacks included a \u201cwatering hole\u201d approach, tainting a common internet gathering spot for the targets, that prompted Citizen Lab researches to look for similar infections on sites frequented by the Tibetan community.\n\nThey found none, but a similar watering hole attack on the Tibetans might have escaped their notice.\n\n\u201cThere are bound to be more targets that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Lobsang Gyatso, secretary of TibCERT. He said that the group would use the report to spread awareness of the tactics and promote better defense.\n\nGoogle\u2019s watering hole report alarmed human rights workers and security experts because it included an unusual instance of an iPhone flaw being used to target a broad population, instead of being reserved for high-priority individuals.\n\nOnce used widely, flaws that can fetch as much as $1 million on the digital arms market are likely to be discovered and rendered obsolete with new patches.\n\nThough Tibetans have been targeted by Chinese hackers for many years, Marczak said the new attempts represented a troubling escalation of effort.", "description": "Sophisticated Chinese hackers who used a previously unknown iPhone security flaw to target ethnic minority Uighurs also went after Tibetans in exile, according to a report published on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Joseph Menn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
