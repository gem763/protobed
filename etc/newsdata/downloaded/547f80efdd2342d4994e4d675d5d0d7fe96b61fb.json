They\u2019re going to say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists. So let\u2019s stand up for the right policy, go up there and defend it.\u201d\n\nWell, if you\u2019re a gun-grabber, that\u2019s exactly what Beto\u2019s doing. And if you believe the polling on gun control, most of the party is with him on buybacks. So why shouldn\u2019t they follow the Boot Edge Edge approach to guns by \u201cstanding up for the right policy\u201d and letting the chips fall where they may?\n\nThis is surprising in another way too: Buttigieg has worked hard to present himself as the face of generational left-wing change within the party. That was shaping up to be Beto\u2019s role in the primary until Buttigieg swooped in this past spring and stole his thunder, bouncing out to a steady 5-8 percent in Democratic polling that O\u2019Rourke himself hasn\u2019t approached in months. Beto\u2019s \u201cf*** it, let\u2019s confiscate assault weapons\u201d pitch is an obvious attempt to reclaim some of that thunder by signaling to young lefties that he\u2019ll fight unapologetically for their cultural priorities. You would think that would be Mayor Pete\u2019s cue to go easy on O\u2019Rourke on a question like this, e.g., \u201cI\u2019m not sure America\u2019s ready for a buyback plan yet but I share Beto\u2019s frustrations and want more aggressive action in Congress.\u201d But no, he\u2019s very clear here that he thinks this is a mistake, letting the perfect be the enemy of the good by giving Trump a reason to bail out of gun-control negotiations when there\u2019s at least a glimmer of hope of passing red-flag laws or expanded background checks.\n\nEven stranger, he almost (sort of) credits Trump and McConnell in his answer for engaging on the subject, claiming that they\u2019re at least \u201cpretending\u201d to be interested in it. Rule one of Democratic politics in 2020: Do not credit Trump or McConnell with good faith in anything ever. Not even with \u201cpretending\u201d in good faith. Beto noticed that and slammed Buttigieg in a tweet, writing, \u201cLeaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are \u2018at least pretending to be open to reforms\u2019? That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let\u2019s have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it.\u201d Then for good measure he posted this clip replete with his signature love-your-passion profanity:\n\nWhen candidates say, \"At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,\" shit, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue\u2014and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country. pic.twitter.com/jE2uiXaENZ \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 15, 2019\n\nAll Buttigieg means when he credits Trump and McConnell for \u201cpretending\u201d is that their pretense is evidence that they\u2019re feeling meaningful political pressure to do something on guns. Even Republican leaders seem compelled to pander (a bit) to gun-grabbers right now by holding themselves out as open to proposals. Beto swooping in and demanding confiscation instead of background checks risks blowing that up by giving gun-rights supporters new reason to fear giving an inch to the left, which could kill any small momentum towards compromise. Even the lead sponsor on the House\u2019s assault-weapons-ban bill, Dem Rep. David Cicilline, thinks Beto crapped the bed by taking the extra step towards outright confiscation. If gun-control legislation collapses in Congress, as everyone expects it will, I wonder how much blame Beto will take and whether that\u2019ll kill any polling bounce he may or may not be getting from his call for a buyback.,\n\nAs for Mayor Pete, his caution here may be evidence that he\u2019s turning more realistic about his chances at the nomination. He\u2019s a man of the left but he\u2019s also native to Indiana. If he doesn\u2019t end up in a new Democratic president\u2019s cabinet he\u2019ll be stuck looking for routes to higher office in a reliably red state where gun confiscation would be destined to play poorly. His best opportunity may be to challenge Todd Young for Senate in 2022 *if* Trump wins reelection and the next midterms start shaping up to be even more Democrat-friendly than the last ones did. (That\u2019d still be no guarantee in Indiana; remember that GOP challenger Mike Braun unseated Dem incumbent Joe Donnelly there last year, winning by six points.) A basic prerequisite for a statewide Democratic candidate in Indiana is *not* to be radical on guns, so that\u2019s the box Boot Edge Edge is checking here. On this issue and maybe only on this issue, Beto\u2019s the radical, not Mayor Pete. Maybe Indiana swing voters will remember.", "description": "Backfire.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
