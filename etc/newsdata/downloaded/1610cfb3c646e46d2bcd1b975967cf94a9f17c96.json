He said initial findings suggest the attack was not launched from Yemen, contradicting claims by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that they carried out the attack using a swarm of long-range drones with more sophisticated engines.\n\n\u201cWe are working right now to spot the launch point of those attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attacks caused an unprecedented surge in oil prices and cast a shadow over preparations for the sale of a stake in Saudi Aramco that could be the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t directly blamed Iran for the attacks, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has. Two U.S. officials said the location of the damage and weapons used suggest the attack was not launched by the Houthis, who have been fighting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for four bruising years.\n\nAl-Maliki said evidence of Iranian involvement would be released, without saying when. Iran denied involvement.\n\n\u201cAccusing Iran of the attacks is in line with the U.S.\u2019s maximum-lies policy,\u201d said Abbas Mousavi, spokesman at the foreign ministry in Tehran. \u201cSuch accusations are unsurprising, unacceptable and baseless.\u201d\n\nRussia, a leading Iranian ally in the Middle East, called on countries not to rush to conclusions over who was responsible, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Trump cast doubt on Iran\u2019s denials of responsibility, citing the Islamic Republic\u2019s claim that a U.S. drone shot down over the Persian Gulf in June was actually over Iranian waters.\n\n\u201cRemember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their \u201cairspace\u201d when, in fact, it was nowhere close,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nDuring that incident, Trump said he called off a retaliatory military strike on Iran at the last minute, after learning about potential casualties that he said would be out of proportion to the destruction of a U.S. drone.\n\nYet over the weekend Trump raised the specter of a military confrontation with Iran, saying that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification\u201d that Tehran staged the attack. He then said he\u2019d wait for Saudi comments on who was responsible.\n\nThere were a total of 19 impact points at the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility at Abqaiq and at an oil field in Khurais, and equipment used in the incidents that\u2019s been recovered so far was inconsistent with the Houthi claims, the U.S. officials said. The Houthis had said they used unmanned aerial vehicles in the attack.\n\nOil posted its biggest ever intraday jump, briefly surging above $71 a barrel after the strike removed about 5% of global supplies and raised the specter of more destabilization in the region.\n\nThe U.S. president promised to help allies following the attacks, saying he\u2019d do so despite America not being as reliant on Middle East oil. The crisis comes as Trump\u2019s White House operates without a national security adviser. John Bolton, who had the post, was dismissed last week.\n\nThe Houthis on Monday said oil installations in Saudi Arabia remained a target for weapons that could reach anywhere in the kingdom.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Saudi regime that our long hand can reach wherever we want, and whenever we want,\u201d Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement. \u201cWe warn companies and foreigners not to be present in the facilities that were hit in the strikes because they are still within range and may be targeted at any moment.\u201d\n\nDifficult Choice\n\nThe Trump administration and Saudi leaders now face a difficult choice in how to respond to Iran or its proxies without triggering a broader conflict that could spiral out of control with potentially devastating consequences for global oil markets and the world economy. Neither country has tipped its hand.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia said preliminary findings show Iranian weapons were used in the attack on one of its key oil installations, but stopped short of directly blaming the Islamic Republic for the strikes that cut its crude output by half and rattled oil markets.Ongoing investigations of \u201cdebris", "authors": ["Vivian Nereim", "Abbas Al Lawati", "Bill Faries"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EstoepxGrF2AZU57AwSZdA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/bloomberg_politics_video_969/eb5a0ff536d53feb4ac59793bdc100ec", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
