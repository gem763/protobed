It records the names of family members of a household surnamed Li who were killed in war. The surviving members of the family buried the deceased and set up the epitaph. At the end of the epitaph, the names of all the victims were listed.\n\nThe unusual form of burial recorded in the epitaph reflects the chaos and social instability caused by war in the early Northern Song Dynasty, said Wan Wenli with the provincial epigraphy association.\n\nIt provides a significant reference for further research on the history, local customs, social conditions and local culture in the early Northern Song Dynasty, Wan said.", "description": "An epitaph dating back over 1,000 years has been found in Linxi County in north China's Hebei Province, local authorities said Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/29/5db7893fa310cf3e97a3517e.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
