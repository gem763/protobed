The measure stands at -8.1 in Q3 2019, down more than six points compared to the same period last year.\n\nLong-term planning for small businesses was hit in the last survey: Exports and investment plans both dropped, while hiring intentions also fell\n\nMeanwhile, small business owners continue to put investment plans on hold with only one in four planning to increase theirs this quarter \u2013 the lowest proportion in five years.\n\nSome 14 per cent of survey respondents are planning to actively decrease investment, up two percentage points compared to this time last year.\n\nBut it is firms that do business internationally that have been hit the hardest by uncertainty caused by the current political and economic landscape.\n\nOnly 25 per cent of small business owners reported an increase in exports over the past three months, the lowest proportion in five years.\n\nLong-term planning in general was hit as in addition to the impact on exports and investment, hiring intentions also plummeted.\n\nHowever, fewer than one in seven (13 per cent) small employers is planning to take on additional staff in the next three months, the lowest proportion since Q4 2017.\n\nMike Cherry, chairman of the FSB, said: 'These findings must serve as an urgent wake-up call for policymakers. Even in the aftermath of the financial crash, we didn't see such a sustained string of negative confidence readings. Three years of political uncertainty and rising costs have stifled output and left small firms unable to plan, invest and grow.\n\n'There's a real sense of exasperation among small firms. Big decisions \u2013 whether that be taking on new staff, purchasing machinery or embarking on sales in a new country \u2013 are being put on hold because we have no idea what our trading environment will look like in less than four weeks' time.\n\n'And what's worse, two thirds of those who would be negatively impacted by a no-deal scenario say they can't prepare for it.'\n\nCherry explained we are now in the final chance period for getting a Brexit deal and that the Government must seize this final opportunity.\n\nMike Cherry, chairman of the FSB said the Government must seize the final chance for a getting a Brexit deal\n\nBudget should aim to reverse uncertainty\n\nCherry called on the Chancellor to come forward with an ambitious Budget aimed at reversing the impacts of uncertainty.\n\n'He must throw lifelines to the small exporters that are especially hamstrung,' he added. 'Direct financial assistance \u2013 such as \u00a33,000 Brexit vouchers \u2013 to enable access to expertise and support would mark a much-needed step forward.'\n\nMeanwhile almost all small business owners - 93 per cent - said operating costs were either stable or rising while two thirds say costs have risen over the past 12 months.\n\nThe most frequently cited causes of this increase are labour, flagged by 40 per cent of firms, as well as inputs at 31 per cent, utilities at 29 per cent, fuel at 24 per cent and regulation 23 per cent.\n\nCherry added: 'The Chancellor must compile a Budget which alleviates the impacts of rising operating costs, rather than simply adds to them. That means uprating the \u00a33,000 discount on national insurance bills for small employers offered through the employment allowance and reintroducing a statutory sick pay rebate.\n\n'Support with the costs of transport \u2013 especially fuel \u2013 and business rates would also help to reinject some optimism into a small business community that's been held back by uncertainty for years now.\n\n'Sole traders are also crying out for support in this unpredictable climate. Now is not the time to blindly push on with IR35 changes billed for April.'", "description": "The Federation of Small Businesses has revealed confidence in the sector has been at its longest low, for nine years, while half of small business owners expect poor near-term performance.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
