Last week Silver claimed the Chinese government had asked him to fire Rockets general manager Daryl Morey over his tweet about Hong Kong:\n\nThe Chinese government asked the N.B.A. to fire a team executive who posted on social media in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, the league\u2019s commissioner, Adam Silver, said on Thursday in his first public appearance in the United States since returning from a contentious trip to Asia. \u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nChina denied having made that request on Friday and on Saturday, state TV said his statement was a lie and that he had crossed a line:\n\n\u201cSilver has spared no effort to portray himself as a fighter for free speech and used freedom of speech as an excuse to cover for Morey, who voiced his support for the violent actors in Hong Kong,\u201d it said. \u201cThis has crossed the bottom line of the Chinese people.\u201d Silver\u2019s handling of the controversy had proved his \u201cdouble standards\u201d, the broadcaster said, adding that he had \u201cdefamed\u201d China on the international stage. \u201cTo please some American politicians, Silver has fabricated lies out of nothing and has sought to paint China as unforgiving,\u201d it said. The way in which the NBA boss had defended Morey showed he had \u201cproblems in his character\u201d, the report said, adding that he \u201cwill receive retribution sooner or later\u201d.\n\nThe NY Times reports that Chinese state TV also reinforced the official position on free speech, which is that it\u2019s not to be used willy nilly: \u201cFreedom of speech does not mean that it can be arbitrary nonsense.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s funny that the Chinese see Silver as a great defender of free speech because his reaction to this entire episode has been less than inspiring. Granted, Silver has defended free speech in principle but he also seems to have muzzled most of his outspoken players and coaches who have suddenly had nothing but nothing to say about the underlying issue except that they need to educate themselves on China\u2019s history.\n\nIn fact, LeBron James\u2019 comment about the free speech last week could have been dropped into the state TV commentary on Adam Silver: \u201c\u2026just be careful what we tweet, what we say, what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, there can be a lot of negative that comes from that.\u201d In other words, no arbitrary nonsense!\n\nThis report is more than 18 months old but it shows the desire to limit free speech isn\u2019t limited to China or woke NBA stars these days. I suspect these student protesters think they support free speech too, just not when it harms the collective good. That\u2019s exactly what Chinese state TV is saying.", "description": "\"Freedom of speech does not mean that it can be arbitrary nonsense.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Adam-Silver-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
