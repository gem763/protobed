Details at the edges such as cows, houses and faces, had been tinkered with, moved or redone.\n\nChagall, who was born in 1887 in a village in what is now Belarus, left for Paris in 1910, weathered World War I in Russia, returned to Paris and then fled World War II for New York in the 1940s, before returning to France and working until his death in 1985.\n\nThroughout his long career, he overlapped with Impressionists, Cubists, Supremacists, Surrealists and many other schools along the way, but he retained his own whimsical style. Often described as dreamlike, his paintings featured recurring themes including his wife, memories from his childhood such as cows, donkeys and milkmaids, and scenes of Jewish life.\n\nUntil now, his work had not been as widely researched by art historians as bigger names of the 20th century. The full findings of the research done by the team at the Stedelijk will be published in a German academic journal next month.", "description": "Marc Chagall, the 20th century French-Russian artist who delighted fans with his vividly coloured, whimsical works, did many of his paintings using the same nine pigments - and hardly ever used black, researchers said on Friday.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429495893&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1Q5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
