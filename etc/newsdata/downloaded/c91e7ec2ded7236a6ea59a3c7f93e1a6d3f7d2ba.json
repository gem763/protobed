(Amr Nabil/AP)\n\nThe attack was brazen in its aim and execution, targeting some of the world\u2019s most vital oil infrastructure with a barrage of missiles and drones and potentially inviting a fierce American response.\n\nBut for Iran, which U.S. officials believe staged the weekend assault on Saudi oil facilities, the gamble of such a mission may have been worth the risk.\n\nTehran denies playing a role in the blitz, which crippled Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output. But analysts say Iran likely wanted to test a key adversary and jolt global energy markets, building leverage ahead of potential talks with the United States.\n\nIran\u2019s leaders may have bet that President Trump, wary of Middle East conflicts, would decline to respond with force and that the crisis instead might prompt world powers to intervene \u2014 and push the United States to lift its crippling economic sanctions on Tehran, according to analysts.\n\nNow Iran, facing an economic crisis, appears to have raised the stakes. It is a strategy, analysts say, that reflects the hardening stance of Iran\u2019s rulers.\n\n\u201cIranian elites have tacked to a harder-line, more risk-acceptant policy. . . . Iranian policy changed from \u2018wait out Trump\u2019 to \u2018shoot back at Trump,\u2019 \u201d said Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East research at the political risk firm Eurasia Group. \u201cThe bold policy does not mean Iran wants war,\u201d he said, adding that Tehran maintains \u201crespect for and fear of U.S. military power.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cit does mean that moving forward, Iran won\u2019t shy away from the edge of the envelope.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s new policy seeks to inflict pain on U.S. allies and showcase Iranian power, analysts say, but without stoking a direct conflict with the United States.\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials have concluded that weaponized drones and guided cruise missiles, possibly fired from Iranian territory, evaded the kingdom\u2019s air defenses to carry out precision strikes against oil installations belonging to the Saudi oil giant, Aramco. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who are allied with Iran, claimed responsibility, though U.S. and Saudi officials say they lack the capability to carry out such a complex attack.\n\nAccording to Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, Iran may have been emboldened by Trump\u2019s reluctance to take military action against Tehran in June, when Iran downed a U.S. Navy spy drone over the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nTrump ordered, then called off, a military strike on Iranian targets, saying the response would have been disproportionate.\n\n\u201cTrump is not willing to start a military attack against Iran,\u201d Naser Imani, a former member of the political bureau of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, wrote in the conservative news outlet Alef this week.\n\nThe most recent escalation in Persian Gulf violence came, perhaps ironically, just after John Bolton, one of the strongest White House voices for confrontation with Iran, was forced to resign as Trump\u2019s national security adviser.\n\nWith the Houthi rebels claiming responsibility for the weekend strikes, Tehran may have been hoping to have plausible deniability, analysts say.\n\n[Billions spent on U.S. weapons didn\u2019t protect Saudi Arabia\u2019s most critical oil sites from attack]\n\n\u201cIt does not matter where the drones came from. What matters is that the expensive Saudi antiaircraft systems could not stop a group of drones from targeting one of their most important facilities,\u201d Imani wrote. \u201cThe advanced American weapons could not guarantee their security.\u201d\n\nFor more than a year, since Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and world powers, Tehran has calibrated its response to ramped up U.S. pressure. The agreement had aimed to restrict Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions, declaring a near-total embargo on the Iranian economy.\n\nIran has encouraged European nations who are also signatories to the deal to help offset the financial impact of the U.S. withdrawal. But as Europe faltered and Iran\u2019s oil sales plummeted, Tehran changed tack in the spring, warning it would begin reducing its commitments under the nuclear agreement.\n\nSince then, Iran has taken ever bolder action, including boosting its uranium enrichment and harassing oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Over the summer, the United States blamed Iran for a string of explosions targeting commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf \u2014 a charge Iranian officials deny.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018art\u2019 of this sort of escalation revolves around staying just below certain thresholds for your adversary\u2019s use of force,\u201d Taleblu said of Iran\u2019s apparent strategy.\n\nAt each juncture, however, the risk of miscalculation grows, he said.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, Iran appears to have achieved most of its objectives,\u201d said Ali Alfoneh, senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. These include strengthening its negotiating position with the United States, displaying its power in the region and, potentially, showing Saudi Arabia that the United States would not come to its aid in a meaningful way.\n\nAs a result, he said, Tehran \u201cis likely to engage in riskier maneuvers in an attempt to persuade Washington to remove the sanctions regime.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nIran warns U.S. of \u2018all-out war\u2019 if attacked\n\nPompeo calls attacks on Saudi oil facilities \u2018act of war\u2019 as Trump orders increase in sanctions on Iran\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Iran may have wanted to jolt global energy markets and win leverage ahead of any negotiations, analysts say.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h-QbYvPLVNAiTlrcRQI3aAw2hlA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DPM5HMG3AEI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
