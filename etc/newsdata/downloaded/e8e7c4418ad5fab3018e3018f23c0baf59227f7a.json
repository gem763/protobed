Bush, and Walter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, respectively described Thursday\u2019s announcement by acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cthe most overt corruption to date.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not only self-dealing, this is a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution which specifically provides that a person holding a position of trust with the U.S. government cannot accept any profits or benefits from foreign governments,\u201d Painter told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cWe have had him violating the emoluments clause since day one and now he\u2019s going out and openly asking foreign governments to subsidize his resorts in connection with the G-7,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s got his hand out to foreign governments and if this Congress puts up with that, they are to blame as well.\u201d\n\nCheck out the clip here:\n\n\"This is not only self-dealing, this is a violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution,\" says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, about the Trump administration's plan to host the 2020 G7 summit at the President's resort in Doral, Florida. pic.twitter.com/P0S111nUGk \u2014 CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) October 18, 2019\n\nShaub, meanwhile, who served under President Barack Obama and resigned from his position six months into the Trump administration, vented his anger on Twitter via multiple posts.\n\n\u201cHow any Senator could fail to object to this is beyond me,\u201d he wrote in one tweet. \u201cThere\u2019s no universe in which anyone could believe that, in a country as big as ours, the selection of Trump\u2019s resort was anything but a product of the worst kind of corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is so overtly corrupt that it can\u2019t be viewed as anything but a loyalty test for Senators,\u201d Shaub said in another. \u201cIf they are corrupt enough to look the other way, Trump will know he can do anything. In that case, he will do everything.\u201d\n\nShaub also said it was \u201ca red line crossed\u201d and that \u201cwe have reached the bottom.\u201d \u201cIf the Senate will not act to stop this, there is no government ethics program,\u201d he posted. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nRead Shaub\u2019s tweets in full below:\n\nThis is the most overt corruption to date. How any Senator could fail to object to this is beyond me. There's no universe in which anyone could believe that, in a country as big as ours, the selection of Trump's resort was anything but a product of the worst kind of corruption. https://t.co/bntG2ozeti \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nCorrect! It's also a very serious violation of federal procurement laws. https://t.co/coLZgSaKh3 \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nSomebody please ask the White House what agency ran this procurement. The White House does not have a procurement team that could run this, and it definitely does not have an appropriation to use for the event. https://t.co/LCovrV2dJU \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nThis is exactly right. This is so overtly corrupt that it can't be viewed as anything but a loyalty test for Senators. If they are corrupt enough to look the other way, Trump will know he can do anything. In that case, he will do everything. https://t.co/Sh0TgK6RdY \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nIf you work in a domed building in the nation's capital, you will either call this G-7 deal corrupt or your silence will scream out your own corruption. pic.twitter.com/kJp08HPLEe \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nIn case it's not clear from my freaking out, this G-7 thing is an escalation. It may look from the outside like it's been corruption all along\u2014because it has been\u2014but participating in a contract award to yourself is different by orders of magnitude. This is a red line crossed. \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nIf Trump were covered by the criminal conflict of interest law, this would be an open and shut case. https://t.co/S7Sa5eJQhh \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nMulvaney is subject to @OfficeGovEthics regs that say \u201cEmployees shall not use public office for private gain\u201d and \u201cact impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.\u201d What is left of the executive branch ethics program if this is ok? https://t.co/HcEqjc5Pxx \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nIn addition to @MickMulvaneyOMB, every White House official who participated in this sham procurement violated @OfficeGovEthics regulations barring misuse of position. If they can do this with impunity, how can lower level employees be held to a higher standard? \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nI'd like you to imagine a conflict of interest prosecution in which a defense attorney's closing argument is based on the things Mick Mulvaney said in defense of awarding the G7 contract to Doral. That attorney would be disbarred. The arguments are ridiculous. \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\n.@ChuckGrassley: Oversight, enforcement and transparency are vital tools to fight fraud & wasteful govt spending.@MickMulvaneyOMB: I don\u2019t talk about how this place runs on the inside. So if you want to see our paper on how we did [the G7 award], the answer is absolutely not. \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nahem \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nFederal Acquisition Reg. \u00a7 1.102-2(c)(1) An essential consideration in every aspect of the [Acquisition] System is maintaining the public\u2019s trust.

My prediction is that they won't be procurement officials after the Trump administration. \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 17, 2019\n\nI'm so angry about the Doral corruption that I can barely see straight and I have to get up early, so I'm going to bed.

There is no level of corruption greater than a President participating in the award of a contract to himself. We have reached the bottom. If the Senate will not act to stop this, there is no government ethics program.
