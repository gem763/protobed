The snub happened after the Giants lost to the Cowboys during the first week of the season.\n\nDALLAS COWBOYS' DEMARCUS LAWRENCE RESPONDS TO BACKLASH OVER SNUBBING YOUNG NEW YORK GIANTS FAN\n\nThe running back invited the fan and will fly him and his family out for a meet-and-greet, TMZ Sports reported Saturday. The game takes place Nov. 10.\n\nKamil was waiting outside AT&T Stadium last week and asked Lawrence for an autograph when the Cowboys star was walking to his vehicle. The short interaction was caught on video and went viral on social media.\n\nLawrence can be heard telling the unidentified kid, \u201cGet the right jersey, son!\u201d Kamil was wearing a Barkley jersey in the clip.\n\nSEATTLE SEAHAWKS' RUSSELL WILSON TAKES HUGE HIT TO HELMET DURING GAME\n\nLawrence received significant backlash for his actions. The Cowboys player responded in his own words in a tweet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how you fans want to attack me for not signing for a kid. It\u2019s more than one kid that come to the game with Cowboys jerseys and never get to meet any player. So if I\u2019m honest with my own kids I will never treat your kid better than mine so suck it up. #SorryNotSorry\u201d\n\nLawrence later apologized in an interview with the Dallas Morning-News.\n\n\u201cIt hurt. That ain't me. If I need to be me 24/7 to have my persona on the field and off the field, trust me, I would love to take it all back,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI can\u2019t have my persona on the field and off the field. ... Sometimes, I can\u2019t click it off fast enough. I ain\u2019t even get one hit on Saquon Barkley in the game, so seeing that jersey, I kinda wanted to give him a little tackle.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLawrence added he regretted the whole interaction.\n\n\u201cHow the fans are attacking me, their situation,\u201d he said \u201cI mean, I could have worded it differently. I really didn\u2019t see the kid to be honest with you, but once I did, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh man, yeah, you\u2019ve got to get yourself a new jersey.\u2019 Not everybody understands my sense of humor or who I am as a man. It will be all right.\u201d", "description": "New York Giants star Saquon Barkley lifted the spirits of a young fan who was denied an autograph from Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
