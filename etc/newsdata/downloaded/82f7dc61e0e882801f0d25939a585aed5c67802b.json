He was surrounded by a lot of knife-wielding delinquents and hardened criminals-in-the-making. But he always turned up early at school. And he always did his homework. And he never got individual detention either. He still has the certificates at home to prove it. He\u2019s got stacks of GCSE\u2019s and A-levels.\n\nAmazingly, he managed to keep out of harm\u2019s way. How? \u201cIt\u2019s all a question of anticipating trouble before it hits you. You have to spot patterns of behaviour. I learned that early on.\u201d Now, aged 37, as CEO and co-founder of Quantexa, he has made a career out of spotting patterns of behaviour \u2013 or misbehaviour \u2013 around the world.\n\nHis father came by boat from India in 1961 and landed in England with only one shilling in his pocket, but worked 20-hour days to acquire a number of cash-and-carry shops across London. \u201cWhile other kids went home from school,\u201d says Marria, \u201cI went to the cash-and-carry.\u201d He started work aged six or seven, stacking shelves and talking to customers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe went on to take a first-class degree in computer science at Royal Holloway, part of the University of London, and a master\u2019s with distinction. He joined BAE Systems and then became, at 28, the youngest ever director at Ernst and Young. It was when he working on \u201ccompliance\u201d with Ernst and Young (which effectively means \u201cnon-compliance\u201d: if everyone complied in the first place you wouldn\u2019t need compliance), that he had his big insight.\n\n\u201cI was consulting with banks like HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. What I realised is they were all trying to make decisions based on a small amount of data. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house by looking through the letter box, would you?\u201d Marria argues, quite reasonably, that if you\u2019re buying a house you walk through the door and check out the kitchen and the bathroom and all the bedrooms. And then you check out the local crime rate and the schools too. It\u2019s what he calls \u201cinternal context\u201d and \u201cexternal context\u201d.\n\nThe same applies if you\u2019re trying to track down the bad guys. Those who are not big on compliance. We are no longer, \u00e0 la Sherlock Holmes, looking for the footprint in the flowerbed, not even fingerprints or DNA. Individuals are good at concealing their identities. But if nearly all crime is now a conspiracy, criminals can be exposed at the level of the network. Quantexa \u2013 founded 3 years and 7 months ago \u2013 offers to connect the dots to nail fraudsters, money launderers, and human traffickers. The name Quantexa, the founder explains, contains \u201cquantitative analytics\u201d and \u201cexabyte\u201d i.e. a quintillion bytes.\n\nI was consulting with banks like HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. What I realised is they were all trying to make decisions based on a small amount of data. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house by looking through the letter box, would you?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about relationships\u201d, says Marria, and gives a simple example. Suppose 4 people in a single vehicle are claiming for whiplash injuries from an insurance company. Which could amount to around \u00a330,000. If you look only at the details of the individual claims, then it might well appear legitimate. Whiplash is practically impossible to disprove. It could be genuine. But when you see multiple claims coming from individuals whose names differ very slightly, but all using the same credit cards and the same bank accounts, then you can start to think in terms of a crash-for-cash scam. \u201cYou have to look at a lot of different signals \u2013 patterns show up in the data. If I look for one person I won\u2019t see it. We\u2019re looking for the gang.\u201d\n\nVishal Marria bought his first property at the age of 18, but he still lives at the same house in south London that he grew up in. He makes tea with his father first thing in the morning (he has his tea English-style, his father has some more complicated Indian-style tea, involving spices and a lot of boiling, plus milk and sugar, and half-hour meditation), and he takes his daughter to school. Then he drives along the same road he used to walk to go to school, and comes to work and sets about investigating sex or drug trafficking, for example.\n\nMarria is a crime fighter, working with insurance companies, banks and government, but it\u2019s nothing like Hawaii 5-0 or Morse. The one thing that connects all the crimes he mentions is financial transactions. They all involve money changing hands.\n\nHe gives me an example of the kind of data network involved in sex trafficking. There are a lot of micro alarm bells that can be set off: males associating, aged between 30 and 50 years; young females, typically of the same nationality. But a \u201cmacro risk score\u201d is triggered by the connection with \u201cunusual travel\u201d and \u201chigh-risk payment patterns\u201d. In effect, organised crime leaves discernible traces, like tracks in the snow, and his job is to establish the links. \u201cEveryone leaves a footprint, from going to work to committing a crime.\u201d\n\nA whole bundle of data sets can be relevant, from names and telephone numbers to corporate registry data. But it\u2019s not all about quantity of data, in the end. \u201cYou can have all the data in the world,\u201d says Marria. \u201cBut there is a point beyond which you don\u2019t need more information. You have enough. Your system can still pick out an event.\u201d Which is when the AI sends a message: \u201cDear human, this is a case worth investigating.\u201d Marria says that they don\u2019t knock on the door in pursuing criminals, but they do provide the intelligence. \u201cWhen you knock on the door to arrest someone you need to know who is in the house.\u201d\n\nAt some point Marria realised that in capturing all this data about large populations, \u201cwe can identify good customers as well as the bad guys\u201d. So Quantexa can pick out the compliers from the non-compliers. It awards certificates for the kids who play by the rules and do their homework as well as handing out detentions.", "description": "Young Vishal Marria went to \u201cthe roughest school in south London\u201d.
