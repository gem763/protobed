Time\n\nGuacamole and avocado toast lovers, you're in for a treat.\n\nA family in Hawaii has claimed the title of world's heaviest avocado, with their fruit weighing in at a whopping 5.6 pounds.\n\nThat's about 18 times heavier than the weight of a typical avocado, which weighs a little more than 5 ounces.\n\nThe Pokini family from the island of Maui told the Maui News that they received their Guinness World Records certificate validating the achievement this week after they applied in December.\n\n\"We were excited,\" Juliane Pokini told the newspaper Wednesday. \"But at the same time, we were, like, finally. It was such a long wait.\"\n\nThe family's accomplishment was recently verified and recorded in the Guinness World Records database, spokesperson Rachel Gluck confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\n\"When the Pokini\u2019s avocado tree started unexpectedly producing large fruit, they decided to attempt the Guinness World Records title to show everyone that Hawaii produces amazing avocados,\" the Guinness World Records entry online says.\n\nA family in Hawaii has claimed the title of world's heaviest avocado, with their fruit weighing in at a whopping 5.6 pounds.

We even gave some away.\"\n\nThe family is already watching their tree for another big avocado this year.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter: @RyanW_Miller\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/11/avocado-hawaii-claims-guinness-world-record-heaviest/3944563002/", "description": "A family in Hawaii has claimed the title of world's heaviest avocado, with their fruit weighing in at a whopping\u00a05.6 pounds.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
