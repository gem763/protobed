Clark will remain in the Bay Area, looking at earlier-stage opportunities alongside Herrod, while Sagan and Maloney handle later-stage deals from GC\u2019s Boston location.\n\nTo find out a bit more, we talked late last week with Clark \u2014 who\u2019d previously spent two years in the C-suite at SAP and 20 years with Microsoft before that \u2014 to learn why now is the right time to become an investor, and what he\u2019s particularly interested in seeing.\n\nTC: You\u2019ve worked informally with GC for a number of years. Is that right?\n\nQC: Yes, I was in Seattle for a long time. I moved down here five years ago and was introduced to a bunch of great folks in the venture community, including Hemant Taneja [of GC] and Reid Hoffman and I spent time with different investments in their portfolios, helping to advise them and investing and that kind of stuff. After I left SAP [in August 2016], I spent a year with GC engaging with a bunch of things in its portfolio.\n\nTC: So becoming a VC was something you were considering.\n\nQC: It was something I was considering long term, but Dropbox gave me this amazing opportunity to join them in this operational role that I couldn\u2019t turn down, and working with [CEO] Drew [Houston] is now one of the highlights of my career.\n\nTC: They must be very different, Dropbox and SAP. How would you characterize your experiences inside both companies?\n\nQC: It isn\u2019t often you get to help pivot something as impactful as what\u2019s happening at Dropbox. We did [Dropbox\u2019s] User Conference [event in late in September], and we launched Dropbox Spaces, which is a fundamental pivot based on a point of view about what the workplace is like and where the pain points are, and you don\u2019t get to do things like that very often. The last time I got to do something that significant was at Microsoft, migrating from on-premises to Azure and rebuilding the entire product portfolio to be entirely cloud-based.\n\nTo have your hands that deeply in the work is rare. At SAP, it\u2019s a very, very large organization, with a very large portfolio, and you don\u2019t personally dig in that deeply in terms of your ability to take an individual product and [change it into something else].\n\nTC: How long ago did you start investing?\n\nQC: I wasn\u2019t investing at Microsoft. There\u2019s now a much bigger tech scene [in Seattle] than five years ago. I really started exploring when I moved.\n\nTC: You\u2019re now going to be working as an enterprise-focused investor. But what, more specifically, interests you?\n\nQC: I\u2019m interested in healthcare. I\u2019m interested in how people navigate their careers. But mostly, I\u2019m business-to-business focused. I think the next generation of enterprise software will help people excel in the work, through machine intelligence, the cloud, the evolution and maturity of the devices we carry. I think this wave we\u2019ve seen with the consumer space will impact the enterprise space more deeply, so I\u2019ll be looking for larger-scale impact on how people [manage] their day to day.\n\nTC: Are you at all nervous about getting up to speed?\n\nQC: I feel very well-supported. There\u2019s a lot of teamwork at GC, so they won\u2019t leave me out there to do this myself. This is literally a venture business, though. I am going to make decisions that 100% of them won\u2019t pan out, but that\u2019s part of finding success. My hesitancy will be around whether I\u2019m investing enough, not whether I\u2019m investing in the wrong things \u2014 at least, initially. But I do have 25 years of judgment that I can apply. I\u2019ve been making investment choices in my career for a long time and seeing bets through and making them successful. That gives me confidence that I can exercise good judgment in this new role, too.", "description": "Quentin Clark resigned a couple of weeks ago as the CTO of Dropbox at the same time that the storage company announced two other execs \u2014 Bharat Mediratta and Tim Young \u2014 were joining its leadership team in Clark\u2019s stead.
