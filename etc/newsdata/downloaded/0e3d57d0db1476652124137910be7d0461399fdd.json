They got a pathway to regular employment for temporary workers. They defended their healthcare\u201d when GM was seeking to sharply increase the premiums the United Automobile Workers (UAW) members paid.\n\nRelated: \u2018We\u2019re organizing to improve lives\u2019: New York fast-food workers push to unionize\n\nThe GM workers also received an $11,000 signing bonus, and the automaker agreed to essentially end its two-tier wage system by folding the lower tier into the top tier within four years. All those workers, lower-tier and top, will earn $32 an hour at contract\u2019s end \u2013 some lower-tier workers now earning less than $20 an hour.\n\nDziczek added that the UAW failed to win any additional job security measures and failed to achieve one of its primary goals: reopening an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The union did, however, persuade GM to reverse plans to close its Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which had been scheduled to close in January. GM plans to invest $3bn in overhauling that plant.\n\n\u201cThey [the UAW] got a pretty hefty contract,\u201d Dziczek said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will discourage strikes.\u201d\n\nMore Americans engaged in work stoppages last year than in any year since 1986 \u2013 485,000 workers participated in strikes or other work stoppages. That surge of collective action continue this year.\n\nIn addition to the GM strike \u2013 the longest nationwide strike against GM since 1970 \u2013 there has been a week-long strike by 30,000 Los Angeles school teachers last January, an 11-day walkout by 31,000 Stop & Shop grocery workers in in New England in April and the ongoing strike by 25,000 educators in Chicago, now in its second week. And last Friday, 3,500 UAW members ended their 12-day strike against six Mack Truck facilities in three states.\n\nArt Wheaton, an auto industry expert at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the huge public support that the GM strikers received will encourage other union leaders to consider walkouts.\n\n\u201cPublic support for the UAW from the community was overwhelming \u2013 GM vastly underestimated the public support,\u201d Wheaton said. \u201cWhether you want to attribute it to the UAW or the teachers\u2019 strikes, I think we\u2019ll continue to have a lot of strikes as long as the labor market is so tight and the jobless rate is so low. People feel if they go on strike and lose their job, they can at least find another job.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders stands in solidarity with striking UAW workers in Hamtramck, Michigan, in September.

UAW members voted 57% to 43% to ratify the contract, indicating that many workers didn\u2019t think the settlement was an out-and-out victory.\n\nNonetheless, national labor leaders hailed the agreement.\n\n\u201cUAW members stood together to win the fair treatment that they\u2019ve earned over years of selfless sacrifice,\u201d said Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO\u2019s president, referring to the pay freeze and other concessions that GM workers agreed to a decade ago to help lift their company out of bankruptcy reorganization. \u201cThis is the latest victory in a wave of collective action happening across America. Working people won\u2019t allow greed to dictate our lives.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "More Americans engaged in work stoppages last year than since 1986 \u2013 and the successful GM strike may encourage other union leaders, experts say  UAW workers stay form by the fire as they picket the GM plant in Wentzville, Montana.
