It's hard to even talk to your friends.\n\n\"And because there's lots of arteries that go to the brain, because my neck moves too much, it can press and trap the arteries. It can stop the blood going to the brain.\"\n\nBeth was very sporty as a teenager before she fell ill with KLS, and had a lot of muscle mass, which Janine thinks helped to 'hold her body together' and mask the fact she had EDS.\n\n(Image: Beth Goodier)\n\nBut spending long periods confined to bed had caused Beth's muscles to deteriorate, and as a result the EDS is now having a catastrophic impact on her health.\n\nIn the past, when she wasn't having a KLS episode, Beth was able to carry on with life as normal, and could go to the gym and see her friends.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, her health has deteriorated so much because of EDS that she now has to rely on a wheelchair, can't sit up for long, is in severe pain every day and rarely leaves the house.\n\n\"It's affected Beth. It's affected her a lot,\" says Janine.\n\n(Image: Beth Goodier)\n\n\"The most serious part is what's happening with her spine, it's unstable. That's a problem anywhere in the spine but the neck is the worst place it could happen.\n\n\"The impact on her life is huge. Before she deteriorated with the EDS, she'd have her episodes of KLS, but outside of that, she'd be able to go to the gym, or out with friends.\n\n\"She could live as normal a life as possible.\n\n\"Now, especially in the past year, she has just deteriorated. It's actually unbelievable the person she was, her life, to what it is now.\n\n(Image: Beth Goodier)\n\n\"She not often out of bed. During episodes, she's in bed anyway, but even now, outside of episodes she's in bed.\"\n\nBeth urgently needs life-saving surgery to fuse her spine, and without it, her condition will only continue to deteriorate, putting her life at risk.\n\nBecause carrying out surgery on people with EDS can be extremely complicated, the family has struggled to find a surgeon in the UK who is able to do it.\n\nInstead, they are now facing the mammoth task of raising \u00a3100,000, so Beth can go to Spain to be treated by a neurosurgeon who specialises in the condition.\n\n(Image: Beth Goodier)\n\n\"I've not even got a choice with this (surgery)\" added Beth.\n\n\"I need it because it's life threatening and it'll just get worse and worse and I'm scared it will get to a point where it's irreversible damage.\n\n\"If I have a stroke and survive it, that could do damage that's irreversible forever\".\n\n\"It's vital that she has it done as soon as she possibly can,\" added Janine.\n\n(Image: Beth Goodier)\n\n\"The deterioration can be terrible, and we don't like to think about where that might end.\n\n\"We know her brain is sagging. We know she could wake up one morning and find she's had a stroke.\n\n\"At the moment it's just a huge amount of money to raise and we don't know how it's going to be achieved.\n\n\"The only way I can think is to try to get the message out there, try to reach as many people as possible.\"\n\n\"There will be times when I won't go downstairs for a week, or won't go outside for a month\", Beth added.\n\n\"Even if I don't have a stroke, the life I have now, I'm not living. I can't just live a normal life. I'm alive but not living\".\n\nBeth's fundraising page can be found here .", "description": "Beth Goodier, from Stockport, has Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS), a condition that affects just a handful of people worldwide", "authors": ["Helen Johnson", "Image", "Beth Goodier"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738381.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_beth12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
