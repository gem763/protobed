Johnson said further delay was \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nThe initial reaction from other European capitals was cool. Berlin and Paris said they were awaiting details.\n\nEU diplomats and officials in Brussels were less polite with one calling the reported proposals \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s take it or leave it, we better close the book and start talking about the modalities of an extension,\u201d a senior EU official told Reuters.\n\n\u201cEssentially it is a non-runner,\u201d said another EU diplomat.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a final Brexit offer to the European Union on Wednesday and said that unless the bloc compromised, Britain would leave without a deal at the end of this month.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436225867&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910X2"}
