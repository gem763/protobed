It\u2019s hard to imagine it\u2019s been 25 entire years (a quarter century!) since such a gem was introduced to the public. Once maligned as one of the worst video-game movies ever made, it\u2019s now still maligned as one of the worst video-game movies ever made.\n\nIt\u2019s not a high bar. The Super Mario Bros. movie is, at best, a bizarre sci-fi film that uses a few names from the game and barely anything else. The Tomb Raider films are more or less second-rate National Treasure films, which themselves are more or less third-rate Indiana Jones films. I saw Prince of Persia and Assassin\u2019s Creed in theaters and genuinely couldn\u2019t tell you one thing about them other than the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal made it just under the wire of not being called out for playing a person of color.\n\nSure, there are some pretty good video-game movies. Silent Hill is a decent screensaver. Mortal Kombat is fun. Detective Pikachu is surprisingly well-made. And none of this addresses the solid anime adaptations of games such as Pok\u00e9mon and Street Fighter itself. Okay, nerds? I mentioned anime; don\u2019t fill my mentions telling me I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s right there.\n\nThis is all to say that video-game movies are hated for good reason: They fail to capture the feeling of playing the game while also failing to tell a decent story to viewers who might not know or care about shit like canon.\n\nThe Street Fighter movie, however, does not care about what you think. It\u2019s not trying to be a good video-game movie or a good movie or a good story or literally anything. It\u2019s a bizarre wreckage, the molten remains of an airplane crash that has \u2014 as if by a miracle of God \u2014 turned into the most beautiful sculpture you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nStreet Fighter: The Movie is good, actually.\n\nEven the opening credits are perfect. After the soothing tones of the Universal Studios opening, the logo for the movie slams onto the globe! Dramatic music, the names Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia appear, and then, with dramatic whooshes, \u201cSTREET. FIGHTER.\u201d\n\nSmash cut to an international broadcast with reporter Chun-Li (Ming-Na Wen, back when Scarlett Johansson was too young for the part) talking about a battle between M. Bison (Julia, in his last major role) and the Allied Nations. Why Allied Nations and not United Nations? I don\u2019t know, maybe the license was too expensive. There\u2019s a whole political thing involving a civil war in the fictional Asian country of Shadaloo, but that doesn\u2019t matter. None of it matters.\n\nWhat matters is our first scene with M. Bison in his overproduced villain base. Does it have goods in uniforms? Why, yes it does. Does it have a large TV screen made up of a bunch of smaller CRT televisions? How could it not? Despite an entire civil war happening in his country, Bison is somehow willing to personally fistfight any opposing soldier who wants to.\n\nBison quickly snaps one soldier\u2019s neck and mutters, \u201cPathetic.\u201d It\u2019s \u2026 beautiful. Raul Julia is an actor and he acts the shit out of this movie. Like superhero movies, video-game films often have a villain problem. The heroes are fun, but the villains are caricatures of evil meant to be overcome. Here, it\u2019s the opposite. Bison is just so likable and charming that you need him on the screen.\n\nBacking up a second, let\u2019s remember that Raul Julia was dying of cancer when he made this film. He knew he was sick, his family knew he was sick, and he reportedly only took the role because his kids were fans of the game. (Julia died of a stroke two months before the film premiered in theaters.) He even brought his family with him to the set so they could spend more time together. Yet under the circumstances of terminal illness and a production that just didn\u2019t go off the rails but never had rails to begin with, Julia turns in one of the most fun villain performances in movie history. He acts the shit out of it.\n\nTake the most famous scene in the movie.\n\nYou don\u2019t need much context for it, because nothing in the Street Fighter movie has any actual, discernible context. But just to paint the picture for you, Chun-Li turns out to be secretly plotting revenge against Bison, which leads to her being captured by Bison, and them doing that weird prisoner hangout thing that heroes and villains do in movies for some reason. Not important.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that Street Fighter flips the script. Rather than Bison getting a long monologue, Chun-Li gets the monologue. And rather than Chun-Li getting the badass line, Bison does. Why am I writing more here? Just watch the greatest scene in cinematic history:\n\nYou could put that scene on the stage tomorrow and it would be perfect. The melodrama of Chun-Li\u2019s story, the way Bison casually changes into pajamas, the weird drink he makes while listening, and then that line: \u201cFor me, it was Tuesday.\u201d That one scene gives so much in so little, and it doesn\u2019t even give a fuck.\n\nSpeaking of not giving a fuck, Jean-Claude Van Damme\u2019s Guile is fascinating. According to writer-director-auteur Steven de Souza, Van Damme was, and this is a direct quote, \u201ccoked out of his mind\u201d while shooting the movie. And guess what? It shows! Van Damme\u2019s all-American hero with a thick Belgian accent is sweaty and desperate. His opening speech through news cameras is just as corny as you\u2019d expect. When Bison (who I guess sort of hacks into the camera system to respond, question mark?) says, \u201cYou will choke on those words,\u201d Guile responds, \u201cAnytime, dickhead.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this batshit nonsense tone that would have made this an amazing Adult Swim original movie. The first time we see Ryu and Ken, it\u2019s set to a song in which the words \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d are sung, because of course they are. This is the \u201990s, and every action movie needs a song that makes sure you know what movie you\u2019re seeing. Oh, and Ryu and Ken are con men pretending to sell weapons. Sure.\n\nBetween all these stories is another story about Guile\u2019s best friend Charlie being mutated into Blanka, whom if you remember from the games \u2026 is Blanka. If you\u2019ve read this far and haven\u2019t played Street Fighter II, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Dhalsim, once a questionably problematic Indian guru, is now a British scientist that keeps Charlie trapped in a metal tube with neon bags attached. Those bags, in very normal fashion, say, \u201cDNA MUTAGENS,\u201d just so the scientists know.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what makes the Street Fighter movie so good: It doesn\u2019t just feature clich\u00e9s, it is clich\u00e9s: The pre-9/11, pre-rise-of-white-supremacy concept of terrorists selling missiles on an open market. The for-comedy-purposes-only henchmen ditching their boss because the audience likes them and they should. The lead female character disguising herself as a dancer to break into the enemy base.\n\nOh God, and let\u2019s not forget Bison naming his money \u201cBison Dollars\u201d and promising to kidnap the queen of England for the sole purpose of setting an exchange rate of one Bison dollar being worth five British pounds.\n\nThe Street Fighter movie isn\u2019t so bad that it\u2019s good; it\u2019s a movie that doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s bad, which makes it good.\n\nAs big as \u201990s nostalgia is right now, it\u2019s almost entirely focused on the end of the decade: Y2K, the Spice Girls, AOL. Those are major defining moments, but they leave out the wackiness of the early \u201990s. We sort of have this weird view that action movies jumped from Die Hard to The Matrix, but that isn\u2019t really true. Coming off the hyperserious, hyperviolent Cold War\u2013era films of the \u201980s, the action movies of the early \u201990s leaned into slapstick comedy and goofiness.\n\nStreet Fighter is the embodiment of early \u201990s action-comedy. Forget the actors \u2014 the entire movie chews the scenery. Every scene is lifted or mutated from something you\u2019d seen before. When Guile finally sees Charlie, now turned into the monstrous Blanka, his old army buddy nearly kills him \u2014 that is until Guile says, \u201cI\u2019m your friend,\u201d and Blanka mutters, \u201cFRIEND?\u201d\n\nIn its own way, it\u2019s also an accidental deconstruction of the video-game movie. Street Fighter is a game about fancy-kicking someone else in the face. Do you really need a story? Does it matter why Bison is fighting Guile if they\u2019re fancy-kicking each other in the face? At the end of the day, it\u2019s all set dressing. So if you\u2019re going to make a movie about fancy-kicking, why not make up your own reasons and have fun with it? Add quirky dialogue, give everyone whatever motivations seem fun.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing: Street Fighter is fun. Fun because none of it makes sense and your brain dies a little trying to stitch the story together. Fun because each performer acts as if they\u2019re in an entirely different movie from the others. Fun because the movie understands it\u2019s weird as hell and leans in. It doesn\u2019t care. The movie never tries to justify its existence \u2014 it just is, a Venus born from an oyster.\n\nEven better, the movie apparently had full oversight from Capcom, the creators of the game. Capcom financed most of the movie themselves. They\u2019re the ones who wanted Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile, and they\u2019re the ones who were willing to pay him $8 million for a film in which most of his scenes are cocaine sweating, mumbling, and fancy-kicking. As much of a mess the movie is, it\u2019s also Capcom\u2019s fault, and that\u2019s deeply wonderful. Even the company that made the game didn\u2019t understand it.\n\nWatching the Street Fighter movie is a class on everything that can go wrong with a film, and how all of that failure adds up to something truly special. It\u2019s a type of tentpole movie that probably couldn\u2019t be made today, an honest-to-goodness piece of shit that\u2019s proudly put out for the public\u2019s consumption.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful.\n\nMike Drucker is a stand-up and television writer.
