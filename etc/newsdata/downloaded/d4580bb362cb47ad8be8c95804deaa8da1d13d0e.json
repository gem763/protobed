Add Interest\n\nThe fight broke out at around 3:45 p.m. Monday afternoon outside of a bagel shop in Oceanside, New York, close to where the victim, Khaseen Morris, went to high school.\n\nAn anonymous witness to the fight who spoke to New York ABC station WABC said Morris was ambushed by the group.\n\n\"There was a bunch of people sitting by the Chinese restaurant ... about 15 kids, and then, all of a sudden, while I was on the phone speaking, eight -- seven or eight kids came from the north and targeted certain people that I believe they were looking for,\" the witness said.\n\nWABC\n\nTyler Flach, 18, of Lido Beach, was arrested late Wednesday and charged with murder, according to WABC. He pleaded not guilty at an arraignment on Thursday afternoon and was ordered held without bail.\n\nMorris was stabbed in the chest in and later died in hospital. Police said they believe he was targeted.\n\n\"There's got to be about 50, 60, 70 kids here,\" Detective Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick, commander of the Nassau County Police Homicide Division, told members of the media at a press conference on Tuesday morning. \"We have a handful of kids that have come forward who have identified people involved in this.\"\n\n\"I don't think anybody here is naive to who is involved in this incident. I think all the players are known to each other,\" said Det. Lt. Fitzpatrick.\n\nWABC\n\nPerhaps the most shocking aspect of Morris' death is the fact that people filmed him dying rather than trying to help him.\n\n\"He was a person that would help anyone, and no one helped him,\" Keyanna Morris, Khaseen's sister, told WABC. \"He told my mom this is the first time in so long that he's been so happy because he finally found a school where he could be himself with nobody judging him.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Phyllis Harrington, the superintendent overseeing Oceanside High School, issued a video statement condemning the \"senseless act of violence\", imploring parents to monitor their children's social media activity, and saying that the community would get through this tragedy together.\n\n\"The kindness and generosity that you model for your children are what makes our community special,\" Harrington said. \"It's those very values that will bind us together and get us through and keep us strong because we are anchored together by purpose, passion and people.\"\n\nWABC\n\nStudents at Oceanside High School have been grieving since throughout the week.\n\n\"Students are crying in the hallway,\" said Victoria Lizama, a student at the high school. She said many had been quiet this week, not talking to each other.\n\nFitzpatrick said police still were looking for additional witnesses to come forward.\n\nSaid Fitzpatrick: \"Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen -- they'd rather video this event. ... They video'd his death instead of helping. So anyone who has video, come forward. Do the right thing for Khaseen.\"", "description": "The fight broke out at around 3:45 p.m. on Monday afternoon outside of a bagel shop in Oceanside, New York.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/oceanside-crime-scene-ht-wabc-ml-190919_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
