After the 3-1 or 4-2 we could have stopped but we wanted more,\u201d Gnabry, who barely got a look-in at Arsenal before leaving north London three years ago, said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big message for everyone else.\u201d\n\nGermany international Gnabry even failed to fire during a loan spell at West Bromwich Albion while in England but he has thrived since returning home, first with Werder Bremen and then with Bayern.\n\nHis performance on Tuesday might make Arsenal fans wonder quite why he was given so few opportunities.\n\n\u201cI think the last time I scored four goals was when I was a child!\u201d the 24-year-old said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy with my performance of course and glad I could help the team to such a big win. To score seven goals away at Tottenham, I don\u2019t think this happens a lot!\n\n\u201cIt was a great night and we\u2019re in a good place now in the Champions League.\u201d\n\nAfter a relatively slow start to the season, Bayern have picked up the pace and are now top of the Bundesliga and with back-to-back matches to come in the Champions League against Olympiakos they look set for the knockout stages.\n\n\u201cI said today was one where we would see where we are,\u201d Gnabry said. \u201cSeven goals doesn\u2019t happen often but we have to keep our feet on the ground. If we do that then performances like that can come more often.\u201d", "description": "Bayern Munich's four-goal hero Serge Gnabry said his side's 7-2 thrashing of Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League on Tuesday had sent a message around Europe.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436047302&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903N2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
