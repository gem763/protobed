LOL.\n\nBut the key takeaway from her prayer was this: White said \u201cJesus.\u201d\n\nAnd in this day and age, where bland public prayers are OK, but calling out the name of Jesus is cause for lawsuit, White\u2019s refusal to stand down on her faith is really rather remarkable.\n\n\u201cLet every demonic network that has aligned itself against the purpose, against the calling of President Trump, let it be broken, let it be torn down in the name of Jesus,\u201d White said, The Hill reported.\n\nTry that at a local government meeting \u2014 the \u201cin the name of Jesus\u201d part \u2014 and watch the fireworks fall.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, one of the left\u2019s attack dogs against Christianity in the public square, writes this in its \u201cState/Church FAQ\u201d online section: \u201cIt is inappropriate for public officials \u2014 many of whom have tax-paid positions and all of whom take an oath to uphold secular constitutions \u2014 to schedule prayer at government functions, or open government meetings with prayer and religious ritual.\u201d\n\nThe FFRF then goes on to advise that despite the fact the Supreme Court has found otherwise \u2014 has, in the minds of the atheist group, \u201cissued two unhelpful decisions about prayer at legislative meetings\u201d \u2014 those who hate God can \u201cstill complain when you encounter government prayer.\u201d\n\nWell, to be fair, the FFRF didn\u2019t exactly direct its advisement toward \u201cthose who hate God.\u201d That\u2019s simply implied.\n\nBut the FFRF isn\u2019t the only one out there waiting to pounce for the crime of mentioning Jesus in public. The American Civil Liberties Union has had its share of similar legal battles; the vicious Mikey Weinstein with the Military Religious Freedom Foundation has had even more.\n\nSo kudos to White.\n\nAnd kudos to Trump for keeping White close.\n\n\u201cI declare that President Trump will overcome every strategy from hell and every strategy from the enemy,\u201d White said. \u201cI secure his calling, I secure his purpose, I secure his family, and we secure victory in the name which is above every name \u2026 the name of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the spiritual battle lines have been drawn.\n\nLet the secularist weeping and gnashing of teeth begin.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
