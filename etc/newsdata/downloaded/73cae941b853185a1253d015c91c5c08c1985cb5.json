There's an emergency. It's a race against time, and one in which we are losing,\" he said. \"There's no excuse for not knowing that.\"\n\nHe also had strong words for those who deny scientific fact, as it relates to global warming.\n\n\"I think the most troubling part is that I don\u2019t think there is anybody in the world that can deny science, undeniable science and facts. Science and facts that have been around for 30, maybe 40 years, and is only getting stronger and stronger,\" he said.\n\n\u201cNo one can deny science, otherwise we live in a very troubling world.\u201d\n\nHarry is spending just one jam-packed day in Botswana, where he will visit the Chobe Forest Tree reserve, see a project run by Sentebale, a charity he co-founded with Lesotho's Prince Seesio to help children affected by HIV and AIDS, and finally, he'll dedicate a part of the Chobe National Park to the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy. Then, he'll head to Angola to further his mother's legacy in the fight to eradicate landmines.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"I feel deeply connected to this place,\" he said.", "authors": ["Caroline Hallemann"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OQgpL0DVRlbJnYx9HMBlEg--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/f69f3dde7b734fb6d781ff4939e0a311", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
