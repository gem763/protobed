Biden.\n\nMrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s rival in the 2016 election, made the remark after the president told reporters outside the White House that both countries should investigate Mr. Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter, effectively repeating a request at the heart of a recently launched impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\n\u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,\u201d Mrs. Clinton responded on Twitter.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s tweet referenced an earlier post that included video footage of Mr. Trump making the suggestion hours earlier.\n\n\u201cI think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Mr. Trump said about Ukraine in the video. \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s actions last week after his administration tried to block Congress from viewing a whistleblower complained filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nThe White House later relented and released a rough transcript of a July telephone call that prompted the complaint, and it showed that the president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Bidens while Mr. Trump delayed aid earmarked by Congress for the former Soviet state.\n\nMr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. He has countered that the Bidens should be investigated because the former vice president, while in office, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had investigated a company with business ties to his son.\n\nMr. Biden has denied that he pushed Ukraine to protect his family, and several past and current Ukrainian government officials have said they are unaware of any evidence to indicate otherwise.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
