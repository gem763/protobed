Facial recognition has no place on our streets.\u201d\n\nThe judgment said 500,000 faces may have been scanned by South Wales Police so far, and that the legal framework governing facial recognition must be subject to periodic review.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

With the benefit of this judgment, we will continue to explore how to ensure the ongoing fairness and transparency of our approach.\n\n\u201cThere is, and should be, a political and public debate about wider questions of privacy and security. It would be wrong in principle for the police to set the bounds of our use of new technology for ourselves.\u201d\n\nFacial recognition technology maps faces in a crowd by measuring the distance between features, then compares results with a watch-list of images \u2013 which can include wanted criminals, missing people and persons of interest.\n\nAs well as a high rate of \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, where innocent people are wrongly flagged to police, campaigners have raised concern over evidence of racial bias in the software.\n\nSouth Wales Police has been using the technology since 2017 and is considered the national lead force on its use.\n\nLondon\u2019s Metropolitan Police is facing a separate legal challenge over its own facial recognition trial, which has seen members of the public misidentified as criminals in 96 per cent of scans.\n\nA spokesperson for the Information Commissioners\u2019 Office, which intervened in the case, said it would be reviewing the judgment carefully.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s finding that the police use of live facial recognition (LFR) systems involves the processing of sensitive personal data of members of the public, requiring compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018,\u201d the watchdog added.\n\n\u201cThis new and intrusive technology has the potential, if used without the right privacy safeguards, to undermine rather than enhance confidence in the police.\u201d\n\nThe information commissioner has conducted its own investigation into trials conducted by South Wales Police and Scotland Yard, and said it would consider the High Court\u2019s findings before publishing national recommendations.", "description": "An activist has lost the world\u2019s first legal challenge over police use of facial recognition, after the High Court found the technology was being used lawfully in Wales.
