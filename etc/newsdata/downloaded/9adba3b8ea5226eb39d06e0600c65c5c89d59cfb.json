He was fired from Showtime\u2019s The Circus; Penguin abandoned a planned book on the 2016 presidential campaign, co-authored by his longtime writing partner John Heilemann; and HBO nixed a television project based on that canceled book.\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry and hope to have a chance to apologize directly to those I treated badly. It is the right and necessary thing to do,\u201d Halperin said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cI cannot imagine how difficult this experience has been for them. I hope this will be a further step in my continued efforts to fully comprehend and make amends for the pain that I have caused.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Halperin has been carefully raising his public profile, resuming his social-media activity after a lengthy hiatus, and launching a political blog titled \u201cMark Halperin\u2019s Wide World of News\u201d\u2014a throwback to his days of writing \u201cThe Note\u201d when he was ABC\u2019s political director two decades ago\u2014in which he offers his opinions on subjects ranging from Attorney General William Barr\u2019s congressional testimony to Joe Biden\u2019s poll numbers.\n\nAccording to knowledgeable sources, Halperin called the top editor at The Hill, the Washington-based political newspaper, to ask about job prospects, but was told there were no openings; Halperin was spotted having lunch in December with TiVo Chief Executive Tom Rogers at Manhattan\u2019s media-centric Michael\u2019s Restaurant, and, earlier last year, dining at the Washington political watering hole Charlie Palmer\u2019s with senior presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThroughout Halperin\u2019s rehab tour, Scarborough and Brzezinski especially have been offering moral support and more concrete assistance. According to multiple sources at MSNBC\u2014which, along with NBC News, dismissed Halperin as an on-air political analyst when the allegations surfaced\u2014the network scrapped a plan for the Morning Joe anchors last fall to collaborate with Halperin on an online-only program analyzing the 2018 midterms.\n\nAccording to these sources, Scarborough and Brzezinski didn\u2019t seek prior approval to involve their friend and former regular panelist in the show, and colleagues reacted with surprise and concern when they got wind of the scheme.\n\n\u201cEverybody was going \u2018WTF!,\u2019\u201d said one MSNBC insider.\n\n\u201cAll parties, including Mark, decided not to move forward with the midterm project for a variety of reasons,\u201d a source with knowledge said, \u201cincluding concerns by management that the online broadcast would detract from MSNBC\u2019s coverage.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, MSNBC managers were blindsided on April 5 when Brzezinski devoted a Morning Joe segment to Halperin\u2019s rehab, playing and positively commenting on an audio clip of his appearance on Smerconish\u2019s SiriusXM program, in which Halperin claimed he had engaged in \u201chundreds\u201d of discussions with women on the subject of workplace sexual harassment and had come to a new understanding of how his misconduct had \u201churt\u201d people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to take the opportunity to again apologize to the women that I mistreated, who told their stories, and who were hurt by me,\u201d Halperin told Smerconish before launching into a heartwarming account of his volunteer work with former prisoners at the Fortune Society, a convict rehabilitation nonprofit, and a pundit-like analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign.\n\nAnd then he commented on the controversy over various women\u2019s complaints about Joe Biden\u2019s unwanted touching.\n\nNoting that many people would not be \u201c the least bit interested in what I have to say about a topic like this\u201d\u2014namely the Biden flap\u2014Halperin nevertheless continued: \u201cI think this is a bit of a distraction. As serious as the charges are, and then as important as this debate is, I think Joe Biden is, despite his standing in the polls, an extremely overrated candidate.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski introduced the April 5 segment by touting political news \u201cthat actually was broken by Mark Halperin\u2026 about the Bernie Sanders campaign,\u201d and added that he\u2019d also discussed \u201chis own personal situations and the terrible mistakes that he has made and addressed them. Let\u2019s show that.\u201d\n\nAccording to multiple MSNBC sources, the cable outlet\u2019s executives were not forewarned that Brzezinski was going to address such an internally sensitive issue in public, and they were not happy about it. MSNBC, Scarborough, and Brzezinski declined to comment for this story.\n\nBrzezinski publicly supported Halperin from the start of the snowballing scandal, telling the Morning Joe audience in October 2017 that \u201cnothing has been proven or adjudicated here\u201d and that \u201cMark and Karen [Avrich, Halperin\u2019s longtime girlfriend and the mother of their infant son] have been a part of Morning Joe\u2019s extended family for years. They\u2019re our friends and we believe it\u2019s important to stand with our friends through even the most difficult of times.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, two months after Halperin\u2019s firing, Brzezinski was compelled to publicly apologize after she complained on-air that several of his accusers had declined her offer to arrange a face-to-face meeting between them and their alleged sexual harasser.\n\nResponding to Brzezinski\u2019s complaint, 10 of Halperin\u2019s accusers issued a statement attacking her \u201cinappropriate comments\u201d suggesting \u201cthat women who were assaulted by Mark Halperin owe him an opportunity to meet with him in person so that he can \u2018apologize face-to-face.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrzezinski was apparently chastened.\n\n\u201cIn our discussion about sexual harassment this morning, I said some things that hurt people,\u201d she said in her own apology. \u201cIn the case of Mark, my goal today was to start a conversation about hearing from the men whenever we can, but I realize that it is not my place. It isn\u2019t my call to make, and for that I am truly sorry.\u201d\n\nSmerconish, meanwhile, has invited Halperin back on his radio show two additional times so far to share his political insights. In an email to The Daily Beast, the CNN host pointed out that during the initial April 4 appearance, he spent 10 minutes asking Halperin about his history of sexual misconduct before the conversation turned to politics.\n\n\u201cHe seems genuinely sorry for what he did. My view is that to not let him opine after 2 yrs would be akin to a professional death sentence,\u201d Smerconish emailed. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t apologized, I would not have invited him. But he did.\u201d\n\nSmerconish added: \u201cMy radio callers appreciated both his repentance and perspective, so I invited him back,\u201d he said. \u201cMark is a smart guy.\u201d\n\nBut during that chat, Halperin questioned whether some of his critics were sincere: \u201cI wasn\u2019t a perfect person when I made these mistakes. I\u2019m not a perfect person now. I\u2019m happy to be judged by perfect people.\u201d\n\nAnd some of Halperin\u2019s accusers doubt his sincerity as well, expressing fury about his comeback attempt.\n\nAmong them is crisis-communications executive Eleanor McManus, who alleged that when she was a recent college graduate more than a decade ago, Halperin invited her to his office at ABC News, where he was political director, and made unwelcome sexual advances, including trying to kiss her and \u201ca bit more,\u201d as she wrote in a column for CNN.\n\n\u201cHe leveraged his position as a prominent journalist to prey on women,\u201d McManus told The Daily Beast, adding that, despite his public mea culpa, Halperin has not tried to personally contact her to apologize for his alleged misconduct.\n\n\u201cBefore he is given that kind of power again, he needs to demonstrate genuine contrition\u2014which includes apologizing to all the women he has victimized,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014Lachlan Cartwright contributed reporting.", "description": "The disgraced pundit has re-emerged from #MeToo hiding and has met with media friends for new punditry work\u2014including a scrapped gig with the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe.\u2019", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Lloyd Grove", "Media Reporter", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1556834355/190430-tani-grove-halperins-tease_cfpp8t", "published_at": "2019-05-02"}
