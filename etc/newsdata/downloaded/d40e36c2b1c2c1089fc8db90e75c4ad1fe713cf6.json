One is that Michael Eavis has frequently insulted me and I don\u2019t really particularly enjoy that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat bothers me more is that he is in favour of the badger cull, which I regard as a tragedy and unnecessary crime against wildlife.\n\nMay is also the co-founder of the Save Me animal welfare organisation, which campaigns against fox hunting and badger culling.\n\nHe started the body in 2010 alongside the environmental campaigner Anne Brummer, and named it after Queen\u2019s 1980 hit.\n\nMay appeared on Zoe Ball\u2019s show alongside the singer-songwriter James Blunt and Strictly Come Dancing head judge Shirley Ballas. Blunt did not say whether he would perform at Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m off on my tour from February around the UK. I will be doing some summer festivals. Glastonbury has always been my favourite gig to play. I\u2019ve played on the Pyramid Stage a couple of times and it\u2019s an amazing place, absolutely.\u201d\n\nDiana Ross, who made her name in The Supremes, has already been announced as the performer for next year\u2019s Sunday afternoon Legends slot, which last year was filled by Kylie Minogue.\n\nRepresentatives of Glastonbury have been contacted for comment.", "description": "Guitarist rules out 50th anniversary headline slot because of rift with festival founder", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7be445cd45b2f0c09c449007265824553f8bbda/0_337_4564_2738/master/4564.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13ed933a37c173932160a2a6752afe55", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
