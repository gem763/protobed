To be fair, it wasn\u2019t just me, and she was wearing a bathing suit. Ross is a newly minted beauty entrepreneur; her curly-hair-care brand, Pattern, will appear in 12,000 Ulta stores on September 22. To showcase the products, she invited me and 20 other beauty editors to watch her take a shower \u2014 sort of like beauty QVC, if the hosts had won Emmys.\n\nRoss, with her halo of bouncy, juicy, fluffy curls, stood under a rainfall shower head and used baseball-size amounts of conditioner. She told us that six is her magic number (it\u2019s the number of ways she splits her hair as she applies product) and that she likes to apply leave-in conditioner prior to a cold rinse. The Cut caught up with Ross after she dried off (via scrunching, not rubbing \u2014 as any curly-hair goddess knows). Read on for her thoughts on entering into the beauty business, the story her hair could tell, and her former days as a New York Magazine fashion intern.\n\nHow do you think about beauty?\n\nBeauty is about the heart. Beauty comes from the inside. It really is a personal, quite sacred relationship that you have with yourself.\n\nThe practice of beauty also has ritual in it. Think about the way men coiff their hair. I think of ex-boyfriends of mine \u2014 I would laugh, You have no hair! What are you even doing? But it was their special ritual.\n\nWhat you just saw, the system of how I shower and create my curls, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing for 20 years. I discovered that process and it crystallized into this thing that gives me what I think it is my best hair.\n\nPhoto: Pattern Beauty\n\nNow you\u2019re in the business of beauty. How do you feel about that shift?\n\nI feel great about it. My desire is to bring mindfulness, compassion, honesty, and sacredness to it. Someone asked me, \u201cDid you make these products keeping in mind that this community can be very critical?\u201d But I don\u2019t know if I would use the word \u201ccritical\u201d \u2014 we just know what we want.\n\nI specifically did not want to try and satisfy everyone. I wanted to create authentic products made with this community in mind. We tried 74 samples ourselves and a lot of them didn\u2019t work. This project is truly just an extension of how I\u2019ve been doing my business of being a creative. It\u2019s another version of storytelling, but with products you can you use in the shower.\n\nFor many people, your mom is seen as a natural hair icon. Does it surprise you that you had an acceptance journey with your own natural hair?\n\nNo. My contentious relationship with my hair started as a teenager. I loved my hair growing up. My aunts and my mom were supportive and made me feel beautiful. The wall I bumped up against was that of society and culture. The culture of entertainment is steeped in patriarchy and sexism. The messages I was getting outside my home were that my hair was not easy, breezy, bouncy, or behaving.\n\nAs a teen, I wasn\u2019t looking at my mom being like, Hey, what\u2019s cool? Now, at 46, I want to copy everything my mom does. But back then, I was like Ewww, go away. As a teen, I was trying to learn how to be lovable, likable, sexy, receivable. Not everyone has Diana Ross as a mom, I understand that, so there is a uniqueness to my story. But I am a human being and just as susceptible to the images that society has expressed to me systematically about my hair, beauty, and what box I\u2019m meant to fit in.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying from Pattern is that my beauty, my hair, your beauty, your hair \u2014 it\u2019s all gorgeous and sexy. My products aren\u2019t trying to make you want something you can\u2019t get. They\u2019re trying to say, \u201cLet\u2019s do this, me and you. I see you, you see me \u2014 let\u2019s play.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve said that the culture of beauty was steeped in racism, sexism, patriarchy, among other things. Have you ever thought about just not participating in beauty, for that reason?\n\nNah. I never think it\u2019s better not to participate. I participate by being one of the expanders within that. I know what people within the industry have done for me, how they\u2019ve affected my confidence and relationship with beauty \u2014 seeing people like Lisa Bonet and Cree Summer, they made a difference to me. Even my mom is one of those people. They all start to weave into this larger fabric of a story.\n\nTo me, all of those spaces that feel limited and unrepresentative of the full picture \u2014 those are the ones that I want to go into and expand into something different. The success of Fenty Beauty happened because people finally felt represented. That was my feeling about this community. Like, Wait, why did I not get to have beautiful products which represent me and are for me? Why is my aisle all the way over there? Why are we in a different aisle? Why can\u2019t we all be in here? Let\u2019s expand the aisle instead of trying to redefine it.\n\nLegend has it that you used to be an New York Magazine fashion intern. Tell us about that time.\n\nThat is so correct. I worked with Samira Nasr. We were both interns who moved from Mirabella to NYMag. It was a part of my journey and development. It added some new skills to my repertoire, and obviously, it created my lifetime friendship with Samira, who has been my best friend for over 20 years.\n\nOur friendship was solidifed in the fashion department. At the time, we were in a building that had one conference room for the whole magazine and when we were doing a shoot, we would fill it with clothes and shoes. I did everything from book models to write insurance letters. It was a good time.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "An interview with actress and beauty entrepreneur Tracee Ellis Ross on her new curly haircare brand, Pattern.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/06/6-pattern-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
