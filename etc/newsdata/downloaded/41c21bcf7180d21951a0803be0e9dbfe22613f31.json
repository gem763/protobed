She pointed to Beijing\u2019s rule over Hong Kong, which has seen months of violent protests opposing China\u2019s grip, as impetus to reject the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle through which it governs the financial hub -- and which she said China wants to impose on Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan would have \u201cno space to survive once accepting \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cRejecting \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is the biggest consensus among the 23 million people of Taiwan regardless of party affiliation or position.\u201d\n\nComing three months before Taiwanese voters go to the polls, the neighboring chaos is just one of the battles China is fighting -- along with halted broadcasts of some U.S. National Basketball Association games and a protracted trade war with President Donald Trump -- that could boost Tsai\u2019s hopes of re-election in January.\n\nShe currently has a more then 13 percentage-point lead over her main rival, popular Kaoshiung City mayor Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang party, according to a poll published in the Apple Daily newspaper Tuesday.\n\nIn contrast to last week\u2019s massive National Day celebrations in the mainland, which focused on military bombast and featured President Xi Jinping driving through the streets of Beijing greeting troops, Taiwan\u2019s was lower-key and highlighted immigration -- including letting dozens of new immigrants lead the singing of the national anthem.\n\n\u201cWhen democracy is under threat, we need to stand up to guard it. Being a president, I need to guard sovereignty, to maintain Taiwan\u2019s survival,\u201d Tsai said Thursday.\n\nLured by China\u2019s Cash, Tiny Pacific Islands Give Up on Taiwan\n\nWhile the People\u2019s Republic has never controlled Taiwan, it claims the separately ruled island as part of its territory, a claim Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party rejects.\n\nTsai, a longtime China critic, faces challenges in her closely-watched bid for re-election, including Beijing\u2019s efforts to isolate Taipei diplomatically. Its success in persuading two of Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic allies to switch recognition to China in the last month -- the Solomon Islands and Kiribati -- leaves Tsai with just 15 such partners worldwide.\n\nBut it also threatens to backfire as Taiwan\u2019s election draws closer, with U.S. and Australian concerns about China\u2019s growing footprint in the Pacific strengthening Tsai\u2019s argument that Beijing poses a threat to both Taiwan and regional order.\n\nThe U.S. supports Taipei militarily, a key source of tension between Washington and Beijing. It made a show of support for Tsai Thursday as Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, attended the National Day celebrations in Taipei. He is the first U.S. senator to attend such a celebration in 35 years, according to statement from Taiwan\u2019s foreign affairs ministry.\n\nSenator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, and Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu also wrote an article Tuesday in the Hill newspaper, calling for strengthening Taiwan-U.S. relations to counter rising Chinese influence in the Pacific region.\n\n(Corrects final paragraph to show that Senator Cory Gardner authored commentary with Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.)\n\n--With assistance from Samson Ellis and Dandan Li.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Miaojung Lin in Taipei at mlin179@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Karen Leigh, Tony Jordan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan\u2019s president said unrest in Hong Kong showed Beijing\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d in governing the city and vowed to defend her island\u2019s sovereignty.President Tsai Ing-wen vowed to fight for Taiwan\u2019s survival in her National Day address Thursday, saying it faced \u201cunprecedented change\u201d in the world", "authors": ["Miaojung Lin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1MB2Zr.apERqEKsXcWiUTQ--~B/aD0xOTM0O3c9MjkwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/211aaf3665a823d86265a168ed4cc2ca", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
