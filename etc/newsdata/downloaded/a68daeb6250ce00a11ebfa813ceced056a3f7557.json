According to Sophos, these adware apps are doing everything they can to hide themselves on your device and inject crappy advertising into everything you do \u2014 and more than 1.3 million devices worldwide have at least one of these apps installed.\n\nThe apps in question are:\n\nfree.calls.messages\n\ncom.a.bluescanner\n\ncom.bb.image.editor\n\ncom.cc.image.editor\n\ncom.d.bluemagentascanner\n\ncom.doo.keeping\n\ncom.e.orangeredscanner\n\ncom.hz.audio\n\ncos.mos.comprehensive\n\ncom.garbege.background.cutout\n\ncom.hanroom.cutbackground\n\ncom.jiajia.autocut.photo\n\ncom.jiakebull.picture.background\n\ncom.fruit.autocut.photo\n\nIf you\u2019re more of a visual learner, here\u2019s a roundup of what they looked like on Google Play \u2014 courtesy of Sophos \u2014 before Google removed them.\n\nWhat\u2019s most damning about these apps is the creative techniques they used to bury themselves on your device (to make it easier for you to forget them and trickier for you to remove them). For example, an app might appear in your app tray at first, and when you launch the app, you\u2019ll get a bogus warning about it being \u201cincompatible.\u201d When you\u2019d go to look for it in your app tray again, however, the app\u2019s icon will have disappeared.\n\nThese malware apps might also use different names to refer to themselves when you\u2019re trying to find (and uninstall them) via your Settings app versus when they\u2019re actually running. The name of the game is confusion: The more they can make you work to find and uninstall them, the more likely it is you\u2019ll give up \u2014 or be unable to.\n\nGoing forward, the best way to ensure you don\u2019t get hit with crafty adware like this is to make sure you\u2019re downloading apps that you\u2019ve heard of (or have been independently reviewed by others), rather than any ol\u2019 thing you find on Google Play. Additionally, check the Google Play reviews for apps before you download them. If a lot of people are reporting than app is a scam, or adware, you probably won\u2019t want to put it on your device.", "description": "If you have any of these 15 sneaky apps on your Android device, it\u2019s time to go on a digital hunt and delete them.
