They say it\u2019s not realistic, that it\u2019s socialism. That\u2019s what they said about Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, and we got Social Security and a middle class.\u201d\n\nMs. Fonda\u2019s campaign announced she moved to D.C. to participate in more climate change protests, adding she will be protesting on the Capitol steps every Friday until at least January.\n\n\u201cShe will be joined at every \u2018Fire Drill Friday\u2019 through at least mid-January by celebrities, scientists, economists and people from impacted communities who will speak and some of whom will invite arrest,\u201d a \u201cFire Drill Fridays\u201d press release said, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\u201cInspired by the growing movement of young climate strikers, Fonda decided to move to the nation\u2019s capital for four months to take up their baton,\u201d the release said.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police released a statement about the arrest.\n\n\u201cToday, the United States Capitol Police arrested 16 individuals for unlawfully demonstrating on the East Front of the U.S. Capitol.
