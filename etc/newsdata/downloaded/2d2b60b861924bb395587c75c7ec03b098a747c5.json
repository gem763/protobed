Propelled by his instinct and impulse, De Gaulle begged to differ with France\u2019s decision makers, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, what came to be known as \u201cGaullism\u201d was in a way a product of \u201cBergsonism.\u201d Gaullism is not a doctrine or an ideology. It\u2019s a pragmatic policy approach to protecting and advancing the national interest that can only be pursued by statesman driven by the right mix of intelligence and intuition, cold reason and emotional impulse.\n\nThis explains why it was sometimes seen as lacking abstract reasoning, consistency, and coherence. President Trump\u2019s foreign policy position and posturing have elicited much of the same complaints.\n\nLike: \u201cPresident Trump, you pledged to get us out of the Middle East. But what about your decision to revoke the nuclear deal with Iran and declare an economic war against Tehran? You argued that a nuclear North Korea would be an existential threat to the United States. So what about your bromance with its evil leader? You are seeking to improve America\u2019s relationship with Russia. Then what about withdrawing from the nuclear missile accord with Moscow? You decried the policy of regime change and nation building. What about your call for doing just that in Venezuela?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s make one thing clear: Trump is no de Gaulle, and for a very simple reason: De Gaulle insisted that his model statesman possess both intuition and intelligence. Intelligence in that case referred not only to high IQ but also to intellectual curiosity, a sense of history, and a comprehensive view of the world that can only be acquired by studying and reading a lot of books.\n\nYet it\u2019s clear that, unlike de Gaulle and the ultimate American Gaullist, President Richard Nixon\u2014for whom spending time going through tomes written by the Greeks and the Romans was considered to be a form of light reading\u2014Trump has never shown any comparable intellectual curiosity.\n\nBut then when we try to deconstruct what we take to be Trump\u2019s foreign policy, it seems that the president\u2019s intuition and instincts, or the \u201cfollowing his guts,\u201d explain major phenomena. The impulse to \u201cdo something\u201d in response to this or that foreign policy crisis, which led his predecessors into military quagmires, has kept the White House occupant in neutral.\n\nTo put it differently, Trump has embraced President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shit\u201d foreign policy. Yet he seems to be doing a much better job of implementing that advice by more forcefully resisting the unrelenting pressure from the interventionist \u201cBlob\u201d (knock on wood).\n\nSo Trump, who has been ridiculed by members of the so-called intellectual elite as a lightweight, has refused to give a green light to a U.S. military intervention in Syria, rejecting the advice of those who would pursue another regime change there.\n\nIt is true that his diplomacy with North Korea and his friendship with its dictator has not brought about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But then no one seriously believed that was going to happen under any scenario. From that perspective, Trump has helped avert a catastrophic war in the area and encouraged reconciliation between the North and the South, which could one day lead to a united Korea that would no longer require U.S. troops to protect it.\n\nIt may not be the Grand Strategy that members of Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment are looking for. But Trump\u2019s decisions have already set the stage for long-term strategic changes in East Asia, where an evolving Korean nationalism countered by a sense of Japanese nationalism could help create a new and stable regional balance of power that would make direct U.S. military intervention unnecessary.\n\nIn the Middle East, by firing John Bolton, expressing a willingness to meet with his Iranian counterpart, and refusing to drag the U.S. into military conflict with Iran in the aftermath of the attacks on the Saudi oil installations, Trump has sent a clear message to the Saudis that they need to pursue a d\u00e9tente with Tehran. The U.S. will not intervene in a war between the Sunnis and the Shiites in the Middle East. Period. And take it from there.\n\nThen there is the message he is sending to a leading player in the Middle East, Turkey, and another regional actor down on the scale, the Kurds, with his recent announcement that he\u2019s ending U.S. involvement in Syria. It\u2019s not much different than his message to Israel and the Palestinians: hey guys, you need to resolve your differences among yourselves\u2014we can only help. Regional powers like Turkey and Israel\u2014and in the long run, Iran\u2014will be able to maintain spheres of influence in order to protect their security and as part of any evolving balance of power, and minor players, like the Kurds and the Palestinians, will have to accept that.\n\nUnfortunately, notwithstanding all his bragging, a \u201cstable genius\u201d Trump is not. He has not surrounded himself with foreign policy aides who fit that bill, the result being that while he has not done any \u201cstupid shit,\u201d he has failed to move ahead by actively reorienting American foreign policy in a non-interventionist direction. And in some cases, like on Iran and China, he has yet to figure out how to resolve the contradictions that his policies bring to the surface.\n\nSo while Trumpism may not be Gaullism, it still makes much more sense than the numerous doctrines and grand strategies that have guided America since the end of the Cold War. Those presidents were men \u201cof texts, a mechanically organized intelligence,\u201d but that didn\u2019t mean their foreign policies turned out to be successful.\n\nLeon Hadar, a TAC contributing editor, writes regularly for National Interest Online, Asia Times, Haaretz, and Quillette.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-de-gaulle.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
