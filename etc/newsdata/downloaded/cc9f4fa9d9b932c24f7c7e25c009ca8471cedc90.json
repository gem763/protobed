They have their first away win in any competition since that memorable March evening in the French capital nearly eight months ago.\n\nIt came on a difficult night in Belgrade. One that was prefaced by fears of more racist behaviour from Serbian supporters who were allowed back into the Partizan Stadium after their club was forced to play the last two European games here behind closed doors.\n\nFortunately, there was no repeat of the problems of the past, but this was still noisy and intimidating setting for a United team containing a number of young players.\n\nAnthony Martial scored a 43rd minute penalty as Man United beat Partizan Belgrade 1-0 to record first away win since March\n\nMartial was starting his first game since recovering from a thigh injury he sustained against Crystal Palace back in August\n\nUnited's win leaves Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side top of Europa League Group L with seven points from three games\n\nMATCH FACTS AND PLAYER RATINGS PARTIZAN BELGRADE (4-4-2): Stojkovic 6; Miletic 5, Ostojic 6, S Pavlovic 7, Urosevic 6; Tosic 6.5 (F Stevanovic 75, 6), Natcho 6, Zdjelar 5.5, Soumah 7.5 (L Pavlovic, 83); Sadiq 6, Asano 6.5 (Ivanovic 90+2) Subs not used: Vujacic, Scekic, Brezancic, N Stevanovic Booked: Natcho, Miletic MANCHESTER UNITED (3-4-2-1): Romero 6.5; Jones 5, Maguire 7.5, Rojo 6.5; Wan-Bissaka 6.5 (James 60, 6), Garner 7 (Pereira 82), McTominay 6.5, Williams 8; Mata 6.5, Lingard 6; Martial 5 (Rashford 60, 6). Subs not used: Lindelof, Grant, Fred, Greenwood Goal: Martial pen (43) Booked: Jones Referee: Xavier Estrada Fernandez (Spain) 7\n\nIt included teenagers Brandon Williams and James Garner, on his full debut, who were both excellent in the circumstances.\n\nThey will be all the stronger for the experience and a win that puts United clear at the top of Group L.\n\nWilliams won the penalty that enabled Anthony Martial to score the winning goal from the penalty spot before half-time on his first start since August.\n\nWorryingly, it was United's only shot on target in two away games in Europe this season.\n\nIt ended a 232-day wait for an away win since that sensational 3-1 comeback over Paris Saint-Germain to reach the Champions League quarter-finals last season.\n\nThis was United's 12th attempt to end that run and failure to do so would have equalled an unwanted record set by Dave Sexton's team 40 years ago in 1979.\n\nTheir problems clearly haven't disappeared but this was a night to focus on the positives; on the performance of their young players and a superb defensive effort.\n\n'Brandon was man of the match,' enthused manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 'He has no fear and is as brave as a lion. He got us the win.\n\n'He's got a great attitude and the boy is going to be a top player.\n\n'Of course, I'm happy. We need to win away from home in the league now, but it was another clean sheet and that gives you a platform to win games.'\n\nJesse Lingard hit the post with a low effort from 20 yards shortly before Anthony Martial put United in front from the spot\n\nUmar Sadiq curled an effort against the woodwork in the first half as Partizan threatened in an evenly-matched first half\n\nUnited were awarded a penalty after Brandon Williams was brought down by the outstretched leg of Nemanja Miletic\n\nIt was notable that Solskjaer gave the captain\u2019s armband to Harry Maguire in the absence of David de Gea.\n\nThe England defender witnessed the racist abuse on international duty in Bulgaria last week and spoke so responsibly about the issue on the eve of this game.\n\nHaving initially forgotten to go up for the pre-match coin toss, he carried out the rest of captaincy duties admirably, marshalling a defensive effort that was tested to the full in the second half.\n\nOn five previous occasions this season, United have failed to protect a one-goal lead, culminating in the draw with Liverpool at Old Trafford last weekend.\n\nThis team needs to start scoring more than one goal, but they held on here and deserve a great deal of credit for that.\n\nDespite the volatile atmosphere, it was a pretty limp game for 37 minutes and in that sense very much in keeping with United\u2019s last Europa League game away to Alkmaar at the start of the month.\n\nThen Garner and Aaron Wan-Bissaka both blocked clearances in the Partizan box and the ball ran for Jesse Lingard who stroked it against the foot of the post.\n\nPhil Jones showed why he was making just his third start of the season with a disappointing performance in Belgrade\n\nUnited struggled to contain the lively Seydouba Soumah, who turned Harry Maguire inside out with one piece of skill\n\nDaniel James and Marcus Rashford were introduced from the bench as United switched to a back four in the second half\n\nPartizan responded immediately as Umar Sadiq rattled the upright at the other end. A rather pedestrian game had suddenly sprung into life and United went ahead from the penalty spot two minutes before half-time.\n\nWilliams caused the Serbs problems all night with his tireless running down the left and Juan Mata played him into acres of space with a pass.\n\nThe 19-year-old looked as though he had overrun the ball as he broke into the box, but got another touch just as Nemanja Miletic lunged in.\n\nThe contact was enough for Spanish referee Estrada Fernandez. Martial, who had looked rather disinterested up to that point, took responsibility to convert the penalty.\n\nUnited were perhaps fortunate that Senor Fernandez ruled in their favour when Phil Jones floored Seydouba Soumah with an untidy challenge in the box shortly after half-time, having just been booked for fouling Sadiq, and again when the ball struck Scott McTominay\u2019s arm.\n\nThe referee was pelted with objects as he left the pitch at full-time, which might spell further trouble for Partizan.\n\nBy then, United were celebrating a hard-earned victory - their first in seven matches in any competition.\n\nIt was worlds apart from Paris, but Solskjaer has won away at last.", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER IN SERBIA: Anthony Martial's first half penalty was the difference as Manchester United beat Partizan Belgrade 1-0 in Serbia to record their first away win since March.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20151528-0-image-a-12_1571948116075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
