At that time, I had it in mind to leave, not because I wanted to leave Barca but because I wanted to leave Spain. I felt mistreated and I didn\u2019t want to be here anymore.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old\u2019s current contract expires in 2021 and Messi believes extending his deal \u201cwill not be a problem\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday it is clearer that my idea is to finish here,\u201d Messi said. \u201cFor how I am at the club, for what I feel, and for the family and the children and how settled we are in this city. I would not like to disrupt that.\n\n\u201cOf course anything can happen but in principle, the idea is to stay here.\u201d\n\nMessi began playing football aged six for Newell\u2019s Old Boys, the Rosario club he supports in Argentina.\n\n\u201cI always dreamed of being able to play again for Newell\u2019s and to have the experience of playing football in Argentina,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I have already told them that sometimes you have to think about what is best for your family.\u201d\n\n\u2013 No rift with Griezmann \u2013\n\nMessi was keen to be reunited with Neymar last summer but Barcelona were unable to agree a fee with PSG.\n\n\u201cI honestly thought at one time, especially in this market, that if he did not come here, he would go to Real Madrid Madrid because I thought he wanted to leave,\u201d Messi said.\n\n\u201cI wanted Ney to come because as a footballer, he is one of the best in the world. He is unpredictable, different and having him in our team would have given us more options.\u201d\n\nBarcelona did sign Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid, despite him rejecting the Catalans the year before. Messi denies suggestions of a rift between him and the Frenchman.\n\n\u201cThe first year when we wanted to sign Griezmann, I said he was one of the best and that the best are always welcome,\u201d Messi said. \u201cI have never had problem with him coming. So it\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\nMessi also offered his support to Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde, who has been under pressure after a bumpy start to the season followed the team\u2019s Champions League collapse against Liverpool in May.\n\n\u201cIt was not the coach\u2019s fault but it was also not my decision for him to stay,\u201d Messi said. \u201cThe club decided Valverde would continue and for me that was a joy, good for stability and he is a coach we support and love.\n\n\u201cIf another coach comes, we will be with him. To achieve success, we all have to be united.\u201d\n\nMessi scored his first goal of the season in a 4-0 thrashing of Sevilla on Sunday, after two months spoiled by calf and thigh injuries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a bit short but I\u2019m feeling better,\u201d Messi said. \u201cMy legs hurt against Sevilla but it\u2019s what happens when you come back. I\u2019m getting closer.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Lionel Messi has admitted he wanted to leave Barcelona when he was under investigation from the Spanish tax authorities but insists now he intends to finish his career at the club.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/000_1L69HL-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
