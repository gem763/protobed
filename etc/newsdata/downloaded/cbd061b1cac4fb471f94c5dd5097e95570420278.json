The threshold for relocating people from Chernobyl was just 350mSv.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMr Ansell said: \u2018I was stunned just how radioactive some of the items were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Fortunately, we didn\u2019t open the bag and weren\u2019t exposed to it for long enough.\u2019\n\nThe nuclear exclusion zone around the area where the 1986 catastrophe took place has become a tourist hotspot in recent times, particularly following the success of a TV show about the incident.\n\nAnd fascination with the disaster has led to a resurgence in interest in the people that still live there and the objects and wildlife left behind.\n\nBut the contents of this latest find remain a mystery.\n\nMr Ansell said he wasn\u2019t interested in trying to find out what was in the bag (Picture: Neil Ansell/Caters News)\n\nThe reading (a different one to that shown here) was nearly 200 times stronger than an adult CT scan (Picture: Neil Ansell/Caters News)\n\nMr Ansell added: \u2018We\u2019re still not sure what exactly was in the bag, even our tour guide didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t interested in trying to find out either as if we\u2019d touched or inhaled it, it could have been fatally dangerous.\n\n\u2018I felt really emotional after leaving Chernobyl as it has become a ghost town where it was once a lively town.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
