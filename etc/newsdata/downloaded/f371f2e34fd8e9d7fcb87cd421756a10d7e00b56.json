She called him a terrorist-supporting loser. And on it went Thursday between Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney in the latest Republican contest to influence \u2014 or just figure out \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nAt issue are weighty matters of war, America\u2019s role in Afghanistan and, more broadly, the world. Paul has long tried to persuade Trump to trust his \u201cAmerica First\u201d instincts and downscale U.S. military actions in places like Afghanistan and Syria. But others with Trump\u2019s ear, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have counseled a more traditional GOP approach to foreign affairs. With Trump ousting hard-line national security adviser John Bolton this week \u2014 a firing Paul celebrated \u2014 more hawkish lawmakers are concerned about what comes next, particularly on Iran, where Trump seems eager to deal.\n\nBut the weighty philosophical questions gave way to an ugly Twitter spat between Paul and Cheney, with a throng of observers chiming in on which political scion Trump likes and even \u201cloves\u201d more. Not helping calm things was the fallout from Trump\u2019s cancellation of a Taliban meeting at Camp David that had been set to take place just days before the nation observed the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nCheney on Sept. 8 lined up with Bolton against Trump\u2019s Taliban meeting, tweeting: \u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11. No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

I stand with @realdonaldtrump on ending wars.\u201d\n\nCheney shot back: \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul, who seems to have forgotten that today is 9/11.\u201d\n\nFor the record, both Cheney and Paul have opposed Trump at various times \u2014 something they would have in common if they became colleagues in the Senate. While Cheney has ascended to the third spot in House Republican leadership, she has the option of running for an open Senate seat in Wyoming in 2020. Paul, meanwhile, is not up for reelection next year, but he does not tend to walk away from fights.\n\nThis one is tinged by political legacies. Paul, a libertarian, is the son of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. Cheney\u2019s interventionist approach echoes that of her father, Dick Cheney, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s vice president on 9/11.\n\nAdd the party\u2019s battle over whether the U.S. should continue to fight in Afghanistan, site of the longest war in American history. Both U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been strong proponents of dealing with the Taliban, an approach Bolton loudly opposed. That contributed to Bolton\u2019s firing.\n\nThere\u2019s long been guesswork involved in determining what the president\u2019s foreign policy is. Trump has regularly griped that the U.S. is paying too much to help keep world peace. And he\u2019s backtracked or shifted U.S. policy toward North Korea, Iran and Syria so often that he has left friends and foes seeking coherence.\n\nBack home in the president\u2019s own party, those dynamics erupted this week on his favorite medium between Paul and Liz Cheney, the faces of Republican isolationists and interventionists, respectively. By Thursday, as the virtual shoving match approached 24 hours old, the two were still dishing out a rapid-fire series of hold-my-drink burns.\n\nFrom Paul:\n\nFrom Cheney:\n\nThe Kentucky Republican senator then invoked Cheney\u2019s father:\n\nAnd the retort:\n\nPaul then put together a multi-tweet thread compiling what he described as the Cheneys\u2019 opposition to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first policies.\u201d He ended on a tweet from Trump himself, naturally:\n\nAnd the retort (again):\n\nBut while Paul might have taken that breath for a minute, he wasn\u2019t done altogether. As of Friday afternoon, he\u2019d lobbed the ball back into Cheney\u2019s court once more:\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Republican Sen. Rand Paul and Rep.
