Even at the lower figure, that\u2019s largest odds for a favorite since the 2007 Boston Red Sox were -240 favorites over the Colorado Rockies.\n\nFor the uninitiated, lines bigger than -200 are rarely seen at this level because people don\u2019t often think things will be so lopsided. The implied odds from a -220 line is that the Astros will win 68.8 percent of the time \u2014 70.1 percent if you use the Caesars line. And given how talented the Washington Nationals are, that seems very high.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nShould the Astros be this heavily favored?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue that the Astros shouldn\u2019t be the favorites in the Fall Classic. It\u2019s entirely possible that they\u2019ve got the top two Cy Young Award finishers, the MVP and the Rookie of the Year, and that\u2019s before getting to Jos\u00e9 Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa, Michael Brantley and Zack Greinke.\n\nThe Astros led baseball with 107 wins, and the numbers showed even more dominance. They led all teams with 66.2 WAR, which was 7.4 more than the second-place New York Yankees.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to sleep on the Nats, especially given their playoff history. Washington had never won a postseason series before this month and constantly failed to meet expectations. Still, that\u2019s no reason to ignore how talented they are this year even after letting go of one of the game\u2019s best players.\n\nThe Astros are the heaviest World Series favorites in over a decade. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nationals are potentially the only team that can match Houston in starting pitching. Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez have combined to give up just nine runs in 54.2 innings in October. Patrick Corbin has been the weak link with a 7.43 ERA, but seven of his runs came from one ill-fated relief outing.\n\nWashington too has star hitters with Anthony Rendon, Juan Soto, Trea Turner and the suddenly resurgent Howie Kendrick. The big difference, though, is in relief, where the Nats had a 29th-ranked 5.68 ERA, while the Astros ranked second at 3.75.\n\nHouston still deserves to be favored, but it\u2019s probably closer to the 60 percent favorites that FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elo ratings say. That would put their odds at -150, which is within 15 points of each of the last three World Series favorites.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "At -220, the implied odds say that the Astros have a 68.8 percent chance of winning the World Series.", "authors": ["Ben Weinrib"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.YF2BJaiFOlHaOTjMH1azw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MCOEYZJ_YDt9FbjneKZ6nQ--~B/aD0yNjcwO3c9NDAwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a6582560-f33d-11e9-b1f9-36d3cd38aa75", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
