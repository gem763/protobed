The 2016 precedent. Finally, President Trump\u2019s offense here was, at most, to leverage his power to advance his political ambitions \u2014 in a manner that was minor, temporary, and without effect. It does not hold a candle to what Democrats did in 2016, when the incumbent administration placed the intelligence and law-enforcement apparatus of the government in the service of the Democrats\u2019 agenda to win the election and, failing that, to suffocate Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 an enterprise that energetically exploited the Obama administration\u2019s conduct of foreign relations. Tellingly, Democrats oppose any investigation of that scheme, let alone accountability or impeachment for any participant.\n\nThe president and his supporters are wont to say that the Democrats\u2019 exploitation of presidential powers for partisan political purposes is the worst abuse of power since Watergate. If it is proved, it may well be \u2014 we\u2019ll have to see what the Justice Department\u2019s investigations establish. For myself, though, I don\u2019t see how one can condemn what happened in 2016, yet not see any problem whatsoever with President Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine \u2014 even with the caveat that to portray the Ukraine excesses as grist for impeachment is overkill.\n\nThat caveat is the president\u2019s best foot forward in opposing impeachment. It is also the best reason why Democrats should stand down. Ukraine seems like an effective campaign issue for them, especially if Joe Biden is not the nominee. As the basis for putting the country through an impeachment crisis, though, it is likely to explode on them.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Mccarthy", "Nationalreview.Com The-Presidents-Best-Ukraine-Defense-Not-An-Impeachable-Offense"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
