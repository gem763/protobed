REUTERS/Aziz Taher\n\nTo her colleagues in the Future Syria Party and Kurdish communities in Syria\u2019s northeast more broadly, her killing became a symbol of betrayal by the United States.\n\nAs recently as Oct. 3, State Department officials reassured her at a meeting that Washington would safeguard northern Syria from a threatened Turkish assault by mediating between Kurdish-led forces and Ankara, according to a colleague who was present.\n\nA state department official said the U.S. message to Syrian partners had been consistent: that American forces would be withdrawing from the country.\n\nDays after the meeting, President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces would quit the region, leaving it vulnerable to attack by Turkey.\n\nKurdish fighters in northeast Syria, key allies in the U.S. battle against Islamic State, said rebels fighting on the Turkish side murdered Khalaf. She was 34.\n\nShe was slain on Oct. 12 along with a driver and aide when Turkey-backed fighters stopped their SUV on the M4 highway in northern Syria, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and officials in her party.\n\nThe spokesman for the Turkey-backed Syrian rebel force, the National Army, at the time denied its fighters killed her, saying they had not advanced as far as the M4.\n\nLast week, the spokesman, Youssef Hammoud, said the incident was being investigated among other \u201cbreaches\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf America hadn\u2019t decided to withdraw, these factions ... would not have dared to carry out their operations in that area,\u201d said Moaz Abdul Karim, a Future Syria Party leader.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has said it was looking into reports of Khalaf\u2019s death apparently while in the hands of Turkey-backed forces, calling the reports \u201cextremely troubling\u201d.\n\nAn autopsy report circulated by the SDF said Khalaf\u2019s body had been riddled with bullets.\n\nAMERICAN ASSURANCES\n\nOn Oct. 3, U.S. State Department representatives visited the Future Syria Party\u2019s headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and told Khalaf and party president Ibrahim al-Kaftan that American efforts in the region were aimed at mediation.\n\nSince the party was founded in 2018, its leaders say U.S. officials have voiced their support. The party aims to attract members from across the ethnic spectrum in a region where critics said the Kurdish YPG militia had become too powerful.\n\n\u201cYes, there was encouragement from the Americans to set up a party,\u201d Kaftan said.\n\n\u201cThe party was already being worked on by a team who believes in Syrian democracy. It was a Syrian idea, not an American one, but I repeat they were in favour of this idea,\u201d he told Reuters in written answers to questions.\n\nU.S. forces withdrew from a section of the border on Oct. 7, and soon afterwards Turkish troops mounted their third incursion into northern Syria since 2016.\n\nAnkara views the YPG as a terrorist threat due to their links to a Kurdish insurgency at home. It has also said its operation in Syria was designed to create a buffer where some of the 3.6 million refugees who fled the Syrian conflict into Turkey could be re-settled.\n\nDEEPLY INVOLVED\n\nA civil engineer by training, Khalaf was deeply involved in the politics of northeast Syria from the earliest days of the war, now in its eighth year.\n\nAfter leaving her job as a state employee, she helped to set up the Kurdish-led administration whose influence would eventually stretch over one third of Syria including predominantly Arab areas.\n\nIn 2018, she was elected secretary general of the Future Syria Party, which was launched from Raqqa, a predominantly Arab city where the SDF defeated IS in 2017 with U.S. backing.\n\nKaftan, an Arab architect from Manbij, was elected its leader, and he said that U.S. and French officials attended the ceremony.\n\nThe United States has long adopted a cautious political approach towards northern Syria, even as it backed the SDF militarily in the fight against IS.\n\nWashington opposed the emergence of the Kurdish-led autonomous region and the main Kurdish groups were always kept out of the U.N. political process for Syria, despite their huge influence on the ground.\n\nBut according to Kaftan, U.S. officials including the envoy for Syria James Jeffrey told members of his party that it would have a role in international talks over Syria\u2019s future.\n\nThe State Department official said the United States wanted a political solution to Syria\u2019s conflict that included \u201cfull representation for all Syrians.\n\n\u201cU.S. officials, including Ambassador Jeffrey, made clear that this included the populations of northeast Syria and intervened repeatedly with the UN to this end.\u201d\n\nThe fate of Kurds in northern Syria is now more uncertain than it has been for years. Stripped of U.S. protection, the SDF struck a deal for Syrian government forces to deploy into the region it controlled.\n\nThe SDF says Washington has stabbed it in the back.\n\nKurds living in Lebanon hold Hevrin Khalaf's picture, a Kurdish politician who was killed in Syria, during a protest against Turkey's military action in northeastern Syria, in Beirut, Lebanon October 13, 2019.

REUTERS/Aziz Taher\n\nDespite the Turkish incursion, which has sparked an exodus and killed scores of people, leaders of Future Syria Party hope it will have a role in shaping the next phase of Syria\u2019s recovery from war.\n\nKhalaf always believed the solution in Syria must come through dialogue with all concerned parties including the Syrian government and Turkey, Kaftan said.\n\n\u201cHevrin didn\u2019t sleep more than 4-5 hours a day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she would always say Syria deserves a lot from us, and for the people who have suffered through nine years of war, we must seek to secure a real, safe future for them.\u201d", "description": "Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf spent the final months of her life building a political party that she hoped would help shape Syria's future, drawing the attention of U.S. officials who said it would have a say in what happened once the war ended.", "authors": ["Tom Perry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443734227&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L12S", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
