It contains 600 different collections that are organized across 85 kilometers of shelving.\n\nFrancis noted that the archive has long been open to scholars and that he himself has decreed that the archives of World War II-era Pope Pius XII (pictured), accused by some of not speaking out enough about the Holocaust, would be open to researchers ahead of schedule on March 2, 2020\n\nLocated inside the Apostolic Palace, the archive contains a series of reading rooms and a two-storey 'bunker' of reinforced cement.\n\nThe most precious documents, including ancient gold-plated manuscripts and the acts of the Inquisition trial against Galileo Galilei - are held in secure, climatized rooms where humidity is controlled.\n\nIt was Pope Leon VIII who in 1881 opened the archive's doors to researchers, and currently an estimated 1,500-a-year are allowed inside.\n\nCurrently the most recent papacy available to scholars is that of Pope Pius XI, who died in 1939. The usual practice of the Holy See has been to wait 70 years until after the conclusion of a papacy to open up that pontificate's archives.\n\nBut that would have meant the archives of Pius XII, who reigned from 1939-1958, wouldn't have been available to scholars until 2028 at the earliest.\n\nThe Holy See has been under pressure to organise and catalogue the Pius XII collection faster to make it available to researchers while Holocaust survivors are still alive.\n\nFrancis cited the Pius XIII opening in explaining his rationale for the name change, while lamenting how the original Latin name 'Archivium Secretum' - meant solely to mean that the archive was private and separate - had taken on almost sinister implications that the Holy See had secrets to hide.\n\nLocated inside the Apostolic Palace, the archive contains a series of reading rooms and a two-storey 'bunker' of reinforced cement.
