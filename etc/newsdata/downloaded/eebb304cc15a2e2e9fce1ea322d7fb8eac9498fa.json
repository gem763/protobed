REUTERS/Amit Dave/Files\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - India\u2019s civil aviation regulator on Monday ordered IndiGo to modify its 16 Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines, linked to in-flight shutdowns, within 15 days to avoid their grounding.\n\nIndiGo\u2019s planes fitted with Pratt & Whitney 1100 series engines that have clocked more than 2,900 hours must have at least one modified engine, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement.\n\nThe restrictions come days after India\u2019s top airline, owned by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss hurt by higher maintenance costs from leasing A320ceo planes to fill a gap caused by the grounding of A320neo due to engine issues.\n\nThe airline said \u201cit will cooperate with authorities and will comply with the next course of action.\u201d\n\nIndiGo is Airbus\u2019 biggest client for the A320neo planes and while the United Technologies\u2019 Pratt & Whitney engines are fuel-efficient they have consistently caused issues since they entered into service in 2016, forcing IndiGo to ground its planes several times.\n\nThe DGCA said it found three in-flight engine shutdowns on the planes in October following which it reviewed maintenance and safety data at the airline.\n\nEarlier this year, the DGCA had directed airlines to make extra checks on their A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines as part of new safety protocols after temporary grounding orders affected the planes last year.", "description": "India's civil aviation regulator on Monday ordered IndiGo to modify its 16 Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines, linked to in-flight shutdowns, within 15 days to avoid their grounding.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445878864&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R15F", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
