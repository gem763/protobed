But US already has socialism \u2013 for the rich", "language": "en", "text": "Nearly three-quarters of young Americans are likely to vote for a socialist candidate, a new poll reveals, suggesting capitalism has lost its appeal. But is it really capitalism when government funds all but the working class?\n\nYoung Americans view socialism much more favorably than their elders, with 70 percent likely to vote for a socialist, according to a poll released on Monday by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. The survey also found that 50 percent of millennials (aged 23 to 38) have an unfavorable view of capitalism. Only Generation Z (aged 16 to 22) was more anti-capitalist \u2013 51 percent view the economic system negatively.\n\nAlso on rt.com Today's protests indicate the scale of troubles in our paradise (by Slavoj Zizek)\n\nWhile the organization\u2019s name betrays its spin on these statistics, its pearl-clutching takes leaves out the fact that the American system has become more and more socialist over the years, to the point where the only group that does not benefit from socialist policies is the working class. A system in which the government bails out banks, subsidizes Big Oil, and pours billions of dollars into private military contractors free to set their prices as high as they wish may not be socialist in name, but it certainly isn\u2019t how capitalism was imagined.\n\nAmericans can't be blamed for resenting a system that has saddled them with crippling debt, from student loans to medical bills to credit cards often maxed out in an effort to juggle the former - but any resemblance to capitalism is coincidental. Americans have socialism for the rich, while ordinary people are taught their failure to thrive in a rigged economy is their fault alone.\n\nThe 2017 Trump tax cuts further accelerated a decades-old trend of trickle-up economics, in which the wealth of working people has steadily consolidated in the hands of the .01 percent. The 500 richest families in the US now pay a lower tax rate than the working class \u2013 assuming, of course, that they pay taxes at all.\n\nCapitalism\u2019s defenders wax poetic about free markets, but there\u2019s nothing free about a healthcare system in which patients are penalized for not buying in, as Obamacare was initially designed. That system has seen prices skyrocket as insurance companies are free to foist exorbitant premiums on customers who have no choice but to buy. Progressives calling for Medicare for All are merely seeking to extend the socialization of healthcare to the people who are supposed to benefit from it \u2013 the patients.\n\nAlso on rt.com Lecturing the \u2018peons\u2019? Pelosi mocked for blaming voter disenchantment on outside forces who \u2018poisoned\u2019 social media\n\nIn the same way, military contractors that corner the market on certain proprietary parts are free to set their prices as high as they wish, and any lawmaker who cries foul on the ever-expanding military budget is slammed as unpatriotic. This model gives Americans hideously expensive yet barely functional \u201cinnovations\u201d like the F-35, which costs over a trillion dollars to develop but can\u2019t fly in the rain.\n\nThe banking sector was the beneficiary of socialism in 2008, when the government pumped $700 billion in taxpayer dollars directly into banks that had grown fat on so-called \u201ctoxic assets,\u201d including bundles of bad mortgages from people who ended up losing their homes to foreclosure. The people didn\u2019t get bailouts that could have kept roofs over their heads \u2013 that would be socialism!\n\nEnergy companies receive some $20 billion in taxpayer-funded subsidies every year, a 2017 report found. President Trump may boast of the US\u2019 \u201cenergy independence,\u201d but the companies that create that energy are thoroughly dependent on Uncle Sam to keep them afloat.\n\nWhat little social safety net there is in the US benefits only the poorest of the poor, with income caps that exclude most employed people making above minimum wage. As a result, the working class \u2013 traditionally, at least in theory, the beneficiaries of socialism \u2013 is the only group that doesn\u2019t get to enjoy its fruits in this upside-down system.\n\nYoung people are right to be disgusted with what passes for capitalism in the US. Most developed nations have figured out how to combine elements of socialism with a market economy in a way that benefits everyone \u2013 it\u2019s time the US catches up to them.\n\nBy Helen Buyniski, RT", "description": "Nearly three-quarters of young Americans are likely to vote for a socialist candidate, a new poll reveals, suggesting capitalism has lost its appeal.
