As recently as a year ago, when he was just another NYU undergrad, he might very well have walked by and gotten a glimpse of a tableau like this from the outside-in. That sort of thing has been happening a lot lately \u2013 finding himself on the other side of a scene he\u2019s witnessed over and over again.\n\nBeyond Ken Loach: where have the social-realists in cinema gone? Read more\n\nYoumans has come directly from the airport, having just returned from the New Orleans film festival, where his debut feature Burning Cane landed a plum showing at the Orpheum Theater. The Crescent City native has a specific memory to go with this one: \u201cI remember going to see A Ciambra, Jonas Carpignano\u2019s movie about the Romani people in Italy, at the Orpheum a couple years ago. I never imagined I\u2019d play there one day. I couldn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nLife has gotten very surreal very quickly for Youmans, who went from another teenager with big dreams to a bona fide artist, becoming the first black director to win the best US narrative feature award at the Tribeca film festival before nabbing a distribution deal from Ava DuVernay\u2019s company. His story, that of a resourceful and determined kid going full DIY to accomplish something plenty of adults spend their entire lives trying to complete, has an instant boy-wonder hook. But beyond all the precocity, beyond his narrative, beyond the satisfying uncanniness of getting VIP treatment at places he once paid to enter, there\u2019s a movie. And it\u2019s a shockingly good one.\n\nYoumans drew on his experiences growing up in Louisiana and its Baptist churches for the worshipful yet critical Burning Cane. It paints a portrait of the struggles of those attending a sweltering service every Sunday in the deep south, focusing on a mother concerned for her son and his burgeoning drinking problem. The poetic look at all that this corner of Christianity has to offer \u2013 solidarity and strength, though not without prejudice and reactionary thinking \u2013 began as a short when he was only 16, though he just used that as a concept for the full-length project in his head. \u201cI\u2019d decided that this was what I wanted to do,\u201d Youmans says, \u201cso I just had tunnel vision. I had to make this happen.\u201d\n\nSo he did, though, of course, that was much easier said than done. The biggest hurdle standing between most first-timers and the realization of their vision has always been money, and that was no different in Youmans\u2019 case. He cobbled together a budget by taking a little here and a little there. \u201cI put all of my savings into the film, which was around twenty-five hundred bucks,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cashed out a lot of savings bonds that I\u2019d gotten from family members. I was working at a beignet stand in City Park that\u2019s no longer in operation now; it turned into another Caf\u00e9 du Monde. It was quick, and a lot of cash for a high school job. I was stacking that up in the months leading to principal photography, and then me and my producer Mose Mayer started an Indiegogo. Started pooling from my family, some of Mose\u2019s family donated a bit too, and that was enough to get us through production. We never had extra funds. There was a lot of stuff we needed to get for free.\u201d\n\nThe generosity of kindred Louisiana locals, admiring the gumption and ambition of Youmans\u2019 crackerjack operation, took him far. (\u201cPeople take care of each other around New Orleans,\u201d he says.) The jack-of-all-trades spent most of what he had on locations, from a Thibodaux sugar plantation complete with standing slaves\u2019 quarters to the Mount Sinai Baptist church in Algiers, but shot in many places for free. He found collaborators in friends, family, family friends and friends\u2019 families. Everything started to get real when he landed Wendell Pierce, a TV veteran and the most well-known name in the cast, through a favor from a stranger.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wendell Pierce plays the pastor in Burning Cane. Photograph: Array Releasing\n\n\u201cI was waiting on a woman named Lula one day at the beignet stand, and she\u2019d gone to Nocca (New Orleans Center for Creative Arts) too,\u201d Youmans explains. \u201cI got to chatting with her, she asked me what I wanted to do with my life, and I told her about the film. I was saying that I\u2019d cast every role except the pastor, because we had been looking at one actor whose schedule didn\u2019t really work, and she said that she knew Wendell. When she brought him up, I was shocked, because I didn\u2019t think his echelon of talent and success was one I was even allowed to approach. But she said he was cool, and she texted him right there and he gave me his email. I sent him the script, then immediately emailed again and told him not to read it, so I could expand his role.\u201d\n\nHe had the advantage of attending classes part-time at Nocca, a well-regarded arts school for those students demonstrating promise at a young age. \u201cTo be completely transparent, I did a lot of this during class,\u201d Youmans laughs. \u201cI went to two high schools, doing a half-day program; I\u2019d leave Ben Franklin and then do the rest of my day at Nocca. I got so much done at Franklin while I was supposed to be paying attention. My grades suffered some, and in my junior year too. But it really does feel like it\u2019s the easiest to concentrate on something when you should be concentrating on something else!\u201d\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was Benh Zeitlin, Sundance darling and the director of 2012\u2019s Oscar-nominated Beasts of the Southern Wild. Youmans threw a Hail Mary and sent Zeitlin an out-of-the-blue direct message via Instagram, having found an account mentioning the film-maker\u2019s production company in its bio. To his surprise, Zeitlin wrote back expressing great interest in helping out and scaling up, and went on to become a \u201cmentor\u201d, as Youmans puts it.\n\n\u201cHe gave a lot of face time, sitting through the edit, helping me along. For a director to do that, while at the same time working on his own movie, that meant the world. That would\u2019ve been enough, and then he also advocated for us to get this grant that changed everything. We got a cash award from CreateLouisiana, but the biggest thing that came with that was editing space at Second Line Stages, and color-correction as well as photochemical work \u2026 This was the next level.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phillip Youmans is the 19-year-old director of Burning Cane.

During one morning\u2019s psychology class, he snuck a peek at his emails to find the director of programming asking if they could host his world premiere. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Holy fucking shit\u2019,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went to the bathroom, called three people, came back to class frozen. I kept refreshing my phone, making sure it was real. After that, I left class walking blindly, nowhere in particular.\u201d\n\nHe bagged the best narrative feature prize and Pierce earned best actor, identifying their film as the runaway success of the festival. Ava DuVernay\u2019s company Array took notice and offered Youmans a deal he could feel good about. \u201cI thought they were an interesting distributor, seriously dedicated to promoting black voices and female film-makers. They put that front and center, and this is unapologetically a southern black story, so Array was the perfect home for it. And, I\u2019d add to that, Ava\u2019s a real one.\u201d\n\nYoumans went on to enroll in NYU\u2019s famed film program as his film made the rounds on the festival circuit, but as the whirlwind picked up, he decided to take a semester off. Now, he\u2019s thinking he\u2019ll probably join the esteemed ranks of such Tisch dropouts as Paul Thomas Anderson and John Waters instead of finishing up the four-year degree. He\u2019s already made plans for his next feature, a movie about the Black Panther chapter in New Orleans during 1978 that will be well-funded enough to capitalize on Louisiana\u2019s generous tax break programs. Why bother preparing for a career he\u2019s already started?\n\nHe\u2019s not concerned about the reputation of a wunderkind weighing him down as he moves forward; if the novelty of his youth brings more attention to his work, no objections there. One gets the sense he\u2019ll have a long career over which to prove that he deserves his place in the business. He\u2019s on the inside of the industry he\u2019s spent the entirety of his brief life gazing at, and he\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cI want to make a movie, then another movie, then another movie, then hopefully another movie, and then after that, another movie,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d", "description": "Phillip Youmans used his own savings to make his award-winning debut film, attracting the attention of Ava DuVernay", "authors": ["Charles Bramesco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ed396eff2a6efb63cda763b9a54689d55058634/0_158_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6cadbb4994a083a3f2b13a7aa16df99d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
