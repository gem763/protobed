I have been selling property for 49 years, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of selling some beauties and this one is definitely up there,\u201d said Tony Gardner of Gardner Property Agents.\n\nMr Gardner said he expects the rare listing, which only came on the market this week, will sell in the \u201c$3 million range\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut just how high into the threes, I don\u2019t yet. We\u2019ll have to test the market to know exactly where the interest lies,\u201d he added.\n\nThe home was designed for James Crawford, an old school over-achiever who was not only a wealthy pastoralist with properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory.\n\nHe was also a justice of the peace in three states, a founding member of the St George Sailing Club, the first president of Sandringham Public School\u2019s Parents and Citizens association as well as being on the committee of the St George Cottage Hospital.\n\nAfter WWI broke out, Crawford even carved off six blocks of land from the Fontainbleau estate to allow returning ex-servicemen or war widows to build homes. He was so revered in the local neighbourhood that Crawford Rd in nearby Brighton Le Sands was named after him.\n\nIn the years that followed the property was passed to members of the family then sold and subdivided.\n\nToday the home still retains many of its character features including high pressed metal ceilings, marble and timber fireplaces, tessellated floor tiles and stained glass windows.\n\nIn addition to the six (possibly seven bedrooms) Fontainbleau has a grand lounge room, large formal dining room, a study or library, a \u201cChina room\u201d, music room and rolling landscaped gardens on a 1265sq m block beyond the stately entrance gates and circular driveway.\n\nThe more modern rear extension includes contemporary dining, living and family areas as well as an open plan kitchen with water views.\n\nFontainbleau is just one of many heritage homes to be listed this week, the list goes on across the country from inner city charmers to country estates;\n\nCamperdown, Victoria\n\nYear: 1897\n\nBuilt by the same architect who designed Camperdown\u2019s landmark clock tower, Keeyuga is a grand home that has been restored to its former glory. It has four bedrooms and is packed with features from yesteryear including five fireplaces, stained glass windows, Victorian era gargoyles and its own tower room.\n\nLewisham, NSW\n\nYear: 1910.\n\nThe gorgeous Avoca has been owned by the same family since the early 1930s, when the freestanding, federation home was purchased with the proceeds of a lottery win. The charming home still retains the historic architecture and original features exclusive to the period, while combing those with contemporary living demands including security lighting, reverse cycle airconditioning and solar water heating.\n\nThe conveniently located property features two bedrooms with separate sitting and dining rooms and an additional sunroom. On a rare 443 sq m block, the garden is bathed in sunlight for much of the year and the main bathroom remains true to its origins.\n\nThornlands, Queensland\n\nYear: 1876\n\nHawstead is not what it appears to be. The original Queenslander was built by Colonel Edward Drury in 1876 on the edge of the Brisbane River, but was later relocated to its current spot in Thornlands on a grand 6994q m block.\n\nDespite its journey, all the original features remain including the bullnose verandah, wide timber floors rest, ornate fretwork breezeways and stained glass windows.

The heritage-listed Victorian residence was built for tailor Robert Love, by his son and therefore earned the nickname \u2018The Tailor\u2019s House\u2019. It features all the classic traits of a grand Queenslander with loads of mod cons from solar panels to Sonos surround sound plus a self-contained cottage out the back.\n\nElizabeth Bay, NSW\n\nYear: c1868\n\nA landmark waterfront home on Sydney\u2019s famous harbour, Tresco has just been relisted after last asking around $50 million two years ago.
