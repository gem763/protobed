In the end, she too betrays him, leaving him chattering in the cold, waiting for what will never arrive.\n\nLucy retrieves her brother at 4 a.m., leads him home and puts him to bed. In one of the most tender moments ever captured on TV, she takes off his socks, for only when the feet are free can the spirit rest. Though Linus has been disappointed and his god has not risen, he sleeps the sleep of the righteous. It\u2019s the same sleep as that of the fisherman at the end of \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d; he\u2019s spent and the sharks have devoured the marlin, but the prize was never the catch. It was the quest, the effort and the suffering.\n\nIn the final scene, Charlie Brown tries to console Linus about his wasted night in the pumpkin patch by saying, \u201cI did a lot of stupid things in my life, too.\u201d This enrages Linus, who vows to find an \u201ceven more sincere\u201d pumpkin patch next year. Experience is no match for faith.\n\nFor many viewers, the special might offer a pagan vision. Schulz himself, who taught Sunday school and clearly drew on Christianity in constructing the scenario (Gethsemane, death and resurrection), didn\u2019t shy away from this interpretation. As described in David Michaelis\u2019s biography \u201cSchulz and \u2018Peanuts,\u2019\u201d the artist once responded to a letter writer by agreeing with her assertion that the Great Pumpkin was \u201c sacrilegious .\u201d His intent, he wrote, was to use the pumpkin deity as a metaphor for Santa Claus.\n\nJohn Updike dismissed \u201cThe Great Pumpkin\u201d as \u201ctravesty if not blasphemy.\u201d Not long ago, I came across a sermon online that used the special to demonstrate the fate of those who worship false gods. Linus follows a nature god instead of Jesus, and look where it leaves him? Chattering alone in the cold.\n\nAccording to the sermon, \u201cLinus\u2019s belief is one of the most common beliefs about religion: It does not matter what a person believes in. As long as they are sincere in their belief, the object of their faith is irrelevant and their faith is legitimate. Because the Great Pumpkin never shows, Schulz, simply and brilliantly, communicates sincerity is worthless if the object of faith is false.\u201d\n\nBut to me, the sincerity in \u201cThe Great Pumpkin\u201d is key and is what has drawn me to its magic year after year . It\u2019s what you believe but also the sincerity of that belief that can give your life meaning. Sincere belief can order an otherwise formless succession of days, and it is meaningful days, collected together, that add up to a meaningful life.", "description": "His unwavering belief in the Halloween deity has drawn me to the 1966 \u201cPeanuts\u201d special year after year.", "authors": ["Rich Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/31/opinion/31cohen-1/31cohen-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
