Both the French firm and the former president deny any wrongdoing.\n\n- 'Still going to drag' -\n\nState lawyer Wim Trengove had argued that if Zuma did not stand trial it gave the impression that he had received special treatment \"because he is an important and a powerful man\".\n\nHe also said Zuma's claims that he was a victim of a \"witch hunt\" were unfounded.\n\nZuma is alleged to have taken the bribes during his time as a provincial economy minister and later as deputy leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in the 1990s.\n\nThe case has been much delayed -- the charges were first brought against Zuma in 2005. They were dropped by prosecutors in 2009, shortly before Zuma became president, and reinstated in 2016.\n\nThe judges blamed both Zuma and the state for the \"systemic\" delays, saying that \"both parties are equally liable as they both participated in the litigation leading to the delay\".\n\nHowever they said they were satisfied that the delays would not prejudice the trial.\n\nThales said in a statement that it \"notes the decision of the High Court\" and was assessing its legal options.\n\nSouth Africa's main opposition party the Democratic Alliance welcomed the court's decision, saying \"that Zuma will eventually have to face his day in court\".\n\nBut political analyst Xolani Dube warned that Zuma could lodge an \"urgent\" appeal.\n\n\"There are also other avenues that the man might still use... he can still appeal so it's still going to drag,\" Dube told AFP, adding that the country may \"not yet see him facing his alleged deeds\".\n\nZuma claimed last year that he was so broke that he had to sell his socks to raise legal fees, after another court ruled he should front the bills.\n\n- Other corruption claims -\n\nThe ruling ANC party forced Zuma to resign over another corruption scandal centred around the wealthy Gupta business family, who won lucrative contracts with state companies and allegedly held sway over his choice of cabinet ministers.\n\nThe court's ruling on Friday came just a day after the US Treasury slapped sanctions on the three Indian-born Gupta brothers, calling them a \"significant corruption network\" that dispersed bribes and misappropriated millions in state funds.\n\nZuma also appeared before a judicial inquiry in July that is probing allegations he organised a systematic plunder of government coffers in a scandal known as \"state capture\".\n\nA few days later he pulled out of the inquiry, saying that he had been \"treated as someone who was accused\". But he later agreed to return at a future date.\n\nZuma's successor as president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to tackle corruption in South Africa, which has been led by the ANC since Nelson Mandela came to power in 1994 after the end of apartheid.", "description": "South Africa's scandal-plagued former president Jacob Zuma will face a corruption trial, a court ruled Friday, in one of multiple alleged graft cases over his long political career.
