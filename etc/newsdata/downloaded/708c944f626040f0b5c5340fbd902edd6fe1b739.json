But the coach said Captain Cool's decision to quit is his own.\n\nIn an interview, Shastri slammed those raising questions on the lack of clarity over Dhoni's future suggesting, \u201cHalf the guys commenting on him can\u2019t even tie their shoelaces\u201d. The India head coach also suggested that Dhoni decided to leave Test cricket when he believed that Wriddhiman Saha was ready to take over. With the wicket-keeper's spot still up for grabs in limited-overs cricket, it's fair for Mahi to see off this transition period.\n\nBCCL\n\nDon't Miss 448 SHARES 506 SHARES 1.5 K SHARES 195 SHARES\n\n\u201cHalf the guys commenting on MS Dhoni can\u2019t even tie their shoelaces. Look at what he\u2019s achieved for the country. Why are people in a hurry to see him off? Maybe, they don\u2019t find enough talking points. He and everybody who knows him know he\u2019ll be going away soon. So, let it happen when it has to. Making statements at his expense is downright disrespectful. After 15 years of playing for India, wouldn\u2019t he know what\u2019s the right thing to do? When he retired from Test cricket, what did he say? That Wriddhiman Saha was good enough to be handed over the wicket-keeping gloves. He was correct,\u201d Shastri was quoted as saying by Times of India.\n\nShastri is also of the opinion that Dhoni might not have been an active part of the Indian team for a while now but he has been there like a shadow. Citing the example of the veteran wicket-keeper batsman's meeting with debutant Shahbaz Nadeem in Ranchi, Shastri suggested that Dhoni knows exactly what he is doing and needs to be given the right to decide when he has to retire.\n\nBCCL\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a shadow when it comes to the team, always sharing his mind, lending his views. The other day, he came over to the dressing room in Ranchi to meet Shahbaz Nadeem and had a chat \u2014 how motivating is that for a guy making his debut at home. Let me say this: MS Dhoni has earned the right to retire when he wants to. And let this debate end once and for all,\u201d he further said.\n\nBCCI chief selector MSK Prasad had also recently given his take on the subject of MS Dhoni, suggesting India have 'moved on' from the 38-year-old and are looking at younger alternatives for the wicket-keeper's role.\n\nWith Inputs From TNN", "description": "Veteran Indian wicket-keeper batsman MS Dhoni made his first public appearance as he arrived at the JSCA Sports Complex in Ranchi to meet the members of the Indian team on Day 4 of the third Test against South Africa.
