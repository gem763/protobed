REUTERS/Andrew Cullen/File Photo\n\nRevenue from North America, which accounts for more than half of the company\u2019s total, fell 21% in the third quarter, primarily due to lower pressure pumping activity and pricing.\n\nHalliburton, the largest provider of hydraulic fracking fleets, said completion and production revenue fell 16% in the three months ended Sept. 30.\n\nLarger rival Schlumberger said on Friday it had recorded a $1.58 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its pressure pumping business in North America.\n\n\u201cThese results from Halliburton bring into crystal-clear focus the speed with which North America (NAM) land well construction and completion activity eroded during course of Q3,\u201d Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts wrote in a note.\n\nOilfield service providers are struggling with reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher buybacks and dividends rather than growth in a weak oil price environment.\n\nHalliburton was forced to cut 650 jobs across Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota amid the slowing oil and gas activity, while smaller rival ProPetro Holding Corp (PUMP.N) cut about 150 workers, sources told Reuters.\n\nNet profit attributable to Halliburton fell to $295 million, or 34 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $435 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts had on average estimated 34 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.\n\nRevenue fell to $5.55 billion, below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.81 billion.\n\nShares of the company were unchanged in premarket trading, having fallen about 31% so far this year through Friday\u2019s close.
