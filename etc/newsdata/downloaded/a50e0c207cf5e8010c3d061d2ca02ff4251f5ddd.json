While sweets seem harmless enough, your pet can\u2019t safely consume most store-bought sweets, and in some instances, the choice of lolly can even prove deadly.\n\nWhat sweets should you be wary of? Over at the Pet Poison Hotline\u2019s website, they\u2019ve assembled some tips on what your pet can\u2019t consume and what to do in an emergency.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nChocolate\n\nUnsurprisingly, chocolate is a no-go for most pets; chocolate contains compounds called methylxanthines, which include caffeine and theobromine, both of which are toxic to pets. As we\u2019ve written before, the dangers associated with chocolate \u2014 like hyperactivity, heart damage, seizures and death \u2014 depend on the size of the dog, the amount eaten, and the type of chocolate.\n\nIf your dog\u2019s small and has consumed several bars of dark chocolate, that\u2019s probably much more cause for concern than a large dog consuming a single crumb of milk or white chocolate. (White chocolate has almost no methylxanthines, while dark chocolate and baking chocolate are the most concentrated; generally, the darker or more bitter a given chocolate is, the more likely it is to be toxic.)\n\nDespite misconceptions, cats are also generally lactose-intolerant and might experience an upset stomach or diarrhoea after consuming any lollies with milk in them (including chocolate). While they may not require a visit to the vet, avoid giving cats any chocolate treats to prevent stomach issues.\n\nWhat to watch out for: Vomiting, diarrhoea, restlessness and increased urination.\n\nGrapes and sultanas\n\nIn case you\u2019re the healthy house on the block, grapes and sultanas aren\u2019t so great for pets, either \u2014 both have the potential to cause kidney failure in dogs, though it isn\u2019t known what causes them to be toxic nor the amount it would take to cause serious health issues. (In a story on the ASPCA\u2019s website, one small dog was poisoned after consuming 10 grapes.)\n\nWhat to watch out for: Vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, lethargy and severe kidney failure.\n\nLolly wrappers\n\nSo your dog has run off with a king-sized bar of Snickers. Aside from chocolate being toxic, the wrapper itself can cause serious issues to your pet\u2019s digestion. According to the Pet Poison Hotline, eating wrappers can cause bowel obstruction, which might necessitate surgery. A smaller lolly wrapper might be less cause for concern than a larger one, however, and will pass through your pet\u2019s digestion system as usual.\n\nWhat to watch out for: Vomiting, difficulty defecating, and decreased appetite.\n\nSugar-free products\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what xylitol is, here\u2019s a quick introduction; xylitol is a \u201csugar-free\u201d sweetener/substitute added to gums, mints, gummy vitamins, baked goods and even brands of peanut butter. It\u2019s generally a low-calorie alternative to sugar, so it\u2019s a pretty popular additive (and safer for diabetics). But xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs \u2014 a small amount could result in hypoglycemia, seizures, liver failure and even death.\n\nWhile you won\u2019t always find the exact amount of xylitol listed on the ingredients label of lolly, you should be wary of any lolly that contains xylitol or any sugar-free lollies in general. The effects of xylitol on cats aren\u2019t well-known. A small study suggests that it may not be as toxic to them, but why risk it?\n\nWhat to watch out for: Decreased activity, weakness, staggering, incoordination, collapse and seizures.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your pet and observe any of these symptoms in addition to foaming at the mouth, immediately find a vet; otherwise, contact the Pet Poison Hotline for resources in the event of an emergency.\n\nIn case you plan to dress up your pet, the organisation also warns against accidental ingestion of metallic beads, snaps or other small pieces that might pose digestion issues, as well as \u201cnon-toxic\u201d dyes that might still pose dangers to your pet. Always read the labels, and when in doubt, ditch the lolly or costume.", "description": "In case you feel tempted to give your pet lollies or chocolates this Halloween, here\u2019s a quick reminder: don\u2019t.
