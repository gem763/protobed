With the Republicans joining Democrats to condemn the president's policy, trump larked out in a tense white house meeting that descended into name-calling. Prompting a walkout from house speaker Nancy Pelosi who called the president's performance a meltdown. Our senior national correspondent Terry Moran starts us off from the white house. It was president trump's 1,000th day in office and it was a head spinner. Reporter: It surely was, George. It is a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington as you point out, strong majorities in both parties expressing outrage and dismay over the president's decision to abandon America's kurdish allies in northern Syria and stand by while Turkey invades and rampages through their enclave. This pits the president against not just Democrats but some of his closest Republican allies as the bitter clash is escalating. What you witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say. He was insulting particularly to the speaker. She kept her cool completely but he called her a third rate Reporter: Overnight after democratic leaders criticized president trump's behavior during a white house closed door meeting on Syria, the president tweeted out these photos sitting with stone-faced Democrats and asking, do you think they like me? And labeling this one of speaker Pelosi pointing at him across the table nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown. Speaker Pelosi seeing it differently responding by making that picture her background on Twitter. All this comes after another contentious day for the president. The ayes are 354. The nays are 60. Reporter: Both parties voting overwhelmingly to condemn his decision to pull American troops from northern Syria. I asked the president what his plan was to contain ISIS. He didn't really have one. He said the Turks and the Syrians will guard the ISIS prisoners. Reporter: Democratic sources claim trump downplayed his former defense secretary James Mattis' recent warnings about ISIS saying trump who once called him as a true general's general was now labeling Mattis the world's most overrated general saying he wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. But the president's handling of Syria continues to draw sharp criticism from some of his closest ally. This is a defining moment of his presidency. If we abandon the kurds it willing to our shame and national security detriment and trump will own the re-emergence of ISIS. Reporter: Trump firing back. Lindsey graham would like to stay in the Middle East for a thousand years. Reporter: Further distancing himself from the kurds who lost thousands in the fight against Nobody wants to say it. We're making the kurds look like they're angels an paid a lot of money to the kurds. Tremendous amounts. Reporter: The white house released a letter the president wrote to Turkey's president erdogan on October 9th which was sent after trump informed him he was moving troops out of the region. The president writing, you don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people and don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool. One congressman tweeting an image of the letter and writing, this is insane. Well, that letter didn't seem to have much impact. The bbc is reporting president erdogan thoroughly rejected president trump's letter and tossed it in the trash. What a day. Terry Moran, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described President Trump as having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d in a meeting on Syria as both Republicans and Democrats have rebuked Trump\u2019s policy.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191017_gma_moran1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
