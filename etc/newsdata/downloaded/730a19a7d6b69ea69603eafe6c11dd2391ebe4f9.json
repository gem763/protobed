Smell you later, bad fashion.", "language": "en", "text": "(CNN) Will Smith knows we're all obsessed with '90s reboots. It might be why he starred in the live-action \"Aladdin.\" But he's taking another stab at nostalgia-mongering, and this time, he's going home to Bel-Air.\n\nThat's right: Smith is rolling out a \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\"-themed clothing line to outfit the Fresh Princes and Princesses in your life.\n\nYou, too, can chill out, maxin', relaxin' all cool in a Bel-Air athletics sweatshirt or an acid-washed throwback tee with the fictional Smith clutching a basketball (it's what he was shootin' outside the school when he got in one little fight, remember? Then his mom got scared, and then she shipped him out West. You know, the impetus of the whole show!).\n\nSmell ya later, bad fashion.\n\nBut dressing like Smith's Philly-to-Cali basketball star doesn't come cheap. Socks are $15, shirts run $30 to $40 and hoodies, track pants and a custom Bel-Air basketball run $60 and up.\n\nSmith modeled the collection in an Instagram video, every bit the goofy dreamboat he was when the show ended more than two decades ago.", "description": "Will Smith is rolling out a \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\"-themed clothing line to outfit the Fresh Princes and Princesses in your life.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170804134551-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-super-tease.jpg"}
