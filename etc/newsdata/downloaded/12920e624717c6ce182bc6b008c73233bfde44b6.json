Sleepwalking.\n\nSleepwalk defence\n\nRandy said he\u2019d been prone to sleepwalking all his life and he must have stabbed Brooke to death in his sleep as he didn\u2019t remember doing it \u2013 and had no desire for her to be dead.\n\nOver the years, there have been several high-profile cases where the accused have used sleepwalking to justify their actions.\n\nIn 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his four-year-old son to death in North Carolina when he argued he was sleepwalking.\n\nWhile in 1999, Arizona man Scott Falater was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife Yarmila, after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.\n\nAt the trial this year, the prosecution dismissed his claim that Randy was sleepwalking when he stabbed Brooke with a hunting knife.\n\nThe cut between his left thumb and forefinger were \u2018consistent with his hand slipping on a wet knife and cutting himself\u2019.\n\nThere was no doubt it was Randy who had plunged the knife into Brooke more than 20 times.\n\nRandy took the stand and said he didn\u2019t remember killing Brooke but he must have been the culprit as he was the only one there.\n\n\u2018The next thing [I know], I\u2019m standing over the top of her and I have the knife in my hand, covered in blood,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I was confused.\n\n'Scared.\n\n'Didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n'Didn\u2019t know what happened.\u2019\n\nHis lawyer said that Randy had no motive and no history of violence and therefore should be found not guilty by reason of insanity because he suffered from parasomnia \u2013 a disruptive sleep disorder that can result in sleepwalking.\n\n\u2018There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,\u2019 his lawyer said.\n\nRandy\u2019s mum, Kathi Adams, testified that her son did sleepwalk as a child but Brooke\u2019s grieving sister, who had been living with them both for six months, said she\u2019d never seen him do it or heard him mention it.\n\nOne forensic psychiatrist said it wasn\u2019t possible to sleep through stabbing someone repeatedly and suggested the motive could have been sexual.\n\nThere was no sexual history between them \u2013 but according to Brooke, he had got naked the night before her death.\n\nWas there an unrequited attraction on Randy\u2019s part?\n\nDid he attack Brooke because she was leaving him?\n\nFirst-degree murder\n\nIn contrast, another expert claimed that it was possible to kill someone while sleepwalking.\n\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon that continues to be hotly debated and experts come down on both sides of the argument.\n\nThere was no clear motive so why would Randy kill his friend unless he wasn\u2019t aware? The jury didn\u2019t agree.\n\nRandy, 26, was found guilty of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nBrooke\u2019s sister was emotional as she made a statement and struggled to hold back her tears. Jordan said that nothing had been the same since Brooke was murdered.\n\n\u2018The last few years without her have been awful.\n\n'Our lives are totally different,\u2019 she said.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Brooke\u2019s dad John said, \u2018There\u2019s no winners in this whole situation.\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losers.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been revealed since the case that Randy\u2019s dad, Randy Herman Sr, 53, had been accused of shooting dead his girlfriend, Gail Monahan, 50, in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania, in 2015.\n\nTwo months after the death, officers were closing in and had an arrest warrant to bring him into custody, but Randy Sr was found dead inside a pickup truck after taking his own life.\n\nIt was a disturbing twist in the tale and another case with so many unanswered questions.\n\nFor Brooke, her life was ended just as it was about to start.\n\nRandy tried to justify the killing of his friend by saying he was asleep.\n\nBut his actions were a harrowing wake-up call for everyone about the man he really was.", "description": "Randy Herman, 24, killed his best friend and housemate Brooke Preston, 21, in West Palm Beach, Florida - but his defence was that he had been asleep at the time", "authors": ["Gail Shortland", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546684.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brooke-Preston-3JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
