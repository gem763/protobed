The mind simply needs to be trained to work for us rather than against us. The mind is a beautiful tool, organ and muscle in many ways, and what it needs is to be understood and trained. I avoid words that imply a struggle or a fight, because ultimately, it\u2019s all taking place within ourselves, and we don\u2019t want one part of us trying to suppress or vanquish another part. All parts of us need compassion and love, and to be seen.\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about controlling the mind, it\u2019s not about using a whip, or holding it in a vice-like grip. The goal is to train it to be a great tool in our hands rather than the master of the show. For example, we may say that we don\u2019t want our minds to be impacted by the outside world. Yet, taking cues from the world around us is what helps to keep us alive. For example, we step off the pavement to cross the street when suddenly, out of nowhere, a speeding car comes our way. If we\u2019ve quietened our mind so completely that it\u2019s not bothered by any external stimuli, we\u2019ll just walk right on to the path of the speeding car.\n\n\n\nWhat we\u2019re looking to do is train, rather than subdue.\n\n\n\nLet it pick up cues from the external world, whether through smell, sight or sound. The world has glorious experiences to offer us \u2014 the fragrance of flowers, the ability to look into the eyes of someone we love, to behold a sunset, to listen to music and allow it to change the frequency of our bodies, and so on. We are surrounded by beautiful things. But we don\u2019t want to be a slave to those stimuli, and that\u2019s the issue.\n\n\n\nNormally, we simply react. Our lives become a series of stimuli and responses, akin to Pavlov\u2019s dogs. But that is not the highest calling of our lives or the highest use of our minds. That\u2019s why the mind must be trained. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re walking down a street. You\u2019ll see restaurants, cafes, other people, an ATM machine, maybe a music store. The streets are filled with innumerable stimuli \u2014 a barrage of visual and auditory stimuli. No one can actually absorb all of it. We\u2019re seeing the world through a filter of our personal minds and attention. Imagine you\u2019re walking down that street starving \u2014 you\u2019ve just got off work, haven\u2019t had anything to eat since breakfast and it\u2019s seven o\u2019- clock in the evening. What are you going to notice? The music store? No, of course not. You\u2019re going to notice the eateries. Pizza, or Chinese food, or maybe a sandwich vendor. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to notice. Restaurants. If you aren\u2019t hungry but are driven by sensual desires, you\u2019ll notice attractive people on the street.\n\n\n\nWhat we see is actually determined by the mind. If a hundred people walk down the same street, they will experience it in a hundred different ways. It\u2019s not that they invent their experiences. They are all equally justified in their perceptions. One person will notice the pizza place; another who may have just got a cast of plaster off her leg will keep her eyes on the ground to make sure she doesn\u2019t fall.\n\n\n\nSo training the mind is having control over what gets absorbed. That\u2019s what meditation gives us. It is a practice, a tool to help us master the mind. When we focus on the breath, what does that do? It takes our awareness from a thousand places and brings it to one. It doesn\u2019t have to be the breath; it could be a mantra. It could be a candle flame; it could be awareness in general. There are entire schools of meditation based purely on the practice of awareness. We teach that if you sense an itch, bring the mind back to the breath, but there are schools of meditation that say if it itches, allow the awareness to be with the itch and name the sensation \u2018itching, itching, itching\u2019. They\u2019re all just different ways, different mechanisms, to take the mind from jumping aimlessly in a thousand places and make it sit in one place. The various techniques available help us get a little bit more familiar with it, befriend it and train it. \u2018Ah, you were in a thousand places, now you\u2019re in one, whether it\u2019s my breath, whether it\u2019s my mantra, whether it\u2019s my itching foot, you\u2019re in one place.\u2019 \u25a0\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/748626-1350-420-5/why-control-the-mind.img", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
