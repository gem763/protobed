Davis hit James with a pass near half-court before James picked up the ball and weaved toward the basket.\n\nJames jumped toward the rim while surrounded by defenders. He turned his body to the left before flipping the ball back with his right hand. The pass hit Green in the corner. The Lakers sharpshooter eyed the rim and netted the wide-open look from downtown.\n\n\u201c[Davis] saw me streaking down the middle and gave me a great outlet pass in the middle, where I was able to continue my momentum,\u201d James told reporters.\n\n\u201cThen it was my obligation to attack the rim and try to attract as many defenders as possible, then find [Green]. I had to get it to him some way, somehow. I didn\u2019t know it was going to result in that \u2026 I wanted to get it to him on time and on target. He did what he is known to do, that\u2019s knock down open threes.\u201d\n\nGreen had eight points and made two 3-pointers in the victory. James had 18 points, 11 assists and four rebounds for the Lakers. Davis had eight points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Avery Bradley hit 4-of-5 shots from downtown in the win.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of pressure on that one, even though nobody was near me but it was probably the most pressure I had in a long time to make a shot \u2026 luckily that one dropped,\u201d Green said.\n\nThis shouldn't be possible, @KingJames. pic.twitter.com/isuiB5YhDQ\u2014 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) October 17, 2019\n\nD\u2019Angelo Russell scored a game-high 23 points for the Warriors.\n\nThe Lakers face the Warriors in another preseason game at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday at Chase Center in San Francisco.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James assisted a 3-pointer with a circus pass while blindly throwing the ball into the corner for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
