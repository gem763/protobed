[Photo: Getty]\n\nA woman has been left in shock after discovering her father has allegedly been having an affair with her aunt for the past 20 years.\n\nThe horrifying revelation came to the surface on an explosive Reddit thread where the woman detailed how a cousin\u2019s digital sleuthing uncovered the pair\u2019s longtime romance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to explain it, but basically my father (towards whom I didn\u2019t have any positive feelings even prior to that) apparently has been having an affair with my godmother, that is the wife of my mother\u2019s brother,\u201d she wrote.\n\nConfronting the culprit\n\n\u201cYesterday, one of my cousins accidentally opened my aunt\u2019s Facebook on her computer and their conversation was the first to pop up.\n\nREAD MORE: How to tell if someone is lying to you\n\n\u201cShe immediately called me and as I was the collected one (I honestly thought she was joking as it was so unbelievable for me) I told her to take as much photos of the conversation as she could and not to hang up.\u201d\n\nThe plot was further thickened when the cousin \u2018impulsively\u2019 confronted her cheating mother about the alleged affair, who then claimed the messages were a \u2018joke\u2019 before quickly deleting the entire message thread.\n\nHowever, despite the denial, the cousins came up with a plan to ensure their parents\u2019 affair was exposed, in a bid to ensure transparency for the innocent parties.\n\n\u201cWe decided to give my aunt a week to confess (which she's not going to do) and then we will show the copies first to my uncle and then my mum,\u201d the daughter wrote.\n\nPotential consequences\n\nBut her agenda didn\u2019t end with the alleged couple\u2019s spouses finding out, and the poster asked other users for advice\u2014which understandably came from different viewpoints.\n\n\u201cYour mum absolutely needs to know, do NOT fall for the age old \u2018I need to hide this to protect her\u2019 fallacy,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cIt will hurt her, but she deserves the truth.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Why you shouldn't tell your partner you cheated\n\nBut others disagreed, and pointed out the potentially life-altering effects the revelations could bring the family.\n\n\u201cThere are ramifications here that need to be explored.
