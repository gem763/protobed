It pops up into the discussion at almost every world championships or Olympic Games.\n\nHowever, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) with help from the sportswear giants like Nike and Adidas, who bankroll many areas of the sport, have managed to maintain the status quo.\n\nAs for the athletes, almost everyone agrees organising is a great idea but no one quite seems to know how to get it done.\n\nTrack and field athletes are not alone in their hopes of earning liveable wages and gaining a bigger say in how their sport works.\n\nIn North America some of the world\u2019s best women\u2019s ice hockey players have unionized (Professional Women\u2019s Hockey Players\u2019 Association) and are effectively on strike pledging not to join any professional league until an economically viable option emerges.\n\nThe U.S. women\u2019s soccer team has filed a lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation alleging they are consistently paid less than their male counterparts. California last week signed a bill that cleared the way for college athletes to profit from brand sponsorships and endorsement deals.\n\nWith sponsorship deals, appearance money and other income spinning ventures, including rapping and modelling, the 22-year-old Lyles will not have to wonder where his next meal and rent cheque is coming from.\n\nBut for many of his fellow athletes competing in Doha, like Norwegian discus thrower Ola Stunes Isene who moved back to his parents\u2019 home because he could not make a living from the sport, the situation is much more challenging.\n\n\u201cI would definitely favour having more than one sponsor, not necessarily Nike,\u201d Jamaican 100 metres champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce told Reuters. \u201cI believe the athletes should be paid more.\n\n\u201cThe IAAF definitely makes a lot of money from these games and there are a lot of athletes that are here and not everybody goes away with something so I think we can do more to benefit the athletes.\u201d\n\nCONTRASTING INCOMES\n\nThe main source of income for many is the Diamond League, a series of 14 meetings with stops around the globe.\n\nWinners of Diamond League events receive $10,000 (8,122.8 pounds), down to $1,000 for the eighth-place finishers.\n\nGold medal winners in Doha will pocket $60,000, silver $30,000 and bronze $10,000. Eighth place finishers walk away with $4,000.\n\nIn contrast, just for stepping on the court for the opening round of the U.S. Open tennis players were guaranteed $58,000.\n\nTrack and field athletes have long sought to benefit from additional sponsorship opportunities that big events like world championships and Olympics can provide.\n\nThe IAAF council voted to permit national teams to display the logo of a national sponsor on their kit at the Doha world championships. But only 13 of more than 200 IAAF member federations have taken advantage of the opportunity.\n\nAthletes are still prevented from negotiating their own sponsorships with many restricted by IAAF rules and contracts they sign with sportswear companies.\n\nAthletics - World Athletics Championships - Doha 2019 - Men's 200 Metres Final - Khalifa International Stadium, Doha, Qatar - October 1, 2019.
