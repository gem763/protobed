I don\u2019t care to go out and party, to be the loud one anymore,\u201d @RyanLochte tells @craigmelvin about seeking help for drinking pic.twitter.com/oHNp2phMx5 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 23, 2019\n\nRyan Lochte pictured with wife Kayla Rae Reid and the first of their two children\n\nLochte credits his family with helping him to return to the pool, but admitted he gained weight after the birth of his second daughter and actually swam 22 pounds overweight at Nationals\n\nInitially, after the first suspension, Lochte said he was crushed by his dwindling fan support.\n\n'It was hard,' he said. 'It got to points where I would wake up crying, and I was just like man I wish I could just disappear and go on a remote Island and not see anyone.\n\n'I was a role model,' he continued. 'Kids looked up to me. They were like, 'I wanna be like you.' Then reading some of the comments, it was, 'I looked up to you and now I don't.' That hurts me. It hurt me inside. I didn't want to be that person.'\n\nLochte credits his wife with motivating him to return to the pool.\n\n'My wife, she's a rock star,' he said. 'She helped me out a lot. She was like: 'You got to keep fighting. This is not who you are. You got to show everyone who the real Ryan Lochte is.'\n\nBut Lochte admitted he needed more than just his wife's support.\n\nAfter years of partying, the Rochester, New York native agreed to check himself into rehab.\n\n'If I was going to keep going down this destructive path,' he said, 'I was gonna end up something tragic. I checked myself into rehab. I don't care to go out and party and be the loud one anymore.'\n\nRyan Lochte swims in the Men's 200m Individual Medley during day 5 of the Phillips 66 National Championships on August 04, 2019 in Stanford, California\n\n.@RyanLochte says he \u201cstarted eating just everything just not good\u201d after his daughter was born and swam Nationals 22 pounds overweight and says he has since lost 17 pounds. pic.twitter.com/7RrU8krDKO \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 23, 2019\n\nLochte claimed he was robbed at gunpoint, but surveillance footage showed a drunken and jubilant Lochte urinating on the side of the gas station and vandalizing the property\n\nWhen asked what helped him change his partying ways, Lochte just mimed rocking a baby to sleep.\n\nUnfortunately for Lochte, that presented him with another problem.\n\nLochte now says his recent practice times are as good as those he put up in 2012, when he won five medals, including two golds, at the Summer Olympics in London\n\n'When my daughter was born, training started slipping away,' Lochte said. 'So I went to fast food and I started just eating everything.'\n\nAmazingly, Lochte claims he was out of shape when he won the 200-meter individual medley at the US national championships in August.\n\n'So when I swam nationals, I swam 22 pounds overweight,' he said. 'Since then I've lost 17 pounds; my times that I'm doing in practice are things that I've seen when I was at my peak back in 2012.'\n\nWith his conditioning improving, Lochte is hoping to win gold again at next year's Summer Games in Tokyo, which would be his fifth Olympics and his first with his family potentially in the crowd.\n\n'I want more,' he said. 'I also want to show my kids that no matter how many times you get knocked down, you can get up and keep fighting.\n\n'If I really think about it, I'm gonna start getting teary. It would be the best thing ever. TO be able to get a medal and have my family in the stands.'", "description": "Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Ryan Lochte is back in the pool, sober, and leaning on his new family as he prepares for the 2020 Tokyo Games after his false robbery claims in Rio in 2012.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20086078-0-image-a-4_1571840174310.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
