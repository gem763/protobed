Tither-Kaplan and Gaal enrolled in the LA program and paid a monthly tuition of $300. There were also additional masterclasses, including a $750 class for sex scenes. The lawsuit claims that students had to audition for the class on tape so Franco could review the footage. Students were also allegedly asked to sign away their rights to the recordings.\n\nThe suit alleges Franco and his partners \u201cengaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior towards female students by sexualizing their power as a teacher and an employer by dangling the opportunity for roles in their projects\u201d.\n\nDuring classes and auditions, the suit claims that \u201coften young and inexperienced females \u2026 were routinely pressured to engage in simulated sex acts that went far beyond the standards in the industry\u201d.\n\nGaal claimed she was not allowed to join the sex-scenes class after voicing her unease post-audition, while Tither-Kaplan claimed that her involvement led to a role in one of Franco\u2019s films. She was picked to star in an orgy scene where Franco allegedly removed plastic guards that had been placed over women\u2019s vaginas while he simulated oral sex. The film is yet to be released.\n\nFranco has claimed the representation is \u201cnot accurate\u201d.\n\nIn 2018, Franco was accused of sexual misconduct by five women, including Tither-Kaplan. At the time, Franco\u2019s lawyer refuted the claims and Franco addressed them during an interview with Seth Meyers.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have my own side of this story, but I believe in these people that have been underrepresented getting their stories out, enough that I will hold back things that I could say, just because I believe in it that much. If I have to take a knock, because I am not going to try and actively refute things, then I will, because I believe in it that much.\u201d\n\nSince the accusations, Franco has continued to star in HBO drama The Deuce, while last week saw the release of his Hollywood satire Zeroville, which was met with negative reviews and box-office failure. He will next be heard voicing \u201ca scatterbrained albatross\u201d called Lemmy in animated children\u2019s adventure Arctic Justice.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking damages and the return of any recordings. The two accusers have told NPR they hope to make it a class-action suit so other women can become involved. Franco\u2019s representatives have been contacted for comment but have yet to reply.", "description": "James%20Franco%20accused%20in%20lawsuit%20of%20sexually%20exploiting%20women%20%7C%20James%20Franco%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": ""}
