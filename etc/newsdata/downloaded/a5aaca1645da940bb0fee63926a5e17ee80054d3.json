It\u2019s a clear VAR issue. I am not angry or whatever, it\u2019s just wow. I saw it was a foul and nothing else.\n\n\u201cMr Atkinson I\u2019m sure would have whistled if there was no VAR involved, but now we have somebody else who can make the decision. But somebody else is not making the decision.\u201d\n\nLiverpool were also disallowed an equalising goal at the end of the first half when Sadio Mane was judged to have handled the ball by VAR.\n\nKlopp largely accepted that decision, but still argued against the high bar which a questionable refereeing decision must meet before it is overturned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the process, that\u2019s important,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general I think it\u2019s good that we have VAR but at the moment it looks like the only thing which works properly is handball, because they made the rule that if your hand is somehow involved in a goal, it\u2019s disallowed.\n\n\u201cOffside works pretty well, even if not everyone is happy. I can accept that. But the process where the ref makes a decision because they have VAR but then VAR says \u2018no, that\u2019s fine\u2019, that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cOn the pitch the referee decides to let it run because we have VAR, but it is not overruled because it is not \u2018obvious\u2019, that makes no sense.\n\n\u201cHow can you not say it\u2019s a foul? It was 100 per cent clear. I was so surprised I could not even be angry!\u201d\n\nAnd despite claiming that it was no excuse for his team\u2019s failure to win, Klopp also claimed that United set out to defend.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side have been accused of only being able to create chances on the counter-attack and employed a similar style on Sunday, picking Liverpool off with pace.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t frustrate me,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI\u2019m not the person who should be concerned about this style. It\u2019s just a fact that when we come here, they just defend. It\u2019s OK, no criticism, it\u2019s just a fact.\n\n\u201cWhen United plays Liverpool, usually you\u2019d think both teams would play like this, would try. We are the one team everyone is on their toes when United play us. With the quality they have, the way they set up is really difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no excuse. I thought we could do better today. But you cannot play each team like this.\u201d", "description": "Jurgen Klopp believes the Premier League\u2019s VAR processes must be reviewed after Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by Manchester United at Old Trafford.
