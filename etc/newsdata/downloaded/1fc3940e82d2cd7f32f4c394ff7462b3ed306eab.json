His death has triggered a nationwide series of recriminations due to Epstein\u2019s high society connections, involving rich and powerful people from politics, the law, journalism and academia.\n\nReif\u2019s letter is the first acknowledgment that Epstein\u2019s donations were known of at the highest level of the university, and not only at its Media Lab spin-off.\n\nEarlier this week, Joi Ito, the head of the Lab, resigned his post after it was revealed that he had solicited donations from Epstein despite MIT listing Epstein as \u201cdisqualified\u201d in its donor database.\n\nIto stepped down after whistleblower Signe Swenson revealed that contacts between MIT and Epstein were more frequent, and the gifts the faculty received via Epstein greater, than previously known.\n\nIn his letter on Thursday, Reif said senior members of his team \u201cknew in general terms about Epstein\u2019s history \u2013 that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior\u201d.\n\nReif added that senior members of his administration were also aware of gifts Epstein made to MIT\u2019s Media Lab between 2013 and 2017, and had required that Epstein not make them public.\n\n\u201cI am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi,\u201d Reif wrote. \u201cWe did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein\u2019s offenses or the harm to his young victims.\u201d\n\nThe latest development comes soon after MIT hired an outside law firm, Goodwin Procter, to review the circumstances surrounding Epstein\u2019s donations.\n\nReif wrote that he took \u201cresponsibility for those errors\u201d and that the university \u201chave already identified flaws in our processes that need to be addressed\u201d.", "description": "University acknowledged 2012 gift from disgraced financier but Rafael Reif writes: \u2018We could and should have asked more questions\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c565daa60b29d98cbc789d909ab00506287b5b0f/0_117_3410_2046/master/3410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b67bca788e8feba3d8a7112bac1ce79"}
