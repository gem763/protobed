Once the eggs go in, be sure to keep the flame low and keep the pan covered while cooking, so the eggs stay soft and almost oozy at their yolk, and the Cotija melts a bit. The chard and the half-and-half create a sort of light broth at the bottom of the shakshuka, which holds so much flavor and is one of the dish\u2019s charms. Lastly, be daring with smoked hot sauce at the end: It\u2019ll push the creamy avocado, cheese and eggs to their peak.", "description": "This easy twist on classic North African shakshuka (traditionally eggs baked in tomato-pepper sauce, with cumin, paprika and cayenne) starts with an onion-garlic-chard saut\u00e9ed until gently wilted: a nest of sorts for steam-poaching eggs Once the eggs go in, be sure to keep the flame low and keep the pan covered while cooking, so the eggs stay soft and almost oozy at their yolk, and the Cotija melts a bit The chard and the half-and-half create a sort of light broth at the bottom of the shakshuka, which holds so much flavor and is one of the dish\u2019s charms", "authors": ["Sarah Copeland", "Colu Henry", "Melissa Clark", "Ali Slagle", "David Tanis", "Pierre Franey", "Claire Saffitz", "Julia Moskin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/sc-green-shakshuka/sc-green-shakshuka-articleLarge.jpg"}
