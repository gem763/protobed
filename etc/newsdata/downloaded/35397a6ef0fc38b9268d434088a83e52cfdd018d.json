But when the optician examined her they advised her to go hospital.\n\nShe subsequently discovered she had a lump in her eye which was a secondary cancer and after tests she was given the devastating news she had incurable bowel cancer.\n\nMiss Coups told NottinghamshireLive : \"I had lots of CT scans and a full body scan and I was told I had bowel cancer but it had spread to my liver, lungs and bones.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/ WS)\n\n\"I have since been having treatment but I have been told that is incurable and very rare.\n\n\"Since then the bone cancer has now spread to my skull and I have been told there is some activity in my right breast.\"\n\nMiss Coups, who lives in Edwinstowe, Nottingham, is now undergoing treatment to shrink her hormones and hopefully reduce the cancer in her body.\n\nShe said it is now a waiting game to see if the cancer responds to the treatment before options like radiotherapy and chemotherapy are considered.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/ WS)\n\nHer friend decided to set up a fundraising page to support her with paying her bills when she is off work sick.\n\nMiss Coups said: \"I haven't been working at my job long enough to accrue sick pay so when I take time off for treatment I won't get paid.\n\n\"My work have been amazing and so supportive but I just worry about paying the bills when I am off sick.\n\n\"I want to carry on and I love my job but I also need to recover after surgeries and treatment.\"\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/ WS)\n\nOn the fundraising page, her friend Cath Harrison said: \"My lovely friend Sharon has been diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Carsinoma, which is an incurable rare form of cancer. Which has now affected most of her body.\n\n\"Sharon now finds herself in a position where, despite her illness, she is having to work additional hours to pay cover all her bills while she is off work undergoing treatment.\n\n\"She has already used up all her holidays and is not entitled to sick pay due to her not being in her current employment long enough, so any time she needs to take off is now unpaid.\"\n\nMiss Coups said her two sons Conor, 26, and Aaron, 20, had been supportive throughout the diagnosis and treatment.\n\nShe said she wanted to raise awareness of the disease to help others.\n\nShe added: \"The diagnosis was devastating. I was in shock when I was told but I am being very positive about it. If I am negative then the cancer has won and I won't let that happen.\"", "description": "Sharon Coups, 50, from Nottingham, saw an optician in June after her right eye became irritated who advised her to go to hospital", "authors": ["Hannah Mitchell", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Walesonline", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Mum-went-to-opticians-for-check-up-only-to-be-told-she-had-incurable-cancerI-was-in-shock-when-I-w.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
