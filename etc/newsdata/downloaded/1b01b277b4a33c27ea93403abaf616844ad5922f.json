These were not honorable freedom fighters defending the rights of \u201cthe people.\u201d They were officeholders wielding all of the powers of the state to repeatedly break the law and violate the civil rights of their citizens.\n\nNo country allows politicians to disobey the law. Suppose that the U.K. government were to choose to disobey the Benn act, which obliges it to seek a three-month extension of the country\u2019s membership in the European Union in the case a Brexit deal cannot be reached.\n\nSuppose Boris Johnson decided to ignore it, and proceeded with his no-deal Brexit. What would the legal consequences be? As the English lawyer David Allen Green and other legal commentators have argued, the crime incurred would be \u201cmisconduct in public office,\u201d for which the official guidance of the Crown Prosecutor Service of the U.K. assigns a penalty of up to life imprisonment.\n\nCatalan separatists have developed a classic populist narrative of \u201ca single people\u201d (un sol poble) fighting against foreign oppressors.\n\nNobody (not even the accused) denies that Catalan separatist leaders have repeatedly disobeyed Spanish and Catalan law. Infamously, Carles Puigdemont, then president of Catalonia, tweeted a photo of himself in April 2017 when he received the fifth consecutive court order from the Spanish constitutional court to desist of his conduct, answering with the following text: \u201cToday I received the fifth court order from the constitutional court. We will not stop going forward.\u201d Behind him were proudly displayed the five court orders.\n\nSimilarly, on September 7, 2017, the Catalan legislature passed by a bare majority an enabling law that declared itself superior to the Spanish constitution and the Catalan Regional Law and allowed the Catalan government, for instance, to appoint judges.\n\nIn ignoring the rule of law, these politicians violated the civil rights of a large part (at least half) of Catalan citizens. What single-minded secessionist propagandists would like us to forget is that that Catalonia is a hybrid, multicultural society. Asked by the Catalan government\u2019s own public opinion center, 41.2 percent of Catalans said they felt \u201cas Spanish as they feel Catalan.\u201d Only 20.1 percent said they felt \u201conly Catalan\u201d (the rest were divided between \u201cmostly Spanish,\u201d \u201cmostly Catalan,\u201d or \u201conly Spanish\u201d).\n\nThe separatists have sought to divide Catalan society in the same way nativist populists do elsewhere. In the United States, President Donald Trump achieved power by employing an \u201cus-versus-them\u201d rhetoric, portraying Mexican Americans and Muslims as not \u201creal Americans.\u201d We have seen a similar process take place in the U.K., where the populists portray everything as the fault of the rotten European elites. But nowhere has the process of dividing the population in two come as close to the brink as in Catalonia.\n\nCatalan separatists have developed a classic populist narrative of \u201ca single people\u201d (un sol poble) fighting against foreign, undemocratic oppressors who \u201csteal from Catalonia.\u201d Those who feel, in different proportions, both Catalan and Spanish are treated as traitors to their language and country, and deprived of some of their civil rights.\n\nAs Catalan President Quim Torra wrote in 2012: \u201cNo, it is not normal to speak Spanish in Catalonia\u2026 And when you decide not to speak Catalan you are turning your back on Catalonia.\u201d\n\nTorra has also written that Spanish speakers are \u201cscavengers, vipers, hyenas. Beasts of human shape that, nonetheless, sniff hatred. A perturbed hatred, nauseating, like dentures full of mold, against everything that the language represents.\u201d\n\nIn the same article, he wrote about Spaniards: \u201cThey are here, among us. They hate every expression of Catalanism. A sick phobia. There is something Freudian in those beasts or a little bump in their DNA chain.\u201d\n\nMore recently, he tweeted: \u201cAbove all, the most surprising thing is the tone, the bad manners, the Spanish self-importance and the filthy feeling. Horrible.\u201d\n\nAnother long-time president, Jordi Pujol, succeeded in inculcating in Catalonia a supremacist, ethnocentric ideology under a cloak of liberalism. For Pujol, the Andalusian is \u201can anarchic man who lives in a state of ignorance and cultural, mental and spiritual misery.\u201d\n\nThe separatist politicians who were sentenced to prison received fair, transparent trials, conducted entirely live on Spanish TV. The seven Supreme Court judges, from different sides of the spectrum, unanimously agreed that they violated the law.\n\nThe judges\u2019 decision is in the best tradition of democratic government in Europe: the preservation of the rule of law in a multicultural, diverse society against those who seek to divide it and would have it ethnically cleansed in the name of plebiscitary \u201cdemocracy.\u201d\n\nIt deserves the support of all those in Europe fighting for the rule of law.\n\nLuis Garicano is vice-president of the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament and professor of economics at the IE Business School.", "description": "Separatist politicians disobeyed the law and violated the rights of their citizens.", "authors": ["Luis Garicano", "Diego Torres", "James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172842726-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
