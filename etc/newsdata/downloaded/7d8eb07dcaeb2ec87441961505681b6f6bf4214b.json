There\u2019s a reason we have so much fan fiction dedicated to the romantic exploits of Walt\u2019s animated baddies. And it\u2019s why one author has created her own erotica saga that looks at what would happen if some of Disney\u2019s classic villains had emerged as the victors... and then had a lot of sex.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always really enjoyed villains, they\u2019re always my favourite part of any story,\u201d Katee Robert told Gizmodo over the phone recently. \u201cIt just was a natural evolution to take that fascination for me and to write it at my preferred heat level, which is pretty spicy.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, erotica writer Robert debuted her latest series, Wicked Villains, a series that features a Once Upon a Time-style crossover world of overlapping Disney characters involved in some really kinky stuff. The first book, Desperate Measures, is about a \u201cDaddy Dom\u201d relationship between Jafar and Jasmine. The follow-up, Learn My Lesson, explores a throuple between Hades, Megara and Hercules; it\u2019s out October 30.\n\nThe series has been a bit of a challenge because Robert doesn\u2019t have a history in fan fiction, but she said it\u2019s been exciting to explore that part of herself and her writing.\n\nThe cover for the first book in the Wicked Villains series, Desperate Measures. (Image: Trinkets and Tales)\n\nRobert told Gizmodo she was inspired to write Desperate Measures after getting into a conversation with some of her friends about Jafar being hot (personal note: some of my coworkers and I have had this exact same conversation, and I\u2019m guessing many of y\u2019all have too).\n\nShe said she had no plans to do this kind of series \u2014 she tends to avoid fantasy or similar adaptations, preferring to tell more grounded erotica stories \u2014 calling it \u201ca fun indulgence\u201d that eventually grew into what\u2019s becoming one of her more-popular franchises:\n\nWith Disney re-releasing everything as live-action, it\u2019s created some really interesting inspiration because everyone\u2019s beautiful. When they announced Jafar\u2019s casting, I was in a conversation with some of my friends. We basically started riffing back and forth about our favourite villains, and how the scene with Jafar and Jasmine when she\u2019s wearing that red get-up made everybody a little confused as children. I just said it: \u201cJafar is a Daddy Dom!\u201d And that basically spawned the entire book.\n\nThat said, this isn\u2019t a fantasy series. The characters have the same names as their Disney counterparts, but in thoroughly modern stories which share themes with the original tales but aren\u2019t carbon copy remakes. That\u2019s partially to avoid Disney\u2019s ire, I\u2019m sure, though Robert said some of the changes were to make the books more in line with the actual fairy tales or other source material \u2014 at least thematically. For example, in the upcoming Learn My Lesson, the characters of Megara and Hercules are modelled more after their Greek counterparts than the Disney versions.\n\nIn Desperate Measures, Jasmine is the daughter of a powerful CEO who Jafar ordered killed so he could take over the company. It also paints Aladdin, referred to as Ali in this story, as the true villain of the story \u2014 a dangerous and scheming man who deludes himself into thinking he knows what\u2019s best for Jasmine. This kind of reflects Robert\u2019s own opinion of Aladdin\u2019s titular hero.\n\n\u201cAladdin is arguably... could easily be the villain. He\u2019s a liar, he\u2019s a thief, he engages in slavery \u2014 kind of \u2014 with the genie,\u201d she said. \u201cJafar, while being murderous and evil, is at least moderately upfront about it.\u201d\n\nThe book alternates point-of-view chapters between Jafar and Jasmine, giving us a look inside each of their perspectives as they grow their BDSM relationship \u2014 though it starts on a pretty questionable note. Much like the animated film, where Jasmine temporarily becomes Jafar\u2019s captive, this version of Jasmine is quasi-kidnapped by Jafar in her own home and becomes his submissive.\n\nThe book makes it clear that Jasmine enjoys and indulges in their power dynamic, and they do have a safe word (\u201cRajah\u201d) that Jafar is shown to obey. However, the story does deal in areas of dubious consent. This may be uncomfortable for some and should be kept in mind before reading.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s a modern story, without magic or talking animals, means there are more opportunities to bring different Disney villains together under one shared universe. The overarching world of Wicked Villains is a city ruled by different crime syndicates, which are each run by a different Disney villain and their gang. It may take away the hooks and blue flame hair, but it does make for some fun crossovers. It\u2019s common to see cameos from characters who will be getting their own stories in the future, like Captain Hook and Tinker Bell, whose own story called A Worthy Opponent is set for February 2020.\n\nMeg and Hades are key characters in Desperate Measures \u2014 Meg even participates in a threesome with Jafar and Jasmine. If that\u2019s something you didn\u2019t know you were into before now, welcome to the club! I asked Robert why she thinks sexifying Disney villains and giving them their own happy endings is something so many grown-up fans are interested in \u2014 whether it\u2019s traversing through the tales of Hugo-winner Archive Of Our Own, or by reading a new series where Jafar is a businessman and Hades runs a BDSM club.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just the villains themselves. They\u2019re so instrumental in a lot of people\u2019s personal histories, and these are the tales that we grew up on. Telling them from a different lens has been absolutely delightful,\u201d she said.\n\nRobert said she has at least six books planned in the series and could possibly keep going if the response stays positive, adding that she\u2019s most excited for her upcoming Sleeping Beautiful and Maleficent story. But for now, it\u2019s all about Jafar and Jasmine. Because Jafar is totally a Daddy Dom.", "description": "It\u2019s an undeniable truth: Disney villains are hot.
