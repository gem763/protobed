The females were born in Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic and were transferred to a Kenyan conservancy in 2009 with two other males, who later died.\n\n\u201cWe brought ten oocytes back from Kenya, five from each female. After incubation seven matured and were suitable for fertilization,\u201d Cesare Galli, a professor based at the Avantea Laboratories in Cremona, Italy, said in an emailed statement. Sperm from two deceased males, Suni and Saut, were injected into the eggs, of which two developed into viable embryos.\n\nThe embryos, all from Fatu\u2019s eggs, will be transferred to a surrogate mother, according to the statement. Najin\u2019s eggs didn\u2019t make it.\n\nThe global rhino population has been decimated by poaching, with China and Vietnam among nations fueling demand for their horns because of the belief that they cure diseases.\n\n\u201cGlobal human behavior still needs to radically change if the lessons of the northern white rhinos are to be learned,\u201d said Richard Vigne, managing director of Ol \u00adPejeta Conservancy, where the two rhinos are sheltered.", "description": "Researchers collected 10 immature eggs from Najin and Fatu, the world\u2019s only survivors of the northern white rhino subspecies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
