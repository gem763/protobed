They really got Trump this time!\n\nJust kidding.\n\nBut hey, that\u2019s clearly what Andrew Desiderio here wants his readers to think.

So\u2026 once again, he knows what the general public does, since the WH released the full transcript 4 weeks ago. The left media needs to do better with this impeachment and Ukraine hoax campaign. https://t.co/30OooMSTQl \u2014 Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) October 29, 2019\n\nSo their big NSC witness knows what the rest of Americans do because we\u2019ve seen the transcript. We bet Trump is just shakin\u2019 in his boots.\n\nHeh.\n\nThis Ukraine hoax is starting to be as embarrassing as the Russian collusion hoax.\n\nThere is a public transcript of the call. We don\u2019t need this guy to tell us what he thinks. \u2014 Roux (@rouxdsla) October 29, 2019\n\nBut he really believes Trump did something bad, man!\n\nIt\u2019s all so stupid.\n\nSchachtel continued.\n\nThis Alexander Vindman ordeal is merely a guy who is upset w/ how the president is conducting foreign policy & wants to criminalize FP wrong think. It's really nothing more than that. NSC officials have no mandate. POTUS does. Dems+media using it to bolster weak impeachment case. \u2014 Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) October 29, 2019\n\nWhat he said. ^\n\nI read his opening statement. This is his interpretation. My interpretation is Trump wasn\u2019t demanding anything. \u2014 Maria F Pino (@pinom912) October 29, 2019\n\nOur interpretation is this Ukraine thing is all stupid.\n\nHe is a weak witness so they elevate his stature by using his military background. \u2014 Elizabeth Herring (@HerringLiz) October 29, 2019\n\nNot to mention they played the Russian immigrant card.\n\nIt is continued political theater. The Democrats know that they can't impeach him. Well they can, but they know that the senate won't convict him because there's nothing here. This is about keeping it going long enough to hopefully affect the election. Straight up interference. \u2014 Meier Ben Avraham Ben Delecto (@hebrewservative) October 29, 2019\n\n*sigh*\n\n-Follow Sam J. on Twitter @politibunny\u2013\n\nRelated:\n\nOUCH!
