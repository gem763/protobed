Countries such as Italy and Malta have complained for years that other EU members have refused to take a fair share of the migrants who arrive on Europe's southern shores.\n\nThe new scheme is described as voluntary and temporary and it would only involve four countries for now \u2014 although some diplomats hope that it could serve as a model for a broader agreement. The interior minister of Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, and European Commission officials are also expected to attend Monday's meeting in the Maltese city of Vittoriosa.\n\nBut the pact may prove controversial as it refers repeatedly to asylum seekers and migrants, rather than to refugees. That could open the scheme up to people less likely to be granted international protection for reasons such as persecution or war.\n\nIn other words, France and Germany could, under the scheme, take in people much more likely to be regarded as economic migrants.\n\nThe number of asylum seekers who could be covered by the scheme would less than 10,000, said the diplomat.\n\nIn the short term, the deal is intended to ease a crisis that became acute under Italy's previous government, whose far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini ordered ports not to accept NGO ships carrying migrants rescued at sea.\n\nNow a more pro-EU government has taken office in Rome, Berlin and Paris have a strong incentive to show Italian voters that the EU is wiling to help Italy with migration when it is run by a government that they judge adheres to the bloc's core values.\n\nAn EU attempt to impose mandatory quotas of refugees caused huge acrimony within the bloc in 2015. Central and Eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary refused to take part in the program.\n\nThe draft document outlines \u201cvoluntary commitments by member states.\u201d The aim is to \u201cset up a more predictable and efficient temporary solidarity mechanism in order to ensure the ... dignified disembarkation of migrants taken aboard on the high seas.\" At the moment, ships run by NGOs can spend long periods at sea waiting for a decision on which port will take them and which countries will take in the people they have rescued.\n\nAmong the points to be finalized are the criteria that would determine when a country would be eligible to receive support under the mechanism.\n\nThe deal could be \u201can important step towards the definition of an agreement on asylum,\u201d said one diplomat, noting that European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has promised \u201ca fresh start\" on migration and asylum.\n\nThe fact that the draft never uses the term \u201crefugee\u201d appears to be a shift in favor of Italy, which argues that many of the people rescued in the Mediterranean do not qualify for this status. While other EU countries have been willing to accept refugees who arrived in another EU member state, they have been much less keen to take in people they see as economic migrants. This means these people often end up in the country where they first arrived in the EU.\n\nOne diplomat suggested, however, that the terminology would be open to interpretation and that, in practice, \u201ccountries that relocate only refugees will keep on relocating only refugees.\u201d\n\nThe number of asylum seekers who could be covered by the scheme would less than 10,000, said the diplomat.\n\nThe draft, dated September 13, is not signed and diplomats warned that it is still a work in progress. The text \u201cis still very open, pending political decisions,\u201d said one. Significant portions of the text are marked in red or in brackets, meaning they have yet to be finalized.\n\nAmong the points to be finalized are the criteria that would determine when a country would be eligible to receive support under the mechanism, a possible rotation scheme for ports where migrants would disembark, and the duration of the temporary relocation.\n\nA new text is expected to circulate by Monday but two diplomats said they expect that the most contentious points, on the eligibility criteria and the ports, to be left to ministers to decide.\n\nThe draft says that the temporary mechanism would apply \u201cwhere that member state is confronted with a disproportionate number of applications.\u201d\n\nBut the definition of \"disproportionate\" could create problems for Italy. Data from the EU asylum agency, EASO, show that the highest number of registered first-time asylum seekers in 2018, relative to the size of the population, was recorded in Cyprus, ahead of Greece, Malta and Luxembourg. Italy is only 13th in the rankings, below France and Germany.\n\nThe signatory countries hope to extend the deal to other capitals. One of the points already agreed in the draft is that they \u201ccall on the other EU and Schengen [open-border zone] Member States to participate in this mechanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we reach 12 countries, it will be a success,\u201d said one diplomat.", "description": "Document shows Germany, France, Italy and Malta poised to seal agreement that could be extended to others.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Arthur Neslen", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1163382443-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
