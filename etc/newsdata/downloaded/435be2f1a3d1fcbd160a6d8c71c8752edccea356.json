And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d\n\nLast week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry in response to a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint said the call revealed Trump \u201cpressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the White House\u2019s summary of the July call, Trump asked Zelensky to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic race, as well as his son Hunter, based on unfounded corruption allegations.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of seeking the removal of a prosecutor in Ukraine when he was Obama\u2019s vice president, supposedly in order to impede an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company on whose board his son was serving. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump repeatedly evaded questions from reporters about comments he made about Biden during the July phone call, including a question on what exactly he had wanted Zelensky to do about the former vice president and his son.\n\n\u201cLook, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked,\u201d Trump claimed amid a long-winded response. \u201cYou know it, and so do we.\u201d\n\nBiden said Trump\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d involving Ukraine was because the president was \u201cafraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November,\u201d Biden said, according to his prepared remarks.\n\nPresident Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2019\n\nEarlier this week, Biden\u2019s campaign urged TV news outlets to stop putting Giuliani on the air, saying the president\u2019s personal lawyer was spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine during Biden\u2019s vice presidency.\n\nLast week, Joe Biden said he was in favor of impeaching Trump if the president refuses to comply with Congress\u2019s investigations. After the release of the White House summary of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine, Biden called the president\u2019s actions \u201can impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nBiden joined the rest of the leading Democratic candidates who had been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment for months. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for Trump\u2019s impeachment in late spring in response to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s April report and May public statement about his investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\nIn his Nevada remarks Wednesday, Biden repeated his description of Trump\u2019s actions as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d and said the president placed his \u201cown personal gain ahead of the public good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not backing down. And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by the lies, smears, distortions and name-calling,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTrump Asked Ukraine President To Target Joe Biden's Son: Reports\n\nJoe Biden Backs Impeachment If Trump Refuses To Cooperate With Congress\n\nTrump Repeatedly Refuses To Answer Questions About Biden Part Of Ukraine Call\n\nLove HuffPost?
