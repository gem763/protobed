Ito confided in other directors and researchers at the Media Lab about his working relationship with the then-convicted sex offender, to the concern of at least one female staffer who later resigned in part due to the lab's ties to Epstein.\n\nOn Saturday, Ito also resigned from the boards of the The MacArthur Foundation, the Knight Foundation, and The New York Times Publishing Company.\n\nMIT Media Lab More\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nRead more: Bill Gates made donations to MIT through Jeffrey Epstein \u2014here are all of the tech mogul's connections to the financier\n\nEmails obtained and published by The New Yorker show that Epstein gave more money to the lab than previously said in public statements from Ito and MIT's president, in part because people like Gates and Black, a leading private-equity investor, were \"directed by\" Epstein to contribute upward of $7.5 million.\n\nA spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told Business Insider that \"Any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.\" The contents of emails sent between Ito and the lab's former Director of Development and Strategy, Peter Cohen, contradict that statement.\n\nIn one email, Epstein wrote \"GAtes [sic] would like a write up on our one science program for tues next week\" in an effort to secure a donation from the Microsoft founder, and Epstein specified in a reply to Ito that he wanted the write-up to be \"more specofic [sic] so that he can fund.\"\n\nStaffers in Ito's office referred to Epstein as \"Voldemort\" and \"He who shall not be named,\" The New Yorker reported, due to the anonymous status of the donations granted by Epstein to the university, and the general secrecy that enveloped Ito's communications with the financier.\n\nIto attempted to conceal visits Epstein made to the lab by writing his initials or \"VIP\" in his itinerary, as opposed to Epstein's full name. MIT publicly admitted to receiving $800,000 from Epstein, which its president said would be given to a fund to support victims of sexual assault.\n\nPrivately, Ito received at least another $1.2 million from Epstein, in addition to the $7.5 million \"directed by\" Epstein to MIT. Emails show Cohen noting that Epstein's donations must be recorded anonymously, and showed him soliciting advice from the financier, such as when he emailed \"you or Jeffrey would know best\" to Ito.", "description": "After a New Yorker expos\u00e9 published emails between MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito and the late Jeffrey Epstein, Ito has announced his resignation.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/16vbbcms8ZCD.iwdERhtUg--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/156fbc49dcfb24faf56ef3a12aa20700", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
