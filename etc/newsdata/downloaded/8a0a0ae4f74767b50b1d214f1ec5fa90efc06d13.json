That\u2019s how we confronted things.\u201d\n\nPaltrow told The New York Times in October 2017 that when she was 22, when her career was just taking off, she found herself alone in a hotel room with Weinstein who attempted to massage her and have sex with her. She said then-boyfriend Pitt confronted Weinstein at a movie premiere and warned the producer to never touch Paltrow again.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that nothing happened further because she was going to do two films,\u201d Pitt told Amanpour. \u201cI think the interesting thing is that we \u2014 Hollywood specifically but the workplace, men and women\u2019s dynamics \u2014 is being recalibrated in a very good way. It\u2019s long overdue. I do think that\u2019s an important story to tell. \u201d\n\nIn an interview with Howard Stern last year, Paltrow credited Pitt\u2019s actions as the reason Weinstein stopped pursuing her.\n\n\u201cIt was so fantastic because what he did was, he leveraged his fame and power to protect me, at a time when I didn\u2019t have fame or power yet,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person and Harvey was never inappropriate with me again.\u201d", "description": "\"I was just a boy from the Ozarks on the playground.
