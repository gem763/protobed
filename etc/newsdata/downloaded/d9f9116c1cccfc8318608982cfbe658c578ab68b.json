The organizers anticipate approximately 10,000 fans to attend across all three days.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to host the inaugural weekend of the Call of Duty League and welcome our ownership partners, players, and most importantly, our fans,\u201d Jonathan Wilf, president and ownership partner of WISE Ventures Esports, said in a statement. \u201cWe have been craving an esports event of this caliber in Minneapolis-St. Paul. With the success this community has in hosting world class events, we are excited to put on an incredible fan experience to launch the Call of Duty League.\u201d\n\nFor the Minnesota team, hosting the league\u2019s inaugural weekend was an integral part of the conversation with Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard from the start.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe conversations around this date back to before there was even an agreement to have a team in Minnesota,\u201d Brett Diamond, chief operating officer of WISE Ventures, told The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re truly the new kid in the class when it comes to this league. Ten of the 12 teams in the Call of Duty League are part of the Overwatch League, and the 11th in London, their ownership group has a long history in esports. As we try to build up a new esports organization from scratch, being able to host the premier event on the league\u2019s calendar right out of the gates is a really great opportunity.\u201d\n\nOutlining Minneapolis\u2019s strengths as a host city, Diamond pointed to its track record hosting the Super Bowl, the Final Four, and the X-Games in recent years. As for the timing of the event \u2014 January is Minnesota\u2019s coldest month \u2014 Diamond explained that arrangements would be made to keep players and events primarily indoors.\n\nHowever, \u201cpart of the fun of being in Minnesota is embracing the weather,\u201d Diamond said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to the league matches, the weekend will include an amateur open bracket tournament called the Call of Duty Challengers Open. Starting in November, amateurs will be able to compete in the Call of Duty Challengers circuit that will be held over the course of the 2020 season via online ladders for a prize pool of $1 million.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The franchised version of Activision's Call of Duty competitive circuit will begin play with all 12 teams participating over three days in Minneapolis.", "authors": ["Mike Hume", "Oversees Editorial Operations For Launcher", "The Washington Post'S Home For Coverage Of Video Games", "Mikhail Klimentov"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Lz4Gj5EfOVvzNpwSvc4Bgm_sTJo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZ3VHUTD65AQ3LWUSOEDUKSZGE.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
