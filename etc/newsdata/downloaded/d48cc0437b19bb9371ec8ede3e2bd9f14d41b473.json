Jordan Strauss/Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nThe Emmy Awards were a mixed bag Sunday night, with some shockers, such as a \u201cFleabag\u201d sweep, and other expected wins, like best drama going to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\n\u201cFleabag\u201d won best comedy series, and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home the trophy for best actress, upsetting perennial favorite Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The dry-witted show also won in the genre\u2019s directing and writing categories. \u201cBarry\u201d co-creator Bill Hader won best actor for the second year in a row.\n\nOn the drama side of things: Billy Porter won best actor for \u201cPose,\u201d which the Associated Press reported makes him the first openly gay man to win in the category. First-time nominee Jodie Comer won best actress for playing a psychopathic assassin in \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d a series that, coincidentally, was also created by Waller-Bridge. Jharrel Jerome received an extended standing ovation for his lead actor in a limited series or movie win for \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d Ava DuVernay\u2019s miniseries about the Central Park Five.\n\nKeep scrolling for a time-stamped look at how the night unfolded.\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wins best drama series and a fourth Emmy for Peter Dinklage for his performance as Tyrion Lannister in the final season.\n\nBilly Porter (\u201cPose\u201d) and Jodie Comer (\u201cKilling Eve\u201d) win best actor and best actress in a drama, respectively.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s \u201cFleabag\u201d wins best comedy, best writing and best actress; Bill Hader wins lead actor in a comedy for \u201cBarry\u201d for the second consecutive year.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d wins variety sketch series for third straight year; \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver\u201d wins variety talk series for fourth straight year.\n\n\u2015\n\n10:59: \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wins outstanding drama series. The show took home the prize for its final season, despite it being generally reviled by critics and fans alike. That shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. In 2016, it became the most awarded show in Emmy history. The final season actually shattered the record for the most nods for a show in a single season, earning 32.\n\n\u201cThis all started in the demented mind of George R.R. Martin,\u201d Benioff said, thanking the author. Weiss then thanked the cast, saying, \u201cYou make everything we write better. We love you, and we loved every minute we\u2019ve spent with all of you,\u201d before thanking the \u201chardest working crews in television \u2026 it is amazing that all of you are still alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we finished it. I can\u2019t believe we did it,\u201d Benoiff said, before thanking his wife Amanda Peet, which is his usual refrain.\n\n\u2015\n\n10:54: \u201cFleabag\u201d wins outstanding comedy series.\n\n\u201cWell this is just getting ridiculous,\u201d creator, writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge said. \u201c\u2018Fleabag\u2019 started as a one-woman show at Edinburgh Festival in 2014 and the journey has been absolutely mental.\u201d\n\nWaller-Bridge also said \u201cSeason 2 would not have had happened or exploded in the way that it did if it were not for Andrew Scott who came into the \u2018Fleabag\u2019 world as a whirlwind.\u201d Yes, the Hot Priest.\n\n[The complete list of 2019 Emmy Award winners]\n\n\u2015\n\n10:46: Jodie Comer wins lead actress in a drama series for \u201cKilling Eve.\u201d This was her first nomination.\n\n\u2015\n\n10:42: Jason Bateman wins best directing for a drama series for \u201cOzark.\u201d\n\nThe honor, for helming the Season 2 opener, \u201cReparations,\u201d marks the actor-director\u2019s first win and seventh nomination. \u201cWow, that is something,\u201d Bateman said before dedicating portions of his statuette (\u201cMean Girls\u201d-style, but without actually breaking it) to cast and crew members from the Netflix series. \u201cI can\u2019t be holding this without a whole lot of people that make this show I\u2019m so lucky to be a part of work,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2015\n\n10:38: Billy Porter wins outstanding lead actor in a drama series for \u201cPose.\u201d\n\n\"The category is love, y'all. Love. I am so overwhelmed,\" began an emotional Porter, who gave an exuberant speech in which he quoted James Baldwin, thanked his mother and praised Ryan Murphy.\n\nFirst he quoted Baldwin, saying, \u201cIt took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I had been taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around the earth like I have the right to be here,\u201d before adding, \u201cI have the right, you have the right, we all have the right.\u201d\n\nThen he thanked those in his life. \u201cI love you, Mommy,\u201d he told his mother, who was sitting in the audience, then thanked the show\u2019s co-creator Ryan Murphy: \u201cYou saw me, you believed in us, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d\n\nFinally, he left the audience with some thoughts on artistry: \u201cWe as artists are the people who get to change the molecular structure of the hearts and minds of people who live on this planet \u2026 Please never stop doing that.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n10:29: Halsey sang a rendition of \u201cTime After Time\u201d for the In Memoriam segment, which paid tribute to everyone from John Singleton to Doris Day to Cokie Roberts.\n\n\u2015\n\n10:22: Julia Garner wins supporting actress in a drama series for \u201cOzark.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n10:19: Jesse Armstrong wins best writing for a drama series for HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n10:14: Peter Dinklage wins outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nWinning his fourth Emmy for playing Tyrion Lannister, Dinklage\u2019s win marked the first for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on Sunday night. Dinklage kicked off his speech by admitting, \"I have no idea what I\u2019m about to say, but here we go.\"\n\nFirst, he said he was thankful to be part of a community of tolerance and diversity, because there is \u201cno other place could I be standing on a stage, like this.\u201d But he spent most of his speech profusely thanking co-showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what I was getting myself into but I knew David and Dan were quite brilliant,\u201d he said, before saying something that was censored on television.\n\n\u201cWe did nothing but sweat. We did nothing but laugh,\u201d said Dinklage, who beat out two of his co-stars, Alfie Allen and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau for the award. \u201cI would literally walk through fire and ice for you, literally. And would do it again in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n10:03: \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver\u201d wins best variety talk show series.\n\nThis is the fourth year in a row the HBO show has won this award, and John Oliver gave a special shout-out to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for \u201cthe lead in\u201d all these years.\n\n\u2015\n\n10:00: Don Roy King wins best directing for a variety series for \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n9:51: \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d wins best variety sketch series.\n\nLorne Michaels, the show\u2019s longtime executive producer, gave an unexpectedly poignant speech, noting that the series had submitted the episode hosted by Adam Sandler. The comedian returned to Studio 8H in May \u2014 24 years after leaving SNL \u2014 and performed a tribute to his late friend and co-star, Chris Farley. The moment made \u201cthe crew and the cast and everyone who was in that studio\u201d emotional, Michael said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare that you see a cameraman tear up or a boom crew crying, but it was a very, very chilling moment and very powerful,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s those kinds of moments, which is why we\u2019re going into our 45th season, and that sort of thing is what keeps us there. That, and the politics.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n9:49: \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver\u201d wins outstanding writing in a variety series.\n\n\u2015\n\n9:39: \u201cChernobyl\u201d wins for best limited series.\n\nCreator Craig Mazin thanked the country of Lithuania, where much of the series was filmed, and said that he hoped \u201cin some small way, our show has helped remind people of the value of the truth and the danger of the lie.\u201d He also mentioned \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d as another example of how television can bring stories to light and make them known.\n\n\u2015\n\n9:34: Michelle Williams wins lead actress in a limited series or movie for \u201cFosse/Verdon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see this as an acknowledgment of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feels safe enough to voice them and respected enough that they\u2019ll be heard,\u201d she said.\n\nWilliams went on to thank FX and the series\u2019 producers for \u201csupporting me completely and for paying me equally.\u201d (The actress has been outspoken on pay equality since news broke that she made less than one percent of the money her co-star Mark Wahlberg did for the film \u201cAll the Money in the World.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThey understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd then where do they put that value? They put it into their work. And so the next time a woman \u2014 especially a woman of color, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar to her white male counterpart \u2014 tells you what she needs to do her job, listen to her, believe her. Because one day, she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment, and not in spite of it.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n9:27: \u201cBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u201d wins outstanding television movie.\n\nThe win led to a solid Brexit joke from \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d creator and co-showrunner, Charlie Brooker, who quipped: \u201cBeing British we were conditioned to expect 52 percent of you to vote for Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n9:17: Jharrel Jerome wins outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie for \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d\n\nJerome\u2019s win marks the first of the night for the Ava DuVernay\u2019s powerful Netflix series about the Central Park Five, five men of color who were wrongly prosecuted for rape and assault. Their convictions were later vacated.\n\nAfter thanking DuVernay \u201cfor giving me this opportunity\u201d and his mother, who he brought as a guest, Jerome addressed the men the series was about \u2014 all of whom were in the audience as guests of DuVernay. \u201cMost importantly, this is for the men that we know as the Exonerated Five. Thank you so much. It\u2019s an honor; it\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Jerome concluded, as the audience rose and applauded.\n\n\u2015\n\n9:13: Craig Mazin wins best writing in a limited series or a movie for \u201cChernobyl.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n9:11: Ben Whishaw wins best supporting actor in a limited series for \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d\n\nWhishaw, who confessed to having a hangover after his agent took him out earlier, thanked his fellow castmates. And to Hugh Grant, he said: \u201cI hope you get one of these.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n9:04: Johan Renck wins best directing for a limited series or a movie for \u201cChernobyl.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:54: Patricia Arquette wins supporting actress in a limited series or a movie for \u201cThe Act.\u201d\n\nArquette accepted the award, first thanking everyone from Hulu to her family. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d she said, before assuming a more serious tone and addressing the death of her sister Alexis Arquette, a trans woman who died in 2016 of complications stemming from HIV.\n\n\u201cI just have to say I'm grateful to be working, I'm grateful at 50 to be getting the best parts of my life, and that's great,\u201d Arquette said. \u201cBut in my heart, I'm so sad. I lost my sister Alexis, and that trans people are still being persecuted, and I'm in mourning every day of my life.\"\n\n\u201cChange the world so trans people are not persecuted. And give them jobs. They\u2019re human beings, so give them jobs,\u201d Arquette added, as Laverne Cox, one of the most high-profile trans actors in Hollywood who brought an ACLU attorney as her guest to the awards show, stood in the audience and held up her purse, decorated with a rainbow flag.\n\nLaverne Cox reacts to Patricia Arquette's #Emmys speech, where she said: \"I'm so sad I lost my sister Alexis and that trans people are still being persecuted... Let's get rid of this bias that we have everywhere\" pic.twitter.com/gxaGHKRxdV \u2014 Variety (@Variety) September 23, 2019\n\n\u2015\n\n8:47: \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d wins best reality-competition program.\n\n\u201cWe are so proud of this show and we are so happy for all the gorgeous kids who come on and show how fabulous they are,\u201d said RuPaul, who then offered one of the few political words of the night: \u201cThanks to the Academy for voting for us. Speaking of voting and love, go and register to vote!\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:44: Phoebe Waller-Bridge wins lead actress in a comedy series for \u201cFleabag.\u201d\n\nAfter stunning the audience by beating Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who won for \u201cVeep\u201d six years in a row, Waller-Bridge repeated a joke she made moments ago, when she won best writing in a comedy series: \u201cI find acting really hard and really painful.\u201d\n\nShe thanked the \u201cFleabag\u201d family once again, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s sickening how much we all love each other.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:37: Bill Hader wins best lead actor in a comedy for \u201cBarry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was awesome, thank you,\u201d Hader said to presenters Maya Rudolph and Ike Barinholtz, who pretended to be unable to read the teleprompter due to last-minute Lasik eye surgery. (Hader\u2019s fellow nominee Michael Douglas was called \u201cMickey Two-Times\u201d as a result of the bit.)\n\nHader, who won the same category last year, thanked just one person: his co-creator Alec Berg.\n\n\u201cUsually, after every take, I get one of two responses\u201d from Berg, Hader noted. \u201cEither \u2018yeah, we should move on,\u2019 or \u2018yeaaaah, we should go again.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for molding my performance, Alec,\u201d Hader quipped. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without you, man.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:31: Harry Bradbeer wins best directing in a comedy series for \u201cFleabag.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like \u2018Fleabag\u2019 only comes along once in your life,\u201d Bradbeer said, thanking \u201ca cast that only had to open their mouths to make me look good.\u201d He thanked Waller-Bridge in particular, saying she came into his life like \u201csome kind of glorious grenade \u2026 scientists are still trying to figure out how someone so utterly talented can be so lovely.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:23: Phoebe Waller-Bridge wins best writing for a comedy series for \u201cFleabag.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find writing really, really hard and really painful but I\u2019d like to say honestly, from the bottom of my heart is the reason I do it is this,\u201d Waller-Bridge said with a smirk, holding up the Emmy statuette. \u201cIt\u2019s made it all really worth it. Thank you, guys.\u201d\n\nAfter thanking everyone who worked on the Amazon Prime show, the writer-actor said, \u201cIt\u2019s just really wonderful to know, and reassuring, that a dirty, pervy, angry, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:18: Alex Borstein wins for best supporting actress in a comedy for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people were upset last year because I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra,\u201d she began, \u201cso I want to apologize because tonight I\u2019m not wearing any underwear. So you\u2019re just going to want to throw that chair out or clean it.\u201d\n\nBorstein dedicated her award to \u201cevery woman on the \u2018Maisel\u2019 cast and crew,\u201d as well as her grandmother, who is a Holocaust survivor. Though her grandmother was warned that she might be shot if she stepped out of line, Borstein said, she did so anyway.\n\n\u201cStep out of line, ladies,\u201d Borstein concluded. \u201cStep out of line.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:10: Tony Shalhoub wins best supporting actor in a comedy for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d\n\nThis is the fourth Emmy for Shalhoub, who plays the father of Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s beloved Midge Maisel. The actor said he wasn\u2019t much for speeches, or as he put it, \u201cthe names and the thanks and the thanks and the names.\u201d But luckily for Shalhoub, there were only really two names he needed to remember: creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and executive producer Daniel Palladino. The husband-wife team (also known for \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) has done just about everything on the show \u2014 from writing to musical production \u2014 which became the joke in Shalhoub\u2019s reluctant speech.\n\n\u2015\n\n8:08: When introducing the comedy awards, Ben Stiller reflected on comedy\u2019s past, using wax statues of comedians of old, such as George Burns and Lucille Ball. Then, he reached Bob Newhart. \u201cWhat would Bob think today, if he could see how the rules had changed?\u201d Stiller said, as the supposed wax statue of Newhart began blinking and talking and we realized it was the real thing. \u201cBen, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d he said. Stiller protested that he actually knew Newhart was alive, to which the elder comedian pointed out, \u201cYou put me with George [Burns] and Lucy [Ball] in this weird wax museum of comedy.\u201d\n\nStiller continued defending himself, saying he was just trying to honor a legend, to which Newhart said, \u201cThis legend is gonna kick your ass. That way you\u2019ll know I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t curse,\u201d replied a shocked Stiller. Newhart had one more verbal punch up his sleeve: \u201cYou thought I was dead.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n8:06: Bryan Cranston got shoved onstage by a producer, and he ended up doing the \u201ctelevision is important!\u201d intro, peppering his inspirational ode to television with just a handful of jokes.\n\nUsing his best \u201cvoice of God,\u201d Cranston said that \u201c50 years ago, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and through the power of television, 600 million people and 350 million households walked with him. Not a bad rating.\u201d\n\nNow television takes us to places like Winterfell (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) and the Upside Down (\u201cStranger Things\u2019). It \u201cwelcomes us to a family home where \u2026 we cry with the Pearsons,\u201d from \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s multiple times. Every single week,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cPlease, stop making us cry.\u201d Sterling K. Brown, sitting in the audience, mouthed an apology.\n\n\u2015\n\n8:00: After the night\u2019s \u201chost,\u201d Homer Simpson, fell through a hole in the stage, \u201cBlack-ish\u201d star Anthony Anderson popped out of his seat, ready to go.\n\n\u201cI will get this show back on track,\u201d he announced, summoning Taraji P. Henson as well: \u201cTaraji, we will not let this \u2018Empire\u2019 fall!\u201d (Did she even show up after this?)\n\nWhen Ike Barinholtz offered Anderson a drink backstage, the latter responded, \u201cNo Starbucks cups on television!\u201d Oof, a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d burn within three minutes of the show starting.\n\n\u2015\n\n7:35: A lot of people are excited to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus back in the running for lead actress in a comedy \u2014 including her fellow nominee Rachel Brosnahan. \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d star won last year when \u201cVeep\u201d wasn\u2019t eligible, but Louis-Dreyfus \u2014 who famously won six consecutive Emmys for playing Selina Meyer on the HBO comedy \u2014 is the favorite to win for \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d final bow. Brosnahan called Louis-Dreyfus \u201cmy hero, my queen,\u201d and also heaped praise on the other women in the category, calling each of her fellow nominees \u201ca master class in comedy.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n7:30: There will be no host for this year\u2019s Emmys, so Thomas Lennon will be providing the voice-overs in between, doing much of the legwork that a traditional host would do.\n\nIs this stuff scripted? Not all of it. Lennon promised some ad-libbing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it will be boring, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n7:22: \u201cI will not be winning husband of the year, for sure,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, whose wife \u2014 \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d co-head writer Molly McNearney \u2014 had an unfortunate welcome to the purple carpet. \u201cSomeone knocked a huge tray of drinks over,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cAnd I immediately took a picture of it.\u201d Kimmel may be a terrible Instagram husband, but his ABC late-night show is up for an Emmy.\n\n\u2015\n\n7:20: Emilia Clarke said that after reading the final script for \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d in which \u2014 SPOILER ALERT! \u2014 her character is assassinated by her nephew/lover Jon Snow, she \u201cjust didn\u2019t know what on Earth I had just read.\u201d A wide swath of the show\u2019s fans shared her shock, many of them finding the finale extremely disappointing. Clarke didn\u2019t say if she was pleased with the ending or not. Instead, she added that while several cast members took mementos from the set, she was \u201ca good girl.\u201d \u201cI [only] took Daenerys in my heart forever.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n7:16: We\u2019re not sure how often Julia Louis-Dreyfus is asked to do \u201cthe Elaine\u201d dance from \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d But here comes Jenny McCarthy, hosting the Fox pre-show and making this awkward request of the famed comedic actress. (Apparently, it\u2019s a \u201cdream\u201d of McCarthy\u2019s to do this dance with the \u201cVeep\u201d star.)\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Louis-Dreyfus responded. \u201cYou do it.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy then started convulsing, but the review wasn\u2019t great; too much rhythm, Louis-Dreyfus said.\n\n\u2015\n\n7:12: Indya Moore, who stars on the nominated series \u201cPose,\u201d spoke about representation in the fashion and entertainment worlds.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re included, it affirms that we are important and we do belong,\u201d said Moore, who identifies as trans and non-binary. \u201cI\u2019m happy to occupy that reality and that space.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n7:05: What\u2019s this? Oh, just Jenny McCarthy swapping Kirk Douglas stories with his son Michael Douglas, and his daughter-in-law, Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nApparently the \u201cMasked Singer\u201d host starred in a movie with the elder Douglas. For his birthday, McCarthy decided to surprise him on set with a gift. \u201cI gave him a birthday lap dance,\u201d McCarthy recalled. (He was around 80 at the time).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s never forgotten it,\u201d Zeta-Jones told McCarthy.

Where\u2019s your wife?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n6:55: This is a big weekend for Billy Porter, who turned 50 on Saturday. The actor is a favorite to win best lead actor in a drama for his acclaimed turn as Pray Tell, a nurturing ball scene emcee in FX\u2019s \u201cPose.\u201d \u201cAll of my dreams are coming true,\u201d said Porter, who called Pray Tell \u201cthe role of a lifetime.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m grateful that I could live to see the day that I could stand in my authenticity.\u201d\n\nIf Porter wins Sunday, he will be on his way to EGOT \u2014 he won a Tony in 2013 for \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d and a Grammy the following year for the same production.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:40: The Emmys are as nerve wracking as you might think for introverts like Laura Linney. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very natural environment to be in,\u201d the \u201cOzark\u201d star \u2014 nominated for best lead actress in a drama series \u2014 told E!\u2019 s Jason Kennedy.

Cheering until his voice gives out.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:33: Billy Bush is back on the red carpet, where he\u2019s reportedly received an \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from his former colleagues.\n\nThis comes three years after The Washington Post published audio of a 2005 conversation between Bush and Donald Trump, in which the then-reality TV host bragged about groping women. In the aftermath, Bush lost his job on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d and Trump was elected president.\n\nBush, who started a new job hosting on \u201cExtra Extra\u201d this month, told a Variety reporter on the Emmys carpet, \u201cI get anxious before any carpet, or anything I do on a work front, always a little butterflies. You want things to go well.\u201d\n\nBut is he worried about someone saying something about \u201cthe controversy,\u201d as the reporter put it? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Bush responded. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be \u2014 that\u2019s really old. I think it\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n6:28: What\u2019s it like to attend an award show as a nominee?

Quickly, though, she offered a heartfelt thanks to Schur: \u201cThis man took a chance on me for no good reason,\u201d she said, again adding that when filming wrapped, \u201cI cried and cried and cried all night.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n6:05: \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d alumna Laverne Cox brought an ACLU attorney with her to the red, er, purple carpet. The pair talked about the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming vote on a Trump administration brief that argues Title VII \u2014 the landmark statute that prohibits employment discrimination \u2014 does not protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Cox\u2019s rainbow-colored clutch featured a rundown of the cases\u2019 most significant details, including the date Oct. 8, which is when the court will hear cases.\n\n\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t talking about this case and it has implications for the LGBTQ community, but it has implications for women and anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to someone else\u2019s idea of how you should be a man or a woman or both or neither,\u201d Cox told Guiliana Rancic.\n\nIt was a markedly political intro to E!\u2019 s pre-show coverage, but Cox noted, \u201cIt\u2019s not all political, like I dance around in my underwear, too.\u201d That aside led Rancic to ask about the looks the actress was serving at Rihanna\u2019s recent Savage X Fenty fashion show.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:03: Your eyes are not deceiving you: Stars are arriving and stopping to chat on a carpet that is not red, but a deep shade of purple.
