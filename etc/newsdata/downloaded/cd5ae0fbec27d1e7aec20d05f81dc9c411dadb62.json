It\u2019ll introduce stuff like skins, cosmetics and a game mode centred around zombies, and will also see the return of Kings Canyon, only now the lights are out.\n\nThis spookier Kings Canyon isn\u2019t just for effect, it\u2019s part of a temporary game mode called Shadowfall, which sees dead players reanimated as a zombie and put on a team called \u201cShadow Squad\u201d. This takes away your weapons and legend abilities in exchange for a melee attack, faster movement, bigger jumps and the ability to scale walls.\n\nThe game continues as normal while more and more players become zombies (who are free to attack anyone), but once there are only ten \u201cliving\u201d players left, teams are combined and the objective changes, Left 4 Dead style, to reaching an \u201cevac ship\u201d while trying to stay alive.\n\nAs for the other stuff, here\u2019s a short rundown (EA\u2019s emphasis, not mine):\n\nExclusive event challenges with free earnable cosmetics, including Two Legendary Weapon Skins\n\n24 Event Limited premium cosmetics that players can now unlock in one of three ways : Direct purchase for Apex CoinsDirect unlock with Crafting MetalsRandom unlock with Event Apex Packs Additionally, the Event Currency in these packs has been replaced with non-event loot drops, yielding more loot overall\n\nLifeline Heirloom Set PreviewUnlock all 24 Fight or Fright pack cosmetics during the event and unlock the Lifeline Heirloom set for free\n\nDouble XP for Top 5 & Wins Weekend\n\nWhile the full details are at the announcement page.", "description": "Apex Legends is running a Halloween event from October 15 until November 5 called Fight or Fright.
