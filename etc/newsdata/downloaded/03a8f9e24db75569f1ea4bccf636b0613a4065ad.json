We set that as a goal.\u201d\n\nPlayoffs? Bulls?\n\nThey insist it\u2019s a possibility coming off an injury-riddled season in which they posted one of the worst records in franchise history at 22-60.\n\nThat will hinge largely on promising core players Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine, Otto Porter Jr. and Wendell Carter Jr. staying healthy and taking their games to a higher level. The Bulls also believe they set themselves up for bigger things with the moves they made in the offseason.\n\nThey signed veteran forward Thaddeus Young to a $41 million, three-year contract. They also gave point guard Kris Dunn some competition after he took a step back last season, drafting Coby White with the No. 7 overall pick and bringing in Tom\u00e1s Satoransk\u00fd.\n\nThey insist they\u2019re deeper, more versatile and ready for bigger things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot of pressure because we expect ourselves to go to that level,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cWe worked extremely hard.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to know with the Bulls starting practices:\n\nFOR STARTERS\n\nBoylen finally gets to put his stamp on a team right from the start.\n\nThe longtime NBA assistant got his first head coaching job in the league when Fred Hoiberg was fired with Chicago at 5-19 last year. Boylen got off to a rocky start with his players before things smoothed over and guided the Bulls to a 17-41 record the rest of the way. He then got a contract extension even though he was signed through this season.\n\nBoylen would like to see the team play faster. He\u2019s challenging LaVine and Markkanen to become better defenders. And he wants Markkanen to be a more consistent rebounder after he averaged nine per game to go with 18.7 points.\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nMarkkanen said the heart problem that kept him out of the final two weeks last season is fine and there is \u201cno reason to look back at it.\u201d\n\nCarter said he is completely healed after a left thumb injury cut short his promising rookie season. The No. 7 pick in 2018, he 10.3 points and seven rebounds in 44 games. The 6-10 Carter also had surgery in July to repair an abdominal muscle injury.\n\nPaxson said Denzel Valentine is also ready after missing last season due to reconstructive left ankle surgery. He also said forward Chandler Hutchinson (hamstring) will be out \u201cfor a little bit\u201d and the same goes for forward Luke Kornet (turf toe).\n\nA SLAM DUNK\n\nThe Bulls will host the All-Star game for the first time since 1988, when Michael Jordan took off from the foul line to win an epic dunk contest and put on an MVP performance in the game.\n\nThe slam dunk champion in 2015 and 2016 as a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves, LaVine indicated he will participate in the contest if his legs are right. A bigger goal is making his first All-Star team.\n\n\u201cI had an All-Star caliber season,\u201d said LaVine, who averaged a career-high 23.7 points in 63 games. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t (experience) that because we didn\u2019t win. \u2026 I think everything comes with winning. I want that to be more important.\u201d\n\nON POINT\n\nDunn seems to be taking the point guard competition in stride. The Bulls were looking for an upgrade after he went from averaging 13.4 points to 11.3 in 46 games.\n\n\u201cJust focus on leading the team,\u201d he said. \u201cMe personally, just keep a good mindset to try to improve my game.\u201d\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cWe have some guys who (are) at a time in their careers where they have to step up. And that\u2019s Zach. That\u2019s Lauri. That\u2019s Otto. \u2026 I think we have people around them, complements to them, that are gonna help this team a lot.\u201d- Paxson.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The way John Paxson sees it, the Chicago Bulls are ready to contend for a playoff spot.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/bulls_media_day_basketball_88817_c0-159-3812-2381_s1770x1032.jpg?e0f46af42ffbb8f9fd3206bb255a72b6b7d6fde6", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
