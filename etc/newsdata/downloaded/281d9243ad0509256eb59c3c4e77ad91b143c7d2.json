It appears to have then been assumed to be new details rather than a round-up of existing ones.\n\nIt suggests there will be three different phones, as repeatedly rumoured in previous leaks. As with other leaks, it suggests they will be named the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max; as such, they will keep the general line-up as the existing phones, though with different names.\n\nOtherwise, it simply repeats what is known about the new phones. It suggests they will look the same as the existing models but will have a much larger camera array on the back, with an extra lens, and that the camera will be the biggest upgrade in the new phones.\n\nThe only very new rumour is that the Pro versions of the iPhone 11 will include the ability to use the Apple Pencil, and may come with a smaller version of the stylus. Such a rumour seems unlikely, especially given much has leaked about the new phone and that has included no references to any new stylus.\n\nIt also makes detailed reference to the specs of the phone, including a rumour that they will have more RAM than their predecessors. But there is nothing to indicate that will be the case, especially given that Apple is usually not especially open about how much RAM is in each phone, even when they have been released.", "description": "A new leak claims to show all of the specifications of the upcoming iPhone 11.
