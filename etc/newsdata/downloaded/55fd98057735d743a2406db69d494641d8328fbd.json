Analysts had expected a 2.0% rise in a Reuters poll after July's 3.3% gain.\n\nThat's despite analyst expectations that a falling yuan would offset some cost pressure and looming tariffs may have prompted some Chinese exporters to bring forward or \"front-load\" U.S.-bound shipments into August, a trend seen earlier in the trade dispute.\n\nChina let its currency slide past the key 7 per dollar level in August for the first time since the global financial crisis, and Washington labelled it a currency manipulator.\n\n\"Exports are still weak even in the face of substantial yuan currency depreciation, indicating that sluggish external demand is the most important factor affecting exports this year,\" said Zhang Yi, economist at Zhong Hai Sheng Rong Capital Management.\n\nAmong its major trade partners, China's August exports to the United States fell 16% year-on-year, slowing sharply from a decline of 6.5% in July. Imports from America slumped 22.4%.\n\nMany analysts expect export growth to slow further in coming months, as evidenced by worsening export orders in both official and private factory surveys. More U.S. tariff measures will take effect on Oct. 1 and Dec. 15.\n\n\"China-U.S. trade friction has led to a sharp decline in China's exports to the United States,\" said Steven Zhang, chief economist and head of research at Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities.\n\nExports to Europe, South Korea, Australia, and Southeast Asia also worsened on an annual basis, compared with July, while shipments to Japan and Taiwan posted slightly better growth than the previous month.\n\nSunday's data also showed China's imports shrank for the fourth consecutive month since April. Imports dropped 5.6% on-year in August, slightly less than an expected 6.0% fall and unchanged from July's 5.6% decline.\n\nSluggish domestic demand was likely the main factor in the decline, along with softening global commodity prices. China's domestic consumption and investment have remained weak despite more than a year of growth boosting measures.\n\nChina reported a trade surplus of $34.84 billion last month, compared with a $45.06 billion surplus in July.
