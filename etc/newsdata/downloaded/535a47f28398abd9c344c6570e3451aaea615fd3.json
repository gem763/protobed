Like the rest of us, Pelosi can see that the pressure is getting to President Trump, as he erupts in profane outbursts and spews reckless accusations of treason at those who would challenge his actions.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I think he is having a limbo contest with himself, to see how low he can go in his rhetoric,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he was surprised that this happened, because he thinks he can do whatever he wants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor many months, Pelosi had resisted the calls within her party to commence the process that could lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment. What forced her hand, the speaker said, were the facts, the sheer impropriety of Trump pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to turn up dirt on Trump\u2019s leading presidential rival, former vice president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cHe has committed impeachable offenses even before this, but I do think this is more easily understandable by the public,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHe gave us no choice. And if he doesn\u2019t understand and the Republicans can\u2019t grasp that \u2014 the fact that he undermined our national security, our Constitution and our electoral system \u2014 that\u2019s their problem.\u201d\n\nPelosi remains determined not to give in to the impulses of some Democrats to make impeachment a vehicle for everything about the president that stirs their rage. All of that should await November 2020, she said, when voters will have their opportunity to weigh in on Trump\u2019s policies, his temperament and his character.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo many of the things that people are unhappy about about the president are not about impeachment. That\u2019s about the election. Take it up with the election,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIf you think he\u2019s a coward on protecting children from gun violence, and you think he\u2019s cruel for not protecting \u2018dreamers,\u2019 if you think he is in denial on climate change, take that up in the election. That has nothing to do with what we are doing here. If you think his vocabulary and his behavior and his immorality and his indecency are personally offensive, take it up in the election.\u201d\n\nIt took some by surprise when Pelosi declared that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Democrats lose their majority in the House over their decision to drive toward impeachment.\n\nBut she is not backing down from her contention that the constitutional questions at hand outweigh the politics. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a healthy thing for a country if people just come here and say it\u2019s about winning the next election,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNone of which is to say that her concern for her more vulnerable members is not weighing upon her. \u201cAs we take brave steps like this, we have to have a \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019 team to protect those who may be more in danger,\u201d she said, adding that means \u201cowning the ground, not yielding one grain of sand to the Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe speaker is closely monitoring what her members are hearing back home in their districts during this congressional recess and noted that some are already being hit by Republican ads accusing them of staging \u201ca coup.\u201d\n\nFighting back means marshaling money, organization and a message. It was by design that Pelosi opened her news conference Wednesday talking about the legislation the House has passed to lower prescription drug costs, even as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the leader of the impeachment investigation, stood by her side.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe point she wanted to get across was a rejoinder to the president\u2019s tweeted claim that \u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the House has spent this year passing measures to lower drug costs, strengthen the Affordable Care Act, encourage more employers to offer retirement plans, tighten background checks of gun buyers, reduce gender-pay disparity and reauthorize the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. All of those measures are languishing in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of unhappy about the fact that most people in the country didn\u2019t know what we were doing. I\u2019m tired of whining about the press not printing it. We\u2019ve got to go advertise it ourselves, and we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the meantime, Trump\u2019s chief adversary at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue is settling in for the duration, however long it might be. \u201cI have never talked about any timeline. I don\u2019t have the timeline,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt will go expeditiously \u2014 that is to say, we\u2019ll use the time well to get the facts. We\u2019re not moving hastily, though.\u201d\n\nFor a president who grows more agitated by the day, that might be the worst news of all.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump is now publicly abusing his oath of office\n\nRahm Emanuel: On impeachment, Pelosi has many good options\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDonna F.
