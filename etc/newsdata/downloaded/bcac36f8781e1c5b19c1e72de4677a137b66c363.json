It became a form of storytelling and enabled the audience to explore the arc of each film, and relive the best moments again.\n\nThe Oscar winner also sometimes deconstructed some of his most iconic work into individual parts, and audience members could experience the epic moments of some of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe Lion King soundtrack review: Beyonce and Donald Glover shine in mostly fantastic 2019 update to classic Disney songs\n\nWhile Zimmer was undoubtedly the mastermind behind the whole show and the music, what made it a night to remember was also how talented each individual performer was. All the musicians in his live band were at the top of their games, and many were able to play multiple instruments at an elite level.\n\nTake Shanghai-born Chinese-American cellist Tina Guo as an example. Her sleek, matte-white electric cello almost became an extension of her body, and each note during her Pirates of the Caribbean solo was emotionally charged and played with passion and power.\n\nGuitarist extraordinaire Guthrie Govan, who according to Zimmer has never played the same solo twice during their 100-show run, blew everyone away with his amazing riffs and superhuman picking skills. Last but certainly not least, Lebo M, who sang the opening Zulu vocals in the original Lion King soundtrack, lit the venue on fire with his penetrating voice.\n\nZimmer did not disappoint when he brought his music to Hong Kong.

The 62-year-old, who had a boyish grin on his face throughout the night, shared anecdotes and provided context for each film.\n\nHis dialogue gave us a peek into the origins of his iconic scores and how they came to be. He shared an intimate moment with the audience in a fully-packed 3200-seat venue, as he talked about how he and his team regrouped and recovered from the tragic and untimely death of actor Heath Ledger, before playing the somber notes of The Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nThe multi-sensory experience was further enhanced by impeccable lighting - each burst of light was perfectly in sync with the music and helped set the mood for each segment.
