Zeke was preparing for a job interview the next day, and his dad stepped in with a pair of scissors to give him a fade and help him get ready.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came out as trans my parents didn\u2019t know wtf to do with me, almost 3 years into my transition and my dad\u2019s out here giving me a fade and trimming my beard in the backyard. If you needed a sign that things get better here it is,\u201d Acosta wrote on Twitter accompanying the video.\n\nThe Chicago native's post garnered thousands of retweets and likes. What seemed like a little hair care was, in reality, a special moment for father and son that the internet couldn\u2019t get enough of.\n\nWhen I first came out as trans my parents didn\u2019t know wtf to do with me, almost 3 years into my transition and my dad\u2019s out here giving me a fade and trimming my beard in the backyard.

Although his parents are fully supportive now, they were initially confused.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is a larger conversation that needs to be had because Latino families typically don\u2019t really have the vocabulary in which to talk about ... having trans kids or having trans family members or what that even means for the family,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of representation of trans men that are Latinos, so I never really felt like trans was something I could identify as.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Zeke Acosta\n\nAcosta says his college experience helped him not only understand his identity but also granted him access to educational resources so that he could explain what he was feeling to his family.\n\nAlthough it was a confusing period of time, he credits the film \"Viva\" on Netflix and the popular series \"Pose\" to helping his family understand him and his identity.\n\n\u201cI think different kinds of cinematic representations helped to open the conversation easier than you trying to do it individually because I know it takes a lot emotionally to even start that conversation, and exposing your family to queer culture is important.\u201d\n\nAcosta was surprised to see that \"Pose\" actually cast transgender actors, and he applauds the show for its dedication to stories about transgender women of color.\n\nHe looks up to the character Elektra, played by actress Dominique Jackson, saying that he\u2019s inspired by how she is so comfortable in herself and is able to speak on who she is.\n\n\u201cI feel like a lot of times trans people are told to be quiet or told that our issues don\u2019t matter or we\u2019re made to feel belittled, and, you know, Elektra is just everything I would like to be,\u201d Acosta said.\n\nWhile he\u2019s happy that many people responded positively to the video he posted to Twitter with his dad, he emphasizes that the transgender community needs a lot of support and acceptance.\n\nAcosta said he is privileged in that he is college-educated, doing well financially and has a supportive family. But that\u2019s not always the case for others.\n\nCourtesy of Zeke Acosta\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 31% of survey respondents experienced homelessness with 14% experiencing homelessness in the year prior to the survey because of being transgender.\n\nIn the same report, 43% of Latinx respondents were living in poverty and 21% were unemployed.\n\nThe transgender community in the U.S., most specifically transgender women of color, are experiencing increased violence due to anti-transgender bias that the Human Rights Commission calls \u201ca national epidemic.\u201d In 2018, the HRC reported 26 deaths due to fatal violence, the majority of whom were black transgender women. In 2019 alone, there have been 16 reported violent deaths of black transgender women and two of Latinx transgender women.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s more conversation to be had, you know, because our communities don\u2019t really understand that there are brown trans people out there and what it means to be trans and having a conversation on that would be beneficial for future generations,\u201d Acosta said.\n\nHis parents are happy that people can see and learn from the video he posted on Twitter. As for the fade his dad gave him, Acosta laughed and said he probably won\u2019t let him cut it again.", "description": "Zeke Acosta shares a special moment with his father after coming out as transgender and thanks shows like", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/zeke-acosta-family-02-ht-jef-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
