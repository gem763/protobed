Cameroonians... know that they are capable of resolving their problems themselves. And they have done so.\"\n\nEnglish speakers account for about a fifth of Cameroon's population of 24 million.\n\nThey are mainly concentrated in the Northwest and Southwest regions, where they complain of discrimination and marginalisation, especially in education, the judiciary and economic opportunities.\n\nIn their September 22 meeting in Montreux, Akwanga and representatives of nine other separatist groups announced the creation of the Ambazonia Coalition Team (ACT), or Team Ambazonia.\n\nThe three-day meeting was the third organised in Switzerland since May.\n\nAll of the meetings so far have focussed purely on getting the separatists on the same page, according to a source close to the process who asked not to be identified. Several groups are still missing from the alliance.\n\nACT has vowed to facilitate access for international aid groups -- something the source described as \"a massive achievement.\"", "description": "Militant separatists may have reacted negatively to official efforts to resolve Cameroon's anglophone crisis, but a coalition of their groups is holding out...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/06/wire-19324200-1570252055-800_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
