(AP) - The biggest weakness in the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 secondary last season now might be its biggest strength.\n\nThrough two games, cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has intercepted one pass and allowed a microscopic quarterback rating of just 16.0. Last season, he intercepted zero passes and allowed a quarterback rating of 107.6.\n\nSomething about him has changed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not really a different player,\u201d cornerback Richard Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the mental approach he takes to adversity, to things not going his way, to the play calls, the slips, whatever the refs are doing. He just doesn\u2019t let it bother him. He\u2019s a guy on a mission. The switch is flipped for him.\u201d\n\nLast season, opponents rarely targeted Sherman, so they targeted Witherspoon frequently and he lost confidence. This season, Witherspoon has made opponents pay for challenging him. He intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown in Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and nearly recorded another pick-six in Week 2 against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\u201cI wish to God he would have gotten that pick-six,\u201d defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. \u201cBecause you keep showing that you can (intercept) the ball as a corner and teams are going to have to look another way. He\u2019s going to get many opportunities and I just feel like he\u2019s doing a real nice job.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers drafted Witherspoon in the third round in 2017. He started nine games his rookie season and 12 games in 2018 but was inconsistent.\n\n\u201cThe big thing, to me, is the work he put in in the weight room over the offseason,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cHe has gotten bigger. He has gotten stronger. He is able to press guys at the line of scrimmage and disrupt routes without disrupting himself. He\u2019s not having to lunge into people. He can stay on top and look for the ball.\u201d\n\nSaleh also attributes Witherspoon\u2019s improvement to a new mindset. \u201cHe\u2019s been very business-like. His mental makeup, in terms of being smart enough to play the position, the foot quickness, all that stuff has always been there. But now, the mindset of making this business-like every single day, never getting comfortable, has been the biggest difference,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Thursday in the locker room, Witherspoon described his new mindset while suiting up for practice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making practice game-like, so when I get to the game, it\u2019s easy,\u201d Witherspoon said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just getting out of my head. Not trying to see the game so much or interpret the game, just playing free and comfortable. Last year, for example, I was trying to see too much. By the time you try to figure out what\u2019s happening, it has already happened to you in the other direction. This year, I\u2019m just playing.\u201d\n\nSo far, Witherspoon has played exceptionally well against strong wide receivers, such as Mike Evans of the Buccaneers and John Ross of the Bengals. The challenges will continue this weekend when he matches up against Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\n\u201cConsistency is the truest measure of performance,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cMentally, he\u2019s got to maintain that mindset and make sure he approaches every day like he\u2019s got something to prove. He\u2019s got to keep a chip on his shoulder. If he does that, he\u2019s going to have a really nice year and he can have a really nice career.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The biggest weakness in the San Francisco 49ers' secondary last season now might be its biggest strength.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Grant Cohn"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/49ers_buccaneers_football_83423_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
