Well, that's a question that we will never have a concrete answer to. Singing reality show Indian Idol has been running for several years and has been serving contestants drama and emotions in equal measures.\n\nHowever, recently an incident that happened on the sets of the show left many cringing. In a promo clip shared by Sony Entertainment Television that is now viral, a man dressed in Rajasthani costume appears for an audition and then calls Neha on stage with him.\n\nHe then tries to badger Neha into believing that they know each other from before.\n\nAfter Neha denies, he gives her a hug and then forcibly plants a kiss on her cheek. Host Aditya Narayan, who was standing behind could not process what was happening but pushed the man away! Reacting to the incident, Vishal took to Twitter to mention that the man \u2018needs psychiatric help\u2019. Dadlani was reacting to a fan's comment who had written,\n\nDon't Miss 34.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 4 K SHARES 5.2 K SHARES\n\n\u201c@VishalDadlani sir uss launde ko chamet maarni chahiye thi (Sir you should have slapped the guy).. how dare he do such a thing.. I hope he was not let off easily.\u201d\n\nReacting to the fan's comment, Dadlani said,\n\nI suggested that the Police be called, but Neha decided to let the guy off the hook. He definitely needs psychiatric help, and we will try to help him get that, if we can. #IndianIdol11 https://t.co/CiCLy7u787 \u2014 VISHAL DADLANI (@VishalDadlani) October 20, 2019\n\nAnother fan expressed his opinion and added, \u201cYou have to take care it doesn\u2019t happen again. Can\u2019t ignore such things.\"\n\nFans were also angry at Sony Channel for airing the promo clip. Another fan comment wrote,\n\n\u201cWhen a TV channel telecast these types of incidents for TRP, When Sony hires Anu Malik as a Judge of the show , who has been accused of misconduct what kind of message we are sending to people that one can misbehave or assault a woman and get away with it.\"\n\nNeha Kakkar has been associated with Indian Idol since last two seasons now.", "description": "In a promo clip shared by Sony Entertainment Television that is now viral , a man dressed in Rajasthani costume appears for an audition and then calls Neha on stage with him.
