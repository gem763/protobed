Two fighters in each division will advance to the finals for a shot at $1 million.\n\nHeadlining the show is Alex Nicholson, who was one step away from making a PFL playoff final last year. Now he finds himself in a spot to redeem himself.\n\nNicholson (14-8 MMA, 3-3 PFL) will take on a familiar face in Francimar Barroso. He will be looking to avenge a unanimous loss to him in June and advance to the semifinals later the same night. After losing to Barroso, Nicholson rebounded with a first-round finish over Zeke Tuinei-Wily in August, punching his ticket to the playoffs.\n\nIn the video above, check out the \u201cRoad to the PFL Playoffs\u201d for a look at Nicholson\u2019s preparation, his journey last year, and Nicholson\u2019s breakdown of his quarterfinal and potential semifinal opponents.", "description": "Get an inside look at Alex Nicholson's journey to the PFL playoffs.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dan Tom", "Nolan King", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/alex-nicholson-pfl-2019-playoffs-3-promo-vid.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
