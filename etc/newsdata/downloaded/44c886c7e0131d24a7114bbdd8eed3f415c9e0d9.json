The first piece features a custom screen of 25 dividend stocks by John Buckingham. The second focuses on a rising income strategy, while the third includes advice about which high-dividend stocks to avoid.)\n\nIn the middle of a series of articles about dividend-stock strategies, it\u2019s good to include a contrary opinion of a money manager who questions the notion of focusing on dividends. Fabio Paolini, co-manager of the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund APINX, -0.78%, doesn\u2019t believe dividend payouts offer any clue to the quality of a company or attractiveness of its shares.\n\n\u201cFor us, the dividend is not a measure of value ... the dividend is a residual. It reflects how much management wants to pay out,\u201d Paolini said during an interview.\n\nLooking for quality\n\nIn their EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) strategy, which includes the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund, Paolini and his colleagues look for companies that appear to be well priced as long-term investments based on estimated cash flow streams and returns on capital.\n\nAt the end of the day a company is worth much more if you can reinvest with a high return of capital Fabio Paolini, co-manager of the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund\n\n\u201cWe want these companies to reinvest their cash flows in a profitable way, to generate a higher return.\u201d This means if a company is paying out dividends from a high percentage of its cash flow, it may mean its management doesn\u2019t see good opportunities to invest the cash for growth.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day a company is worth much more if you can reinvest with a high return of capital,\u201d Paolini said.\n\nHe emphasized that in the U.S., it is also important to factor in share buybacks and consider them \u201cin context,\u201d because a high total return of capital is a good indication of slow growth ahead.\n\n\u201cThe fact that interest rates are close to or below zero does not mean the stocks are more attractive. We think it is dangerous to think that way,\u201d Paolini said.\n\nAs an example of the type of stock favored for the fund, Paolini mentioned Safran SAF, -1.52%, the French manufacturer of engines for narrow-body passenger jets, which he discussed when we spoke in February 2018. The stock has returned 52% since Feb. 1, 2018 (the day before the previous article was published) through Aug. 29. It has a current dividend yield of only 1.39%.\n\nSome high dividend yields\n\nDespite urging investors not to be overly focused on dividend payouts, even with interest rates so low for so long, Paolini named three European financial stocks whose dividends happen to be high.\n\nHe calls the sector \u201cinteresting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe banking sector in Europe has been very depressed for a number of years,\u201d Paolini said, but now that \u201cthe regulatory headwinds are behind us,\u201d because the banks\u2019 capital levels are so high, quality franchises can be scooped up at low valuations.\n\nSo even though these three banks are suffering from low demand for loans and low interest rates, and are paying out nearly all their earnings in dividends, Paolini believes \u201cthe franchises are good\u201d and \u201cthe payouts are sustainable in the short term.\u201d\n\nBank Ticker Dividend yield Total return - 2019 through Aug. 29 Nordea Bank Abp NDA.SE, -1.16% 12.22% -9.9% Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. ISP, -0.15% 9.78% 14.1% Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. BBVA, +0.20% 4.68% -4.5% Source: FactSet\n\nFor U.S. investors, there are American depositary receipts (ADRs) for all three:\n\n\u2022 Nordea Bank Abp ADR NRDBY, -2.73%\n\n\u2022 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. ADR BBVA, -1.05%\n\n\u2022 Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. ADR ISNPY, +0.76%\n\nSaying the dividends are sustainable over the short term isn\u2019t the highest vote of confidence. But all three of these banks are held by the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund now that Paolini and his colleagues have \u201cput some money to work\u201d in the space. He sees \u201cgood downside protection\u201d for all three, adding: \u201cshould interest rates rise one day or the economy recover, we think the upside should be significant.\u201d\n\nHe described Nordea Bank NDA.SE, -1.16% of Helsinki as a \u201cpure retail\u201d Scandinavian institution with \u201csignificant fee income\u201d and called Intesa ISP, -0.15% Italy\u2019s most profitable bank, with close to half its revenue coming from fees. Significant revenue from asset management and insurance makes Intesa \u201cresilient,\u201d he said.\n\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria BBVA, +0.20% derives about 40% of its revenue from Spain and has large operations in Mexico and other regions of Latin America. \u201cIt has weakened significantly on interest rates and fear of Argentine contagion,\u201d Paolini said.\n\nFund holdings\n\nThe AMG Managers Pictet International Fund has $289 million in total assets, which is a tremendous decline from $2.1 billion when Paolini was interviewed along with his co-managers in February 2018. He said the decline took place because one very large institutional client decided to move from active strategies to passive strategies. \u201cSo all the money that came in from them, in roughly one year to 18 months, came out,\u201d he said. He added that the remaining investors in the fund were \u201cfairly diversified.\u201d\n\nHere are the fund\u2019s 10 largest holdings (out of 62) as of July 31:\n\nMore about dividend stocks in a world of low interest rates:\n\n\u2022 25 dividend stocks selected for value by an outperforming money manager\n\n\u2022 This dividend-stock strategy is for investors who want an attractive monthly income stream\n\n\u2022 Seeking attractive dividend stocks?
