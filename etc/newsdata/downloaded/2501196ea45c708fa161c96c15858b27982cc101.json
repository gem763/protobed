England want to go through the opposition, rather than around them, and that means big runners off nine and 10. They want to bully the opposition, so the 12 doesn't have quite as many touches.\n\nEveryone knows Jones is ruthless and honest. If he wants Farrell to play at No 10, then he will put Farrell at No 10. Ford is making an exceptional statement \u2014 'I merit selection in the knockout games' \u2014 but I don't think he is playing so well he can't be dropped.\n\nFord has had a couple of really good games. He's had good ball, set up a couple of good tries and looked really comfortable. But he's probably had 50 per cent more touches than Farrell so he's going to take centre stage.\n\nIf your team's stuttering a little bit, you become a facilitator at 12, rather than someone driving the game, and that's probably what's happened.\n\nGeorge Ford has looked superb in the No 10 shirt but had far more touches than Farrell\n\nWhen everyone is fit and firing Eddie Jones could play Farrell in his more natural role\n\nJones wants two front-line kickers on the field at any time, but his options have been limited so far because of Henry Slade's injury. When everyone's fit, I think he will pick Farrell at 10, Manu Tuilagi at 12 and Slade at 13. It's a tough call on Ford, but that's the most fluid option. Slade offers something a bit more dynamic.\n\nThe way he moves and operates creates holes in midfield \u2014 and you simply can't leave Farrell out of the team. He's the captain and he's shown his quality over the last year or two. Yes, he had an 'off' game on Saturday, but that's because we hold him to such high standards. Sometimes things don't click for you.\n\nGetting a couple of whacks probably didn't help. He wasn't concussed but that can still set you back a little and you can lose your groove.\n\nThe 28-year-old has taken some almighty hits but that is not unusual for key players\n\nHe's being targeted but that's not unusual. Opponents will look at what makes England tick. Who are their key players? Jamie George, Billy Vunipola, Maro Itoje, Ben Youngs and Farrell.\n\nThose guys will all have massive targets on their heads. Teams will be thinking, 'If we shut those guys down, then we can hurt them'.\n\nWe've always known Farrell has a spiky temperament and that can lead to players having a pop at him but, let's not forget, it's also what makes him an incredible competitor.", "description": "TOBY FLOOD: I switched between the 10 and 12 jerseys at two World Cups and there's a big difference between the positions.
