But Illinois hasn\u2019t lived up to its promise, rolling out automatic voter registration far behind schedule and struggling with other changes the law made.\n\nInterest in automatic voter registration has surged since Oregon became the first state to approve it in 2015. Nearly 20 states have approved some form. But the delays in Illinois, and elsewhere, have elections experts and advocates worried, saying it\u2019s meant missed opportunities for voters and less time to work out potential problems ahead of 2020. The challenges could offer a glimpse of what\u2019s in store for other states trying out the increasingly popular voter reform.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of advocates and community members who thought the bill was signed, a switch was flipped. That we won. In fact, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Jay Young of Common Cause Illinois, which backed automatic voter registration. \u201cThis is exceptionally frustrating.\u201d\n\nIllinois gained national attention in 2017 when then-Gov. Bruce Rauner was among the first Republican governors to support automatic voter registration. The law set a July 2018 deadline for the secretary of state\u2019s office to offer automatic voter registration.\n\nThe office was a year late, first offering it in July.\n\nRoadblocks have included old technology and state data that\u2019s not compatible with what\u2019s needed to automatically register to vote: verifying a person is a U.S. citizen, 18, and has a local address.\n\nSecretary of state officials say they were late because the law tied automatic voter registration to Illinois\u2019 implementation of REAL ID, which also lagged behind schedule. The 2005 law tightening rules for identification at airports and federal facilities requires applicants to show documents proving U.S. citizenship, making it ideal for automatic voter registration.\n\n\u201cWe moved as quickly as the programming would allow,\u201d said Dave Druker, a spokesman for Secretary of State Jesse White. He said the stakes are too high to rush and the office wanted to ensure integrity of voter information. The agency did overhaul its opt-in voter registration system last summer under the law.\n\nIllinois residents also can still get driver\u2019s licenses that aren\u2019t tied to REAL ID. Those people aren\u2019t automatically registered to vote, and still must \u201copt in\u201d through a process that\u2019s long been offered and requires proof of age, address and attesting to the fact that one is a U.S. citizen.\n\nCivic interest groups say Illinois still isn\u2019t where it should be and they\u2019re considering legal action. They issued a demand letter in December, with concerns about the rollout and saying the process is cumbersome. They\u2019d hoped to add 1 million new Illinois voters through automatic voter registration over time.\n\nSo far, roughly 25,000 have been automatically registered to vote since July. Overall, roughly 600,000 have been registered since July 2018, through all the changes in the law, including new opt-in processes.\n\nElections experts say having automatic voter registration for elections in 2018 and 2019, as designed, would have offered additional peace of mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helpful to have that come out in a midterm year or odd year where election officials have an opportunity to make fixes without the pressure,\u201d said Barry Burden, a director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s Elections Research Center. \u201cThe presidential (election) puts the most stress on any system than any other contest.\u201d\n\nOther states have also experienced delays. West Virginia passed an automatic voter registration law in 2016, but still doesn\u2019t have agency infrastructure to support it. State officials are eyeing a 2021 implementation. California has had issues and faced a lawsuit with its 2018 program. An audit found technical problems that led to discrepancies in voter registrations sent to the secretary of state.\n\nStill, momentum for automatic voter registration grows. Michigan started offering it this year, and Maine approved it in June.\n\nThe draw is clear. States with automatic voter registration have seen a huge increase in registrations. Oregon, which has been held up as a national model, quickly added about 300,000 voters. Illinois says new registrations are coming in on a regular basis.\n\nWhile there\u2019s little research on whether increased registration boosts turnout, experts say registered voters get more attention from campaigns and their concerns are better heard.\n\n\u201cOnce you get on the rolls, a lot of other things happen,\u201d said Myrna Perez with the Brennan Center for Justice, which supports automatic voter registration.\n\nThe Illinois law also required four additional state agencies \u2014 the departments of Employment Security, Financial and Professional Regulation, Human Services, and Natural Resources \u2014 to register people to vote with an opt-in process by July. For now, the agencies have rolled out partial processes that election officials have to finish or they direct people online to a State Board of Elections website to register. Nearly 250 people have registered because of agency interactions since July, election officials say.\n\nState officials say little planning was done during Rauner\u2019s tenure and they hope to address technological issues soon, perhaps within months. Each agency has different problems, complicating matters. For example, Employment Security is funded mostly with federal money that can\u2019t be used for voter registration; it\u2019s expected to seek state funds.\n\n\u201cWe have to get it right,\u201d said Ann Spillane, general counsel for Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s office. \u201cThat is the missions and the focus right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Illinois' top leaders trumpeted the benefits of automatic voter registration when signing a bipartisan plan in 2017 to change how the state", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/7c74a1_automatic-voter-registration-illinois-14181-in-jan-2019-file-photo-now-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
