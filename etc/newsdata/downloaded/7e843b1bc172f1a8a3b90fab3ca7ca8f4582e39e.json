Maybe with your stable income and option of private health that\u2019s true, but for me, a student reliant on an oversubscribed NHS and understaffed university counselling service, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s six months away.\n\nI\u2019m not angry with the people who share their experiences, but with the system that tells us help is readily available. Many of us know that\u2019s not the reality.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCountless times I\u2019ve booked a doctor\u2019s appointment, waited three weeks, then cancelled within 24 hours when my confidence has drained. Working up the courage to attend the \u201cweekly drop-in\u201d only to leave more helpless than before when facing months of waiting. If only I could pause my depression and come back when it suits the system. Unfortunately, my brain\u2019s yet to get the memo of a few months\u2019 warning before the next serotonin drop.\n\nSharing your struggles is important. Highlighting help is necessary. But let\u2019s not pretend that help\u2019s \u201cjust there\u201d, when \u201cthere\u201d is so far in the distance it\u2019s often unreachable and frequently too late. I\u2019m lucky my university offers counselling, but how is it a privilege to have the option of joining two waiting lists for help? How have we become a society that\u2019s desperate to solve the mental health crisis but unable to provide any real change?\n\nOn the next World Mental Health Day, amongst the bravery, I hope we see more calls for urgent action and change in our mental health services.\n\nMaddie Perrins\n\nWiltshire/London\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It might just then cross their minds to rescind said awards and take steps never to make such disgraceful decisions again in the future.\n\nRobert Boston\n\nKingshill\n\nComing back alive\n\nI can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve agreed with President Trump on any issue, but his move to pull US troops from Syria is the smartest thing he ever did. The day after his policy change, the president explained his decision in a tweet: \u201cUSA should never have been in Middle East. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d\n\nThat is what I call saving American lives. After all, \u201csupport our troops\u201d means getting them out of harm\u2019s way, and bringing them back home alive and not in body bags. For that, I just wanted to give President Trump a big shout-out.\n\nMahmoud El-Yousseph\n\nWesterville, Ohio\n\nA class act\n\nThe four horsemen of the apocalypse in any marriage are criticism, defensiveness, contempt and stonewalling. Boris Johnson is guilty of all four. During the last ten years (with the help of some influential media outlets) he continually criticised the EU; showed contempt for the EU; was defensive about how great the UK is (and always would be); and, more recently, he stonewalled his own electorate plus 27 electorates of the EU, by closing down and proroguing parliament. Like a sulky child he left the room and slammed the door (having first consulted his Ladybird Book of Negotiations by Dominic Cummings). No wonder the relationship was doomed.\n\nBut now, happy days \u2013 a communicator who neither criticises nor shows contempt for the UK, who has been neither defensive about Ireland (and the EU) nor stonewalled his political counterparts, has given Mr Johnson a masterclass in communication and negotiation at the top level. You\u2019re in the room with the grown-ups now.\n\nIn all the mood music coming out of the meeting on the Wirral, Leo Varadkar has outclassed Boris Johnson \u2013 although, in truth, that can\u2019t have been that hard to do.\n\nAlison Hackett\n\nDun Laoghaire, Ireland\n\nNatural selection\n\nThere is a brilliant and simple code of conduct for MP\u2019s to follow; it\u2019s called \u201cmitigation of cruelty\u201d. Mitigation of cruelty is the sensible and authentic principle of morality derived from the reality of life known as \u201cevolution by natural selection\u201d. In society it would act as a natural brake on the cruelty of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d and an organism\u2019s predilection for the trait of territorialism.\n\nMitigation of cruelty would certainly put that organism called Boris Johnson in a spin and also be of great comfort to immigrants. Brexit would be finally over and done with.\n\nDavid Parsons\n\nPortsmouth", "description": "Yesterday was World Mental Health Day, and while my social media feeds were clogged with heartfelt posts detailing\u00a0people\u2019s tricky experiences, one message really\u00a0irked me: \u201chelp is out there\u201d.
