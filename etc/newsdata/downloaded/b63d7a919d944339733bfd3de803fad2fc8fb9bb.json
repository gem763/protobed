For a Pittsburgh team that finished outside the playoffs at 9-6-1 last season, the two made for convenient scapegoats.\n\nBut moving on from two All-Pro talents in the prime of their careers \u2014 all in the name of improving team chemistry and the locker room \u2014 was going to fly with fans in the long haul only if the Steelers, you know, actually got back to winning big in 2019.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin says there shouldn't be a big dropoff in offensive production between QB Ben Roethlisberger (7) and Mason Rudolph. (USA Today Sports)\n\nAnd while it\u2019s too early to count Pittsburgh out after two weeks, the fact the Steelers sit at a surprising 0-2 following a 28-26 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday means there are already fewer places for the key figures who remain \u2014 namely general manager Kevin Colbert, coach Mike Tomlin and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger \u2014 to hide.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nOne person who seems to understand this is Tomlin, who refused to use the spate of injuries the Steelers suffered Sunday \u2014 including one that sidelined Roethlisberger at halftime \u2014 as an excuse for the loss.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe lost a number of guys in this game, but that wasn\u2019t the reason why we didn\u2019t win this game \u2014 we were fully capable with the guys that were on the field,\u201d Tomlin explained afterward. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make enough plays, to be quite honest with you. We didn\u2019t play clean enough, particularly in some moments. We\u2019ve got to get better. We accept responsibility for it, we\u2019re not looking to make excuses. There\u2019s certain things that we did in that game you cannot do.\u201d\n\nLike look disjointed and start slow offensively just one week after the New England Patriots throttled them, 33-3, in front of a national television audience. It\u2019s disturbing how much Pittsburgh has struggled to weaponize its passing game without the prolific Brown, who scored a touchdown for New England on Sunday.\n\nYes, the Steelers led the Seahawks 10-7 at the break, but their one touchdown was set up by a fumble return \u2014 they had to drive only 22 yards \u2014 and they totaled only 103 yards and went 1-for-6 on third downs in the half.\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve by leaps and bounds in the second half for Pittsburgh, which was forced to finish without star running back James Conner \u2014 who suffered a knee injury \u2014 and Roethlisberger, who was knocked out of the game after injuring his right elbow on the final possession of the second quarter.\n\nInterestingly enough, Roethlisberger\u2019s replacement \u2014 Mason Rudolph, a 2018 third-rounder \u2014 dealt with some of the same issues as Roethlisberger, as he threw his first career interception because it caromed off receiver Donte Moncrief\u2019s hands (his fifth drop in two games, which led to his subsequent benching).\n\nWhile the Steelers finished with only 261 yards \u2014 compared to 425 for Seattle, who iced the game by converting third down after third down \u2014 it says plenty about the Steelers\u2019 current state that Rudolph\u2019s play was actually a reason for optimism going forward, even if Roethlisberger has to miss significant time.\n\nRudolph, a 6-foot-5, 235-pounder, looked functional in his first regular-season NFL game, completing 12 of 19 passes for 112 yards, two touchdowns and the aforementioned interception that wasn\u2019t his fault.\n\nHe had one truly ugly play \u2014 a pick thrown right to a defender over the middle on a two-point conversion \u2014 but he still had fewer than some veterans who played Sunday and should have known better (cough, cough, Ryan Fitzpatrick).\n\n\u201cMason\u2019s capable, man, he\u2019s been a part of this thing,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re capable of functioning in a very normal manner when he\u2019s in there, and we did.\u201d\n\nStill, the Steelers must improve fast \u2014 both offensively and defensively \u2014 if they want to make the playoffs, since the odds are against them statistically. Since 1990, only 12 percent of teams that started 0-2 reached the playoffs.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the last time the Steelers started 0-2 \u2014 2013 \u2014 they finished 8-8, the worst record of Tomlin\u2019s 13-year tenure and one they might be staring at again in four months if they don\u2019t:\n\na.) heal up quickly\n\nb.) start catching the ball with regularity\n\nc.) shore up the defense\n\nOtherwise, the next major narrative awaiting the Steelers will be scapegoats for yet another disappointing season in Pittsburgh, only this time, the names Bell and Brown will no longer apply.\n\n\u201cWe understand the position we\u2019re in, we understand the negativity that comes with it,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cWe better absorb it, we better get singularly focused and get better for our next opportunity. Control the things that we can control, that\u2019s what we intend to do.\n\n\u201cBut today it\u2019s painful, as it should be.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Steelers must improve fast if they want to make the playoffs, since the odds are against them.
