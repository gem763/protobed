In 2016, he reportedly came close to being named Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, before she chose Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\nNow Stavridis has written a book on leadership, \u201cSailing True North: Ten Admirals and the Voyage of Character.\u201d In a visit to Yahoo Finance on Thursday to discuss the devolving political situation in Turkey and Syria, Stavridis assessed the overall leadership of President Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a chaos machine,\u201d Stavridis says. \u201cI look at close friends of mine like H.R. McMaster, who was the national security adviser, Jim Mattis, John Kelly, who for a time was the chief of staff\u2014all of them have seen their reputations diminished. All of them tried hard to serve as a kind of guardrail set around an extremely, shall we say, exuberant president. President Trump is utterly decisive, the problem is he makes a decision but then he often reverses course. Very very difficult to be in that environment. When I worked for President Obama, I found the opposite\u2014he\u2019s so deliberate and takes such a long time to make a decision, because he wants to measure everything. There\u2019s probably a balance in there that would be appropriate for making those kinds of decisions.\u201d\n\nStavridis also offered commentary on Trump\u2019s frequent use of Twitter.\n\n\u201cThere are times when a good, sharp tweet can move a situation\u2014think of it as a shot of espresso in the morning,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is if you did 42 shots of espresso before lunch.\u201d\n\nAdm.

Stavridis, US Navy, commander, U.S. European Command/Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) More\n\nInterestingly, Stavridis\u2019s assessment of Trump\u2019s decision-making matches almost verbatim the comments that former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter made to Yahoo Finance earlier this week.\n\nBoth military veterans say it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to advise Trump on military strategy.\n\nCarter said that when he served under President Obama, \u201cWhen I and the chairman left the sit room, I never left without clarity. We knew what the president decided we had to do. I would find today\u2019s environment very difficult because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s hard to be consistent and excellent in implementation. It\u2019s one thing if the president doesn\u2019t take your advice. But if you don\u2019t even know what he wants, that\u2019s a whole other problem.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
