The task of reimagining a station with over 180 years of changing requirements would seem both freeing and frightening. In addition, keeping the station open for the 50 million passengers a year who use it while the five-year transformation took place is a tremendous achievement.\n\n\n\nThe build was a complex one; however, Grimshaw are no strangers to large infrastructure projects and have taken a simple concept and kept it coherent.\n\nDark, confined passenger spaces have been transformed into voluminous light-filled spaces\n\nMoving south to north, and using a phased plan of staged modular construction by using prefabricated concrete blocks and steel and aluminium cassettes for the canopies, the team have managed to increase the capacity for passengers with two-thirds more available space than before.\n\nThe creation of the largest concourse in the UK, described by judges as \"truly impressive\", offers a triple-height atrium and public square which it is hoped will draw more general use from the public with retail and caf\u00e9 options. The judges also highlighted that \"dark, confined passenger spaces have been transformed into voluminous light-filled spaces that are a joy to use\".\n\nThe second aim of the redevelopment of the station was to simplify one of the most complicated track layouts in the country. With a combination of extending the platforms, updating tracks and producing dedicated lines for each service provider, the result is an increase in available trains and capacity for the future. The station footprint is now longer than the nearby Shard is tall.\n\nThe judges added: \"The station\u2019s transformation acts as a catalyst for the redevelopment of the surrounding area and sets the standard very high for future station redevelopment.\"", "description": "Six exceptional buildings chosen by RIBA for the Stirling Prize Shortlist", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07h2nd0.jpg"}
