Carlson also says that Twitter is making people rich while dividing America. Seriously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a company that\u2019s hurt this country more than Twitter,\u201d Carlson said with a straight face on his show last night. \u201cMaybe there are some. I can\u2019t think of one. If you look at the hate and the division and the cruelty that\u2019s now common, it wasn\u2019t common 10 years ago. Twitter\u2019s a huge part of that.\u201d\n\nFox News' Answer To School Shootings Is This Giant Water Cannon There's been a boom in the bad ideas market, as experts look for idiotic ideas to address school shootings since stricter gun control is apparently off the table. Luckily, the folks at Fox News have a new idea for responding to active shooter situations: blast holes through the walls of schools with water cannons to evacuate children.

A judge recently ruled that Nunes, who\u2019s from California, could sue in the state of Virginia, a state where he\u2019s more likely to win a defamation case.\n\nCarlson\u2019s show \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d has hemorrhaged advertisers over the past year in the wake of several racist and sexist things that the TV host has said. In December of 2018, Carlson said that allowing certain immigrants into the U.S. \u201cmakes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided,\u201d causing advertisers like IHOP, Ancestry.com, and Nerd Wallet to drop their sponsorships.\n\nThe show lost even more advertisers in March after a radio interview from 2006 was unearthed that featured Carlson defending statutory rape, calling a woman \u201ccunty,\u201d and saying that woman in general were \u201cextremely primitive.\u201d Carlson refused to apologise for the comments.\n\nBut those controversies may as well have been a decade ago, given the pace of our current news cycle and the way that things are deteriorating. And Carlson is still on the air, spreading hatred on a nightly basis as the country reels from one constitutional crisis after another.\n\nOn the other hand, Carlson may have a point. Donald Trump\u2019s presidency would\u2019ve been highly unlikely without the help of platforms like Twitter. But at the end of the day, Fox News got Trump elected. And Fox News is the reason that the Trump regime isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson says Twitter has harmed America by spreading hatred and division in the U.S., something that he insists wasn\u2019t common 10 years ago.
