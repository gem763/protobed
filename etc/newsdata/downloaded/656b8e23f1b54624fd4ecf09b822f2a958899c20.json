It is the third time that Britain has asked the EU to delay the deadline for Brexit.\n\n\n\nJohnson, however, did not personally sign the letter, according to media reports. Earlier on Saturday, Johnson said he would refuse to ask the EU for a delay to the current deadline after suffering a narrow defeat in Parliament.\n\n\n\nThough Johnson personally opposes an extension, the British government was forced to ask for one after U.K. lawmakers delayed approval of Johnson's withdrawal agreement and voted to activate a law that required Downing Street to ask Brussels to push back the deadline for Brexit.\n\nThat amendment triggering the law, known as the \"Benn Act,\" was backed by 322 votes to 306.\n\nSpeaking after the setback, Johnson said he would \"not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.\" However by law, according to the Benn Act, Johnson had until 11:00 p.m. London time Saturday to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson, however, did not personally sign the letter requesting an extension, according to media reports.", "authors": ["Spencer Kimball Matt Clinch", "Spencer Kimball", "Matt Clinch"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106191344-1571522657586rts2rt4q.jpg?v=1571522746", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
