There was that monster sell-off in the stock market, except it wasn\u2019t a monster sell-off for Blue Chips stocks or the S&P 500. The impeachment noise added another layer of frustration to the market. I don\u2019t think any professional money manager (not to be confused with traders) took any evasive action yesterday and sold everything.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: -0.53%\n\nS&P 500: -0.84%\n\nNASDAQ Composite: -1.46%\n\nRussell 2000: -1.58%\n\nSemiconductor Index: -1.48%\n\nThat said, the tech wreck is pressuring the NASDAQ Composite. The market breadth was ugly, but milestones underscored just how much pressure is building in the NASDAQ.\n\nNYSE\n\nNew Highs: 112\n\nNew Lows: 28\n\nNASDAQ\n\nNew Highs: 62\n\nNew Lows: 102\n\nIPO Debacle Worsens\n\nThere are problems in momentum names revealed by the current sell-off in them and those (formerly) hot initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nMeanwhile, as names like Netflix (NFLX) continue to struggle, recently debuted names are getting slammed. There is news of major changes in the role of WeWork. The founder, Adam Neumann, is giving up the role of CEO, and perhaps lowering his super voting stock from a ratio of 20 to 1 for regular shareholders (otherwise known as suckers) to maybe 3 to 1. It reinforces the notion that most of these stocks are overvalued, led by megalomaniacs and may never be profitable.\n\nLots of carnage IPO, including:\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND): -3.53%\n\nLyft (LYFT): -7.57%\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD): -6.56%\n\nPinterest (PINS): -5.04%\n\nSlack Tech (WORK): -3.97%\n\nThe great news is all the Silicon Valley insiders made billions, and none of these CEOs can be accused of leaving money on the table because the stock rallied. Congratulations.\n\nThere\u2019s money to be made with all those names being hammered together, but it\u2019s tough to step in now that the dam has broken.\n\nBack to Market News:\n\nAfter the close, the following companies released financial results:\n\nNike (NKE)\n\nRevenue: $10.70 billion, consensus: $10.42 billion\n\nEarnings: $0.86, consensus: $0.70\n\nGross Margin (GM): 45.7 from 44.2\n\nEffective Tax Rate: 12.4% from 14.0%\n\nGeographic Performance Revenue Change North America $4,293,000,000 +4% Europe, Middle East & Africa $2,773,000,000 +12% Asia Pacific $1,345,000,000 +13% Greater China $1,679,000,000 +27%\n\nStrong sales around the world, particularly China, point to global brand power that powered the shares to an all-time high after the close.\n\nCintas (CTAS)\n\nIt posted revenues and earnings that beat the Street while hiking full-year guidance on top and bottom lines. I\u2019m frustrated we closed this out, although we didn\u2019t panic when the shares sold off after posting results earlier in the year. I love this stock as a proxy for America\u2019s blue-collar economy.\n\nCintas leads the industry in supplying corporate identity uniform programs, providing entrance and logo mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid, safety, fire protection products and services, and industrial carpet and tile cleaning. We operate more than 400 facilities in North America\u2014including six manufacturing plants and eight distribution centers.\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nWe sent an alert to take profits on a Technology position and still are overweight on the sector, despite the pressure in key names. On that note, I loved the action in Boeing (BA) yesterday. While there have been false breakouts, the way shares snap back after swoons underscores a huge demand for the stock. It will materialize once the 737 saga is resolved, but probably even before then.\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 2 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 2\n\nWaiting in the Transcript\n\nEveryone is waiting for President Trump to release the unredacted and now unclassified transcript of his July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President.\n\nIt\u2019s high drama stuff, which will be interpreted by the listener. The fact that it\u2019s being released suggests President Trump\u2019s lawyers think it won\u2019t be incriminating, even as initial steps for impeachment officially began yesterday evening.", "description": "I know there was breathless reporting on the market yesterday. .09/25/2019 19:24:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/ce732fbd-0cda-4321-9995-e0f3c3f68816.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
