The West Midlands region, which includes towns such Wolverhampton, Coventry and Dudley, is also enjoying the boom, with a record 131.4 million tourists last year.\n\nPeaky Blinders has developed a global following as a deal with Netflix means the show is available in 183 countries, and the numbers of international visitors to Birmingham has surged in the five years since the series launched.\n\nInternational visitor numbers rose by 19% to 1.1 million between 2013 and 2018, with the number coming from the US \u2013 where Peaky Blinders has been a big hit \u2013 rising by 50%. It is estimated that overseas visitors spent about \u00a317m last year on screen tourism-related trips, according to the WMGC.\n\nPeaky Blinders 'inspires popularity of Arthur and Ada as baby names' Read more\n\n\u201cPeaky Blinders\u2019s fantastic success has introduced Birmingham and the West Midlands to a new global audience,\u201d says Street.\n\nThe Black Country Living Museum in Dudley \u2013 a staple filming location in all five series of Peaky Blinders to date \u2013 sells out themed evenings in less than 24 hours. The show has acted as a free advertising campaign, at home and abroad, fuelling a record 355,000 visits last year, up almost a third since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just seen out the fifth successive year of growth, achieving record visitor attendance,\u201d says Andrew Lovett, chief executive at the museum. \u201cAs one of the film locations for Peaky Blinders, the popularity of the series has undoubtedly attracted new audiences.\u201d\n\nDown the road in Stourbridge, Sadler\u2019s Ales launched its own Peaky Blinders beer off the back of the show a few years ago. \u201cIt is based on the history of Birmingham and the original gangs,\u201d says Chris Dew, marketing manager at Sadler\u2019s. \u201cBut when the TV show is on, we naturally see a spike in sales.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Black Country Living Museum in Dudley has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the screen touring boom.

Digbeth is also home to Peaky Tours, a guided walk operator, and the Custard Factory, an arts venue that was once home to Bird\u2019s Custard, which recently unveiled a 60ft mural of Cillian Murphy\u2019s character, Tommy Shelby.\n\nNearby, in a 1920s period building in Birmingham\u2019s jewellery quarter, Escape Live has officially licensed the right to create the first two Peaky Blinders escape rooms \u2013 called The Raid and Double Cross \u2013 and are due to open to tourists imminently.\n\nThe appetite for Peaky Blinders shows no sign of slowing. In July, more than 76,000 people applied for tickets to the first exclusive screening of the season five premiere in Birmingham town hall. The season four premiere at the same venue in 2017 attracted 40,000 applicants.\n\nWhile Peaky Blinders may have firmly put Birmingham on the global tourism map, the West Midlands is proving to be an increasingly popular location for film and TV companies.\n\nSteven Spielberg used the region for parts of Hollywood sci-fi film Ready Player One, including filming in the jewellery quarter. Matthew Vaughn\u2019s Kingsman: The Golden Circle and the film American Assassin also shot in the West Midlands.\n\nEarlier this year, Steven Knight unveiled an ambitious \u00a3100m plan for a 40-acre film and TV studio in the West Midlands.\n\n\u201cPeaky Blinders has had such a positive effect on the local economy, but the full cultural impact is immeasurable,\u201d said Joe Godwin, director of BBC Midlands. \u201cPeaky Blinders has been a game-changer for Birmingham.\u201d", "description": "Record number of visitors at UK\u2019s second largest city and West Midlands boosts local industry", "authors": ["Mark Sweney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60bd526d44a4a08e96ea84a29047420589095a5e/0_126_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c39e274e9d3f4df29a12ea482ab70a3"}
