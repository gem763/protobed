REUTERS/Remo Casilli\n\nThe crowd waving League and Italian flags filled Piazza San Giovanni, traditionally a venue for leftist and trade union rallies, as Salvini and his allies spoke from a stage against a huge backdrop reading \u201cItalian Pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the Italy that works and suffers, that dreams and hopes,\u201d said Salvini, who was deputy prime minister and interior minister in the previous coalition of the League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.\n\nThat government collapsed in August when Salvini, encouraged by surging poll ratings, pulled out in a failed bid to trigger elections he hoped would crown him as prime minister.\n\nInstead, 5-Star formed a new coalition with the center-left Democratic Party (PD), pushing the League into opposition.\n\n\u201cWe are the people against the elite, we will change the history of this country,\u201d said Salvini, adding that 200,000 people had turned out at the rally. The police estimated a figure closer to 50,000.\n\nOpinions polls show the League has lost some support since Salvini brought down the previous government, but it remains easily Italy\u2019s most popular party, with around 30% of the vote.\n\nHowever, the combined backing of the PD, 5-Star and other allied leftist and centrist groups is roughly the same as the support for the rightist parties gathered at Saturday\u2019s rally.\n\nSalvini was preceded on the stage by 83-year-old former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose conservative Forza Italia party has steadily lost support in recent years, and Giorgia Meloni, who heads the far-right Brothers of Italy party.\n\nSalvini has eclipsed Berlusconi as leader of the right but still needs his support if he is to make a renewed bid for power, leading to an ambiguous and often tense relationship.\n\nThe League chief often says his national alliance with Berlusconi is over, only to revive it again when needed. Meanwhile, the three rightist parties always join forces at local elections for mayors and regional governors.\n\n\u201cThank you Silvio for the battles you have fought and the battles we will fight,\u201d Salvini said, promising the center-right would remain united to \u201cwin together.\u201d\n\nBerlusconi, calling the new government \u201cthe most leftist in our history,\u201d said he entered politics 25 years ago to save Italy from \u201ccommunists\u201d, and now the threat was even greater.\n\nThe billionaire media tycoon, who was convicted of tax fraud in 2013, said he was particularly worried by the new coalition\u2019s pledge to ensure prison sentences for large-scale tax dodgers.", "description": "Tens of thousands of supporters of Italy's right-wing opposition parties, spearheaded by Matteo Salvini's League which was ousted from power two months ago, gathered in central Rome on Saturday to protest against the new government.", "authors": ["Gavin Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442721073&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0GQ", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
