Milky Green Glass) Things You Can Find on Amazon", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: courtesy of the retailers\n\nFollowing its resurgence in the late \u201990s, the opaque milky jadeite glass that was popular in the \u201940s and \u201950s for kitchenware and food storage has seen something of a revival in the past few years. Chef Vivian Howard of North Carolina\u2019s Chef & the Farmer tipped us off to her obsession with jadeite everything, and ever since it feels like we keep seeing it everywhere. It\u2019s also relatively inexpensive to produce, which is why modern jadeite from companies like Ohio\u2019s Mosser Glass can sell the stuff at very reasonable prices.\n\nIf you\u2019re not so keen on brighter colors in your home, jadeite is a more subdued way to add character to a countertop or cupboard. It\u2019s known for its resistance to stains, which made it an ideal food-storage container before Tupperware existed. Do note that you should avoid putting jadeite in the dishwasher or microwave, though, as temperatures can get too hot for the stuff. If you\u2019re not so lucky to get your hands on an original Fire-King collectible, we found some new jadeite pieces on Amazon that would make a good alternative: from a pretty ballerina soap soap dish to a charming spoon rest to a milky mortar and pestle.\n\nButter Dish\n\nMortar and Pestle\n\nRosso Glass Mortar and Pestle There\u2019s something very pleasing about seeing a mortar and pestle in this shade of pastel green. $31 at Amazon Buy $31 at Amazon Buy\n\nPitcher\n\nBowl\n\nMixing Bowl Set\n\nTrinket Dish\n\nRosso Glass Jadeite Ballerina Soap Dish For displaying a miniature soap or storing your rings and earrings. $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nRabbit Dish\n\nMosser Glass Basket Dish Something you can break out for Easter lunch or keep year-round as a candy dish. $31 at Amazon Buy $31 at Amazon Buy\n\nSalt and Pepper Shakers\n\nCake Stand\n\nRing Holder\n\nGeneric Jadeite Mannequin Jewelry Ring Display Hand This hand is technically meant for displaying rings, but we think it would look great \u201cnaked\u201d on a mantel or a bookshelf. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nVase\n\nCanister Set\n\nHC Elegant Home Canister Set Just a touch of jadeite for those not ready to commit to anything too crazy. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
