(REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo)\n\nMiami\u2019s Super Bowl just got a whole lot more fun. Jennifer Lopez and Shakira announced on Thursday that they will headline the halftime show during Super Bowl LIV.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBoth Lopez and Shakira teased the announcement with tweets specifying the date they\u2019d be performing, but not the event.\n\nSince February 2, 2020 has already been announced as the date for the upcoming Super Bowl, it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out what event they\u2019d be headlining.\n\nBoth Lopez and Shakira released statements about their upcoming halftime show performances, via ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEver since I saw Diana Ross fly off into the sky at the Halftime Show, I dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl,\u201d said Lopez. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s made even more special not only because it\u2019s the NFL\u2019s 100th anniversary, but also because I\u2019m performing with a fellow Latina. I can\u2019t wait to show what us girls can do on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so honored to be taking on one of the world\u2019s biggest stages in the company of a fellow female artist to represent Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and all over the world \u2014 and to top it off, on my birthday!\u201d said Shakira. \u201cThis is a true American Dream and we are going to bring the show of a lifetime!\u201d\n\nIt had been rumored that Lopez would be performing at the Super Bowl. The multi-talented actor, singer, and dancer is in the middle of a career renaissance, and has garnered Oscar buzz for her star turn in the well-reviewed stripper revenge movie \u201cHustlers,\u201d which also features Lizzo and Cardi B.\n\nIf the halftime show organizers are looking for more performers to share the stage with Lopez and Shakira, organizing a musical \u201cHustlers\u201d reunion with Lizzo and Cardi B. would certainly solve that problem \u2014 and make many, many people happy in the process.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "JLo and Shakira will shake up the Super Bowl LIV halftime show.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jk7YonrRUlj8jXj7Tezv5Q--~B/aD05Njg7dz0xNDM3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/35527270-e097-11e9-b6fd-9c360d9d6b0a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
