Barr met with lawmakers and floated an idea to expand background checks to all commercial firearm sales, including gun shows.\n\nSenators were left needing more details about how that proposal would work but said it was a good starting-off point.\n\nTheir biggest question, however, was: Where did the president stand on the idea?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important piece \u2014 if the president doesn\u2019t support it, there\u2019s no point. It\u2019s not going to become law,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, said.\n\nMr. McCarthy told The Washington Times he was reserving his decision on whether or not to support the idea until after he saw the proposal himself.\n\nMeanwhile, at a press conference on Wednesday, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and several other House Republicans pushed back on the growing calls for gun background checks. They said Democrats were rushing to push through ineffective solutions.\n\nWhen asked about the appetite among House Republicans for background checks in general, Mr. McCarthy focused on other solutions, such as the bump stock ban and their work to shore up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\n\u201cThe appetite in the Republican conference is to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he told The Times.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are holding out for universal background checks, which would apply to private sales.\n\nWhen asked if Democrats could back something like Mr. Barr\u2019s idea, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pointed out that the White House made it clear that Mr. Trump hadn\u2019t signed off on it yet.\n\nShe noted that one of the summer\u2019s deadly shootings occurred because of a \u201cstraw purchase\u201d \u2014 when someone buys a gun for someone who can\u2019t pass the background check \u2014 which doesn\u2019t appear be addressed by the proposal.\n\nMrs. Pelosi also slammed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for letting the president take the lead on the issue.\n\n\u201cThat is to abdicate your role as a leader,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
