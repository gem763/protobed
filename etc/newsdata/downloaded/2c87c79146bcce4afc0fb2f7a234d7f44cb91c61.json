A corset is a form of underwear, it\u2019s hot, for who though?\u201d the rapper told Kim, 38.\n\nHowever, Kanye\u2019s criticisms did not go over well with his wife.\n\n\u201cSo the night before the Met you\u2019re going to come in here and say that you\u2019re not into a corset vibe?\u201d Kim responded. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me really bad anxiety. You knew last night I had really bad anxiety and I don\u2019t need any more negative energy and for you say you\u2019re now not into me wearing a tight dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,\u201d Kanye fired back. However, Kim did not back down.\n\nKanye and Kim | Theo Wargo/WireImage More\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian\u2019s Met Gala Dress Was So Tight, She Considered Peeing Her Pants in \u2018an Emergency\u2019\n\n\u201cYou built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this, and just because you\u2019re on a journey and transformation doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in the same spot with you,\u201d Kim told him.\n\n\u201cOkay, alright. Okay, alright cool,\u201d a visibly annoyed Kanye said before walking out of the room, as his wife said to her friends, including Jonathan Cheban, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nDespite the couple\u2019s argument, things seemingly blew over when Kim stepped out with Kanye for the fashion gala\u2019s red carpet in her custom dress that she said was inspired by her daughter North.\n\n\u201cMy dress is dripping wet and it\u2019s like I\u2019m coming out of the ocean because North always says she\u2019s an alien and I\u2019m a mermaid,\u201d she explained.\n\nAs seen in Sunday\u2019s episode, Kim had been anxious heading into the 2019 Met Gala, particularly due to the arrival of her fourth child, which was scheduled to occur in the same week.\n\n\u201cThis time right now is so crazy hectic for me,\u201d she said. \u201cStudying law and the baby coming soon and I have the Met Ball this week. It\u2019s all really overwhelming, I wish I had more time.\u201c", "description": "KUWTK: Kanye West Disapproved of Kim Kardashian's Met Gala Look", "authors": ["Eric Todisco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zSwo7gEN5czJs9bzyt4Qgw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/54f9c1e6b3969f0f60fe218511d3935c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
