I think we are playing with fire in many ways.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If we take this to the very limit in a situation where one side or the other is vanquished entirely, I think there is a real danger that we break the social contract inner country and I think we all have a responsibility to find ways to reunite the country in a common endeavour.\u201d\n\nThe Lib Dems\u2019 new policy will see the party seek a Final Say referendum on whether the UK should accept any Brexit outcome. But if an election comes before any referendum \u2013 as now seems likely \u2013 they will campaign on a platform of withdrawing the UK\u2019s Article 50 letter if they win power.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We believe a referendum is the best way to get clarity, to get resolution of this current gridlock and Brexit impasse.\n\n\u201cBut it does look like it may be that a general election will be upon us an in that general election \u2013 that democratic process \u2013 the Liberal Democrats will campaign to stop Brexit.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson did not rule out campaigning to take the UK back into the EU if Brexit goes ahead, telling Today: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the hypothetical because I am absolutely focused and determined on stopping Brexit. That fight has not been lost.\n\n\u201cIt is September, we are still members of the European Union. It is a membership that brings huge benefits for our economy, for the way in which we have improved workers\u2019 rights, environmental protections, the way in which we engage around the world. I\u2019m not going to throw that away. I\u2019m not going to accept defeat on that. We are going to fight to stay in the EU.\u201d", "description": "A split has emerged at the top of the Liberal Democrats over Brexit, as senior MP Sir Norman Lamb warned that the new policy of cancelling EU withdrawal was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d.
