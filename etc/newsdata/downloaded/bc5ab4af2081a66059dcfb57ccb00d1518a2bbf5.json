Local news outlets on Wednesday reported that convoys carrying Turkish special forces, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery along with scores of trucks transporting an estimated 2,000 Free Syrian Army fighters were arriving near the Syrian border south of the city of Sanliurfa as they awaited for US troops to depart as part of a deal negotiated with President Donald Trump earlier this week.\n\nMr Erdogan has long demanded the creation of a Turkish-influenced \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria\u2019s northeast as a space to alleviate the pressure more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey and as a means to destroy Rojava, the budding proto-state there run by an affilate of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a separatist group that Ankara has been fighting for decades.\n\nBut the president\u2019s Syria policies have also begun to badly hurt him and his allies politically, as economic troubles exacerbate long-simmering Turkish animosity towards Arabic-speaking Syrians. Aided by local allies, Turkey has already created several relatively successful and mostly stable zones of influence in Syria\u2019s north and northwest.\n\nTurkey\u2019s broadcast news outlets, mostly loyal to the government, reported jingoistically about the military intervention.\n\n\u201cHands on the trigger at the Syrian border,\u201d declared the A Haber news channel.\n\nIn parliament, the AKP, CHP, and two other nationalist opposition parties backed a general motion Tuesday to authorise Turkey\u2019s armed forces to engage in cross-border operations in Syria while the Kurdish-led People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP) opposed it. Opposition figures voiced support for troops taking part in what is being dubbed, Operation \u201cPeace Spring,\u201d or \u201cStream of Peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur prayers are for our heroic soldiers to return home safe and sound, after successful completion of Operation Stream of Peace. May God protect and lead our boys to glory,\u201d CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu announced on Twitter.\n\nBut rather than unite Turks behind the flag and the armed forces, the operation has prompted numerous voices of dissent, a potential consequence of the increased political openness since ruling party losses in municipal elections earlier this year. On social media the hashtag #SavasaHayir, or \u201cno to war\u201d was trending in Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe war is Erdogan\u2019s attempt to divide the opposition front using the flag of nationalism,\u201d exiled journalist Can Dundar wrote on Twitter. \u201cIf the opposition falls into this trap by saying this is a \u2018national issue,\u2019 it will shoot itself in the foot and throw the country into the fire. That is why we must say no to war.\u201d", "description": "Turkey\u2019s intervention in northern Syria inspired domestic support for the country\u2019s armed forces, but also scepticism, fear and anger in a politically divided country that perceives it has already suffered greatly because of the continuing eight-year conflict to its southeast.Turkey\u2019s armed forces launched", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Sd_Vsh_NZkdr5gOt24rHbg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/062897168c38002372e8e46226cc81ee", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
