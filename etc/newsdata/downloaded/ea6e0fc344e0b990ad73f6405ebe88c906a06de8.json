That vote will have to wait a little longer, it seems.\n\nBREAKING: Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Trump https://t.co/52N7JTzvAC \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) October 15, 2019\n\nCONFIRMED: Pelosi informs caucus there will NOT be a formal floor vote to launch the impeachment inquiry \u2014 Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) October 15, 2019\n\nMultiple Dem sources say it\u2019s \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that Pelosi will announce an impeachment inquiry vote tonight. Several cmte chairs aren\u2019t in agreement with holding that vote, per sources. \u2014 John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) October 15, 2019\n\nFox is told Pelosi plans no vote right now to formally launch impeachment probe at this time. She has been discussing this with House Democrats \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) October 15, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s a hoax. \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Bonnie O (@bloc52) October 15, 2019\n\nBecause its literally a hoax \u2014 Ashley (@pinkskipper21) October 15, 2019\n\nIt will take the democrats at least a decade to recover this slow motion trainwreck \u2014 CP (@c_peters) October 15, 2019\n\nThus allowing Schiff's secretive, in the basement, inquisition to continue, prohibiting Republican members from participating on an equal footing. @GOPLeader should strongly oppose this move and demand she brings it to the floor for a vote. Enough is enough. \u2014 Deb Ramey (@ramey_deb) October 15, 2019\n\nBut what about that \u201cbombshell\u201d testimony Chad? \u2014 CornyPop (@Kurt54712255) October 15, 2019\n\nThought there was a \"BOMBSHELL\" by Dep Sec State Kent which you reported on in an earlier tweet. Looks like the Pelosi/Ds discussion was a non discussion. Keep the status quo bc the \"Bombshell\" didn't favor their narrative. \u2014 Larry Nigro Jr (@LarryNJr1) October 15, 2019\n\nWhat's so funny (actually sad) is that the average Democrat thinks all of this is formal & for real. \u2014 Jennifer Harris (@livinbythelake) October 15, 2019\n\nSupport Pelosi or not, easy to see why she\u2019s pushing against Impeachment. \u2014 AstrO (@Mi_Astronauta) October 15, 2019\n\nShe doesn't want to put Red State Trump district Democrats on the record of impeachment \u2014 Hunter Mayberry (@ProfesserBird) October 15, 2019\n\nThey want re-elected. \u2014 Lady Gator (@ladygator2007) October 15, 2019\n\nFirst Schiff walks back about not being clear on his words and Nancy being all nervous\u2026 Must be something big in the IG report \u2014 Cajun Princess (@janyo1962) October 15, 2019\n\nMethinks they mistimed their effort, now they just look stupid with all the investigations coming out. \u2014 E J Rankin(Mr Homan my latest hero) (@EJRankin1) October 15, 2019\n\nShe ain't got the votes and they have nothing real \u2014 Bad Boy (@diddykilled2pac) October 15, 2019\n\nDoesn't have the votes. What a loser. \u2014 Tony Semeraro (@Redeemed54) October 15, 2019\n\nBasically they have no factual evidence against Trump. What a waste of time. \u2014 Average American (@SwampDog4614) October 15, 2019\n\nJust another democratic hoax. \u2014 Kathleen Pelletier (@kjkpelletier) October 15, 2019\n\nLol\u2026.she counted votes and called it off. No freaking vote\u2026..it would be devastating for the dems. \u2014 Lou (@Oracle_Louie) October 15, 2019\n\nIf Democrats had the impeachment vote they would hold the impeachment vote. Hoax. \u2014 John Ocasio-Nolte (@NolteNC) October 15, 2019\n\nHer new plan is to drag this into the 2020 election. \u2014 Pigpaw1 (@Pigpaw12) October 15, 2019\n\nWe suspect it was always her plan to skip impeachment and focus solely on the 2020 elections, but her caucus just wouldn\u2019t have it anymore.\n\nRelated:", "description": "Nancy Pelosi's big announcement didn't turn out to be that big after all.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-17-at-5.29.24-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
