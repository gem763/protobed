So I\u2019ve just decided not to feed into that anymore.\u201d\n\nAs for her family, who she previously accused of extorting her with an alleged sex tape, Lindsie says she wishes them all well.\n\n\u201cI wish everybody the best. And I think that we all need to move on with our lives in separate directions,\u201d she said. \u201cI pray for them and I\u2019m moving on from that part of my life.\u201d\n\nIn August, \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d star Todd Chrisley and his wife, Julie, pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of tax evasion and fraud charges and were released on $100,000.

We have tried to keep Lindsie\u2019s extramarital relationships with Robby Hayes and Josh Murray private for her sake since August of 2016. Sadly, for reasons we can only guess at, she ran to the sheriff\u2019s office to accuse her brother of buying a sex tape of her and Robby, which was a complete lie, and now she\u2019s telling more lies about me. Although our hearts are broken, Lindsie is our daughter and we will always love her.\u201d\n\nJosh Murray denied he had an affair with Lindsie. He insisted they've only \"been friends for years.\" In a statement to Entertainment Tonight, Murray said: \"I know Todd and his family are going through some tough times right now and I pray everything works out in their favor.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They should probably focus on how not to be imprisoned for 30 years rather than spreading gossip to try and hurt their daughter. I truly believe they are good people and I wish them the best in however they choose to go about their actions.\"", "description": "Lindsie Chrisley says she\u2019ll no longer publicly discuss the ongoing family drama between herself and her estranged father, Todd Chrisley.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/lindsie-chrisley-todd-chrisley-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
