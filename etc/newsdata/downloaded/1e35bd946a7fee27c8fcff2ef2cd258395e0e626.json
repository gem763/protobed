The album notably comes on the heels of Kanye\u2019s much-hyped Sunday Service shows: a series of gospel-themed performances that grew from private church sessions at his Calabasas home attended by various Hollywood A-listers to West and Co. literally crashing church services and college campuses around the country to perform tracks from the new album. So what to make of Jesus Is King, now that it\u2019s here? The final product of all the chatter over the past few months is underwhelming as a grand creative statement\u2014and inconsequential as a \u201cgospel\u201d album.\n\nOf course, pop artists having spiritual awakenings is nothing new. In 1958, Little Richard renounced rock & roll as \u201cthe devil\u2019s music\u201d and walked away from his career at its peak to become a minister. The Jewish-raised Bob Dylan became a born-again Christian in the late-\u201870s, releasing albums like Saved before returning to more traditional themes. Cat Stevens converted to Islam and changed his stage name to Yusef. In hip-hop, Run-DMC re-emerged in 1993 with the Christianity-referencing \u201cDown With the King,\u201d while MC Hammer released full-fledged gospel songs like \u201cPray\u201d and \u201cDo Not Pass Me By.\u201d Artists like Goodie Mob and Lauryn Hill kept Christian themes prominent in their music, while former Kanye collaborator Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Muslim faith permeates his music\u2014as does the Christianity of Chance the Rapper, another Kanye protege.\n\nBut Kanye\u2019s religious journey from \u201cJesus Walks\u201d to Yeezus to Jesus Is King has been an interesting (mostly frustrating) study in celebrity, media and art. \u201cJesus Walks\u201d was driven by the creativity of former West cohort Rhymefest, who famously walked away from his old friend during the recording of The Life Of Pablo in 2016. Yeezus was seen as the height of Kanye\u2019s egocentrism back in 2013 and has become his most polarizing album. Now we have what many expect to be West\u2019s first full foray into gospel and, well, it just sounds like Kanye being Kanye\u2014with more scripture.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Jesus Is King is Kanye at his most tuneful in years. There\u2019s a melodicism that hearkens back to his popular 2000s sound, with the kind of sonic textures he explored (with less consistent results) on 2016\u2019s The Life of Pablo. Forgoing the silly hedonism that dragged down so much of that record and avoiding some of the more pretentious indulgences of last year\u2019s Ye makes this, in a way, the most streamlined Kanye has sounded since his heyday.\n\nBut the high points of craft don\u2019t negate the more juvenile moments in what\u2019s supposed to resonate as a grand statement of spiritual purpose. When West croons \u201cYou\u2019re my Chick-fil-A...you\u2019re my number one\u2014with a lemonade\u201d on \u201cClosed On Sunday,\u201d it\u2019s groan-inducing. It says a lot about how West comes off in 2019 that such a goofball line from him would have once seemed irreverent.\n\nThe \u201cEvery Hour\u201d opener is as straight-ahead gospel as the album gets, with West\u2019s Sunday Service choir offering sped-up platitudes. But the Ronny J-produced \u201cSelah\u201d brings us directly into Kanye\u2019s moody trademarks: \u201cWhen I reach Heaven\u2019s gates / I ain\u2019t gotta peek over / Keepin\u2019 perfect composure / While I scream at the chauffeur.\u201d\n\n\u201c It\u2019s the core of the album that proves Kanye is only occasionally interested in seeking God\u2019s grace or praising His mercies, and is far more preoccupied with nailing himself to a cross. \u201d\n\nAnt Clemons and Ty Dolla $ign show up for \u201cEverything We Need,\u201d a slice of upbeat trap that wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on Pablo and began life as a track on West\u2019s shelved Yandhi project. Clemons reappears on the follow-up track \u201cWater,\u201d a slow-groover more meditative than it is explicitly spiritual. \u201cGod Is\u201d is Kanye once again wearing the album\u2019s religiosity on his sleeve, with warbled AutoTune vocals conveying some of his most clich\u00e9 church-isms (\u201cKing of Kings, Lord of Lords / All the things He has in store / From the rich to the poor / All are welcome through His door\u201d) and that always present chip on his shoulder (\u201cThis my kids / This the crib / This my wife, this my life / This my God-given right\u201d). It\u2019s the core of the album that proves Kanye is only occasionally interested in seeking God\u2019s grace or praising His mercies, and is far more preoccupied with nailing himself to a cross.\n\nAn album highlight, the Clipse reunion of Pusha T and No Malice, is an invigorating presence on \u201cUse This Gospel.\u201d Pusha seems less focused on the Lord while his brother, devout Christian No Malice, rhymes, \u201cFrom the concrete grew a rose / They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk / Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk / Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost.\u201d The Kenny G sax solo is mostly extraneous, but provides interesting texture on an album that often threatens to run together.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been a fan of Kanye\u2019s music of the past five years, there\u2019s a lot to enjoy about Jesus Is King. He\u2019s engaged and sounds more creatively focused than he has in a while. But those are modest triumphs; and if you\u2019ve found recent Kanye to be insufferable and musically hollow, well, this album likely won\u2019t shift your opinion. Kanye adding more Jesus references to his own persecution complex does not a gospel album make, but the rapper seems convinced that his own demands and defensiveness make him a martyr. Jesus Is King isn\u2019t much of a gospel album and it\u2019s only a fairly average rap album. It\u2019s sonically and stylistically on par with much of 2010s Kanye: grand, sweeping-but-empty, and full of the bombast inherent in the artist himself. This time there\u2019s just a little more mass choir thrown in.", "description": "The MAGA rapper\u2019s ninth studio album comes on the heels of his Sunday Services, and is a gospel-inspired effort that feels, well, uninspired.", "authors": ["Stereo Williams"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572086083/191024-kanye-jesus-is-king-tease_gkvxmc", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
