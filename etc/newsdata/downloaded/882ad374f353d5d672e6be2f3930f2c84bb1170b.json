Once in, they were found to obtain elevated privileges to internal systems to install malware and laterally spread across the network to meet their operational objectives.\n\nOne of the tools employed during the intrusion is PlugX, a fully featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) with capabilities such as file upload, download, and modification, keystroke logging, webcam control, while completely avoiding security controls and detection.\n\nThe malware has become a weapon of choice for Chinese state-sponsored hackers in recent years, with Palo Alto Networks\u2019 threat intelligence team Unit 42 linking the cyberattacks in Southeast Asia to a group it calls PKPLUG last week.\n\nIn addition to using VPNs to anonymize their incoming connections, the bad actors identified by ANSSI saved their tools in folders named after popular antivirus software, such as ESET and McAfee, to evade detection.\n\nAs a consequence, the cybersecurity agency has urged service providers and clients to set up two-factor authentication, monitor their network for malicious connections, and grant external entities with the least amount of access to thwart privilege escalation.\n\nThe ANSSI alert comes as supply chain attacks \u2014 compromising a third party with a connection to the true target \u2014 are becoming an increasingly common way to target businesses and install malware. Last month, European aerospace giant Airbus was hit by a series of cyber assaults aimed at its suppliers possibly by China-linked groups in search of commercial secrets.\n\nLeveraging a service provider as an attack vector also vastly increases the scale of a security incident, as a successful break-in opens up access to multiple clients, making them all vulnerable at once.\n\nWhether be it by beefing up account security, or isolating critical network infrastructure, or by ensuring timely data backups, having well-tailored controls in place across the organization can ensure preparedness at both tactical and strategic levels for a destructive malware attack.\n\nRead next: Vodafone repledges Libra support, but wants it independent of Facebook", "description": "France has issued a new cyber threat advisory about targeted espionage operations directed at service providers and engineering firms.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Ffrance-malware-hed.jpg&signature=633bd12c97084c5ba3503b07313f67e8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
