The firm rates the stock a buy, but lowered its price target to $US2200 from $US2350.\n\nChief executive officer Jeff Bezos has promised since the company's initial public offering to invest for the long haul, and he is proving again his willingness to endure a little short-term pain in a bid to expand. Facing slowing growth in its core e-commerce franchise in recent years, Amazon in April announced an initiative to cut the delivery window on millions of items for paying members of its Prime subscription program. That's helped reinvigorate sales, if at a high price.\n\n\"Customers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day - they've already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year,\" Bezos said in a statement. \"It's a big investment, and it's the right long-term decision for customers.\"\n\nThe effort has helped reinvigorate sales, if at a high price. Global shipping costs soared 46 per cent in the third quarter to $US9.6 billion as the company offers one-day delivery on more Prime items. Indeed, online store sales rose 21 per cent in the same period.\n\nAmazon isn't only spending on shipping. Olsavsky said the company continues to build out software development and sales and marketing teams for the Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, and hire for roles supporting its devices business, streaming video unit and international operations.\n\nThe retail giant said Thursday that profit fell 28 per cent to $US2.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the higher spending, but revenue rose 24 per cent, a second consecutive increase, to $US70 billion.\n\nAmazon's costs for technology and content -- largely salaries related to employees in research and development and infrastructure for AWS data centres -- jumped 28 per cent to $US9.2 billion. The company's total workforce increased 22 per cent to 750,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, AWS's growth was the slowest since Amazon began breaking out the unit's performance.\n\nThat was \"absolutely\" a concern for investors, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. Amazon, which had a lengthy head start in building out a cloud-computing platform, faces steep competition now from well-funded rival offerings like Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform.\n\nWhile many analysts lowered their price target for Amazon shares, most of them saw the stock dip as a buying opportunity.\n\nUBS analysts said they weren't \"surprised with the initial negative stock reaction\", and said \"investors with a long-term horizon out to 2020 should view this result as a positive with Amazon clearly making investments against long-term objectives -- a paradigm that has historically yielded a much higher stock price once fully digested by investors\".\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Bullish analysts, including Goldman Sachs' Heath Terry, were undeterred by a holiday season cost surge that will dent both income and sales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4416%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d2a65925c0f0caed3a3c6b4dc5f37fbd92c5d2da", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
