If hacking, purely defined, consists of devising the simplest, most elegant way of getting what you want, then Snowden excelled at it, beginning when he set back every clock in the house at age 6 so he could stay up past bedtime.\n\nSnowden would later hack his way through adolescence. He calculated the minimum amount of work needed for passing grades in high school. The scheme worked until Honest Ed explained it to a teacher.\n\nSuch stories enliven the new memoir, \u201cPermanent Record,\u201d from the computer whiz who exposed secret U.S. government mass domestic surveillance six years ago.\n\nThe former CIA and National Security Agency systems engineer is now a digital privacy activist living in exile in Russia, charged with Espionage Act violations for which he says his conscience offered no other option.\n\nBorn in 1983, Snowden grew up on the early internet, intoxicated by its seemingly limitless potential for good. Before innocence was lost, it represented for him America\u2019s true values. Patriotism was ingrained in Snowden\u2019s upbringing. His parents quietly exercised it clocking in daily at work. Dad was a Coast Guard techie. Mom held various government jobs.\n\nComing-of-age memoirs like Snowden\u2019s typically recount journeys of moral discovery. That is the book\u2019s strength. Others, most notably journalist Glenn Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras, have already better chronicled the white-knuckled drama of how the most famous whistleblower since Daniel Ellsberg persuaded them to meet him in Hong Kong in 2013 so he could lift the lid on the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance of U.S. citizens.\n\nWhat Snowden does well is define the promise and dangers of digital technology and the wacky alchemy that grants system architects and administrators like him extraordinary power over people\u2019s lives. His clear-cut explanations of complicated yet vital phenomena like the TOR privacy browser and encryption are especially instructive.\n\nSnowden most regrets his atavistic reaction to 9/11, how the 18-year-old Ed became \u201ca willing vehicle of vengeance.\u201d He enlists in the Army only to break his leg in basic training. Then he watches from the inside as U.S. agents kidnap and torture foreigners.\n\nEngrossing is Snowden\u2019s description of how he used his programming skills to create a repository of classified in-house jots on the NSA\u2019s global snooping - and built a backup system for agency data. Reading through the repository, Snowden begins to understand the extent of his government\u2019s stomping on civil liberties. He becomes sullen, \u201ccursed with the knowledge that all of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d been forced to live the rest of their lives under omniscient parental supervision.\u201d\n\nAs he was deciding to blow the whistle, Snowden also came to realize that it wasn\u2019t just the government that was amassing and categorizing our data. The eureka moment came when he met his first internet-equipped \u201csmart fridge.\u201d\n\nHere he was, getting all exercised about U.S. government snooping while surveillance capitalists were collecting incredible dossiers on acquiescent consumers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Permanent Record,\" Metropolitan Books, by Edward Snowden", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Frank Bajak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/book_review-snowdenpermanent_record_69110_c0-1103-2309-2449_s1200x700.jpg?b51caf1c14b3d613ee9b14b1b96546485ad4e9ce", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
