If you're not a Prime member, the cost will be $298, which is still the equal cheapest among most Aussie retailers.\n\nIf you want to buy a few games on the side, however, Harvey Norman might have the best deal. The console itself is $298, but any games you buy with it will get a 10 percent discount.\n\nImage: Harvey Norman\n\nThe discount means you can bring the cost of Link's Awakening down to just under $63, which is the best price available right now. The discount applies to all games in your cart, so that means Pokemon Let's Go would drop to around $53, Smash Ultimate to around $81, and the Mario games (Mario Maker, Odyssey) to just over $60.\n\nWhether you get extra games or not, you might as well save every dollar you can. The extra $30 is enough to pick up something decent \u2014 like Untitled Goose Game later this week, anything from the American or Japanese eShops that aren't available here (like Hotline Miami) or just a few sub-$10 indies.\n\nFor more on how the Switch Lite compares to the original model, see our hands on with the hardware below.", "description": "If you've been holding out on a Switch, but wanted to save a little where possible, you can still get a good deal before the Switch Lite launches....", "authors": ["Joshua Rivera", "Keza Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/07/fbhvf5juopsulrtt9mfn1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
