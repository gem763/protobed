But Trump argued that it was unfair to suggest he was to blame for a military aircraft refueling in the vicinity of one of his properties.\n\n\u201cI own a lot of different places,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cSoon, you will find that out because I will be, at some point prior to the election, I will be giving out a financial report of me. And it will be extremely complete. I'm going to give out my financial condition.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s finances have been a major issue of contention, stemming from his refusal to release his tax returns while running for president, breaking a decades-long tradition for major party nominees.\n\nDemocrats in the House are now embroiled in a legal battle with the White House as well as top banks with whom he\u2019s conducted business in an attempt to compel their release \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely the issue will be resolved ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But he became unyielding as his White House has stonewalled oversight investigators demanding information about his finances and sued banks to block subpoenas issued by Democrats.\n\nAs president, Trump is required to submit annual financial disclosures. It is unclear whether he was referring to these less revealing documents on Monday; his latest disclosures were released in May.\n\nRegardless, Trump insisted that his eventual financial statements would show that his properties are not hurting for business.\n\n\u201cYou will be extremely shocked at the numbers,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cMany, many times what you think. I don't need to have somebody take a room overnight at a hotel.\u201d\n\nAccusations that Trump\u2019s properties are unfairly profiting off of his administration have dogged the president since entering office. Trump still owns his business but placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit. He can receive money from the trust at any time.\n\nEthics officials and lawmakers have long raised concerns about foreign officials staying at Trump hotels, noting that Trump supporters and industry groups regularly hold events at Trump-owned locations. Trump has also publicly announced that his Doral resort in Miami is under consideration for next year\u2019s gathering of G-7 leaders, a potential financial boon for the property, and he has previously stayed at the Turnberry property in Scotland during an official visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nRevenue increased by $3.1 million at Trump Turnberry in 2018, which Trump visited in July of that year, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure forms.\n\nCompounding the Scotland scandal, Vice President Mike Pence raised eyebrows last week when he stayed at Trump\u2019s resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, during a visit there, despite its location hundreds of miles away from his meetings in Dublin. Trump has insisted he played no role in Pence\u2019s decision to stay there, pointing to family the vice president has in the area.", "description": "Trump\u2019s finances have been a major issue of contention, stemming from his refusal to release his tax returns while running for president.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/77/28/d25defb14b278c339cdf63a87bd8/190909-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
