The last time an Arab party backed a candidate during consultations was in 1992, when Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister. Rabin later signed the historic Oslo accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\n\u201cWe will recommend Benny Gantz as prime minister,\u201d Joint List leader Ayman Odeh said during a meeting with Rivlin on Sunday. \u201cWe want to return to be legitimate political actors and bring an end to the Netanyahu government.\u201d\n\nRivlin held consultations with representatives of four of the nine political blocs that make up Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset. He is scheduled to meet with the rest of the factions on Monday and then decide whether Netanyahu or Gantz will get the first chance to form the next government.\n\n[Netanyahu offers talks over unity government. His chief rival brushes aside the invitation.]\n\nAlso breaking with precedent was Avigdor Liberman, the hawkish former defense minister. He has been loyal in the past to Netanyahu, but said he could not support the long-serving leader this time because Netanyahu has aligned himself closely with religious and right-wing parties.\n\nLiberman said he wouldn\u2019t recommend Gantz, either, after he was supported by the Joint List.\n\nLiberman said the only way forward was to form a unity government that included both Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party. He said it did not matter which of the two men became prime minister first.\n\nBlue and White won about 40,000 more votes than Likud in the election last week, but neither party gained enough seats to form a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. And neither, it appears, will be able to muster enough support from their ideological blocs to carve a stable coalition. With 33 and 31 seats, Blue and White and Likud could form a strong, centrist government.\n\nRivlin said after the election that the parity between the two parties indicated \u201cloud and clear\u201d that the majority of Israel\u2019s citizens wanted to see a \u201cbroad and stable national unity government.\u201d\n\nHe said the stalemate, which began after a first round of elections in April left Netanyahu unable to secure a governing coalition, had gone on for too long. He called on all candidates to quickly \u201cwork towards forming a government that can serve the State of Israel and the people of Israel again.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Rivlin, who normally has a ceremonial role, much like the queen of England, has now been thrust into a role of great importance,\u201d said Gil Hoffman, chief political correspondent and analyst for the Jerusalem Post.\n\n\u201cHe is really being looked to as the unifier that Israel so desperately needs,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\n[What\u2019s next for Israel\u2019s new Arab political party?]\n\nIt was unclear how Rivlin would get the sides to cooperate, after their campaigns promised not to be part of a government that included certain candidates or certain parties. It wasn\u2019t even clear how he would decide who would get the first chance to form a government. Tradition dictates that the opportunity be offered to the person most likely to succeed, but with the task appearing near impossible for either leader, the president might need to consider other criteria.\n\n\u201cThis situation has never happened before, and therefore it\u2019s hard to know what the options are,\u201d said Mordechai Kremnitzer, professor emeritus in law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a senior research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.\n\nBecause Israel is in such an \u201cunusual situation,\u201d he said, \u201cit is possible that the president will choose something that is equally unusual.\u201d\n\nNeither party appeared willing to budge Sunday. Gantz last week rejected an appeal by Netanyahu to meet and discuss a unity government, making clear that, as leader of the largest party, he intended to become Israel\u2019s next prime minister.\n\nHe also reiterated a commitment to a unity government, as long as it did not include Netanyahu, who faces possible criminal indictment in three cases of fraud, bribery and breach of trust.\n\nImmediately after the election, Netanyahu signed a pact with two ultra-Orthodox parties and a smaller religious nationalist party, boosting his support in the Knesset to 55 seats. Likud insists that, as the head of the largest bloc, it should lead the charge. At this stage, it has refused to remove Netanyahu as party leader.\n\nRead more\n\n\u2018Our relations are with Israel\u2019: Trump appears to give embattled Netanyahu the cold shoulder\n\nIsrael\u2019s two main parties locked in dead heat as negotiations begin over new government\n\nIn Israeli election, a nation votes but one man could decide\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "President Reuven Rivlin is in consultations with key parties over who will form the next government.", "authors": ["Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/l_qsO6xEQr-9ufzwHEHJ6B82vbc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VPRVAAW5KUI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
