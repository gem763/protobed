The trauma resulting from Hurricane Katrina is also multifaceted, as Sarah M. Broom shows through the loss of her family home in her memoir, The Yellow House.\n\nIn her writing on the rape she experienced as a preteen in her memoir Hunger, Roxane Gay not only confronts the pain of that event, and her resulting weight gain, but also criticizes the social structures and shaming that can deepen such traumas. A sexual assault in Siri Hustvedt\u2019s novel Memories of the Future becomes a catalyst for the protagonist\u2019s writing, through which she develops the courage to speak out forcefully against misogyny.\n\nChanel Miller\u2019s memoir, Know My Name, details how she grappled with her sexual assault, the onslaught of victim-blaming she endured, and her attacker\u2019s lack of accountability. In this case\u2014as with the other books on this list\u2014the paradox of writing about trauma is that one of the many effects of experiencing a devastating event can sometimes be the production of a powerful piece of art.\n\n\u200bEvery Friday in the Books Briefing, we thread together Atlantic stories on books that share similar ideas.\n\nKnow other book lovers who might like this guide?
