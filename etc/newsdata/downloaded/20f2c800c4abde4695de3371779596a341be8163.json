Retired American Carmelita Jeter currently holds the honour at 31.\n\nWhile Usain Bolt\u2019s world-record breaking success at the 2008 Beijing Olympics dominated the headlines, Fraser-Pryce also made her share by becoming the first Jamaican woman to win an Olympic 100m race.\n\nKATERINA STEFANIDI, Greece, pole vault\n\nThe Greek just became the first female pole vaulter to win four consecutive Diamond League titles. Now the reigning Olympic and world champion is aiming for two more honours.\n\nA victory in Doha would enable the 29-year-old to join American Stacy Dragila and Russian Yelena Isinbayeva as the only repeat female pole vault world champions. Dragila did it in 1999 and 2001 with Isinbayeva taking gold in 2005 and 2007.\n\nStefanidi also has a chance for a third global title, an exclusive club that currently includes only Isinbayeva (with five - two Olympic, three world) and Dragila (three - two world, one Olympic).\n\nYULIMAR ROJAS, Venezuela, triple jump\n\nThe world indoor and outdoor champion definitely has the world record in her sights.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nTuning up for the world championships earlier this month, the 23-year-old bounded 15.41 metres, nine centimetres shy of the 1995 record that Ukrainian Inessa Kravets set two months before Rojas was born.\n\n\u201cI want to show women that if you work hard for something you can do it,\u201d Rojas said after improving her personal best by 30 centimetres and becoming the fourth female triple jumper to record at least four 15-metre jumps in the same year.\n\nThe jump made Rojas the favourite for another world title with contenders Shanieka Ricketts of Jamaica (14.93m) and Colombian Olympic champion Caterine Ibarguen (14.89m).", "description": "Key women to watch at the Sept. 27-Oct. 6 world championships at Doha:", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434269348&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1WY", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
