Most of those gains were quickly given up however after the suggestion received a lukewarm response from unionist politicians who advocate Brexit.\n\nThe chief whip of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, Jeffrey Donaldson, said in a tweet that the proposal was \"economic madness.\"\n\nA separate report from the FT suggested that the U.K.'s ruling Conservative Party would struggle to unite around a \"Brexit at any cost\" platform as part of a general election campaign.\n\nThe paper claimed as many as 50 MPs would revolt against the government if it pursued no deal as an option.", "description": "The Times newspaper reports that the EU is offering Northern Ireland a future veto over the backstop arrangement.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106160593-1570030538810gettyimages-1172802168.jpeg?v=1570030566", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
