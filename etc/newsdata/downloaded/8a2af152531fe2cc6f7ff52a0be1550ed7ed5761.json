The Foreign Ministry claimed it was merely a \"face-to-face talk\" with Harris, but diplomatic sources said the ministry summoned him to protest.\n\n", "description": "Stop Meddling Over Intelligence Pact with Japan, Seoul Tells U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/08/29/2019082900842_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
