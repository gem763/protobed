They typically claim malware has infected recipient\u2019s machines to record webcams and naughty browsing habits, demanding Bitcoin in exchange for not leaking that data to the world.\n\nTo add authenticity, the emails often include sensitive information, such as email passwords, believed to have been sourced from any number of major online data leaks.\n\nOG Bitcoin sextortion scam email sample courtesy of Emin G\u00fcn Sirer.\n\nAs for why the scammers have switched to Litecoin over any one of the thousands of cryptocurrencies that aren\u2019t Bitcoin, Cofense explained that not all are easily accessible from popular exchanges.\n\nSo, for the scam to work, potential victims need to be able to acquire the demanded cryptocurrency \u2014 Litecoin fits that description.\n\nRecent iterations of the sextortion scam have evolved in other ways. Some have reportedly removed text and images altogether, instead opting for PDF documents, which in some cases are encrypted.\n\nCurrent versions of the scam are also said to be written using very few searchable word patterns, again, to avoid detection.\n\nIt\u2019s all fun and games until the real malware showed up\n\nEarlier this year, Hard Fork reported that an 84-year-old bagel-loving lady foiled a $1,400 sextortionist plot by simply ignoring the emails \u201cThey told me I have very good taste in porn so I thought that was nice,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nMore concerning, however, is that just one month later, ESET researchers discovered a nasty strain of malware that\u2019s reportedly capable of detecting pornography on-screen and automatically recording webcam footage when its found.\n\nThat particular malware is distributed through dodgy email attachments, so defending against it is as easy as avoiding suspicious emails altogether.\n\nAnd still, the best defence against sextortion emails is to simply not reply.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
