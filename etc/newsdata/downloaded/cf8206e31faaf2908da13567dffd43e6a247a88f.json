So a two-night stay at a downtown hotel in Seattle sounds great at $137 a night. But then Hotwire tacks on a $95.38 \"tax recovery and fees\" surcharge and the bill grows to $373. Explanation: \"We retain our service fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation.\"\n\nTravel: Expedia fined over $300,000 for breaching U.S. sanctions with Cuba tours\n\nDestinations: The top U.S. cities for quick trips, according to Hotwire\n\nHotWire's hidden fees jack up a room rate More\n\nPriceline\n\nThis is another site promising discount rooms, but check your discount first as you will pay in the form of fees for the service. Priceline calls it \"compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs.\"\n\nExpedia's checkout cart lists only the first night taxes, not the total More\n\nExpedia\n\nThe dominant site for airline tickets and hotel rooms \u2013 it also owns Hotels.com, CheapTickets, Orbitz, Hotwire, Travelocity and Trivago \u2013 doesn't appear to tack on fees, but you need to be on your toes when booking. For instance, we found a hotel in New York City for $119.24 a night. Two nights, plus $21.09 for taxes, should come to $259.57 by our estimations, but Expedia's checkout put us at $280.66. What we missed at first: We were supposed to multiply both the room rate and the taxes by two.\n\nAlso, look out for great airline fares on Expedia \u2013 but be sure to note the airport listed first. We tried to book flights to Seattle from Los Angeles International Airport, where we were quoted $169 roundtrip, versus an average of $300 and up on other airlines. Once we clicked enough buttons to get to the cart, we saw that the flight actually originated from Ontario Airport, some 60 miles from home, not LAX.\n\nAirBNB\n\nThe discount hotel alternative got a well-deserved reputation for offering lower-priced overnight stays, and the ire of the hotel industry, but the list of fees (cleaning, administration) have a way of making a $50-a-night stay creep really high. That's how a $96 a night townhouse in San Diego for two nights gets to $308. One-third of the cost are fees \u2013 $58 for cleaning, $32 for \"service\" and $26 in taxes. Of the service fee, Airbnb says, \"This helps us run our platform and offer services like 24/7 support on your trip.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "What to look for when shopping for a travel deal and how to avoid the hidden room fees on websites.
