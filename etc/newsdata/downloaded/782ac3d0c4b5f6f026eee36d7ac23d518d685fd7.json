But government funding for two highly symbolic imperial rituals this year has sparked rare dissent.\n\nOn October 22, Emperor Naruhito will formally proclaim his enthronement, which occurred earlier this year after his father\u2019s abdication, and in November he will perform the sacred Daijosai thanksgiving ritual.\n\nThe government is setting aside millions of dollars in funds, in particular for the sumptuous October event, which will draw dignitaries from around the world.\n\nBut critics say the two ceremonies are effectively religious rites, and public funding for them violates a constitutionally mandated separation of state and faith.\n\n\u201cThe Daijosai ritual is nothing more than a Shinto ceremony,\u201d the United Church of Christ in Japan, a leading Protestant group, said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nPublic funding for them \u201cviolates the principle of separating politics from religion\u2026 and infringes on freedom of belief\u201d, it added.\n\nThe subject touches on the sensitive history of the role of the emperor during World War II.\n\nUnder Japan\u2019s wartime constitution, the emperor was \u201csacred and inviolable\u201d, he was supreme commander of the army and navy and was invoked as a motivating force for Japanese troops on battlefields across Asia.\n\nAfter Japan\u2019s defeat, some felt the imperial family should be removed altogether, but instead US-led allied forces stripped the emperor of political power, enshrining his limited role as a state symbol in the newly written constitution.\n\nThe constitution also stipulates that \u201cthe state\u2026 shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity\u201d, a rule critics say the government will violate by allotting public money to this year\u2019s imperial rituals.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Highly religious nature\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe dissent extends beyond the Christian community, with 300 plaintiffs ranging from Buddhist monks to university professors filing suits from last year against the government\u2019s plan to fund the ceremonies.\n\n\u201cThe government funding these religious events means that the emperor epitomises Japan\u2019s religion and culture, and that the government is promoting a state religion,\u201d Koichi Shin, one of the plaintiffs, told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a problem, too, that all the activities of the imperial family are financed with public money,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBut the two ceremonies are huge in terms of size and expenditure, as well as media attention, so they have an enormous impact on society.\u201d\n\nAnd the critics have support from a somewhat unlikely quarter: Crown Prince Akishino.\n\nLast November, before assuming his new title with his brother\u2019s ascension to the throne, he publicly questioned the spending, noting the Daijosai ceremony in particular \u201chas a highly religious nature\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wonder if it is appropriate to finance this highly religious thing with state funds,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue has come up before, with lawsuits also filed over the enthronement of former emperor Akihito and ceremonies related to the death of his father Hirohito in 1989. But the cases were mostly dismissed.\n\nOne court ruled there were grounds to \u201csuspect\u201d the ceremonies were religious, but the supreme court rejected suits on the grounds that the ceremonies were \u201csocial conventions\u201d not religious activities.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Social conventions\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe government says the rituals are \u201cpublic events\u201d and therefore eligible for funding.\n\nAnd the spending will not be insignificant given the price tag for all the enthronement-related ceremonies runs to 16 billion yen ($147.2 million).\n\nThe government has set aside $64 million in cabinet funds for the events, with the remainder split between the imperial household \u2014 itself funded by taxpayer money \u2014 the national police agency, and the foreign and defence ministries.\n\nSeveral lawsuits against the spending are working their way through the courts, but none stand much chance.\n\nA hearing on an urgent injunction isn\u2019t even scheduled until after the Daijosai event.\n\nAnd there is little sign of public support for the critics, with the imperial family enjoying high approval ratings.\n\nBut the plaintiffs, including Satoshi Ukai, a professor of modern French literature, are undeterred, insisting Japan\u2019s history makes it important to fight the case.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese case is different from cases in other countries,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s state Shintoism\u2026 was used as a foundation to justify invasive wars and colonisations.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 When it comes to Japan\u2019s royal family, anti-monarchy sentiment is almost non-existent.
