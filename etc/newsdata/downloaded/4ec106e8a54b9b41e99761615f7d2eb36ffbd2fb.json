If the gains hold through the open, the range that had been in place since early August would break to the upside. But can already observers are finding reasons to doubt the rise. \u201cUS stocks are poised for a strong open after the world\u2019s two largest economies signaled trade negotiations are set to continue at the highest levels in October, while lower level meetings will take place this month,\u201d writes Oanda\u2019s Edward Moya. \u201cThe US is set to turn up the tariff pressure again on October 1st and if we don\u2019t see that threat taken off, markets will be skeptical that the October meeting likely not see anything meaningful happen.\u201d\n\nThis is meaningful, however, at least for today. While the stock market is moving higher, bonds prices are getting knocked lower, which means yields are rising. The 10-year Treasury yield has gained 0.066 percentage point to 1.53%, and the 30-year is back over 2%. Even better, one part of the yield curve is no longer inverted, as the difference between the 10-year and 2-year yields is solidly positive for a second day in a row.\n\nIs it time for stocks to follow the curve higher?\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "Reports emerged overnight that the U.S. and China had agreed to talk, and that was enough to send the market higher.
