The Turkish military announced its first fatality on Friday.\n\nRas al-Ain, Tal Abyad and other border towns between them have been almost emptied of their population in a huge wave of displacement.\n\nMost of the 70,000 people the United Nations confirmed had been displaced travelled east towards the city of Hasakeh, which has not been targeted by Turkey.\n\n\u201cWhat does Erdogan want from us?,\u201d asked one woman, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as she and her family settled in a school the local authorities had turned into an emergency shelter.\n\n\u201cIs it all simply because we are Kurds?\u201d\n\nErdogan wants to create a buffer between the border and territory controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces, who have links with Turkey\u2019s own Kurdish rebels.\n\nHe also plans to use the strip, which he envisions will be about 30 kilometres (20 miles) deep and is mostly Arab, as an area in which to send back some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees who live on Turkish soil.\n\nThe area would be under Turkish control and run by Syrian proxies, a move that would make it hard for displaced Kurds to return and would durably reshape the area\u2019s ethnic map.\n\n\u2013 Ceasefire? \u2013\n\nOn Twitter on Thursday, Trump said that he hoped to \u201cmediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds\u201d \u2014 saying the alternatives were sending in \u201cthousands of troops\u201d or hitting Turkey hard with sanctions.\n\nA US official explained that Trump had asked diplomats to try to broker a ceasefire agreement and argued sanctions against Turkey were not justified at this stage.\n\nAsked to define what actions would violate Trump\u2019s vague warning, the US official said they would include \u201cethnic cleansing\u2026 indiscriminate artillery, air and other fires directed at civilian populations.\u201d\n\nDoctors Without Borders (MSF) said in a statement that it had to close down the hospital it supported in Tal Abyad.\n\nThe shelling there led most people to leave, including the hospital\u2019s medical staff, it said.\n\nAid groups have warned of yet another humanitarian disaster in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war if the offensive was not stopped.\n\nFrance, which was the United States\u2019 top partner in the anti-IS coalition, has threatened sanctions against NATO member Turkey.\n\nTurkey is still far from having reached the goals of its military invasion but the risk appears to be growing that detained IS fighters could break free.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said he doubted Turkey would be able to ensure IS prisoners stay behind bars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether the Turkish army will be able to take this under control \u2014 and how soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a real threat to us.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Kurdish administration, some 12,000 men are held in seven detention centres across Kurdish-controlled areas.\n\nThe United States already plucked two of the most high-profile IS jihadists to have been captured alive and spirited them out of Syria.", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Turkish and allied forces faced stiff Kurdish resistance Friday as they battled to seize key border towns, on the third", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/bf3de1_kurdish-controlled-but-arab-border-town-tal-abyad-is-one-areas-brunt-turkish-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
