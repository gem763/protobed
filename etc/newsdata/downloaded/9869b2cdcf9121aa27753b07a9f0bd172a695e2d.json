Economic growth slowed to 1.8 percent in the last quarter of 2018 due to the political instability.\n\nIt took a further hit earlier this year after local armed fighters carried out suicide bombings against three hotels and churches, killing at least 269 people.", "description": "Sri Lanka's president withdraws opposition to US grant that Washington withheld last year over constitutional standoff.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/0896201d11f9412e824c039207a01cfc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
