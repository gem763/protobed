Luna ended up being the winning name.\n\n\"That was the most popular vote we had ever seen. People were so glued in to Luna and her story,\" Ford explained.\n\nLuna's story even captured the attention of famed \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, who admitted voting for the sea pup's name!\n\n\"We want people to be excited about otters and be excited about picking a name for these pups, but there are also some very real things they can do to help sea otters out in the wild, as well,\u201d Ford said, such as supporting wildlife protections legislation.\n\nI voted on this orphaned otter's name. My favourite animal named for one of my favourite characters! https://t.co/L8E9fueN7M \u2014 J.K.
