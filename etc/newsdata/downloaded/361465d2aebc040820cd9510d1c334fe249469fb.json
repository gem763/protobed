I\u2019ve seen chefs post about how this is the way they keep greens fresh. After you rinse and spin your greens, you can just put the top on and stick the whole thing in the refrigerator. I use it for parsley, romaine, spinach \u2014 any leafy green that I buy. And if I use half a cucumber in a smoothie, I\u2019ll just stick the other half in the salad spinner with whatever greens are in there and it stays so much fresher. This one\u2019s pretty big, so it can store quite a bit. It will stay fresh for a week. I like that the bottom of this spinner is metal, not plastic; it\u2019s really well-made. I\u2019ve had mine for at least three years and it\u2019s still going strong. It\u2019s pretty easy to clean, and the top comes apart if you really want to do a deep clean. This spinner is more or less middle-of-the-road in terms of price (Goop had a luxury one for like a hundred bucks that sold out). But in terms of something that\u2019s good quality, I think this one is worth investing in.", "description": "We talked to designer and zero-waste influencer about the reusable products she swears by, including OXO Steel Salad Spinner, Kablo Glass Water Bottle, Bormioli Rocco Fido Clear Jar, Lakeshore Linen Bread Bags, and Kinto To-Go Tumbler.", "authors": ["Haley Boyd", "Liza Corsillo"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/28/haley-boyd-wiclw/28-wiclw-haley-boyd.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
