When it comes to life or death, people choose life - and mostly their own life, however there are those who put their own lives in danger in order to protect others.\n\nIf a video doing rounds on social media is to be believed, a bunch of kids gave the rest of us a lesson in humanity. The video shows a bunch of children putting their own safety in danger to rescue puppies from under a burning car. Though the video is from India, the exact location and time is not yet known.\n\nIn the video, one can see a jeep completely on fire, and still burning as a bunch of children crowd around it and try to get under it. There is no need to point out the danger of getting under a burning vehicle, there is always the possibility of it exploding (at least that\u2019s the take away from Bollywood movies).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnafraid of what might or might not happen, one of the children lay down and took one puppy out, while the other helped keep that puppy at a safe distance. Then the former went under again and rescued another puppy and then another. It's visible that the kids rescued a total of three puppies.\n\nWhile there are cases of animal cruelty pouring in from across the country, this really gives us hope. On one hand there are people who mercilessly beat dogs, even to their deaths, and on the other, are these sensitive young citizens who literally went into the mouth of danger to rescue little puppies.\n\nDon't Miss 152 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 408 SHARES\n\nWhat these children did is really inspiring and brave and it sets an example for all of us - to value every life, because every life matters. We hope that the puppies are safe and healthy.", "description": "In dangerous situation with the rush of adrenaline, mostly the instinct is of flight.
