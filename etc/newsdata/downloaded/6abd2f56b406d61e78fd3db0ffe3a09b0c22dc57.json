(TechRepublic)\n\nUnder the program, the aerospace giant plans to develop autonomous systems capabilities to increase the independent operation of air and sea vehicles. It will focus heavily on the regulatory side and has been built on the existing partnership Boeing has with the Shell-operated, Queensland government gas initiative.\n\nAt the time, Boeing Autonomous Systems vice president Chris Raymond said basing the company's investment in Queensland would further its relationship with local security forces and Defence.\n\n\"We've been really excited about what we've been doing in Queensland ... it's really been a great effort I think, because for anything to advance, it needs resourcing,\" Raymond said at the time.\n\n\"Apart from the financial investment, one thing we've really found here is all the elements of innovation: The university ecosystem, the small to medium-sized enterprise business, the technical providers we have in the supply chain, and then our own Boeing people here.\n\n\"We've really found it a great place to combine resources, insights, know-how, and a really like-minded focus for advancing autonomy in Queensland.\"\n\nThe DCRC was launched in 2017 by the Australian government to focus on the development of trusted autonomous systems in partnership with academia, publicly funded research agencies, and industry -- particularly small to-medium enterprises -- in a bid to create an \"interlocking research and innovation capability that is focused on driving a Defence outcome\".\n\nRelated coverage\n\nBoeing signs on as Australian Space Agency partner with a focus on STEM\n\nThe pair will focus on STEM education, space-related R&D, as well as other areas that are expected to grow the Australian space sector.\n\nBoeing to use Queensland as test bed for autonomous systems development\n\nThe aerospace giant has touted Australia as the 'ideal' place to work on autonomous innovation to both build systems and get regulators on side.\n\nDefence awards AU$15m in latest round of Innovation Hub contracts\n\nIt will also make major reforms to its DISP program to make it easier for industry to do business with Defence.\n\nWA launches new automation courses and Defence Science Centre\n\nThe state government also secured AU$39 million to purchase new equipment to advance scientific research and support jobs in STEM industries within the state.\n\nBoeing plans autopilot software update after two 737 MAX crashes\n\nThe software update includes changes to flight control systems, pilot displays, operation manuals and crew training.", "description": "The technologies developed have the potential to be used in unmanned systems for military operations.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/f4b4ac39-5e2c-43e3-bb6b-507d086c3fd0/thumbnail/770x578/6d28bbd1d3e4baee37ac4a5613a0ccc7/boeing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
