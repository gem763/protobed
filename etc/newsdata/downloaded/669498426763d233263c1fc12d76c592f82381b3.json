Smart grids are electrical grids that incorporate digital components such as real-time energy meters and smart appliances.\n\nThe panel, which was established nearly a decade ago under former President Obama, is the third advisory board confirmed to have been terminated for fiscal 2020, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Protected Areas Federal Advisory Committee and the Interior Department\u2019s Invasive Species Advisory Committee.\n\nNeither the White House nor any government agency has released a comprehensive list of committees cut under Trump\u2019s order, which mandated that all agencies \u201cterminate at least one-third of its current committees.\u201d The due date for cuts was Sept. 30.\n\nThe 11 advisers on the Smart Grid Advisory Committee were first alerted by an official from NIST at the end of September that the committee\u2019s charter would not be renewed but were offered no explanation.\n\n\u201cIt was a very straight forward call,\u201d said Paul Centolella, chairman of the advisory committee and president of Paul Centolella & Associates.\n\nCentolella said members were made aware of the likelihood that the panel might get the ax during the June meeting, which ended up being the advisory board\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cWe were told that considering the number of advisory committees, there were not a lot of choices in the department. So that was a factor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a decision that obviously came from high up in the administration for the agencies.\u201d\n\nA Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed the agency\u2019s termination, saying it was the only advisory board ended at NIST, which falls under Commerce.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Commerce has conducted a comprehensive review of its advisory committees pursuant to the Executive Order \u2018Evaluating and Improving the Utility of Federal Advisory Committees,\u2019 in an effort to use government resources more efficiently. As part of the review, Commerce recommended to the Office of Management and Budget that the Smart Grid Advisory Committee would cease operations by September 30, 2019,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement provided to The Hill.\n\nA spokesperson for NIST would not provide details on what other committees at Commerce were ended under the executive order.\n\nThe committee had recently finalized a framework and road map on methods to modernize the U.S. electric grid to allow for better communication with smart homes and computer systems.\n\nCentolella said he hopes the panel's latest report will still be released as slated next year.\n\n\u201cI think the framework was generally very well received,\u201d he said. \u201cI know staff has been working hard on it and there\u2019s been a great deal of public work and input.\u201d\n\nMike Jacobs, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, called the decision to end the committee worrisome.\n\n\u201cI would worry that it represents the loss of forward momentum in trying to bring this kind of technology into the market. There\u2019s an awful lot of room for the digital age to get into energy, and this was really a central part of the puzzle. I've been talking to folks who\u2019ve wanted to get this thing going for 20 years,\u201d he said.\n\nJacobs said the committee was not considered controversial but did make utilities rethink the way electric grids currently work.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that this kind of progress is not in the interest of conventional power plants, their owners and their fuel suppliers. So if you are looking to do a favor to the old ways of doing things, stunting the growth of the new ways would be your best bet,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked his thoughts on the advisory board\u2019s termination, Centolella called it \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there certainly is a role for gathering input from outside expertise aside from the government. It\u2019s not clear to me how they came up with this decision,\u201d he said.", "description": "An advisory committee that provided input on bettering smart grids in the U.S. is the latest casualty of President Trump\u2019s executive order to cut federal advisory boards by a third.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/electricgrid_thinkstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
