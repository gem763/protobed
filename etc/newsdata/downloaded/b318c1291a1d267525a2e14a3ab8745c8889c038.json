However, it\u2019s clear that her many accomplishments are both unprecedented and even more magnificent than those of history\u2019s most lauded athletes.\n\nAs if anyone needed a reminder of the 22-year-old\u2019s brilliance, Biles put on a record-breaking clinic at the gymnastics world championships in Stuttgart, Germany, this past week.\n\ncaption Simone Biles performs a routine on the balance beam at the 2019 world championships. source Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nShe came home with a whopping five gold medals to raise her overall world medals count to 25 \u2013 the most of any gymnast, male or female, in the history of the sport. With her definitive gold-medal performance on the balance beam Sunday, Biles broke the record of 23 total medals at worlds, which Vitaly Scherbo of the Soviet Union and Belarus set a year before the wunderkind was born.\n\nThough Biles is consistently the heavy favorite regardless of the event she\u2019s competing in, her victory on the beam was far from a guarantee. The Columbus, Ohio, native took home the gold in 2014 and 2015, but her recent history has been mixed. She lost her balance and settled for bronze medals in the event at both the 2016 Rio Olympics and 2018 world championships.\n\nSo when she did secure the victory, Biles allowed herself a moment of jubilation and jumped out of her seat to celebrate.\n\nJOY!????\n\nThe moment @Simone_Biles found out she had become the most decorated World Championship gymnast!

She unquestionably left her competition in the dust in every single event. Biles secured gold by more than half of a point in both vault and balance beam before earning a full point more than the next-highest scorer in the floor exercise. And in the all-around event, Biles was truly competing in a league of her own, racking up an impressive 2.1 points more than silver medalist Tang Xijing of China.\n\nIn a sport that is more often decided by tenths or hundredths of a point, as The New Yorker\u2019s Eren Orbey points out, Biles comparably astronomical margins of victory would have been unfathomable before she first joined the US women\u2019s national team in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis is really the best worlds performance I have ever put out,\u201d Biles said on Sunday, according to the New York Times.\n\ncaption Simone Biles performs a mind-bending triple-double during her gold medal-winning floor routine Sunday. source Kyodo News via Getty Images\n\nBiles\u2019 next appearance on the international stage will come in Tokyo next summer, where she\u2019ll more than likely put on jaw-dropping performance after jaw-dropping performance as she did in 2016. In Rio, Biles took the top prize in team, all-around, vault, and floor and tacked on the bronze in balance beam for good measure.\n\nThis time around, it appears she\u2019s entering the Olympic games, having cemented her dominance even further. In addition to regaining her confidence on the beam, Biles has continued to push herself in other areas of competition. Biles consistently nails skills so technically difficult and beyond the abilities of her competitors \u2013 or any gymnast ever, for that matter \u2013 that they\u2019ve been named in her honor.\n\nAnd because gymnastics scoring rewards athletes for the difficulty of their planned routines and subtracts points for any deviation from the perfect performance, Biles is almost always afforded a heretofore unprecedented amount of leeway. At worlds last year, she famously competed while battling a kidney stone and, despite multiple falls and uncharacteristic errors, still came away lightyears ahead of the field.\n\ncaption Simone Biles poses with one of her gold medals from the 2018 world championships. source Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nNo athlete \u2013 regardless of gender \u2013 has ever commanded the throne of any sport in nearly as dominant a fashion as Biles. She has also done so amidst sexual abuse scandals and filings for bankruptcy that have amounted to the most tumultuous period in USA gymnastics\u2019 history.\n\nThe summer Olympics in Tokyo will serve as her victory lap. The gymnastics virtuoso already announced her intention to retire after the upcoming games, and it\u2019s more than likely she\u2019ll cap her career with a slew of resounding victories.\n\nAnd even though she\u2019ll walk away from competition without rivaling the medal count or longevity of Olympic legends like Phelps or Usain Bolt, Biles will almost certainly have enjoyed the single most impressive international career of any athlete on the planet, past or present.", "description": "Business Insider - The 22-year-old wunderkind has been leaving her competition in the dust for years, and it's unlike anything we've ever seen from another athlete..
