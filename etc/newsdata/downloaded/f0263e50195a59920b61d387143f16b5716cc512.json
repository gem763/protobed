As part of his five years of extensive reporting on the high seas for his forthcoming book The Outlaw Ocean, from which the piece is adapted, Urbina traveled through the churning waves of the North Sea to tour Sealand and interview its founding family. For The Atlantic, Urbina will continue his reporting on issues associated with the world\u2019s oceans\u2014crime, piracy, global migration, climate change\u2014and on other topics, publishing across multiple platforms.\n\n\u201cIan is one of the most intrepid reporters working today,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cHis writing about the world\u2019s oceans is totally pathbreaking. I\u2019m so excited to share his writing with readers of The Atlantic.\u201d\n\nDuring his career, Urbina has won a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News, a George Polk Award for Foreign Reporting, and his work has been nominated for an Emmy Award. He has degrees in history and cultural anthropology from Georgetown University and the University of Chicago. Before joining The New York Times, he was a Fulbright Fellow in Cuba and he also wrote about the Middle East and Africa for various outlets including the Los Angeles Times, Harper\u2019s, and Vanity Fair.\n\nThe Atlantic recently added contributing writers Rachel Monroe, whose latest investigation for The Atlantic told the story of the con man-turned-true-crime author; and Drew Gilpin Faust, President Emerita and the Arthur Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University, who wrote recently on race, history, and memories of her childhood in Virginia.", "description": "Ian Urbina, a longtime reporter for The New York Times and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize, is becoming a contributing writer for The Atlantic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/UrbinaCrop/facebook.jpg?1565884407"}
