But it may be that a fundamental part of the explanation is quite simple.\n\nAt a meeting of the synagogue that I attend \u2013 one of the largest in north London \u2013 members were asked to hold up their hands to discuss which factors were the most important in promoting their sense of Jewish identity. A large number put up their hands when Israel was mentioned. Similarly, the Holocaust was seen as very important as was antisemitism. Jewish ritual and practice was not, relatively speaking, an important factor.\n\nIt is a small sample, and it comes at a time when antisemitism is rarely out of the news, but it did get me thinking.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This is a source of tremendous pride.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Protests against Labour antisemitism Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

Rabbi Herschel Gluck, an orthodox rabbi who does extensive liaison work with other communities, last year had a briefing from the Metropolitan police. During the high holidays \u2013 when numerous Jews are on the streets \u2013 not one antisemitic incident was reported to the police.\n\nThere were no reported attacks, no abuse, not even anything serious on social media.\n\nMonitoring remains robust however. There are organisations collecting data on antisemitism which are well-funded by the Jewish community. There is the charity, the Community Security Trust (CST) which is probably the best established and most respected of these groups. There is also a relatively new organisation called the Campaign against Antisemitism.\n\nThe CST reveals that last year there were 1652 antisemitic incidents. However the vast majority of these consisted of abuse \u2013 much of it on social media. There were 123 physical assaults, most of which were non-serious. One of these was regarded as \u201cextreme\u201d \u2013 an incident which could potentially have led to grievous bodily harm.\n\nThis sort of behaviour is not acceptable, of course, but compared to the experiences of Muslims and black people in the UK, the levels of antisemitism are almost negligible.\n\nSo why is such a fuss being made? This is not because Jews are trying to \u201cweaponise\u201d antisemitism. There are obviously some Conservative Jews who are keen to make as much noise as possible, but more broadly, a lot of Jews do have a sincere sense that they are under attack. And they feel that by complaining about antisemitism, they are defending their identity and their community.\n\nStar of BBC show The Apprentice, Alan Sugar, makes very clear that he has no interest in Jewish practice. But he is at pains to state that he feels Jewish and he gives to organisations that defend jews. By paying money to fight antisemitism, he feels that he is maintaining his identity.\n\nWithin the Jewish community, there remains an enormous sense of insecurity. There is a widespread belief that antisemitism lurks just below the surface of most non-Jews. And in that context it is no surprise that many feel any attack on Israel may be linked to the idea that most people \u2013 in their hearts \u2013 harbour misgivings about the Jewish community in the UK.\n\nConversely, left wingers are very keen to attack Israel \u2013 even though there are many countries with worse records on human rights. The attacks are not simply about Israel\u2019s questionable record here, but because it is backed by the West. It has become a symbol of Western and American imperialism.\n\nFor a left-winger, attacking Israel is a mark of commitment. In the same way that any self-respecting left-winger in the seventies and eighties complained vigorously against South Africa, the target of choice these days is Israel.\n\nThis is not helped by the fact that Israelis politics, which used to be liberal and left-leaning, has taken a violent swing to the right.\n\nAfter that show of hands in a North London synagogue, I wondered if this sustained row about antisemitism on the left boiled down to a clash of identities: the left feel strongly they should be attacking Israel, and Jews feel that anyone attacking Israel must be antisemitic.\n\nObviously, this is not a great combination, but if we understand the dynamic at work, it does at least give us a better chance at finding a solution. If we don\u2019t, then the Labour Party will continue to steadily lose Jewish support and the Jewish community will end up being ever more closely identified with every move of whoever happens to be in government in Israel.", "description": "It\u2019s not easy to make sense of the current furore about antisemitism and the left.
