The longest-living former U.S. president just turned 95.", "language": "en", "text": "Now, Carter is 95. To help the low-key former chief executive celebrate his birthday on Tuesday, the Carter Center is inviting people all over the world to send him birthday messages.\n\nCarter has reached yet another milestone despite thinking he was on the verge of death just a few years earlier, after doctors discovered that cancer had spread to his brain.\n\nAD\n\nBorn on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Ga., the typically cheery and humble former Navy lieutenant has had a life of service. Before taking office as president, he served as a state senator in Georgia and as governor.\n\nAD\n\nHis presidency \u2014 remembered for the Camp David accords, the Iran hostage crisis and the creation of the Departments of Energy and Education \u2014 flamed out during the election of 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated him.\n\nAfter leaving the White House in 1981, Carter, then 56, and his wife, Rosalynn, returned to their hometown in southern Georgia. Yet another distinction: Carter has been a former American president longer than anyone.\n\nThe un-celebrity president: Jimmy Carter shuns riches, lives modestly in his Georgia hometown\n\nHe remains engaged in the causes and activities that matter most, the Carter Center\u2019s director of communications, Deanna Congileo, told The Post earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nHe participates in Carter Center programs in global peace and health and annual Habitat for Humanity builds, and he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, for work during and after his time in office. He also continues to teach Sunday school lessons and courses at Emory University.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBoth President and Mrs. Carter are determined to use their influence for as long as they can to make the world a better place. Their tireless resolve and heart have helped to improve life for millions of the world\u2019s poorest people,\u201d Congileo wrote in an email to The Post in March, as he surpassed Bush\u2019s record for longest-living president.\n\nIn 2015, Carter announced doctors had discovered a form of melanoma that spread to his brain.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just thought I had a few weeks left, but I was surprisingly at ease,\u201d Carter said at a news conference that August. \u201cI\u2019ve had an exciting and adventurous and gratifying existence.\u201d\n\nHe received his first radiation treatment at 90. Four months later, he was \u2014 remarkably \u2014 cancer-free.\n\nBush, the 41st president, died on Nov. 30. Carter attended the funeral in Washington, along with President Trump and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and, of course, Bush\u2019s son George W.\n\nAD\n\nCarter says he takes pride in having \u201calways told the truth.\u201d He also says he is proud that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u201ccomported themselves with dignity, talked about issues that matter and presented a vision for our nation,\u201d during the 2016 presidential election. Still, thinking back on more than 40 years, Carter told The Post last year that he \u201cregrets not doing more to unify the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHis 2016 message to the younger generation of voters was: \u201cStay engaged. Stay involved. And be sure to vote.\u201d\n\nLast month, at a Carter Center event, the former president, who voted for Sanders in Georgia\u2019s 2016 Democratic primary, said he is keeping \u201can open mind\u201d about the 2020 Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cOne of the major factors I will have in my mind is who can beat Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAt that same event, Carter was asked what it would take for him to run for president again. The questioner noted that Grover Cleveland had served two nonconsecutive terms in the late 19th century.\n\n\u201cI hope there\u2019s an age limit,\u201d Carter said with a big grin as he sat next to the former first lady.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, if I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don\u2019t believe I could undertake the duties that I experienced when I was president,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one thing, you have to be very flexible with your mind. You have to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately and then put them all together in a comprehensive way.\u201d\n\nCarter added that presidents \u201calso have to adopt new ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe things I faced just in foreign affairs, I don\u2019t think I could undertake them if I was 80 years old,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo 95 is out of the question. I\u2019m having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "In 2015, after melanoma spread to Carter's brain, \u201cI just thought I had a few weeks left,\" he said.
