Since then the game has been completely offline and unplayable, making everyone think what really happened to the game. We might have some answers for you.\n\nFortnite\n\nHow did it start?\n\nDuring a regular game session the meteor, which made its first appearance during the beginning of Season X (and was placed in the centre of the island) started doing something rather unusual. The meteor then slowly started destroying everything that was in the vicinity. This is around 2:00PM EST or 11:30PM IST.\n\nAfter that, players weren't able to do anything except see the meteor attack the surface over and over until it finally obliterated the ground and completely turned into a black hole that sucked everything in it, from location elements to players -- everything! Later all that was visible on the screen was the black hole.\n\nTwitter/@dyllieaug\n\nDon't Miss 1.3 K SHARES 16.2 K SHARES 8.7 K SHARES 2.7 K SHARES 3.2 K SHARES\n\nWhen players tried to log out and log in again, the game just showed an error stating 'Error! We are experiencing!' This screen was also being shown to new players who logged in that the time wanting to experience the wrath of the black hole.\n\nFortnite's Twitter had rung the bell\n\nA day before this catastrophe, Fortnite had tweeted 'The end is near.' After the destruction, Fortnite tweeted again, ' This is the end.' However, after this, Fornite went ahead and deleted all its previous tweets, including the aforementioned ones. Now the twitter handle just has a live video of the black hole.\n\nWhat about Fornite now?\n\nWell, if you were wondering this is the end of Fortnite, you couldn't be more wrong. Epic games has adopted a rather dramatic approach to completely revamping its game and getting something new onboard for its players. We can surely expect some new maps along with some cooler in-game features to make us love Fortnite more than we did before.\n\nWhat about the in-game purchases?\n\nIf you were one of the many who have made a bunch of in-game purchases, rest assured, those aren't going anywhere. Sony has made an official statement regarding that says, 'Please be assured that your inventory items and V-Bucks are secure during the Fortnite Blackout. For any other Fortnite questions, please visit http://help.epicgames.com.'\n\nWhile there is no update for what new Fortnite plans to bring for its players, one thing is for sure-- they definitely know how to put a show!
