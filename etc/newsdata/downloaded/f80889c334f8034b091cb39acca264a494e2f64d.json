China slows and the United States slows \u2013 and they all have their headwinds \u2013 that makes it not as good for the others who deal with those countries.\"\n\nMr Dalio made the comments the day before China released figures showing its economy grew at 6 per cent in the third quarter of 2019 compared with a year earlier, its slowest pace in about 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, investors expect the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates when it meets at the end of the month in response to growing recessionary risks amid faltering business investment and worrying signs that consumers are beginning to waver.\n\nThat creates this big sag more than it's likely to create a big bust. \u2014 Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates\n\nUS central bank officials are also concerned about the deteriorating global outlook. The International Monetary Fund last week lowered its forecast for global growth in 2019 to 3 per cent, the lowest rate since the financial crisis.\n\nThe Washington-based fund also warned that companies had responded to ultra-low interest rates and plentiful liquidity by taking on levels of debt that risked becoming a $US19 trillion ($27.7 trillion) timebomb in the event of another global recession.\n\nGlum global outlook\n\nIn it's half-yearly update on the state of global financial markets, the IMF said almost 40 per cent of the corporate debt in eight leading countries \u2013 the US, China, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 would be impossible to service from corporate cash flows if there was a downturn half as serious as that of a decade ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IMF warned that credit spreads in bond markets \u2013 the compensation demanded by investors for taking on extra risk \u2013 appeared to be too low, given the state of the global economy.\n\n\"The search for yield in a prolonged low-interest-rate environment has led to stretched valuations in risky asset markets around the globe, raising the possibility of sharp, sudden adjustments in financial conditions,\" the IMF report warns.\n\nFor his part, Mr Dalio was doubtful a debt crisis was likely in an environment where ultra-low interest rates kept a lid on debt servicing costs.\n\nStill, he noted that while the dynamic which saw companies continuing to pile on debt had almost reached its limits, companies would still be left saddled with large debt burdens.\n\n\"So that creates this big sag, more than it's likely to create a big bust,\" he said.\n\nIt's clear investors are becoming more fearful that asset prices could sag, dragged down by the combined weight of large debt burdens and stuttering economic activity.\n\nInvestors don't trust inflated IPOs\n\nAlthough US corporate bond yields remain low, there are growing strains in junk-rated debt compared to higher-quality corporate bonds, as investors worry about the rising risk of defaults should the economy sour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd investors' increased skittishness is even more evident in the two high profile initial public offerings (IPOs) that have had to be pulled in the past few weeks.\n\nIn the US, WeWork's IPO was slated to be one of the biggest share market debuts of the year,\n\nInstitutional investors, however, balked at the rich $US47 billion valuation and were alarmed by the cash-burning business model of the office space company.\n\nIncreasingly, investors are questioning the sky-high valuations that have been slapped on technology startups, given the tide of capital that has poured into Silicon Valley as venture capitalists have hunted for new founder-led companies that might replicate the success of Facebook or Amazon.com.\n\nOf course, there are good reasons for investors' increased wariness. Back in May, the ride-sharing company Uber became the biggest Silicon Valley offering in years when it launched with a $US82.4 billion valuation.\n\nBut Uber's shares closed last week at $US32.06, down some 30 per cent from the $US45 they were priced at in the IPO.\n\nAnd investor misgivings over WeWork's valuation have been vindicated by reports the company is now scrambling to put together a rescue deal for the group that could value its equity at $US8 billion or less.\n\nAlong with growing cynicism overvaluations, investors have also become nervous about placing too much faith in the ability of startup founders to adapt to the higher corporate governance standards demanded of publicly listed companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cult of the founder was shaken after Uber's co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick was forced to resign in the wake of a series of scandals.\n\nAnd WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann resigned last month after some of the company's biggest investors lost faith in him following the dramatic collapse of the IPO.\n\nLocal investors displayed a similar diffidence when it came to the $3.2 billion float of consumer finance company Latitude Financial.\n\nThe deal, which was to have been the biggest IPO to hit the market this year, was abruptly pulled last week as investors balked at what they saw as an excessive valuation being put on the business.\n\nRisk appetite follows growth\n\nOf course, local investors have their own reasons for caution when it comes to private equity-backed floats. They still remember the disappointing performances of department store group Myer, the chicken giant Inghams Group and the retailer Dick Smith, which collapsed three years ago.\n\nThere's also no doubt some investors were concerned about the unshakable self-belief of Latitude chief executive Ahmed Fahour, and the generous financial reward he stood to pocket from a successful float.\n\nOn top of a potential total annual salary of $4.84 million and shares worth about $28 million \u2013 which were purchased using a $17.5 million interest-free loan from the company in addition to his own funds \u2013 Mr Fahour was set to earn a bonus of $22.5 million if the company's listing was successful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's probable that in a more buoyant, bullish environment, investors would have happily set all such qualms aside.
