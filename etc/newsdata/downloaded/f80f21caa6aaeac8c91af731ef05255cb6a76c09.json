The SDF - a group dominated by the YPG - fought alongside the US against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.\n\nThere has been growing international concern about possible war crimes committed by Turkey and allied militias during the offensive.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mike Pence announces Turkish ceasefire in Syria\n\nAmnesty International says it has gathered \"damning evidence\" of war crimes and other violations by their side and the United Nations has called on Turkey to investigate the allegations.\n\nUnconfirmed reports have also emerged that Turkish-allied forces have used white phosphorus, a chemical weapon which causes bad burns, in Syria.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was aware of the claims and was gathering evidence.\n\nWhat is the latest with the ceasefire?\n\nThe pause in hostilities followed talks in the Turkish capital Ankara between Mr Erdogan and Mr Pence on Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump celebrated news of the ceasefire and claimed the pause in hostilities would lead to \"millions of lives\" being saved. He remained optimistic in comments made on Friday, despite reports the ceasefire was failing to hold.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump on Turkish and Kurdish forces: \"Sometimes you have to let them fight a little bit\"\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali tweeted on Friday morning to allege that Turkey was breaking the ceasefire near Ras al-Ain.\n\n\"Despite the agreement to halt the fighting, air and artillery attacks continue to target the positions of fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital,\" he wrote.\n\nPresident Erdogan dismissed reports of continuing clashes on Friday as \"misinformation\" but international news media recorded explosions in Ras al-Ain during the morning.\n\nThe SOHR said Saturday that the SDF had not yet started to pull back from the border region.\n\nLocal Kurdish media are reporting that five civilians and 13 Kurdish fighters in Ras-al-Ain have been killed since the ceasefire began, but the BBC has not been able to independently confirm that.", "description": "US Vice-President Mike Pence says the pause in operations will allow Kurdish-led forces to withdraw.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4D25/production/_109294791_057396241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
