Goldman said earlier this month it was cooperating with the Justice Department and other government and regulatory investigations.\n\n\"The firm is also engaged in discussions with certain government and regulatory authorities with respect to potential resolution of their investigations,\" the bank said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Oct. 15.\n\nMalaysian and U.S. investigators have said at least $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by Low and other high-level officials of the fund and their associates.\n\nLast year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman over its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. Prosecutors in August filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at its units.
