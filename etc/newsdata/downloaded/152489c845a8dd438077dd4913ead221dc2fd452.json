They have to hold them accountable.\n\n\u201cIf they can do that, then maybe these kind of incidents will stop happening.\u201d\n\nFahad\u2019s death has caused outrage across the country, prompting protests this week by students at the universities of Dhaka, Chittagong and Rajshahi, and demands for authorities to clampdown on political violence on campuses.\n\nHuman rights groups have condemned groups such as BCL, which have been accused of beating student protesters and stifling debate. Last year, university and school students who had launched a protest calling for greater road safety were beaten with sticks and machetes in attacks widely blamed on the Awami League and its youth wing.\n\nAuthorities took no action against those carrying out the violence, according to Human Rights Watch, but instead detained the protesting students.\n\nA first year student from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) in Dhaka, where Fahad was studying, said students did not feel safe in halls of residences. \u201cWe never speak freely,\u201d he said.\n\nFahad was in his second year at Buet, the most competitive university in the country, where he was studying electrical and electronic engineering.\n\nFriends said he was attacked because he had recently written a Facebook post criticising deals signed during Hasina\u2019s recent visit to New Delhi. These included controversial deals on water sharing and on exporting petroleum gas to India, which many argued were not in the country\u2019s interests.\n\nAccording to an autopsy report, he died of severe internal bleeding from beatings with blunt objects such as cricket game stumps or sticks.\n\n\u201cFahad was a very simple person. He had a naive mind. My son, he wanted to go abroad for higher study,\u201d Ullah said.\n\nAmnesty International South Asia described his murder as a \u201chorrific crime that must be investigated immediately\u201d.\n\n\u201cAbrar was only exercising his peaceful right to freedom of expression in his Facebook posts criticising the government,\u201d the human rights group said in a statement.\n\nHasina has promised justice to Fahad\u2019s family. At least 11 students have reportedly been arrested in connection with his murder.\n\nOn Wednesday, hundreds of students and teachers took part in a silent procession at Buet. A second student at the university, who also wished to be anonymous, said that the humiliation and beatings of students had been repeatedly ignored by Buet\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cThe ragging [bullying and beating] has always been a massive problem. For many past incidents, we reported them to authorities. But they never took any serious action. And this was a result of their negligence,\u201d the student said.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators never thought they\u2019d face any consequences,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that someone has to get killed to bring the issue under spotlight.\u201d", "description": "Abrar Fahad, 22, was allegedly targeted after he criticised the government in a Facebook post", "authors": ["Redwan Ahmed", "Rebecca Ratcliffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0253bd1ec7618e13be2ceb76eaeadcc38544754a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=853ff8bb77db6a712b8dd39fdc5c82d6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
