I said a word I should not have said, and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\u201d Sanders said in the interview, at which he was joined by his wife, Jane Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign. I love doing rallies, and I love doing town meetings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders, 78, added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this thing.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, he had struck a different note. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d he told reporters. Asked to clarify what he meant, Sanders replied, \u201cProbably not doing four rallies a day.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has yet to say how severe a heart attack Sanders suffered or what, if any, lifestyle changes his physicians have recommended. The senator said Tuesday he will release his health records at \u201cthe appropriate time\u201d but declined to specify when that would happen. His campaign earlier committed to releasing them before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.\n\nSanders was taken to a Las Vegas hospital with chest pains Oct. 1, a Tuesday. It was not until the following Friday, after he was released from the hospital, that his campaign released an advisory from his doctors stating that he had suffered a heart attack.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the preceding days, aides had provided limited information about his health, saying that doctors inserted two stents to treat an artery blockage. During that period, aides did not respond yes or no when asked specifically whether Sanders had suffered a heart attack.\n\nIn the interview with NBC, Sanders dismissed the notion that he was not transparent enough with the public.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what people think campaigns are \u2014 you know, we\u2019re dealing with all kinds of doctors, and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the first thing that we\u2019re trying to do is understand what\u2019s going on and not run to the New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes. You know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders said on the night he had chest pains, he underwent \u201ca few tests\u201d before a doctor told him, \u201cyou\u2019re having a heart event.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019s Harry Smith asked him to clarify \u2014 had the doctor told him he was having a heart attack?\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Sanders, who said he \u201ccould not believe\u201d what was happening at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders told reporters it was \u201cdumb\u201d of him to ignore symptoms that might have foretold the heart attack.\n\n\u201cI, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders\u2019s recovery has forced a collision of needs for him and his campaign: to promote a healthy image of a candidate already struggling to replicate his 2016 success, while at the same time giving him time to recover.\n\nAD\n\nProminent friends and supporters of Sanders said Monday that he should cut back on his aggressive pace, which has surpassed his top rivals. His allies also said he should speak openly about his heart attack when he returns to the campaign \u2014 to show a personal side he has long been hesitant to reveal.\n\nAD\n\nThe NBC interview released Wednesday, conducted at Sanders\u2019s home in Burlington, Vt., appeared to be one part of his campaign\u2019s effort to confront the unusual challenge of keeping a national campaign chugging along with its candidate absent from the trail.\n\nThe campaign has sought to demonstrate progress and action in different ways. On Wednesday, it announced it had surpassed 1 million attempted voter contacts in Nevada, a key early state. Officials also said the campaign had booked 1,500 supporter events for October, including door-knocking, phone banks and other volunteer initiatives.\n\nAD\n\nBut it was unclear whether those activities would keep supporters energized and quell the questions about age and health that continue to loom over Sanders, the oldest candidate in the race.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has strongly hinted that next Tuesday\u2019s televised debate near Columbus, Ohio, will be his reentry into the campaign. The debate will be one of the highest-stakes appearances of Sanders\u2019s decades-long political career, a three-hour test of his physical capabilities for one of the most demanding jobs in the world.\n\nAD\n\nMillions of Americans will be watching, if the ratings from earlier debates are any indication. He will be jumping back into the race on prime-time television exactly two weeks after his health scare, with 11 of his competitors standing on the same stage. Sanders said his cardiologist has assured him that standing for three hours will be \u201cno issue.\u201d\n\nSanders, who arrived in Burlington over the weekend, has made periodic trips outside his home this week. He left for a walk Monday and made a trip to see a cardiologist Tuesday. As he has come and gone, he has spoken to reporters staked out near his house, sometimes cracking light jokes.\n\nChelsea Janes contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The senator from Vermont on Wednesday defended his decision to wait days before disclosing he suffered a heart attack and said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters this week that for health reasons he would cut back on his aggressive campaign schedule.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MdqaFR2VAdJgxfD-lwjhI7VvxvQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DVUG5DHK3MI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
