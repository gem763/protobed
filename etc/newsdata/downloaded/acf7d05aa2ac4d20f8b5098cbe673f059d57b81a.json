That changed everything for me,' she revealed in an interview with People that was included in its Women Changing The World 2019 issue.\n\nNow inspired to make a difference for herself and others, the 32-year-old actress decided to contact an attorney to press charges against her abuser, but she quickly learned that the statute of limitations on her case had already run out; she was told that there was nothing that she could do legally but 'try to change the law.'\n\nAnd that's exactly what she set out to do.\n\nWood teamed up with other domestic violence survivors and worked alongside legislators and lawmakers to draft the Phoenix Act.\n\nNot only does the bill extend the statute of limitations to press charges from three years to five years, it also expands training requirements for police officers to help them properly identify survivors of domestic violence without causing additional harm.\n\nCourageous: Wood, 32, went public with her domestic violence nightmare, when she realized her abuser had hurt someone else\n\n'I am a domestic violence survivor, but I didn't know that I was a domestic violence survivor until many years after the events took place mainly because we've created a culture of silence and shame around domestic violence,' she explained.\n\nHer initial goal in going public with her story, and forging ahead with the Phoenix Act, was to make sure that what happened to herself would never happened to anybody else. She was also motivated to start a dialogue 'that we so desperately need, because it's a global epidemic, and it affects men and women and children.'\n\nThe North Carolina native named the legislation the Phoenix Act because she believes people can 'rise out of of the ashes' after traumatic events.\n\n'I do believe that you can come back from tragedy, sometimes even stronger than you were before.'\n\nOctober is Domestic Violence Awareness Month.", "description": "Evan Rachel Wood transformed her domestic violence trauma with the passage of a California bill that extends the time victims can come forward and demand justice.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/04/19570722-0-image-a-30_1570766096059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
