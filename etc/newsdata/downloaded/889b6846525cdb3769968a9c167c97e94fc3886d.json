A positive index reading means activity is expanding.\n\nEconomists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected an index reading of 3.0.\n\nThe New York Fed said 27% of respondents reported business conditions improved from a month earlier while 25% said they had worsened.\n\nThe new orders index fell three points to 3.5 and the shipments index fell four points to 5.8, its lowest level in nearly three years.\n\nManufacturers were less optimistic about the coming months as the index for future business conditions fell 12 points to 13.7. The indexes for future new orders and shipments also moved lower, the report said.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 16, 2019 08:51 ET (12:51 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
