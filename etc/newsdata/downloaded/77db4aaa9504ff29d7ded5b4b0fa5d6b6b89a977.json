(Diego Diaz)\n\nThe seeds of dissent were visible almost immediately.\n\nSoccer officials had notified the Timbers Army, the main fan organization for the team in Portland, Ore., that the anti-fascist symbol its members had been waving on a giant banner in the north end of the stadium would no longer be permitted at games on the eve of the season earlier this year. The fan group was not happy, releasing a lengthy critique of Major League Soccer\u2019s new rules, and working with team officials for months in meetings to change the rule.\n\nBut what began as an internal dispute between the league, the Timbers front office, and the fan group has morphed into a full rebellion in recent weeks.\n\nThe symbol, a re-purposed icon from an anti-fascist group, the Iron Front from Nazi-era Germany, has now popped up at stadiums around the country. The MLS ban of it has drawn harsh coverage from left-leaning media outlets. And a recent Timbers game became the venue for a nearly stadium wide protest, that saw two rival fan groups join in silence for more than a half-hour before openly flouting the symbol\u2019s ban.\n\nHow did a simple game \u2014 the beautiful game \u2014 become the setting for such a heated political struggle?\n\nThe Timbers Army\n\nThe Portland Timbers were incorporated into the MLS in 2010, part of a long wave of expansion for the league that continues today as the sport\u2019s popularity grows.\n\nThey have attracted a particularly active fan base, embodied most feverishly by the Timbers Army, a supporters group of some 5,200 paying members that makes the stadium\u2019s North End their raucous home every game.\n\nThe league has made relatively lenient rules in its stadiums a point of pride as it seeks to embrace a more participatory style of fandom that marks soccer in Europe and South America, where the game is the strongest. Compared to many football or baseball games, where signs are often heavily restricted, MLS games are marked by colorful signs, drummers, and gargantuan banners called tifos, which were originally pioneered by fan groups overseas.\n\nBut European-style fan groups often have deeper cultural or political connections, reflective of a different idea about fandom that exists overseas. There are fan clubs aligned with local political groups, unions and causes \u2014 socialist-aligned clubs and others that lean toward right-wing politics, or even overt fascism. All of which run against the deeply American notion that sports should be free from politics, despite the national anthem before the game, the military jets flying overheard, the overt displays of nationalism and patriotism.\n\nFor Portland, a famously liberal enclave that has increasingly become a staging ground for clashes between the far-right and anti-fascist activists \u2014 the city\u2019s political leanings have been reflected by the fans.\n\n\n\nPortland Timbers fans wait for the team's MLS soccer match against the Seattle Sounders, Friday, Aug. 23, 2019, in Portland, Ore. (Serena Morones/The Oregonian via AP)\n\nIn response to what fans say was a noticeable uptick in hate incidents in the city in 2017, the Timbers Army began to fly the Iron Front\u2019s logo, three arrows down and to the left, in Timbers\u2019 colors, as a banner at the game. The Iron Front was a political group of anti-fascist and anti-communist activists in Nazi Germany that was banned in 1933.\n\nTeam officials eventually asked the Timbers Army to take down the banner last year, but the fan group moved it to a flagpole instead, a compromise that seemed to be tolerated, Stephan Lewis, a co-chair for community outreach for the nonprofit atop the Timbers Army, told The Post.\n\nThen the league told the group about the new code of conduct coming, in the offseason.\n\nNo political signage\n\nThe league said it began to update its code of conduct that year while consulting with its clubs to determine the appropriate balance between encouraging its fans while tamping down on some of the overt politics that has divided the country so bitterly in recent years.\n\nPolitical signage, including the Iron Front symbol, is generally accepted on T-shirts, hats or other personal items, the MLS says. But the league ruled that the symbol would not be permitted on large signs and banners that could be seen around the stadium or by audiences watching on television because it was inherently political.\n\nThey gave a simple reason: its use by the loose collection of hard-line anti-fascist protesters, Antifa, who have made it a mission to meet right-wing and supremacist demonstrators when they show up in cities around the country, to sometimes violent results.\n\n\u201cDespite its origins dating back to fascism opposition in World War II-era Germany and elsewhere, today most of the broader public are unaware of the Iron Front and its historic meaning,\u201d the Timbers said in a statement explaining the decision. \u201cInstead it is widely associated with its frequent use by Antifa, often in the context of violence at protests or counter protests. The Iron Front symbol is clearly different than a national symbol like the American flag, that some have tried to argue has been misappropriated by certain groups.\u201d\n\n[Far-right and antifa groups both claim victory at Portland]\n\n\n\nA banner is partially covered before an MLS soccer match between the Portland Timbers and the Seattle Sounders on Friday, Aug. 23, 2019, in Portland, Ore. Major League Soccer recently instituted a policy that bans political displays at matches. (Serena Morones/The Oregonian via AP)\n\nOutcry\n\nThe decision flew under the radar for months after the season began in March, delayed perhaps by the renovations that prevented the team\u2019s home stadium from opening until June.\n\nBut in July, tensions about the symbol started to trickle up to the surface.\n\nA fan group for the Seattle Sounders team, the Emerald City Supporters, was formally warned by the team\u2019s front office about a large banner with the Iron Front logo that was displayed at a game. That story drew a small flurry of press.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN soon thereafter, MLS Commissioner Don Garber was asked about the challenges of determining what was political in an era when existential questions about race, sexuality and identity drive the conversation in Washington. Is it possible to be apolitical in this environment?\n\n\u201cWe basically have created a policy that takes any decision-making off the table,\u201d Garber said. \u201cOur stadiums are not environments where our fans should be expressing political views because you then are automatically opening yourself up to allowing counterviews. Then we're getting into a situation which is unmanageable and really not why the vast, vast majority of fans go to games.\u201d\n\nThe ban began to draw more criticism, drawing harsh rebukes in publications like Deadspin and the Portland Mercury.\n\n[At Deadspin, can the cool kids of the sports Internet become its moral authority?]\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there is never an absence of politics. You either allow anti-fascist imagery or you don\u2019t, but either decision speaks volumes about the values and priorities of your organization,\u201d Mercury reporter Abe Asher wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cIf certain other supporters are uncomfortable with anti-fascist displays in stadiums, they should take a hard look at where exactly their discomfort stems from or find somewhere else to spend their time.\u201d\n\n\n\nA sign is held up before an MLS soccer match between the Portland Timbers and the Seattle Sounders on Friday, Aug. 23, 2019, in Portland, Ore.

Major League Soccer recently instituted a policy that bans political displays at matches. (Serena Morones/The Oregonian via AP)\n\nRebellious displays of the Iron Front symbol began to spread to other teams, popping up in the stands in D.C., Orlando, Oklahoma, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and beyond, prompting the hashtag #AUnitedFront.\n\nAnd publications, including Fox News, were taking note.\n\n\u201cAntifa\u2019s \u2018Iron Front\u2019 symbol banned by Major League Soccer\u2019s Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders,\u201d the publication reported as news in August, months after the ban had gone into effect.\n\nA silent protest gets loud\n\nLewis, of the Timbers Army, said the group had tried discussing the use of the symbol with the Timbers front office throughout the season, but the talks failed to yield a compromise.\n\nBut they did not want to let the issue go, saying that the symbol and its cause was worth fighting for.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s ultimately important to us is that we create a safe place for all people,\u201d he said. \u201cBy using the term political and applying that to the Iron Front image, it\u2019s sending a dog whistle.\u201d\n\nSo they came up with a plan with their rivals, the Emerald City Supporters and another Seattle fan club, Gorilla FC, to engage in a stadium wide protest when the Sounders came to Portland for a match on Aug. 23.\n\nReminder:\n\n- The work continues tomorrow! 930am.

Then the stands would explode into an English adaptation of an anti-fascist anthem from Italy, \u201cBella Ciao.\u201d\n\nVideo from the stands captured the protest, including the moment the stands erupted in noise and cheer after the 33rd minute. Many supporters waved flags with the Iron Front symbol in open defiance of the code of conduct.\n\n[Sound of silence: Sounders, Timbers fans go quiet in protest at MLS match]\n\nUnique night in Soccer City #AUnitedFront with the sound of silence for the first 33-minutes #RCTID #PORvSEA pic.twitter.com/kITi5sJD6r \u2014 Nick Krupke (@NickKrupke) August 24, 2019\n\nSimilar protests took place at the Portland Thorns game in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League two days later.\n\nThe fans have drawn support from some members of the teams. Both teams took pictures with small banners affirming their \u201canti-fascist\u201d and \u201canti-racist\u201d bona fides.\n\nZarek Valentin, a defender on the Timbers, showed up at the game with the Iron Front symbol on his shirt, as did Thorns forward Christine Sinclair.\n\nBen Carrington, a sociology and journalism professor at USC and the author of multiple books about cultural, racial and political aspects of sports, said he saw the protests as the result of two main factors.\n\nHe said that the idea that there was a line between sports and politics in the United States has been crumbling for years, noting NBA player protests about police shootings, protests during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games and the push for pay equality on the U.S. Women\u2019s national soccer team.\n\n\u201cThe line that many try to draw between sports and politics has now been completely blurred,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always an artificial line.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the MLS unique, was the fan element of the protests, he said, saying that the culture of soccer, with its vibrant fan groups \u2014 many of which are linked to politics, both left and right, in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to soccer there is a fan base for activism that\u2019s been there for many years in many countries. There is a bit of irony or hypocrisy on part of MLS - part of what it\u2019s trying to do is import robust fan cultures we see in Mexico, England, and Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can understand why organizations want to take a stand and put the genie back in the bottle, but I think it\u2019s too late. What\u2019s a political symbol? Is the rainbow flag, for gay right and LGBT a political symbol? For many people it is.\u201d\n\nThe league declined to say how many people have been or will be disciplined for displaying the Iron Front symbol at the game last week.\n\nBut it said it stood by its code of conduct and the interpretation that the symbol was political.\n\n\u201cWe support \u2026 basic human rights and values of inclusion and diversity - rainbow flags are an example of that,\u201d Mark Abbott, the president and deputy commissioner of the MLS told The Post. \u201cSigns that condemn racism are an example of that. Signs that condemn fascism. The disagreement here is not over any of those things \u2014 it\u2019s over the signs or a banner that include association with Antifa, an outside organization. That we don\u2019t believe should be in our stadiums.\u201d\n\nLewis told The Post that the Timbers Army as well as one of the supporters clubs from Seattle had been warned by the league, but that they weren\u2019t going to give up on the symbol.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always kept the door open for them to change their mind on this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t? We have other options.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAre you smarter than a jellyfish?
