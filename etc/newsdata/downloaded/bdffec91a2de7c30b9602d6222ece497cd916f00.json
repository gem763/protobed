IBM had bid for the contract but has been eliminated from the competition.\n\nEsper's son's role is not related to IBM's pursuit of JEDI, she added.\n\nThe JEDI contract is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon's information technology systems and has been mired in conflict of interest allegations involving a former Pentagon employee who worked on the contract and for Amazon.com Inc.\n\nThe Pentagon put the contract on hold in August after President Donald Trump said his administration was examining Amazon's bid following complaints from other technology companies.\n\nFor example, Oracle Corp lobbied aggressively and expressed concerns about the award process for the contract.\n\nOracle has since been eliminated from the competition, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp as finalists.\n\nSome technology companies were also concerned that a single award would give the winner an unfair advantage in follow-on work. The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.\n\nThe Pentagon spent around $38 billion on information technology projects in fiscal 2019, and though only $6.5 billion was earmarked for cloud projects, the segment has been growing at around 30% a year, according to analysts at Jefferies Group LLC.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio, Tom Brown and Lincoln Feast)", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud computing deal because of a possible conflict of interest, a move that could further delay the contract-award process.
