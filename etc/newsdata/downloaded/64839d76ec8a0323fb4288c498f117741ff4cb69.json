Thank you so much for your support and understanding. xx\"\n\nFans who had traveled long distances to be at the show posted well-wishes to the prolific entertainer, whose career has spanned 50 years.\n\n\"SO SAD,\" wrote one fan. \"Heard the news when I checked into my hotel. But I'll be back in March.\"\n\n\"We hope you recover soon Elton! Get well soon dear can't wait to see you next year,\" another fan posted.\n\nThe \"Rocket Man\" singer is scheduled to perform 300 shows over a three-year period on five continents as his farewell to touring so he can spend more time with his husband, David Furnish, and their two young sons, Zachary, 8, and Elijah, 6.\n\nThis is not the first time John has endured a scare. In 2017, he suffered a serious infection following surgery for prostate cancer, which he discusses in his autobiography, \"Me,\" published earlier this month. The book also covers his struggle with addiction and eventual sobriety.\n\nThere's no doubt that the singer is a survivor, and his Indianapolis concert date has already been rescheduled for March 26, 2020. John is scheduled to perform next in Nashville on Oct. 28 and Memphis on Oct. 30.\n\nWe're wishing Sir Elton a speedy recovery!", "description": "Sir Elton John apologized to fans for postponing his concert in Indianapolis on Saturday, saying he is \"extremely unwell.\"", "authors": ["Ronnie Koenig"], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_43/1499425/elton-john-today-main-191027_443e08256101c73757461929b7b2cb9a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
