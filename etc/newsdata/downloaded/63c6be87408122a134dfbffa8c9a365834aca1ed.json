It may also come sooner. But regardless of the timing, RBC Capital Markets sees compelling reasons why another investors should remain on standby for another pullback by Dec. 31.\n\nThe team led by Lori Calvasina laid out their concerns in a recent note to clients. Their case is broadly threefold: history suggests a pullback is coming, there are risks aplenty for the market, and valuation is extremely stretched.\n\nStarting with the historical evidence, Calvasina notes that the rally in stocks since the market's low on Dec. 24 has been similar to the recoveries from three growth scares since the financial crisis: in 2010, 2011, and 2016.\n\nAll of these market recoveries suffered between two and four sell-offs, ranging in severity from a 4% pullback to a 10% correction. There have been three such episodes so far in 2019, \"suggesting that another would not be all that unusual,\" Calvasina said.\n\nBut these historical parallels don't lay out the full evidence. There is a bevy of risks \u2014 some already impacting markets and others on the horizon \u2014 that could serve as negative catalysts in the coming weeks.\n\nTo name a few:\n\nInvestors are already grappling with the global economic slowdown and the risk that it spreads to the US and causes a recession.\n\nAny economic data that shows cracks in consumer spending or the labor market would intensify this risk.\n\nThe third-quarter earnings season \u2014 off to a strong start with the banks \u2014 is still pending releases from the all-important big-tech and consumer discretionary companies.\n\nThere's anxiety concerning the 2020 elections, particularly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren leads the pack in the Democratic party.\n\nRead more: The world's most accurate economic forecaster sees a 'prolonged global slowdown' on the horizon \u2014 and warns it can only be narrowly avoided\n\nMost metrics say stocks are overvalued\n\nAll these potential catalysts are confronting a market that is overvalued by most major metrics.\n\n\"S&P 500 valuations are still extremely stretched, taking a clear turn for the worse on forward P/E recently,\" Calvasina said.\n\nThe S&P 500 forward price-to-earnings ratio hit a new high relative to its global counterpart before the fourth-quarter sell-off in 2019. It is now 18.6 \u2014 a 1.8 standard deviation from the mean, above its long-term average, and higher than every other major region in the world, Calvasina said.\n\nTo consolidate all the additional valuation gauges, RBC created an S&P 500 Combo Model which takes into account 17 different ones.\n\n\"At 1.16 standard deviations as of October 16th, this gauge remained above average and was close to the peaks of the current cycle,\" Calvasina said.\n\nShe added that it was in a range historically associated with 12-month forward returns in the low single digits.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\n\nCalvasina further observed that the relative valuation between US stocks continue to look overvalued relative to the rest of the world.\n\nUltimately, she is still bullish on the stock market. Her S&P 500 year-end target of 2,950 implies a roughly 18% gain for the year. She is overweight large-cap industrials, financials, utilities, and real estate.\n\nBut she's also prepared for a lot of zigzagging on the way to that target \u2014 and is advising clients to buckle up too.", "description": "Investors face a bevy of imminent risks and should remain on high alert, according to RBC Capital Markets.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/542426c969beddf36797c78a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
