(AP) - Nebraska began preparing for this week\u2019s game at unbeaten Minnesota as if sophomore Noah Vedral would start at quarterback in place of Adrian Martinez.\n\nMartinez limped to the sideline at the end of the third quarter of the Cornhuskers\u2019 win against Northwestern on Saturday and had ice on his left knee when he came out of the medical tent. He didn\u2019t practice Monday.\n\nCoach Scott Frost, as per his policy, did not disclose the nature of Martinez\u2019s injury. If Vedral starts, freshman Luke McCaffrey would be the backup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the week develop and see where Adrian is, but we feel good about it if we have to go with Noah and Luke,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThose guys got a bunch of reps today, and they\u2019ve been repping a lot all through the fall. If it ends up being them, we\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nTop receiver JD Spielman also left the Northwestern game with a knee injury in the second half, and Frost offered no update on him other than to say, \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nVedral quarterbacked the Huskers\u2019 last four series against Northwestern, and his first 11 plays netted just 17 yards. On the final possession, he hit Wan\u2019Dale Robinson with a 32-yard pass and ran twice for 13 yards to set up Lane McCallum\u2019s 25-yard field goal as time ran out for a 13-10 win.\n\nThe Huskers (4-2, 2-1 Big Ten) will be trying to beat the Gophers (5-0, 2-0) for the second year in a row.\n\nAsked about the prospect of starting, Vedral said, \u201cIt would be a lot of fun Saturday night. Nothing changes. The preparation is the same. We\u2019re focused on what they do. I\u2019ll be ready if that\u2019s my time.\u201d\n\nOffensive lineman Matt Farniok said nothing changes if Vedral is the quarterback.\n\n\u201cTheir job is to be ready no matter what happens, so if Adrian (goes) down, it\u2019s next man up,\u201d Farniok said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in a drop-off. He stepped up Saturday, he took control and did a fantastic job. He did exactly what we expect of him.\u201d\n\nVedral grew up 30 miles from Lincoln, in Wahoo, and has deep ties to the program.\n\nHis father, Mike Vedral, was a tight end from 1990-92, and three of his uncles also played for the Huskers. Jon Vedral was a wingback from 1994-96 and was a teammate of Frost\u2019s. Mark Vedral was a linebacker from 1998-2001. Matt Turman was a backup quarterback from 1994-96 and, as a walk-on, helped keep the \u201894 national championship season alive when he was the emergency starter in win at Kansas State.\n\nNoah was a star three-sport athlete at Bishop Neumann High but received no recruiting interest from the previous Nebraska staff.\n\n\u201cIt might have frustrated my uncles, my family, more so than me,\u201d he said.\n\nNoah had impressed Frost at a camp at Oregon when Frost was the Ducks\u2019 offensive coordinator. He accepted a scholarship offer from Frost when Frost was head coach at Central Florida, and he served as backup to McKenzie Milton on the 2017 team that went 13-0. He appeared in eight games as a freshman and transferred to Nebraska after Frost was hired in December 2017.\n\nVedral\u2019s only quarterback appearances for Nebraska before last week were against Bethune-Cookman in 2018 and Northern Illinois on Sept. 14.\n\n\u201cYou can look at him and tell he has that swagger,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI love that about him. He can make all the reads, he can make all the throws, and he\u2019s confident.\u201d\n\nFrost said he originally recruited Noah to UCF because he knew his family and liked his athleticism, particularly his speed and passing ability.\n\n\u201cWe saw something in him, and he hasn\u2019t disappointed us,\u201d Frost said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good player. If it is his turn to play on Saturday, I\u2019ll feel great about it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nebraska began preparing for this week's game at unbeaten Minnesota as if sophomore Noah Vedral would start at quarterback in place of Adrian Martinez.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/ailing_nebraska_football_18194_c0-159-3805-2377_s1770x1032.jpg?0aca76273d303491048b9ae10cc4583cb952976a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
