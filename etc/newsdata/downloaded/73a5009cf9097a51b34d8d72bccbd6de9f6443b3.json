And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state\u2019s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nTrump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it. With the impeachment inquiry intensifying and congressional Republicans increasingly vocal in their criticism of the president, the elections give Trump the opportunity to demonstrate his political strength and shift a narrative that\u2019s turned sharply against him.\n\nBut the offensive isn\u2019t without risk: Though all three races are in Trump-friendly states, Democrats have a decent shot in at least two of them. A Republican loss in any of the elections could give the president\u2019s detractors ammunition to argue that he\u2019s politically weakened as he heads into a treacherous 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cMississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana are states where Republicans can win races for governor. Those would be big momentum wins for President Trump heading into 2020, but in the unlikely event we lose in all those states it would clearly be a troubling sign that the president would have to overcome,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member and the nephew of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump has been quizzing aides and allies on the three contests and been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about Bevin\u2019s reelection fight. He also speaks regularly with Bevin, a longtime ally and frequent visitor to the White House.\n\nKentucky Gov.

The RNC, which works closely with the president's team, is expected to spend millions on a get-out-the-vote effort across the three battlegrounds. Chris Carr, the Trump campaign's political director and a Louisiana native, has become increasingly involved in the state\u2019s gubernatorial contest.\n\nYet none are sure bets for the president. Republicans face formidable candidates in each state \u2014 and especially in Louisiana, where popular Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking reelection. Bevin is one of the least popular governors in the country. And in Mississippi, Republican nominee Tate Reeves, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has been criticized for his lackluster campaign skills and is recovering from an unexpectedly tough primary.\n\nRepublicans have never won all three states in the same year, despite the conservative tilt of each.\n\nThe White House has calculated that Trump is likely to take the brunt of the blame for a loss whether he campaigns or not. So he's decided to jump in head-first so he can take credit if Republicans win.\n\nTrump is popular in all three states, and his team is convinced he can pull each Republican candidate over the finish line. In Mississippi, the president is so well-liked that the Democratic candidate, state Attorney General Jim Hood, has made a Trump-like promise to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor\u2019s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency.
