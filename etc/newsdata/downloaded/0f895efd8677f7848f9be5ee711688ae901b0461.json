The investigation of these suspects led officers to a couple in Shanghai.\n\nThe couple was found to run a company, collect orders through WeChat and hire people to buy luxury products in countries like Italy and the United States, according to China Central Television.\n\nThose products were then shipped to a warehouse in Hong Kong, which were later brought to the Chinese mainland through courier services labeled with fake product names and deflated prices or by individual parallel traders.\n\nIn the couple's high-end apartments in Shanghai, officers seized more than 3,000 items from brands such as Balenciaga, Burberry and Hermes. Nine people were captured in the operation.\n\nThe ring was found to have smuggled 320 million yuan worth of products and evaded millions of yuan in duties since 2016.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db6a98ba310cf3e97a34613.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
