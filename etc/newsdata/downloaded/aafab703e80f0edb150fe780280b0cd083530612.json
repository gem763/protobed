Dead cats and dogs were strewn throughout the wreckage while some stray animals were digging through the garbage for food and had taken up residence on the porches of destroyed homes. At least one wild pig weathered the storm, celebrating its survival by charging at two Reuters journalists.\n\n\u201cWhat I was struck by was the focused nature of the devastation,\u201d Mark Green, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, told reporters in Nassau on Sunday, adding that some areas in Abaco looked \u201calmost as though a nuclear bomb was dropped.\u201d\n\nBahamian officials were still pulling bodies from the wreckage across the island and acknowledged that the official death toll of 43 was likely to rise markedly.\n\nSome 70,000 people need food and shelter, according to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme\u2019s estimate. Interviews with evacuees this week shone light on the extent of Dorian\u2019s destruction. Survivors avoided death, but lost homes, jobs and hospitals.\n\n\u201cHome is more than four walls and a roof \u2014 it\u2019s the neighbourhood where people live, their friends and neighbours, their livelihoods, comfort, and security for the future,\u201d said Jenelle Eli, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, which is helping with the relief. \u201cPeople are concerned about their next step, but also how they\u2019ll earn an income and what their lives will look like in the future.\u201d\n\nBahamian officials acknowledged on Saturday that Nassau would strain to house all the people who needed shelter.\n\nSome institutions that had opened their doors as a place for people to ride out the storm were trying to clear out people who had lost homes, Leonardo Cargill, of the island\u2019s Department of Social Services, told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThey now understand that the people coming in, it will be long-term sheltering, and many of them are church facilities and they cannot allow that to go on,\u201d Cargill said.\n\nAbaco resident Bernard Forbes is evacuated from the island by Global Support and Development personnel at the airport in the wake of Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco, Bahamas, September 8, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott\n\nTENT CITIES POSSIBLE\n\nThat has Nassau officials considering other options.\n\n\u201cWe can look at the tent city concept and the container city concept, these are all support mechanisms to help us,\u201d Captain Stephen Russell, who heads the National Emergency Management Agency, told the news conference. \u201cJobs may be a challenge at this time but long term we can house them.\u201d\n\nInternational aid was also pouring into the island nation.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development said it was allocating $2.8 million and had moved enough emergency supplies for 44,000 people to the islands.\n\nThe American Red Cross said it had committed an initial $2 million to help the Bahamas recover from the hurricane, with food, water and shelter and other necessities.\n\nNorwegian energy company Equinor (EQNR.OL) said on Sunday it will clean up an onshore oil spill discovered this week at its Bahamas storage terminal in the storm\u2019s aftermath.\n\nThe storm had made its way to Canada by Sunday, where the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was a still-powerful post-tropical cyclone with 75 mile-per-hour (120 km-per-hour) winds over the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nMany in hard-hit Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco complained that aid had been too slow in arriving.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a thing to help us down here,\u201d shouted Tepeto Davis, a 37-year-old tile contractor who slammed on the brakes of his pickup truck and backed up to talk to reporters. \u201cWe are suffering out here and no one cares about us. We\u2019ve had to funnel gasoline out of destroyed cars to get injured people back and forth. There\u2019s no gas, there\u2019s no food, no medicine, and no water.\u201d\n\nThose receiving aid in Nassau worried that they were still a long way from being able to rebuild their lives.\n\n\u201cThe government says everyone\u2019s being fed, and that\u2019s good,\u201d said Anthony Morley, 61, who fled Marsh Harbour and was staying at Breezes, a Nassau resort where local volunteers have subsidized rooms for survivors. \u201cBut for food I can fish. What I need is a house. I don\u2019t have a bed, a refrigerator. I don\u2019t even have a Bible.\u201d", "description": "Days after fleeing their crumbling home and breaking into a vacant apartment to take shelter while Hurricane Dorian rampaged over the Bahamas' Great Abaco Island, Samuel Cornish and his family caught a rescue flight to Nassau.", "authors": ["Zachary Fagenson", "Nick Brown", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427656775&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870UL", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
