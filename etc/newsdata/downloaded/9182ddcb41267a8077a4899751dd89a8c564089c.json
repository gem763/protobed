I\u2019ve just got to give it a good crack this time and see what happens.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to have a few beers, though, I\u2019ve stayed off the beers for a while but I\u2019ll have a few tonight and they\u2019ll taste smooth as silk.\u2019\n\nJamie O\u2019Neill has a big task on his hands against the Rocket (Picture: EPSB/Twitter)\n\nIt has been a tough start back to life on tour for O\u2019Neill, and also a very unlucky one as he was one of a number of players forced to withdraw from the Riga Masters due to a flight being grounded thanks to a storm.\n\nO\u2019Neill had beaten world number 10 Barry Hawkins in the qualification round for the tournament and was due to face Sam Craigie in the last 64 but had to pull out.\n\nThat victory over Hawkins has been his only win of the season so far and the clash with Craigie would have been only his eighth appearance in the main stages of a ranking event, so it was a major disappointment for O\u2019Neill.\n\nHowever, he will have the chance to cause a sensational upset in Crawley on Monday night when he takes on the Rocket on his first ever appearance at the English Open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and Judd Trump complete cracking English Open line-up\n\nMORE: Reanne Evans sends message to Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan after securing Champion of Champions spot", "description": "Jamie O'Neill has been handed the task of facing Ronnie O'Sullivan in the English Open first round, and ditching his party lifestyle has afforded him that opportunity.
