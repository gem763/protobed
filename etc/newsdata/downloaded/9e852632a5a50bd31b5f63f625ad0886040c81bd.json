I've also been curious about \"supercharged\" waters like the ones I see everyone toting at the gym or airport.\n\nThese waters usually contain electrolytes or have been ionized to increase its pH. Water with higher pH, or alkaline water, can improve cardiovascular function and help people retain more fluids in the body, leading to more efficient rehydration than regular water.\n\nI don't love that they're only sold in plastic bottles and are typically more expensive than regular water, but there has to be some real reason why people love them, right?\n\nI took a closer look at an ionized alkaline water called Essentia, a leader in its category whose bold black, red, and white bottles you've no doubt seen everywhere as well. In 2018, the company reported nearly $196 million in retail sales and it's only growing, in both sales and reputation.\n\nRead more: The best water bottles you can buy\n\nTo make its water, the company employs a three-step process. First, it purifies potable tap water to remove any chemicals and heavy metals. Then, it infuses the water with electrolytes like calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. Finally, it uses a proprietary ionization process to get the pH of the water to 9.5.\n\nThough the scientific benefits of ionized pH water have yet to be corroborated by multiple research studies, many reviews of Essentia water have mentioned that it has improved their acid reflux and morning sickness.\n\nIt's also supposed to taste better and hydrate you better than traditional waters. According to a published study conducted by Essentia's Director of Clinical and Scientific Research, Dr. Ralph E. Holsworth, Jr., Essentia water resulted in 88% \"better hydration\" than regular bottled water.\n\nRead more: This electrolyte powder is a low-sugar way to replenish fluids and prevent dehydration after workouts or long nights out\n\nUltimately, the only way to see whether Essentia water really did offer significant taste and hydration benefits was to try it ourselves.\n\nSome would argue that it all tastes the same, but I can definitely taste the difference between various bottled waters. Some leave strange aftertastes, while others feel dry in your throat as you drink it. Essentia tastes noticeably cleaner and smoother than other waters I've tried, and other Insider Picks team members agreed.\n\nI drank Essentia throughout a work day as well as after a workout, and I have to admit that it was a subtle but welcome change from usual tap water. The taste was just different enough, but not as drastic as a sparkling or flavored water, and I felt rehydrated and re-energized after drinking it, whether I had it while diving into a writing session or after coming out of a strength workout class.\n\nHaving tried it now, I'd still stick with regular tap water for my everyday needs, but if I do want an extra rehydration supplement that also tastes good, I would buy a bottle of Essentia. It's sold in a variety of sizes, from 12 fl. oz. to 1 L, so you can get the one that best fits your needs and habits.", "description": "I took a closer look at an ionized alkaline water called Essentia, a leader in its category whose bold black, red, and white bottles you've no doubt seen everywhere as well.", "authors": ["Connie Chen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c8910bc113a500fd8366198?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
