That caused Day (17-4-1, 6 knockouts) to stumble and seconds later Conwell landed a left hook that knocked Day to the canvas.\n\nThe 27-year-old Day, from Freeport, New York, was instantly knocked out and it wasn't clear if he regained consciousness. He was treated by a doctor in the ring and then was rushed off on a stretcher by paramedics and transported to the hospital. Day was knocked down twice earlier in the fight.\n\nDiBella said on his verified Twitter account Sunday: \"Pat Day makes any room he is in a better place. I've never met anyone who's met Patrick and not liked him. Never heard him utter a mean word. Never saw him greet someone without a big smile. Life doesn't seem fair sometimes. Please keep Pat in your prayers, thoughts, and hearts.\"\n\nIn his statement, DiBella conveyed thanks for the outpouring of \"support, prayers and offers of assistance from all corners of the boxing community.\" He asked that the privacy of Day and his family be respected at this difficult time.\n\nEddie Hearn, the managing director of the promoter, Matchroom Sport, said after the bout that Day never gave up in the bout.\n\nHearn said: \" I think there was 30 seconds left in the final round and he was still trying to win the fight and he was a mile behind in the fight and he could've easily not tried to win the fight, but he got knocked out trying to win the fight. \"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nhttps://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
