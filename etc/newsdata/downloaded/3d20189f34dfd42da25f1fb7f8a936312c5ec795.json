In recent years, their numbers have grown dramatically, driving up congestion on city streets.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne rule imposed a limit on how often a driver can cruise in an empty vehicle in Manhattan south of 96th Street during peak hours, in an effort to combat Manhattan\u2019s traffic congestion. The other rule extended the city\u2019s cap on the issuance of new licenses to industry drivers, in a bid to both combat congestion and elevate the livelihoods of existing drivers. (New York City also instituted a first-in-the-nation minimum wage for drivers \u2014 Uber has yet to challenge that in court, though Lyft has). Last week, Uber said it would start dropping riders from its app in low-demand areas in an effort to boost its utilization rate.\n\nUber argues, among other things, that the Taxi and Limousine Commission overstepped its regulatory bounds by implementing the cruising and vehicle cap, and that both are preempted by the congestion pricing regime that the state is instituting in New York City for 2021.\n\n\u201cDrivers\u2019 flexibility is already being threatened by Mayor de Blasio\u2019s regulations, and the cruising cap will only make that worse,\u201d said Uber spokesperson Alix Anfang in a statement. \u201cThis arbitrary rule used a flawed economic model, did not take into account how drivers are affected by previous regulations, is preempted by the state and was voted on despite the objection of City Council members and community groups.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has an antagonistic relationship with the company, said Uber was merely putting \"profit first and the people and drivers they serve last.\"\n\n\"Extending this cap for at least the next year is not only legal, it will bring needed relief to congested streets and hardworking drivers,\" said the spokesperson, Seth Stein. \"The City\u2019s rules make our streets safer and are in the best interest of all New Yorkers.\"\n\nBy filing this suit, one of many the company has leveled against New York City and the second on its vehicle cap, Uber is following in the well-trodden path of the taxi industry it so effectively demonized in its bid for supremacy here. Before Uber came to town, the taxi industry went to court to challenge nearly every regulatory bid by the city.\n\n\"Uber has money to sue against life-saving rules to protect drivers drowning in a race to the bottom, but apparently not enough money to actually pay drivers,\" said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, in a text message.", "description": "Uber argues that the Taxi and Limousine Commission overstepped its regulatory bounds by implementing the cruising and vehicle cap.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/A%20-%20UBER%20DRIVER.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
