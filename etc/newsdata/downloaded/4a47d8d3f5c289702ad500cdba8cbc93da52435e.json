Places you'll be able to find weed by 2030", "language": "en", "text": "The quickening pace of cannabis legalisation could change the food, drink and beauty landscape over the next decade, according to market research organisation Euromonitor International.\n\nBolstered by the rise of CBD, many regions have relaxed and in some cases decriminalised full-strength cannabis. Unlike CBD (cannabinol), cannabis contains THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active \u2013 and in some cases psychoactive ingredient \u2013 that gets you high.\n\nRead more | CBD: miracle cure or widespread scam?\n\nBy 2030, the cannabis market will have been revolutionised, seeing brand names emerge and a host of cannabis products available for use in everyday life.\n\nWhere will cannabis be available?\n\nEuromonitor predicts the market for cannabis will go far beyond revolutionising the tabacco industry to see people smoking the dried cannabis plant.\n\nThere will be much more to do than smoke cannabis\n\nIn fact, it identified four additional key industries as potential markets the burgeoning cannabis industry could exploit.\n\nDrinks\n\nThere are already a host of CBD-infused drinks on the market, to take advantage of the wellness halo currently surrounding CBD products. While looking ahead to widespread acceptance of products containing THC, Spiros Malandrakis, Euromonitor\u2019s industry manager for alcoholic drinks says there is an opportunity for cannabis to \u201cradically disrupt traditionalist industries such as alcoholic drinks\u201d.\n\n\u201cReshaping millennia-old drinking rituals and providing an alternative to social lubrication occasions, cannabis should be either embraced as a symbiotic opportunity or faced as a potentially detrimental antagonist for an alcohol industry already on the defensive,\u201d he adds.\n\nAlcoholic cannabis cocktails could still be a while away\n\nHowever, while the two could work together as a social bonding experience, Euromonitor is keen to point out drinks containing THC rarely contain alcohol at the moment, as research is still ongoing about the impact of the combined effects.\n\nHealth\n\nSome believe cannabis-based products could provide a natural solution for pain relief and an alternative to addictive opioid drugs.\n\nEuromonitor suggested vitamins and dietary supplements containing cannabis could become commonplace within six years while it could also form part of sleeping aids and sports nutrition.\n\nSkincare is set to drive the cannabis craze in the beauty industry\n\nBeauty\n\nCBD has already replaced hemp references in many beauty products, promoting its anti-oxidising, oil-balancing and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nEuromonitor expects skincare to be the main driver of cannabis beauty growth, with those looking for a holistic skin routine likely to jump on the trend.\n\nFood\n\nCannabis-infused edibles are nothing new, but seeing them on the shelves of your local supermarket may come as something of a revelation.\n\nBakery products, savoury snacks, pasta and soups could all soon contain CBD to satisfy demand for mood-boosting snacks.\n\nEdibles are nothing new, but seeing these hash cookies on your supermarket shelf could come as a surprise\n\n\u201cThey will be able to wake up and have a pick-me-up cannabis beverage, jump in the shower and use cannabis toiletries, take a cannabis supplement with lunch, consume cannabis sports nutrition after the gym, pop out in the evening for a non-alcoholic THC drink with a buzz and go to bed at the end of the day with a THC sleeping aid,\u201d says Zora Milenkovic, head of drinks and tobacco at Euromonitor and author of the report Here Comes Cannabis: How Legalisation Will Disrupt Global Industries.\n\nWhere is cannabis legal now?\n\nRecreational marijuana is now legal in Canada and in 10 US states. Medical marijuana is legal in 33 US states, which is a strong precursor to recreational legalisation. Euromonitor expects federal legalisation of recreational cannabis in the US within the next 10 years. Meanwhile, some countries and regions in Europe, Asia and as far away as Australia have legalised cannabis for medicinal or personal use.", "description": "The market for cannabis is exploding.
