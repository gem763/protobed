The storm has gathered strength in the Caribbean, increasing to a Category 2 hurricane overnight and close to becoming Category 3. As Florida and now Georgia batten down the hatches, forecasters predict Dorian will make landfall over the holiday weekend as a Category 4 hurricane:\n\n.@RobMarciano is tracking Hurricane Dorian from Melbourne Beach, Florida where they are bracing for a possible hit. https://t.co/gR46xwdPXI pic.twitter.com/eg5hoHZsML \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) August 30, 2019\n\nNow forecast to approach Florida with winds of 140 mph, Dorian, should it make landfall at those wind speeds, would become just the ninth hurricane to do so, dating back to 1851. States of emergency have been issued in Florida and in Georgia as residents scramble to acquire supplies before Dorian, which strengthened into a Category 2 overnight into Friday, is forecast to make landfall early Tuesday as a Category 4 and dump more than a foot of rain.\n\nCNN\u2019s forecasters predict a Monday landfall, but the impact will be felt earlier in either case. It will be the worst storm to hit Florida since 1992:\n\nAt 105 mph, Dorian is the strongest storm of the Atlantic hurricane season so far. If it makes landfall as a Category 4 storm on Monday as forecast, with sustained winds of around 130 mph, it will be the strongest hurricane to strike Florida\u2019s East Coast since Andrew in 1992, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller. Dorian is currently a Category 2 storm. It will also be the fourth year in a row of a hurricane of any strength hitting Florida, the most years in a row since the 1940s.\n\nIt\u2019s significant enough that Donald Trump canceled a planned trip to Poland in order to remain on hand for the storm. Mike Pence will go in Trump\u2019s place instead while Trump directs emergency efforts from the White House. Trump\u2019s connections to Florida run deep, and he was concerned enough about the \u201cabsolute monster\u201d storm to put out a video last night warning Floridians about what is coming \u2014 even if no one\u2019s still quite sure where it\u2019s coming:\n\nUnsure where Hurricane Dorian is going to land over Labor Day weekend, many Florida residents faced a sense of helplessness as they prepared for what President Donald Trump said could be an \u201cabsolute monster\u201d of a storm. \u201cAll indications are it\u2019s going to hit very hard and it\u2019s going to be very big,\u201d Trump said in a video he tweeted Thursday evening, comparing Dorian to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in 1992. \u2026 With the storm\u2019s track still unclear, no immediate mass evacuations were ordered. Along Florida\u2019s east coast, local governments began distributing sandbags, shoppers rushed to stock up on food, plywood and other emergency supplies at supermarkets and hardware stores, and motorists topped off their tanks and filled gasoline cans. Some fuel shortages were reported in the Cape Canaveral area. Josefine Larrauri, a retired translator, went to a Publix supermarket in Miami only to find empty shelves in the water section. \u201cI feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of going all the way to Georgia if it can land there?\u201d\n\nThat uncertainty will continue for at least another day, depending on the pace of the storm\u2019s track, and will complicate efforts to evacuate when its landfall becomes more apparent. The broad target at the moment also represents a massive challenge to FEMA and other emergency responders, who will have to remain stretched thin until almost the last moment.\n\nFor the rest of us, time to dig deep and contribute what we can to legitimate emergency-response charities, and to pray for our fellow Americans in Dorian\u2019s path, of course. The American Red Cross, Save the Children, Salvation Army, and Catholic Charities are usually good choices for those who can donate cash and goods in response to disaster situations.", "description": "Batten down the hatches.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trump-dorian.png"}
