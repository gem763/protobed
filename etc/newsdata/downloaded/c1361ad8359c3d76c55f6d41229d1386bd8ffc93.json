I wear hearing aids and, during President Trump\u2019s inspiring speech, which covered in detail the entire range of significant issues facing the world, was concentrating on what was being said,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo footage and images from both CNBC and CNN showed the 81-year-old Ross wearing headphones but appearing to nod off with his eyes closed for up to 15 minutes as Trump delivered what has been described as a subdued but hawkish address before the General Assembly.\n\nThis is not the first time Ross has been believed to have been caught napping during a Trump speech. Video from a Trump\u2019s speech in Saudi Arabia in May 2017 showed Ross appearing to doze with headphones on, seated several seats away from the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump. Other reports have described Ross as falling asleep during meetings.\n\nFor his part, Ross suggested in emailed comments, sent to MarketWatch via his representatives, that he had maintained a rigorous agenda in New York and was not ill. \u201cImmediately following the President\u2019s remarks, I attended bilateral meetings with the leaders of the United Kingdom and India, and, later in the day, will have follow-up meetings with officials from the United Kingdom and South Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, throughout the entirety of the UN General Assembly, I attended events or am planning to participate in meetings with the governments of Pakistan, Poland, Egypt, Japan, Greece, and Vietnam.\u201d\n\nTrump, during his remarks to the UN on Wednesday, reinforced a long-held position that America comes first in international dealings. A two-year trade dispute between global economic superpowers China and the U.S. has rattled markets as it has disrupted manufacturing supply lines, while associated import tariffs have raised costs for producers.\n\n\u201cThe future does not belong to globalists,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe future belongs to patriots.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his accusation that China is a currency manipulator and said that \u201cfor years these abuses were tolerated, ignored or even encouraged.\u201d\n\nU.S. markets, which have been sensitive to trade-related comments, appeared to soften amid the hawkish comments from the president near midday Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.53% , S&P 500 SPX, -0.84% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.46% ended lower, with the tech-laden Nasdaq putting in its worst daily loss of the month.", "description": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday has rebutted claims that he was snoozing during President Donald Trump\u2019s United Nations speech in Manhattan,...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR969_ross_n_ZG_20190924154918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
