Netflix reported a loss of 126,000 paid subscribers during its second quarter. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings blamed the weaker content slate for the company\u2019s weaker-than-expected subscriber adds during its second quarter. Releases of Netflix\u2019s smash hit series, Stranger Things 3, during the third quarter is anticipated to have boosted paid subscribers for the company. Analysts expect Netflix to report 794,000 domestic paid subscribers and 5.92 million international paid subscribers during the third quarter.\n\nThe fourth quarter is gearing up to be a big challenge for reigning streaming giant Netflix. Competitors Disney+ and Apple TV+ are slated to launch in the fall at lower price points than Netflix. Investors will be paying close attention to any additional commentary from management on the growing competitive landscape ahead.\n\nWall Street is estimating that Netflix will report third-quarter adjusted earning of $1.23 per share on $5.25 billion in revenue. The options market is implying a 11% move in either direction following the results.\n\nStranger Things logo seen on the backdrop of Netflix's \"Stranger Things 3\" premiere at Santa Monica high school Barnum Hall on June 28, 2019 in Santa Monica, California.

Excluding volatile auto and gas sales, retail sales are also expected to have risen 0.3% for the month.\n\nOther notable earnings reports scheduled for Wednesday include Ally Financial (ALLY), Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) before market open; IBM (IBM), Netflix (NFLX), CSX Corporation (CSX) after market close.\n\nCatch up on what you missed More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
