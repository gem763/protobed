Several rural centres could run out of drinking water next year unless rains come.\n\nAustralia's air temperature has warmed over the past century, according to a state of the climate report in January, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events like drought and fires.\n\nRob Rogers, NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, said fire crews from other states were coming to help so firefighters did not get worn out so early in the season.\n\n\"In light of how long some of those crews have been going, we've called for interstate support,\" he said.\n\nFire services are also monitoring blazes in the state of Queensland, while high-risk fire alerts have been issued in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with those who have lost a great deal, fortunately there's been no loss of life,\" Morrison said.\n\nFires have been raging in Australia for several weeks, despite it only being mid-spring. Usually, fires are more severe in summer.\n\nQueensland vineyard owner Robert Davidson was at home in early September when a damaged powerline set his plum orchard ablaze before flames tore through four blocks of vineyards reserved for a fledgling wine brand.\n\n\"It's bone dry. It's like a ticking time-bomb out there. Normally we'd be doing controlled burns and now we're burning for all the wrong reasons,\" he told Reuters.
