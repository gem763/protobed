Others are easily accessible but lesser known. All make for intriguing travel\n\nAngkor Wat, Cambodia\n\nl e v a r t\n\nIn the 12th century, the Khmer took their vast understanding of the known universe and sought to recreate it in miniature.\n\nThe result was Angkor Wat, a sprawling city designed to impress with meticulously arranged moats and towers, and walls covered in astonishingly detailed bas reliefs of Hindu deities.\n\nThe ancient Khmer took a broad view of scenes worth preserving.\n\nWhile many are celestial or holy in theme, other murals detail mundane acts like preparing supper.\n\nAngkor Wat stretches over 500 acres within the Angkor Archeological Park, a large area covering more than 150 square miles.\n\nThe main temple receives packs of tourists, but many lesser-known temples offer a chance to wander through old Khmer capitals, which were built from the 9th century onwards.\n\nRome, Italy\n\nVisiting a city as beloved as Rome comes with particular hazards: the crowds, the cheesy souvenirs, the young men in full gladiator regalia waiting to pose for selfies with tourists.\n\nAnd yet there are few places like it.\n\nTake the Colosseum -- a nearly 2,000-year-old stadium in the middle of a modern city.\n\nIn the days of actual gladiators, 50,000 spectators would gather with the emperor for bloody contests to the death.\n\nThe Colosseum had the original retractable roof, a whizz-bang contraption called a velarium that used sail technology to rig canopies to shelter crowds from sun and rain.\n\nAnd we've not even mentioned the Vatican, the catacombs or the Forum.\n\nIstanbul, Turkey\n\nIstanbul loves to depict itself as the city straddling two continents.\n\nWhat's most remarkable is the way the city straddles great periods of history that pile up and fold over themselves more naturally than anywhere else in the world.\n\nConstruction by successive empires from Byzantium to Constantinople to modern Turkey have bequeathed Istanbul an instantly recognizable skyline that merges elements from all those eras.\n\nIn the historic core around the iconic Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine-era Hippodrome circus sits a short stroll away from the Ottoman Empire's Topkapi Palace, which houses artifacts including Moses's staff.\n\nSurrounding it all is a thriving modern city with top-notch dining, galleries and architecture that make Istanbul one of the world's most important cultural centers.\n\nBagan, Myanmar\n\nLess crowded than Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu, but just as magical. Courtesy Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLong hidden from international view by Myanmar's military government, the treasures of Bagan returned to the spotlight after political reforms began opening up the country.\n\nHere, over 2,000 Buddhist temples fill a plain along the Irrawaddy River, creating an ethereal landscape.\n\nThe crowds remain far smaller and more adventurous than the tour groups that fill Angkor Wat or Machu Picchu.\n\nMyanmar is still finding itself after decades of civil war and international isolation. The current crisis over the country's treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority is also attracting global criticism.\n\nNone of which makes this 11th-century temple city anything less than more magical.\n\nThe kingdom that reigned here was destroyed by earthquakes and Kublai Khan's invaders, but the quiet temples retain a spiritual air that's impossible to ignore.\n\nTikal, Guatemala\n\nHidden in the jungles of Guatemala, Tikal was a Mayan citadel that reflects more than 1,000 years of cultural achievements beginning from 600 BC.\n\nJaguars and pumas prowl the surrounding wilderness, but the palaces, temples and plazas within the site represent some of the earliest pinnacles of human achievement.\n\nThe stepped pyramids are icons of Mayan culture that rise above the canopy.\n\nEqually impressive are the sporting courts, temples and palaces that ring the main plaza.\n\nMost of the ancient causeways that link Tikal's 3,000 structures have been cleared of vegetation, so visitors can now wander among the buildings much as the ancients did.\n\nCairo, Egypt\n\nFor first-time visitors, it's a shock just how close the pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx are to Cairo's chaotic streets.\n\nWith 22 million people, Cairo is one of the world's biggest cities, built around one of humanity's earliest urban centers.\n\nTombs at Giza date back 4,500 years, and the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities boasts an incredible collection from the Nile's earliest inhabitants.\n\nBut the slightly less ancient parts of Cairo are also rich with cultural treasures.\n\nThe current city was founded more than 1,000 years ago and has one of the world's oldest universities, a rich legacy of Islamic art, and Coptic treasures that are often overlooked.\n\nPersopolis, Iran\n\nl e v a r t\n\nIran's openness to Western tourism in recent years has helped Persepolis regain its allure for visitors, even if international relations have once more become strained.\n\nThe city was founded in 518 BC by Darius I, ruler of ancient Persia's Achaemenian Empire, and grew in grandeur until Alexander the Great sacked it two centuries later.\n\nIts most remarkable feature is an immense terrace of 125,000 square feet, partially carved out of Mount Kuh-e Rahmat (the Mountain of Mercy).\n\nRulers built ever more regal palaces, temples and halls around the terrace, complete with an underground sewage system and cisterns for fresh water.\n\nDespite a series of protective walls, rising to 30 feet high, Alexander laid waste to Persepolis, whose ruins were only rediscovered in 1618.\n\nToday, however, the city is one of the best examples of ancient architecture, especially for the slender columns that remain.\n\nRelated content 25 of the most beautiful places around the world\n\nKyoto, Japan\n\nKyoto cool: Japan's former capital preserves old traditions. Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nIf Tokyo represents the part of Japan obsessed with technology and the future, Kyoto is the part that rakes sand in Zen gardens and performs graceful tea ceremonies.\n\nThat's not entirely fair -- Nintendo is based in Kyoto, just one part of the city's thriving tech scene.\n\nPerhaps closer to the truth is that as imperial Japan's capital for more than 1,000 years, Kyoto has found a way to respectfully preserve its old traditions while eagerly embracing the new as well.\n\nMore than 1,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines temper the frenetic pace of modern life. Sites such as Nijo Castle , which dates back to 1603, draw people from around the world.\n\nSince the city was largely spared bombing during World War II, most are still in use.\n\nBeijing, China\n\nPlanning a winter trip to Beijing? A quick side journey to the Great Wall rewards with stunning, snowy views.\n\nChina has invested heavily in eye-popping modern architecture for its capital over the last two decades, but with a past that stretches more than 3,000 years, the city has a deep history providing a rich legacy of art, architecture and education.\n\nJust visiting the city's six UNESCO World Heritage sites, including the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, could take a week.\n\nThat would barely allow even a casual glance at the treasures inside the city's legion museums and galleries, much less the alleyways of the hutongs, old neighborhoods reinvented and sometimes rebuilt as a trendy center of the Beijing's modern life.\n\nGreat Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe\n\nFrom the 11th century, this kingdom in southeastern Zimbabwe grew into a trading empire that stretched through the African interior and across the Indian Ocean.\n\nA royal complex grew on a hilltop, with drystone architecture creating a terraced palace with fruit trees, hidden chambers and stunning views over the king's dominion.\n\nBelow, the towering walls of the Great Enclosure surround a conical tower that's become a national symbol.\n\nOverpopulation and deforestation caused the kingdom's collapse around 1450 -- historically bad timing as Europeans soon began arriving to find a weakened polity that was easier to subdue.\n\nGreat Zimbabwe remains a monumental reminder of Africa's achievements before colonialism.\n\nRelated content 30 of Africa's most amazing places to visit\n\nTimbuktu, Mali\n\nBefore the Sahara nearly swallowed the city and before French colonialists swept through, Timbuktu was one of the world's most important centers of learning.\n\nThe city's librarians guarded thousands of manuscripts, protecting them against the elements and violence.\n\nMany of the manuscripts were evacuated to Mali's capital Bamako during the last period of separatist violence, but the city's unique mosques remain.\n\nThe three most important ones date as far back as the 14th century.\n\nTheir earthen architecture requires continuous maintenance, and caretakers today use the same techniques to preserve them as the original builders.\n\nRelated content Africa's most luxurious safaris\n\nMachu Picchu, Peru\n\nOne of the most popular ancient cities in the world. AFP/Getty Images\n\nNearly 8,000 feet high in the Andes, the Incan citadel of Machu Picchu retains an aura of mystery and majesty even as it welcomes thousands of tourists a day.\n\nWhen the Spanish conquered Peru, Machu Picchu's very existence was kept secret from them.\n\nRelated content Sacred Valley of the Incas -- see Machu Picchu and so much more in Peru\n\nThe vast complex was revealed to the outside world in 1911, and quickly became the emblem of Incan achievement.\n\nBuilt more than 500 years ago with drystone construction, the city sits on the saddle between two peaks rising above tropical jungles.\n\nClouds swirl among the ruins, whose significance remains largely unknown.\n\nTerraces and ramps skirt the mountains, and the buildings appear to reflect the Inca's sophisticated grasp of astronomy -- though archeologists are still seeking to understand exactly how.\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nAthens traces its origins back 5,000 years, but the modern city has found remarkable ways to coexist with its iconic ancient monuments.\n\nBelow the Acropolis, walkable neighborhood streets wind past cafes and shops.\n\nMany brim with tourist tchotchkes, but with enough art galleries and good eating mixed among them even the most jaded traveler will be satisfied.\n\nMuch of the city's social life centers around the monuments, turning the stunning ruins of classical Greece into casual backdrops of Athenians' every day lives.\n\nPetra, Jordan\n\nWhile the ancient city of Petra is simply a famous archaeological site to most of the world, for university professor Sami Alhasanat, it's home\n\nThis region between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea has been inhabited since the earliest days of humanity, but around 300 BC the rulers of the Nabatean Kingdom laid their claim to cultural greatness by carving magnificent buildings into red sandstone cliffs.\n\nGorges and canyons surround the ancient city, creating a maze of passages that helped keep it secret from Europeans for centuries.\n\nAdding to the mystique: no cars are allowed in the ancient city.\n\nVisitors who don't want to walk have to hire a camel, donkey or carriage to get around.\n\nEllora, India\n\nLike Petra, Ellora was carved out of the mountains in the area of Maharashtra. But this Indian monastic complex remains relatively unknown.\n\nThe temples include Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina holy sites that were built over 400 years, beginning in the 6th century.\n\nThe most impressive has the uninspiring official name of Cave 16, known informally as Kailasa, and the entire temple was carved out of a massive rock face.\n\nThe double-story entrance leads to a courtyard surrounded by a three-story arcade lined with columns. The building is twice as large as the Parthenon.\n\nInside, images of Hindu deities were sculpted from the stone, with two life-size statues of elephants in the courtyard.\n\nRelated content 12 top Delhi attractions\n\nXi'an, China\n\nIn addition to the famed Terracotta Warriors, Xian's well-preserved city wall is worth a visit. Shen Lu/CNN\n\nIn the Silk Road's heyday, Xi'an was where the journey west began.\n\nFor more than a millennium, Xi'an was the capital of ancient Chinese dynasties.\n\nNow it's most famous as the home of the Terracotta Warriors -- thousands of clay soldiers that fill the mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. Each is standing, ready for battle, but they had been buried underground for 2,000 years.\n\nWorkers digging a well stumbled upon one of the soldiers in 1974, leading to one of the great archeological finds of all time.\n\nExcavation is still underway, and more recent work has discovered statues of dancers and acrobats, giving a new sense of the grandeur of Qin's ambitions.\n\nMadurai, India\n\nIn ancient days, the Tamil city of Madurai was an important capital that traded with Rome and ruled over its part of India until the British conquest.\n\nAt its heart is the Meenakshi Amman Temple, one of India's holiest sites that draws one million visitors for its annual festival in April and May.\n\nAlthough the city is 2,500 years old, the original temple was sacked during a period of medieval invasions.\n\nThe current structure was built in the 1600s, with 14 gateway towers guarding the shrines covered in vibrant colors.\n\nThe Thousand Pillar Hall is carved with the mythological yali, a creature with the head of elephant on the body of a lion.\n\nRelated content India's 30 most beautiful places to visit\n\nPoverty Point, Louisiana\n\nLargely unknown even to Americans who live nearby, Poverty Point in Louisiana achieved the height of early human civilization in North America.\n\nIt's named for a plantation located nearby, as the original name has been lost to time.\n\nThe city probably reached its greatest heights around 3,500 BC, when its people carved out six concentric, elliptical ridges from the earth.\n\nThey also built five large mounds, erected causeways and established docks that gave them easy access to the Mississippi River. That helped turn this site into a trade hub for a network that stretched over hundreds of miles.\n\nThough the area was developed by people who hunted, fished and gathered wild plants for food, farming hadn't been established yet.\n\nBorobudur, Indonesia\n\nBorobudur is the most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia. Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nForeigners tend to think Indonesian travel as centering on the tranquil island of Bali or the hectic capital Jakarta. But the most-visited site in this mainly Muslim nation is the ninth-century Buddhist temple complex of Borobudur.\n\nThe temple was completed in the early 800s, but much of its history has been lost.\n\nFor centuries, it lay covered under volcanic ash, and then the surrounding jungle grew over it.\n\nIn the early 1800s, locals told a British governor about its existence. In the 1970s, UNESCO guided a restoration that brought Borobudur to its current glory.\n\nNow the stupas once again rise among the green valley. Because the complex was buried for so long, most of the artwork remains intact.\n\nTakht-i-Bahi, Pakistan\n\nThis Buddhist monastery was built in the first century, but fell out of use a mere 600 years later.\n\nTakht-i-Bahi's location on a hilltop protected it against a succession of invasions, until the British came through and hauled off most of the surviving treasures to keep in the British Museum.\n\nWhat remains are three stupas and the court surrounding them, as well as meditation chambers once used by monks who brought Tantric traditions to this part of the world.\n\nIn the popular imagination, Tantric practices revolve around sex.\n\nTakht-i-Bahi is a reminder that Tantra is so much more.\n\nStonehenge, England\n\nArcheologists believe this prehistoric stone circle could have been built as much as 5,000 years ago.\n\nThere's general agreement that the area was a burial ground, but no one really understands how the giant stones were brought in from as far away as Wales.\n\nConstruction may have taken place over 1,500 years, at a time before the wheel had arrived in England.\n\nGondar, Ethiopia\n\nThe capital of the old Ethiopian Empire, Gondar suffered under repeated invasions from the mid-1800s. However, several castles and churches remain, offering a look into one of the few medieval African cities that's still alive today.\n\nTourism here is not heavily developed, so wandering among these royal walls feels more like time travel.\n\nThe city is often called Africa's Camelot, which seems unfair.\n\nGondar is the center of a culture that's connected to the broader Christian world and completely distinct from it.\n\nRelated content 10 things that make Ethiopia extraordinary\n\nNimrud, Iraq\n\nThe capital of the world's first empire, Nimrud ruled over Assyria from around 880 BC, though humans settled the area thousands of years before.\n\nExcavations since the 1840s revealed a formidable city with massive palaces and temples to gods of war and writing.\n\nIvory furniture, carved stone slabs, gold jewelry and crowns were all buried inside.\n\nThe art and architecture are irreplaceable, but many were destroyed in 2016 as Nimrud sits just outside Mosul.", "description": "These are the best 23 ancient cities you can visit  around the world -- from Timbuktu and Tikal to Kyoto and Cairo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F160304172533-mali-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-14"}
