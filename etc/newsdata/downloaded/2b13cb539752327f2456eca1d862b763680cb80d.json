In fact, protesters decrying the repeal of the religious exemption rarely mention religion, probably because there is little official religious opposition to immunization. \u201cReligious belief\u201d was probably the easiest way around the law, the \u201cabracadabra\u201d that made the problem go away.\n\nAD\n\nIt still is in most of the country: 45 states and the District have religious exemption laws; 15 allow moral or philosophical exemptions. Facing falling vaccination rates, Vermont did away with its philosophical exemption in 2015, but it preserved the religious exemption, at which point many more parents started to have religious qualms. To apply for a Vermont exemption, you only have to sign a form that says, \u201cI attest to holding religious beliefs opposed to immunizations.\u201d Abracadabra.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blame parents for using what works, and nothing works like religion. Our longstanding legal deference to religion is why Jews can wear yarmulkes in court, Sikh soldiers can wear beards, and employers with dress codes excluding hats can\u2019t tell Muslim employees to remove their hijabs. It\u2019s why Prohibition didn\u2019t prohibit Catholics from drinking ceremonial wine.\n\nAD\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cReligious belief\u201d can exempt churches and schools from providing contraceptive health services to their employees. In some states it lets pharmacists refuse to fill prescriptions, elected officials refuse to do their jobs and businesses refuse certain customers. It soon will let businesses with federal contracts discriminate in their hiring. And in nine out of 10 states it lets parents put other people\u2019s children at risk.\n\nThe Post reported recently that the owner of a wedding venue in Mississippi turned down an interracial couple, on account of the owner\u2019s \u201cChristian beliefs.\u201d The groom\u2019s sister shared a video of the conversation, which went viral, and shortly thereafter the owner apologized. She was wrong. She assumed the Bible forbade biracial relationships, but when she looked she couldn\u2019t find where it did. She had never \u201ctaken the opportunity to research and find whether this was correct or incorrect.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSo if she had found relevant verses, refusing to host an interracial wedding would have been . . . correct?\n\nAD\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem right. Why should religion exempt people from civil rights legislation and public health law? Maybe because, unlike parenting philosophy or political views, religious tenets can\u2019t change over time. Religious law is rigid, so civil law must bend.\n\nFor most people, though, religion is flexible. Believers routinely ignore inconvenient or outdated passages in their holy books, choosing, for instance, to fixate on Leviticus 18:22 (\u201cYou shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\u201d) but ignore Leviticus 19:19 (\u201cDo not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material\u201d). And then there are disputes among believers. Can Jews eat rice during Passover? Yes and no. Does baptism require full immersion? Yes and no.\n\nAD\n\nEverybody picks among religious laws \u2014 even religions do. Just last year, the U.S. Episcopal Diocese voted to stop using masculine pronouns for God. In 2015, Pope Francis declared that, for one year only, abortion was a slightly more forgivable sin.\n\nAD\n\nBut if religious beliefs are not mandatory or immutable, then how are they different from secular beliefs?\n\nThey\u2019re not. A sincere religious belief against vaccination should have the same weight as a sincere belief in whatever Jenny McCarthy says. Discrimination bolstered by Bible verses is just like the regular kind. And when those beliefs conflict with laws that protect other people\u2019s health or civil rights, the believer shouldn\u2019t get to wave a magic wand to make the law disappear.\n\nAD\n\nAs New York\u2019s Rockland County Attorney Thomas Humachsaid when defending the government\u2019s right to keep unvaccinated kids out of school during a measles outbreak \u2014 and as New York seems to have concluded \u2014 \u201cIn this country, individuals are free to make choices about their lives, however, those choices may have consequences.\u201d Amen.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: Religious leaders should step up on vaccinations\n\nScott C.
