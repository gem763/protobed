But if the UFC wants me to fight Joanna, no problem. I can definitely beat her.\u201d\n\nJedrzejczyk produced a dominant display to defeat Michelle Waterson in a bout many viewed as a title eliminator at UFC on ESPN+ 19 this month. And although the former champion was widely praised for her performance, Weili wasn\u2019t quite as impressed.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it was a good fight, but you can see Joanna has a lack of finishing power,\u201d Weili said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Joanna now is the Joanna she used to be when she was champion, so I have a lot of stuff that can finish her.\u201d\n\nWeili captured the strawweight crown on home soil when she defeated Jessica Andrade in Shenzhen at UFC on ESPN+ 15 in August. It was a matchup that some suggested might have arrived too early for the Chinese fighter. But Weili squashed those fears in less than a minute and proved that she was ready for her title with a 42-second TKO.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that fight to come up so soon, but you saw the result,\u201d Weili said. \u201cI used my ability to prove that I can be the best. At the time a lot of fans, even some Chinese fans, didn\u2019t believe that I could win the fight and thought I would get knocked out, but you saw the result.\u201d\n\nWeili recently had her personal visa issues addressed, which has opened the door for her to return to the U.S. and compete again. But she said she wants her coaches\u2019 visa problems to be similarly dealt with in order to ensure her preparation for any future fights on American soil can be taken with her entire team alongside her.\n\n\u201cI wish the next fight could be in the states, because I know a lot of fans still don\u2019t know who I am, and I want to give them a great fight and let them know who I am and prove I\u2019m a great strawweight champion,\u201d Weili said. \u201cBut before that, I hope all my coaches can come to the states and help me to prepare my camp.\u201d\n\nWeili has fought twice in the U.S. and twice in China during her UFC career to date, with both performances in China resulting in stoppage victories. However, her two appearances on American soil led to decision wins. Weili says the difference is in no small part to her coaching team, and suggested that if she is able to bring her full team with her to the U.S. for her next fight, the fans will see her produce her very best.\n\n\u201cMy last two experiences of fighting in the states, not all my coaches could come because of visa issues,\u201d Weili said. \u201cSo the next time I fight in the States I hope all my coaches can come. When I fight in China I always perform very well, because all my coaches are there.\u201d", "description": "UFC strawweight champion Zhang Weili says she'd relish the chance to challenge flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko in her next bout.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/zhang-weili-ufc-boston-post-fight-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
