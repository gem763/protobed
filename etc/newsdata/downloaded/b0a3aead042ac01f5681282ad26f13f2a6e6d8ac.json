It was March 2015 and Liverpool were on a 13-game unbeaten league run. This was not the uplifting Red spring of the previous year when Rodgers\u2019 side had come close to winning the title but the team had not lost since before Christmas. The manager felt positive. He does positivity brilliantly.\n\nThe audience were journalists. Although the meeting was off the record and he could not be quoted directly, what the Liverpool manager said made great copy. He talked about long, sleepless nights when he weighed up complex tactical issues and how he arrived at a \u2018eureka\u2019 moment and changed his principles to get the best out of his squad. He talked about his CORE philosophy \u2013 Commitment, Ownership, Responsibilities, Excellence \u2013 and explained how to apply each point. And he discussed players, articulating how he had improved Emre Can and Jordan Henderson while detailing why Mario Balotelli was doomed to failure on Merseyside.\n\nThe resulting pieces were published the day before Liverpool played Manchester United at home. They captured a manager in his element and the last high-water mark of Rodgers\u2019 Anfield career. United blew their rivals away in a first half where Louis van Gaal out-thought his opposite number. Although the final score was only 2-1, the defeat was comprehensive. The season unravelled. Liverpool lost five of their last nine league games and, even more embarrassingly, were humiliated by a hitherto abject Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final. The campaign climaxed with a 6-1 defeat at Stoke City. All that was left was the lingering smell of bullshit. Rodgers was doomed. It was only a matter of time. Jurgen Klopp replaced him three months into the next season.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

There were plenty of other debatable issues around Liverpool at the time, too. It was a club on the edge and it took a remarkable lack of perception of the problems for Rodgers to choose that moment to project such a rosy image of his managership.\n\nIt had been a difficult season. The title challenge of the previous campaign ended with Steven Gerrard\u2019s infamous slip against Chelsea and the collapse in the next game at Selhurst Park when Liverpool squandered a three-goal lead in the last 11 minutes. Yet, at a club where contending to win the Premier League in May was a novel situation, there should have been enough residual positivity left to fire the team into the new season. Instead, Luis Suarez left in acrimonious circumstances and the replacements were, well, inadequate. Anfield\u2019s recruitment policy was a mess. Lazar Markovic, Emre Can, Alberto Moreno and Balotelli were wished on the manager and were never going to fill the void left by Suarez. Dejan Lovren was only a slightly less contentious signing. Fenway Sports Group (FSG) , the American owners, were convinced that Rodgers favoured English players. The arrival of Adam Lallana and, especially, Rickie Lambert, did not engender much confidence in Boston. Liverpool lost seven and drew three of their first 16 games of 2014-15.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After a 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford in December, they gave him an ultimatum: get the likes of Can into the side or pay with your job. Those endless hours and the 3am moment of realisation that Rodgers described to the journalists \u2013 essentially adapting a 3-4-3 system he had seen Basel use in their 1-0 victory over his team in the Champions League group stage \u2013 were born of that necessity. FSG\u2019s Mike Gordon applied heavy pressure to move Rodgers away from his favoured 4-3-3 and 4-4-2 formations.\n\nCan and Henderson were generating praise so Rodgers was keen to point out how he had improved them, even though he was strong-armed into putting the German in the team and did his best to get the Englishman out of the club.\n\nRodgers was on safer ground talking about Balotelli. He never wanted the Italian and was pressurised to play him, too. Yet the story the manager told about their interaction and the use of psychology to motivate the striker was laughable. The Northern Irishman sketched a drawing of a figure wearing a crown to illustrate to Balotelli that \u2018we are all kings of our own destiny\u2019. FSG had long stopped being amused by their manager\u2019s antics.\n\n---\n\nJohn W Henry, the principal owner, was convinced he had found the perfect manager in the summer of 2012. The Swansea City boss was in demand. Rodgers showed up with an 180-page dossier that set out his vision and was delighted to discuss analytics with the American millionaire. In their 18 months at the club FSG had dealt with Roy Hodgson and Kenny Dalglish. The Americans could not comprehend why Hodgson had ever been appointed and they simply could not understand Dalglish\u2019s impenetrable accent. They wanted freshness, they wanted the future. Rodgers was that man.\n\nTransfer windows always throw up issues, though, and old-fashioned ideas like wanting to build a squad in your own image come to the fore. There was concern in Boston that Rodgers was too keen to unload players without adequate replacements. Henry wondered whether his manager was too concerned with midfielders and not enough with attackers. They looked short on options up front. On August 10, Henry explicitly told his manager: \u201cWe cannot move [Andy] Carroll anywhere until we have a couple of additional forwards.\u201d The Geordie was one of a long list of players Rodgers was keen to discard. Henderson was among them.\n\nFSG were eager to bring Daniel Sturridge to Anfield from Chelsea. With that deal almost done and the deadline clock ticking down, Rodgers offloaded Carroll to West Ham United. But after the Sturridge move fell through, made an approach for Fulham\u2019s Clint Dempsey and offered Henderson to Craven Cottage in part exchange.\n\nHenry was unhappy about losing out on Sturridge but what made him really furious was Rodgers\u2019 response to the incident at a press conference after the window shut. \u201cIt\u2019s probably 99.9 per cent finance,\u201d he said about Carroll\u2019s departure. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got a choice, then he\u2019s someone around the place who you could use from time to time. He would have been a good option.\u201d\n\nFSG were aghast at the suggestion. Henry wrote an open letter to fans to shoot down the notion that the manager was being forced to sell and explaining their strategy. What they could not understand across the Atlantic is how Rodgers could \u201cthrow us under a bus\u201d. It would not be the last time the phrase was used. Trust was undermined within three months. The roots of the transfer committee began there.\n\nRodgers was conciliatory afterwards, pleading that Sturridge was a player with \u201ctalent but\u2026 issues\u201d. Your money is my money, he told the owner, and the manager did not see the striker as being worth it because of his injury record. It cut no ice. In January Sturridge moved to Anfield. Doubt crept in. The transfer chronology of the window, Henry told some intimates, \u201cmight make you think I had, again, chosen the wrong manager.\u201d\n\nOn the pitch things were fine. The American owners approved of the coaching methods and could see improvement in the team. They inserted a \u00a320 million buyout clause into his contract for fear that Manchester City would come calling \u2013 which raised an eyebrow or two at the Etihad \u2013 but recruitment remained a cause of friction. \u201cPay too much for a target and he complains we used too much of the budget on a player he didn\u2019t think was worth it,\u201d a source noted. \u201cPay too little and lose the deal, and he complains that we aren\u2019t big enough to compete.\u201d Perhaps that was the American\u2019s inexperience. That sort of behaviour is common among managers across the game. Rodgers allowed too much of the thought process to reach the public domain for the owners\u2019 taste, though. After Liverpool\u2019s first failed attempt to sign Mohamed Salah in January 2014 \u2013 a player he was lukewarm about and argued against meeting Basel\u2019s valuation \u2013 Rodgers said at a press conference that losing out on the Egyptian was \u201chard to take\u201d. He was asked why the winger ended up at Chelsea. \u201cThat\u2019s for the money guys to say,\u201d he replied.\n\nFSG felt the bus roll over them again and one angry internal missive stated, \u201cI\u2019m fighting the urge to call him and tear him a new asshole\u201d.\n\nSuccess repairs breaches. Coming close to winning the title \u2013 finishing second to Manchester City in 2014 \u2013 should have brought all the factions together but there were rumblings in the dressing room as well as the boardroom. Suarez and Raheem Sterling are not the only players who believe that the manager broke promises to them. There was a sense that Rodgers\u2019 schtick was getting old. When the 2015 season started poorly and the manager talked about entering another three-year rebuilding cycle after a 1-1 draw with Everton, FSG\u2019s patience snapped. Rodgers was gone and Klopp appointed in his place.\n\nRodgers was right, of course. Liverpool did need three years to get anywhere near where they wanted to be. Klopp inherited a squad that was not good enough but then benefited from a more coherent strategy in the market although his predecessor can hardly complain about the mess he helped create. The Northern Irishman sparked the recruitment chaos in August 2012 and it took until after Rodgers\u2019 departure for things to get sorted out.\n\nBecause of the lopsided nature of Scottish football, the jury is still out on Rodgers despite his overwhelming success during three years in charge of Celtic. But he is a good coach, even if it is worth taking some of his pronouncements with a hefty handful of salt. Once again he is riding high in England with Leicester. They come to Anfield third in the table and look like the team most likely to crash the top six. At 46, Rodgers seems to have developed some extra maturity. His achievements speak for themselves. The next few months will show whether self-awareness has overridden ambition, especially with the chatter around the possibility of Mauricio Pochettino leaving Tottenham Hotspur growing ever louder. At Celtic, he indicated to former colleagues that he was eyeing his next move within weeks of arriving in Glasgow.\n\nThe Leicester manager would do well to learn the lessons of that unbeaten run in 2015. Everything comes to an end and pride comes before a fall. Those cliches would never make it into his list of motivational messages but they are nonetheless true.\n\nThe Kop will be affectionate but it is unlikely that Rodgers will have any regrets. If he does, they will not be shown outwardly. He is heading for the big time and his future is bright, he\u2019ll tell anyone who will listen.\n\nAnd you know what? He might be right.", "description": "Brendan Rodgers held court. It was March 2015 and Liverpool\u00a0were on a 13-game unbeaten league run.
