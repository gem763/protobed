It is also likely to disrupt state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco\u2019s upcoming initial public offering, likely the world\u2019s largest.\n\nSatellite imagery of the aftermath of a drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil processing facility on Sept. 14, 2019, reportedly carried out by Houthi rebels.

Though the Houthis have used drone strikes before, at a distance of 800 kilometres from Yemen this attack would be deeper into Saudi territory than prior missions and (if the rebels are to be believed) involved 10 drones.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Houthi drone capabilities have steadily increased from off-the-shelf models to \u201cversions nearly identical to Iranian models,\u201d with the United Nations, Gulf nations, and the West saying Iran has supplied the rebels with weaponry.\n\nThe AP wrote that there are some indications that Saudi security forces tried to shoot down the drones, apparently to limited success:\n\nFirst word of the assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometres northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day\u2019s first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn... In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him. The fires began after the sites were \u201ctargeted by drones,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. It said an investigation was underway.\n\nA Houthi military spokesman, Yahia Sarie, said on the Houthi-run Al-Masirah satellite news channel that rebel forces had received \u201cintelligence\u201d from within Saudi Arabia and that \u201cThe only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us,\u201d the AP wrote.\n\nYemen is the Arab region\u2019s poorest country, and the civil war that began there in 2015 has since spiraled into one of the world\u2019s greatest ongoing humanitarian catastrophies. The U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project estimates that roughly 90,000 people have died as a result of the conflict, according to the AP, and the Saudi-led and U.S.-backed coalition has reportedly engaged in atrocities such as the bombing of markets, hospitals, weddings, and in one instance a bus carrying dozens of children.\n\nThe UN stated last year that the majority of the casualties have been the result of coalition airstrikes rather than Houthi action, though Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen chairperson Kamel Jendoubi said \u201cThere is little evidence of any attempt by parties to the conflict to minimise civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nNone of this, however, has driven a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which has stood with the country\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman through both the disastrous military venture and accusations of other human rights abuses ranging from the murder of a dissident journalist to sweeping crackdowns on dissent.\n\nAs the Jerusalem Post noted, the weekend attack is a major escalation not just because the rebels are repeatedly proving they can carry out long range, precision drone attacks, but because it will only serve to increase tensions between the U.S. and Iran that have been growing since Trump decided to walk away from a 2015 agreement designed to limit the scope of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an impressive, yet worrying, technological feat,\u201d Department of International Security Studies at Yale University visiting research fellow James Rogers told CNN. \u201cLong-range precision strikes are not easy to achieve and to cause the substantial fires in Abqaiq and Khurais highlights that this drone has a large explosive yield.\u201d", "description": "Saudi Arabia has shut down approximately half of its oil production capacity after \u201ccoordinated drone strikes on facilities in  Eastern Province\u201d set blazes at the Hijra Khurais oil field and Abqaiq, the world\u2019s largest oil stabilisation facility, the Wall Street Journal reported....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
