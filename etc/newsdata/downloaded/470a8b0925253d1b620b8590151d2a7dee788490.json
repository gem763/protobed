If they don\u2019t, that suggests they\u2019re not legitimate asylum-seekers fleeing persecution but rather regular migrants seeking better jobs or to unite with family \u2014 which are not usually valid reasons for asylum under U.S. law.\n\nAlthough the high court\u2019s move isn\u2019t a final decision on the merits and the case is still pending, President Trump celebrated the court\u2019s order on Twitter.\n\nHogan Gidley, principal deputy press secretary, said the court\u2019s move Wednesday will help the broken asylum system.\n\n\u201cThis greatly helps build on the progress we\u2019ve made addressing the crisis at our southern border and will ultimately make American communities safer. The district court\u2019s erroneous nationwide injunction was another in a series of overreaching orders that allowed a single, non-elected district court judge to override policy decisions for the entire nation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lifting of the injunction comes just days after a federal court reinstated it on Monday, siding with immigrant rights groups who challenged the policy over the summer.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously said the injunction could only reach as far as its jurisdiction, which includes nine states.\n\nBut the Monday ruling by U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar for the Northern District of California, an Obama-appointee, attempted to expand the injunction across the country, saying it was the only remedy to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cWhile many of these clients cross the border in the Ninth Circuit, they \u2018move between jurisdictions throughout the lifetime of their asylum case,\u2019\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union quickly filed suit a day after the administration issued the rule in July, arguing the policy unlawfully closed the door at the southern border to individuals fleeing persecution.\n\nAccording to Fox News, as of March this year there were more than 327,000 asylum applications pending. By comparison, there were 35,811 claims in 2009.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
