I love the little syrniki,\" Bencic gushed in her press conference.\n\nKremlin Cup 2019 winner Belinda Bencic: \u2018I love Russian tournaments, I love Russian breakfasts, I especially love syrniki (cottage cheese pancakes)\u2019 #KremlinCup#Moscow \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udfbe pic.twitter.com/10avAtToLA \u2014 Danny Armstrong (@DannyWArmstrong) October 20, 2019\n\nFollowing her win over French player Mladenovic, Bencic took time out to speak to RT Sport about her emotions in reaction to qualifying for the WTA Tour Finals, the annual at end-of-season tournament contested by the world's top-ranked players.\n\n\u201cMy emotions are over the top I can't believe it's over and I finally reached it... But obviously my celebration on the court was for the Moscow finals but as well for a spot in Shenzhen,\" she said.\n\nBy virtue of her heroics in Moscow, Bencic currently sits in 7th place in the WTA rankings, somewhere she insists she plans to stay after last entering the world top 10 in 2016, only to quickly exit.\n\nBencic also spoke about her 20-time Grand Slam winning compatriot Roger Federer, with whom she partnered in a successful 2018 and 2019 Hopman Cup campaign, saying he would love to play Russian world no. 4 Daniil Medvedev on Moscow's Red Square, should the two get the opportunity.\n\nIn a prior interview with RT, Medvedev said his 'dream match' would take place against Federer at the iconic landmark in his hometown.\n\n\"Well I definitely think so! I mean, it\u2019s a very nice opportunity for Daniil to maybe make it happen,\" Bencic said.\n\n\"He\u2019s been dominating the tour in the last month pretty amazingly so big well done to him, he\u2019s a very smart and intelligent player. So i hope they can somehow agree to it.\"\n\n\u201cMy dream match in my dream place for me would definitely be Wimbledon final. So that\u2019s enough for me,\u201d she added.\n\nBencic is one of a number of new players that represent a new generation in women's tennis alongside others such as 15-year-old American Coco Gauff and 19-year-old Canadian US Open champ Bianca Andreescu.\n\nStill herself only 22, Bencic herself has previously predicted those players will eventually \"naturally\" replace veterans such as Serena Williams.\n\nAway from women's tennis, Bencic is a self-proclaimed fan of the men's game and has described the emerging rivalry between Medvedev and Federer as \"amazing\" for the sport.\n\n\"It's very good how the top three they are unbelievable legends, they are on the top forever and the younger guys they have a very difficult job to overtake their place because they are just that amazing,\" she said.\n\n\"I really love to watch men's tennis and it's really good to see them all competing now and the younger guys you know challenging the older ones and the older ones not letting them take their place. For me it's very entertaining as a fan.\"\n\nBencic is the top-ranked Swiss player in the women's game, as is Federer in the men's, but the Flawil-native says there is no such rivalry between her and perhaps the greatest player of all time.\n\n\"I definitely don't think I can be a rival for Roger Federer,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think anyone can be. So definitely not.\n\n\"I\u2019m just incredibly grateful I got to meet him in Hopman Cup and you know what, he has been telling me the tips he gave me the experience to play next to him and also to spend some time with him on the tournament it's for me amazing and for all Switzerland and for tennis I think he\u2019s just been amazing.\"\n\nIn the men's final played directly after Bencic's win over Pavlyuchenkova, emerging Russian star Andrey Rublev bettered Frenchman and 2018 finalist Adrian Mannarino in straight sets 6-4, 6-1.\n\nRublev bagged his first ever Kremlin Cup title on his 22nd birthday, to a chorus of 'happy birthday' chants from the crowd, and described the experience as his \"best birthday ever.\"", "description": "After winning the Kremlin Cup 2019 in Moscow on Sunday, Swiss tennis world no. 10  Belinda Bencic declared her love for Russia, the country's tournaments and her penchant for Russian breakfast, especially 'syrniki'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5dad998485f54017343b0751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-23"}
