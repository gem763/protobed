Being a tech-focused bunch here at Gizmodo, we're keen on covering the nerdier flavour of inclusions on offer here.\n\nThis article has been sponsored by Kia, getting you on the road in tech-laden style.\n\nFirst thing's first, let's get the basics out of the way. Set to hit Australia in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Kia Seltos is on the larger side of the compact SUV scale and comes in a few different models with varying features and interiors. The base model comes with 16-inch alloy wheels, auto headlights, reversing camera, autonomous auto braking, lane-keeping assist, and cruise control. The next version bumps up the alloy wheels to 17-inches, adds climate control, and a full-sized spare tire.\n\nThe next model up adds some nice little things like fake leather interiors, heated seats, a proximity key, privacy glass, and some more driver assistance tech, including blind-spot monitors and front parking sensors. The top-line model has all of the above and adds 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, seat ventilation, rain-sensing wipers, some wild mood lighting that we'll get into a little later, and some other advanced stuff we'll look at as well.\n\nIn terms of design, the Seltos features some pretty sharp lines, a diamond-pattern grille, and, comparatively, is around the same size as the Nissan Qashqai. Base models have a 2-litre engine, while the top one will feature a 1.6-litre turbo engine capable of going from 0 to 100 in just 8 seconds. Ok, onto the techy stuff.\n\nThe base model comes with an 8-inch touchscreen featuring both Apple Car Play and Android Auto, but you can jack that up to a 10.25-inch screen in more advanced models which is just 0.25 inches short of having an iPad on the dashboard. In either option, the HD touchscreens come with Kia's most advanced operating system to dates, with split-screen functionality which allows you to control and monitor a number of features or applications at the same time, which is both handy and safer than having to fiddle with multiple apps while driving.\n\nIf you opt for the top-line model, you'll also get a wireless Qi fast charger in a specifically designed spot for your phone, a nifty 8-inch head-up display for important information like speed, navigation, and speed limits, a 7-inch digital instrument readout, and the aforementioned LED mood lighting. If you're into that kind of thing, you'll be able to customise the interior lighting with 8 different colours and 6 themes. We've seen coloured cabins before in a $200k Mercedes-Benz in the past, but Kia's stepped it up a level offering themed lighting that can also pulse to the beat of your music. Necessary, no. Fun? Absolutely.\n\nThe Seltos also features a Bluetooth multilink, which allows the connection of 2 devices simultaneously, and an 8-speaker BOSE sound system for pumping out bangers while you drive. Kia is making a pretty big deal about these speakers, and whilst we haven't heard them, BOSE has a pretty solid reputation for going hard. It also features speed-sensing technology, so the volume will automatically adjust according to your speed to account for road noise.\n\nThe compact SUV starts at $25,990 driveaway, with the top model clocking in at $39,990 driveaway. If car tech is something that's important to you, the Kia Seltos is certainly one to keep an eye on.", "description": "Kia is ready to take on the compact SUV market with its sleek new car, the Seltos, with a name derived from Greek mythology and an interior packed with features.
