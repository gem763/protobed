This agreement with the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel is a major step, and one that we hoped for a long time would be possible,\u201d Jim Murren, chairman and chief executive of MGM Resorts said in a statement.", "description": "Survivors and family of 58 people who were slain in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history have reached a settlement of at least $735 million with MGM Resorts, a law firm representing the victims and MGM Resorts International said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436688674&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9219Y"}
