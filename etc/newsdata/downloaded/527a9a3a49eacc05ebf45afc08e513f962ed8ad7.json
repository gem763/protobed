It's moving backwards, \" she told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nThe ACCC's heavy reliance on consent would only result in Facebook \"bombarding users with notifications about how their data is being used.\"\n\n\"We very much support providing transparency to users about how their data is being used ... But the ACCC's recommendation to really go all in in the direction of providing detailed notice and requiring consent for every particular data use is not in line with global best practices.\n\n\"We know from our own experience that people don't pay attention to the notifications that bombard them when they sign up to a service, or to the long terms and conditions and privacy policies that they have to agree to,\" Ms Claybaugh said.\n\nGlobal consistency is important because people deserve to know that their data will be protected wherever it goes around the world. \u2014 Melinda Claybaugh\n\nInstead of simply bombarding users with even more notifications, as the ACCC has recommended, Ms Claybaugh said obligations should be placed on companies to provide meaningful transparency and controls to people over the course of any interaction they have with the service.\n\n\"Companies shouldn't consider that they can simply get away with getting consent from someone by putting a bunch of terms in front of them, getting them to click, and that's it,\" she said\n\n\"That's not a good privacy outcome. It puts all the burden on people to read and digest and understand, rather than on the companies, which is where it should be.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook itself had implemented the GDPR's privacy policies for all its users globally, and if it were forced to implement the ACCC's recommendations, it believes it would only lead to confusion for users, and to the balkanisation of the internet.\n\n\"Global consistency is important because people deserve to know that their data will be protected wherever it goes around the world. And it's important that organisations will have a clear set of rules to follow around the world,\" Ms Claybaugh said.\n\n\"There will always be local differences, and that's appropriate, but if the rules start to diverge in really fundamental ways, it leads to a place of fragmented services, of different services being offered in different countries, and a fragmentation of the internet.\"", "description": "Facebook, the company behind the most infamous privacy violations of the 21st century, is looking to tell Australian regulators how to do their job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3473%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_605%2C$y_179/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e2b2c4f98c01958a1ad926403649a6825cf983b6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
