This isn\u2019t a goodbye forever, but we are going move forward and switch to drinks that remind us of fall.\n\nWe start to crave darker liquors such as bourbon and brandy, cozy fruit flavors, like apple and blood orange, as well as spices such as ginger and chile, to help us warm up and ward off the chill in the air. Or, if it\u2019s still hot where you are, at least get you in a festive mind-set.\n\nWhether you\u2019ve got a holiday feast or a quiet night in, here are cocktails to fit every mood and occasion.\n\nApple Brandy Sour, above. When you\u2019re done apple picking, head back inside for this tart and tasty tribute to fall.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nSangrita de Fruta. This riff off a nonalcoholic chaser becomes a nice little cocktail in its own right. Eliminating tomato juice lets other flavors such as pomegranate come through in making this \u201csangrita\u201d\u2014 which in Spanish means \u201clittle blood\u201d \u2014 a spicy, fruity number.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nBlood Orange and Bourbon Boulevardier. This wintry drink is a lot like a negroni but with whiskey instead of gin. Blood orange adds its signature color \u2014 and edge.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nHot Buttered Apple Brandy. When you\u2019re facing a nippy evening, this warm, apple pie-like drink will do the trick to warm you up. Vanilla, butter, apple brandy, orange zest and chai blend together to make a very cozy sipper.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nCranberry-Ginger Punch. Looking for a great party punch? Orange, cranberry, ginger liqueur plus a bottle of sparkling wine make an easy-to-please, amber drink.\n\n\n\n(Jennifer Chase for The Washington Post)\n\nFig Brandy and Brandied Figs. Do this today! Why? Because you\u2019ve got to soak those figs for at least a month to infuse them with flavor \u2014 and you\u2019ll add deep, complex layers to the brandy, as well. The brandy keeps for a year; the figs will be eaten up fast!\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nThanksgiving Daiquiri. Save some of your cranberry sauce and mix it up with rum and lime for this very on-brand cocktail.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nCrimson Crane. Bourbon and cr\u00e8me de cacao pair unexpectedly well with cranberry juice in this smooth drink.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nBitter Harbor. Tawny port and mezcal complement each other beautifully with just a hint of Gran Classico Bitter to bind them.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nCocoa Smoke. Chocolate, mezcal and a hit of ancho chile? So mysterious, so intriguing, so perfectly fall.\n\nMore on Voraciously:\n\n6 sweet or savory bread pudding recipes for breakfast, dinner or dessert\n\nThe secret to a deeply flavorful vegetarian soup: Dried porcini mushrooms\n\n6 spectacular sauce recipes to improve almost any meal", "description": "Get yourself in an armchair with smoking slippers and one of these autumnal cocktails.", "authors": ["Kari Sonde", "Editorial Aide For Food", "October At Pm", "Kari Sonde Is The Editorial Aide For The Food Section", "Where She Helps With Recipes", "Cooking Questions", "Food Styling.
