We're all spending the day together.\n\n\"They chose to go to the theme park - all of the rollercoasters have already been picked.\"\n\n(Image: Holly Cross/Triangle News)\n\n(Image: Holly Cross/Triangle News)\n\nBanker Mr Higgins chose to sign up to Anthony Nolan register because he saw his office crush Kate, 31 - who he went on to marry - in the queue.\n\nIn a bizarre coincidence, the pair honeymooned in the same hotel - Shangri-La's Le Touessrok Resort & Spain Mauritius - that Rupert's parents Holly and banker Toby, 44, did.\n\n\"And Rupert was a honeymoon baby - so it's unbelievable,\" said Holly, of Hemel Hempstead, Buckinghamshire.\n\n(Image: Holly Cross/Triangle News)\n\n(Image: Holly Cross/Triangle News)\n\nThe grateful mum had to wait two years to get in touch with the anonymous donor who'd saved Rupert after being a 10/10 match.\n\n\"I contacted the Anthony Nolan Register to say I'd like to get in touch with the donor and I got a reply with his name and email address,\" she added.\n\n\"I bought a thank you card but it took me a year to send it as I didn't know what to say - what could I write to the selfless stranger who'd saved my boy's life?\n\n(Image: Holly Cross/Triangle News)\n\n(Image: Ash Knotek)\n\n\"It was such a massive thing that he had done - he had to have a general anesthetic and have a lumbar puncture to donate his bone marrow.\"\n\nShe added: \"They're always going to be part of our lives.\n\n\"Billy is a hero, and if it wasn't for Kate none of this would have happened so we're just so grateful to both of them.\"\n\nRupert is now back at school and has made a complete recovery.\n\nHe now joins Holly running round the park - and beats her.\n\nHolly added: \"I don't mind. I saw him lying in an isolation ward looking so ill so I'm happy he's well enough to go faster than me.\"", "description": "Thrillseeker Rupert Cross and his 'Superman' bone marrow donor Billy Higgins are due to visit Thorpe Park together later this month", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Anthony Nolan Triangle News", "Holly Cross Triangle News", "Ash Knotek"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541694.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Rupert_Cross_Roller_Coaster_3_TRIANGLENEWS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
