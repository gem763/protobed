Schumer, New York Democrat, said, calling it a \u201cdiatribe.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leaders said they decided to leave because the president was treating Mrs. Pelosi disrespectfully.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steny Hoyer said he\u2019s worked with six presidents, and \u201cnever had I seen a president treat so disrespectfully a co-equal branch.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who emerged from the White House said Democrats were the ones who behaved poorly.\n\nIf Mrs. Pelosi had stayed behind instead of storming out, she would have seen a productive meeting in which generals outlined plans to keep a small residual force in Syria to protect U.S. interests, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.\n\nMr. McCarthy scolded the speaker, saying it\u2019s \u201cunbecoming\u201d of her to walk out of meetings, even if they get heated.\n\n\u201cI do not believe in that process, you get up and walk away,\u201d said the California Republican, noting there were some congressional Democrats who stayed in the room.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump walked out of an infrastructure meeting with Democrats at the White House out of frustration with investigations into his presidency.\n\nOn Wednesday, members of Congress went to the White House moments after the House rebuked Mr. Trump for pulling U.S. troops from the path of a Turkish incursion on American-allied Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria.\n\nMembers of both parties say the move will invite chaos, undermine faith in American troops and allow the Islamic State to reemerge.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said Mr. Trump appeared to be \u201cshaken\u201d by the congressional rebuke.\n\nMr. Schumer also said Mr. Trump, as a New Yorker who\u2019s seen terrorism firsthand, should understand the threat that ISIS fighters pose.\n\nHe asked Mr. Trump for a plan to secure ISIS prisoners who escape near the Turkey-Syria border, but \u201che didn\u2019t really have one.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
