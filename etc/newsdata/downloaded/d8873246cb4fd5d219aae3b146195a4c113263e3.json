News\n\nDistributing merch with his face on it\n\nAlso at Drake's 32nd birthday bash were reportedly these airbrushed shirts with the young 6 God's face on them.\n\nNothing like some personalized party favors depicting yourself as an adolescent to help your guests remember the good times.\n\nThrowing himself another bar mitzvah\n\nDrake did have a bar mitzvah at 13. But the accompanying celebration wasn't as elaborate as he would have liked.\n\n\"When I had a bar mitzvah back in the day, my mom didn't really have that much money,\" the rapper said in a 2012 video . \"We kinda just did it in the basement of an Italian restaurant, which I guess is kinda like a faux pas.\"\n\n\"I told myself that if I ever got rich, I'd throw myself a re-bar mitzvah,\" he added.\n\nSo at the age of 31, he did just that.\n\nThe party featured red solo cups with the words \"Aubrey's Re-Bar Mitzvah\" printed on the side to pizza boxes that read \"Papi's Pizzeria.\"", "description": "Drake turns 33 years old on Thursday, and while some people might simply consider this a marker of having completed another full rotation around the sun, this is Drake we're talking about.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190416160937-drake-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
