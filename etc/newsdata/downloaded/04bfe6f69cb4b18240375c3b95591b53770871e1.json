Someone I had known for 10 years. There was absolutely no reason that person should have been in the room. No reason they should have given me any sort of flash drive.\"\n\nAsked by the BBC whether there were state secrets on the drive, as the prosecution maintains, Mr Whelan said he had \"no idea\".\n\n\"I never looked at it. I didn't know I had it until I was arrested. This is 100% a provocation, and a really bad one,\" he said.\n\nDefence lawyer Vladimir Zherebenkov also described the case as \"provocation\", adding that he has seen no proof so far of his client's guilt.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @sarahrainsford As the judge read out his verdict, Paul Whelan told him 'I can speak louder' and carried on calling the case against him 'nonsense'. pic.twitter.com/soSdtfbwMw \u2014 Sarah Rainsford (@sarahrainsford) September 17, 2019 Report\n\nMr Whelan's frustration, meanwhile, is clearly increasing, our correspondent adds.\n\nWhen the judge returned to read his verdict - that he should be kept in custody, ahead of trial - Mr Whelan raised his voice to denounce the case as \"garbage\".\n\nMr Whelan, who said he had been assaulted by a doctor and refused medical treatment, also called on all four governments - whose passport he holds - for their help.\n\nWhy was he arrested?\n\nMr Whelan arrived in Russia on 22 December to attend a wedding and had planned to visit St Petersburg in addition to Moscow before flying home on 6 January, his brother told the BBC.\n\nHe was arrested in Moscow on 28 December after taking a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums.\n\nThe FSB said he was detained \"during an act of espionage\".\n\nMr Whelan's Russian lawyer said the arrest was made after he was unwittingly handed a memory stick containing state secrets.\n\nWho is he?\n\nMr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents but moved to the US as a child. He is currently director of global security for Michigan-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner.\n\nHis brother said Mr Whelan had been visiting Russia for business and pleasure since 2007.\n\nMr Whelan joined the Marine Reserves in 1994 and rose to the rank of staff sergeant in 2004. He served in Iraq for several months in 2004 and 2006.\n\nHe was convicted in a 2008 court martial on charges related to larceny and received a bad-conduct discharge.
