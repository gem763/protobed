Authorities in Charlton went to the location Michael Jones mentioned and found bodies there, to the Brantley County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nMarion County Sheriff Billy Woods said the bodies are believed to be those of the four children.\n\n\"Unfortunately, true evil poked its head up here in Marion County. That's about the only best way to describe it,\" Woods said Monday afternoon.\n\nDetectives said they believe Michael Jones murdered the family in Marion County and stored the bodies at his home and in his van for several weeks before transporting them to Brantley County, Georgia.\n\nWoods said he hopes Michael Jones gets the punishment he deserves.\n\n\"He has no right to walk on the face of this Earth, and I'd hate to be him when he stands before the Lord,\" Woods said.\n\nDeputies said family members had been communicating with someone they thought was Casei Jones but it was probably Michael Jones using her phone, which is why they waited so long to report her and her children missing. Authorities are investigating the phone records.\n\nRecords show a second-degree murder warrant was issued for Michael Jones' arrest. Additional charges could be forthcoming.\n\nWoods told WKMG his deputies were on their way to Brantley County, where they were going to execute a search warrant on the van Casei's was found in.\n\nHe also said Michael was facing charges in Georgia, and his office was working with law enforcement there to bring Jones back to Marion County to be prosecuted for all five deaths.", "description": "Florida authorities call it case of \"pure evil\" as bodies of Casei Jones and her 4 children found weeks after they went missing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/ff717fba-a2e9-4968-a9bd-4a9908c01111/thumbnail/1200x630/cf729f3069b0fb939597cfee8f80c615/casei-jones-and-her-4-kids.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
