Millions of lives will be saved.\u201d\n\nPence and Erdo\u011fan agree on ceasefire plan but Kurds reject 'occupation' Read more\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, also scored a quick win. The threat of US administration sanctions was suspended and his occupation of the Turkish-Syrian border zone was given an extra layer of respectability.\n\nOtherwise it was hard to pinpoint what the 13-point document produced in Ankara actually meant. It was agreed between Turkey and the US, which has withdrawn its troops from the contested area.\n\nWashington had been in touch with the actual combatants on the ground, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), but appears to have sold them a completely different deal.\n\nThe SDF commander, Mazloum Kobani, said he had agreed with the Americans that there would be a ceasefire in two areas about 100km apart, along the border where there was heavy fighting, Ras al-Ain, and Tal Abyad.\n\n\u201cAs far as he is concerned the ceasefire is only where there\u2019s active fighting and he totally rejects the idea of any kind of withdrawal, any removal of heavy weapons,\u201d said Charles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute. \u201cSo everyone seems to be talking a different language, which can only spell more trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Ankara document envisages a 120-hour ceasefire in a \u201csafe zone\u201d that would be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish armed forces\u201d. The size of this \u201csafe zone\u201d is not defined. The phrase had been used to define a narrow strip of land along the border that was jointly patrolled by the Turks and US troops under an agreed joint security mechanism.\n\nQuick guide What is happening in north-eastern Syria? Show Hide Who is in control in north-eastern Syria? Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus. That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now. How did the SDF come to control the region? Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers. Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds? For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey. Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.\n\nWhat are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border? Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region. Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border. How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis? Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria. SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.\n\nOn 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials. It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside. Michael Safi\n\nBy invading, Erdogan had swept that mechanism aside, but in Ankara, Pence allowed the Turks to hijack the terms to refer to their area of occupation. Ankara said it would stretch 440 km from the Euphrates river to the Iraqi border, and 32km (20 miles) deep into Syria, up to the M4 highway which runs east-west across the region. The Turkish foreign minister said that across that whole area, Kurdish forces would have to hand over their heavy arms and withdraw.\n\nThat is a fair description of Erdogan\u2019s maximalist war aims for his \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d. By explicitly accepting those terms, the US signalled acquiescence to the long-term Turkish aim of creating a buffer zone in north-eastern Syria, by removing much of the Kurdish population and resettling the area with Syrian Arab refugees.\n\nColin Kahl, a former senior White House official in the Obama administration, who was extensively involved in dealing with the Kurds and Turkey, said he had assumed that the Turkish forces would aim to control just majority Arab areas in the north-east, but that this agreement suggested bigger ambitions.\n\n\u201cIf they really think they\u2019re going to push the Kurds all the way back to behind the M4 highway, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a huge population transfer,\u201d Kahl said. \u201cIt would involve massive ethnic cleansing essentially.\u201d\n\nIn hailing the deal, Trump not only adopted Turkish talking points but even seemed to embrace the language of ethnic cleansing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there that they couldn\u2019t have. They suffered a lot of loss of lives and they had to have it cleaned out,\u201d the president said. \u201cThis outcome is something they\u2019ve been trying to get for 10 years.\u201d\n\nWhat his letter to Erdo\u011fan tells us about Donald Trump Read more\n\nSo when Trump had boasted \u201cpeople have been trying to make this \u2018deal\u2019 for many years\u201d, the people he was talking about were Erdo\u011fan and his military leadership. Until now no one was prepared to give them deal. Certainly not the Kurds who live there.\n\nPence claimed the US would work with the YPG (the dominant Kurdish element within the SDF) to carry out an \u201corderly withdrawal\u201d from the 32km zone. He even said it was already under way on Thursday evening. But the YPG showed no readiness to surrender that territory.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cgreat day for civilisation\u201d may not last very much longer than a day or two at best. For its part the US Senate seemed particularly unconvinced.\n\nThe Republican senator and usual Trump loyalist Marco Rubio said on Twitter that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear the \u2018ceasefire\u2019 signals change in Erdogan\u2019s goal. He still plans to rid area of Kurds and create a \u2018security zone\u2019, but it\u2019s giving Kurds an ultimatum: they can leave voluntarily or leave dead.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic senator Chris Murphy was even more blunt. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: this essentially gives Erdo\u011fan everything he wants \u2013 it ratifies a Turkish takeover of a huge swath of the country and calls on the Kurds to abandon their territory or else the slaughter will continue,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a diplomatic victory \u2013 it\u2019s the capstone on Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds.\u201d\n\nThe choice of 120 hours for the length of ceasefire may not have been an accident. In five days Erdo\u011fan is due to fly to Moscow to meet Putin. That is where the real outline of a settlement will be hammered out, argued Jennifer Cafarella, researcher director at the Institute for the Study of War. \u201cSo basically the threat of US sanctions will help Russia get a deal,\u201d Cafarella wrote on Twitter. \u201cMazloum is likely betting that the negotiation between Russia and Turkey that will occur at the end of those five days will produce an outcome he can live with.\u201d", "description": "Trump hails ceasefire and \u2018safe zone\u2019 on Turkey-Syria border as \u2018great day for civilisation\u2019 but few believe it", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5567375858bc61566d3fa349229b4b2cf0af8c32/0_32_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e79f912e265dc1835cd82b88c53b096", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
