Dolphins have no comment. Story coming with help from @CameronWolfe \u2014 Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) September 13, 2019\n\nReport: Dolphins seek \u2018significant return\u2019\n\nMortensen\u2019s partner on the story Cameron Wolfe reports that the Dolphins aren\u2019t actively shopping Fitzpatrick and that they would seek a \u201csignificant\u201d return if a potential trade partner expressed interest.\n\nDolphins have given 2018 1st round pick Minkah Fitzpatrick permission to seek a trade, but they are not actively shopping him. They want a significant return to trade him. Fitzpatrick has been unhappy with his role with defense for months. Story with @mortreport coming shortly. \u2014 Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) September 13, 2019\n\nCould a deal happen?\n\nThe reports add up to a trade being a long shot.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiami drafted Fitzpatrick, a versatile defensive back out of Alabama, with the 11th pick of the 2018 draft. So far he\u2019s not lived up to his lofty draft status, and it sounds like the Dolphins aren\u2019t considering parting with him without recouping the price of the draft pick they spent on him \u2014 a price a trade partner would be unlikely to pay.\n\nBut the news reinforces that things are exceptionally bad in Miami with a franchise that\u2019s obviously tanking despite claiming otherwise.\n\nThe Dolphins have so stripped down their roster in the name of compiling draft picks and the alleged pursuit of the No. 1 draft pick that there\u2019s talk that this may be the worst team in NFL history \u2014 after one week.\n\nOn the off chance that the Dolphins do find a trade partner, Fitzpatrick would be the second talented young player the Dolphins recently jettisoned after the team traded starting left tackle and 2016 first-round draft pick Laremy Tunsil to the Houston Texans.\n\nMinkah Fitzpatrick reportedly wants out of Miami. (Getty)\n\nIs tanking like this worth it?\n\nThe Dolphins got a haul in return for Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills from the Houston Texans that included a pair of first-round draft picks.\n\nWith potential game-changing Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa expected to come of the board first in next year\u2019s draft and the stockpile of draft assets the Dolphins have acquired, there\u2019s a reasonable debate over the merits of their strategy. There is upside to be gained in the future.\n\nBut at what cost?\n\nIf they draft Tagovailoa and can\u2019t protect him, then what\u2019s the point. And what about the physical toll now on players of fielding a subpar NFL team?\n\nFitzpatrick has reportedly been unhappy with his role in Miami. His mom even went to Twitter to complain during the preseason that he shouldn\u2019t be lined up at strong safety.\n\nFitzpatrick may be unhappy playing that position. But it can\u2019t help that he\u2019s doing so for a laughing stock of a team.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "2018 first-round pick Minkah Fitzpatrick is reportedly ready to be done with the Dolphins.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/55k_u7W731D4ipP8ViD_Nw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzEuNDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V1UbPNiL0j53RhU8_xznmg--~B/aD0yMDQzO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/702866b0-d5df-11e9-af7f-f1523b07df61", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
