A former letter carrier, Brennan steadily rose to the top of the postal agency over a 33-year career.\n\nTrump repeatedly told aides earlier this year that he wanted to remove Brennan, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. The president had \u201ccomplained to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about his frustrations with Brennan,\u201d the paper reported, citing a source familiar with the discussions.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Sept. 15, 2011 file photo, Postmaster General Megan Brennan is seen in Washington.\n\nA White House spokesman refuted the suggestion that Brennan\u2019s retirement had anything to do with Trump, telling the Post that \u201cthis insinuation is so false that no one had the guts to go on the record with it.\u201d\n\nThe Postal Service and Brennan herself characterized her impending departure as a run-of-the-mill retirement.\n\n\u201cWhen I was appointed Postmaster General, I made a commitment to the Board of Governors that I would serve for five years and it has been my absolute honor to do so,\u201d Brennan, who is 57, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI feel a deep responsibility to this organization and to its future.\u201d\n\nBrennan also expressed deep gratitude to the employees of the postal agency.\n\n\u201cI have had the privilege to work with you over the course of my 33-year career. You embody the spirit of public service, you earn the trust of the American people every day, and you continually reinforce my reverence for this institution and my abiding belief in our mission,\u201d she said.\n\nBREAKING: @USPS Postmaster General Megan Brennan announces retirement after a 33-year career at the agency. Board of Governors will look for a successor \"in the months to come.\" pic.twitter.com/2ZDVc22ACY \u2014 Jory Heckman (@jheckmanWFED) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Postal Service Board of Governors, a majority of whom are Trump appointees, said they\u2019re searching for Brennan\u2019s replacement.\n\nHer successor will face the same daunting financial challenges that Brennan encountered.\n\nThe Postal Service, a quasi-governmental agency that receives no federal funding for operating expenses, has reported net losses for 12 consecutive years. Brennan warned lawmakers in May that the agency could run out of cash by 2024.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the Postal Service could boost its coffers if it charges higher shipping rates to online retailers like Amazon, one of USPS\u2019 biggest customers. Trump has lambasted what he\u2019s described as an imbalanced relationship between the retail giant and the Postal Service, which he\u2019s disparaged as Amazon\u2019s \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201d\n\nWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017\n\nI am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u2019t have a clue (or do they?)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018\n\nBrennan reportedly rebuffed Trump\u2019s suggestion to increase the Postal Service\u2019s Amazon rates on multiple occasions in 2017 and 2018, explaining to the president she believed Amazon\u2019s business is critical to the agency\u2019s bottom line.\n\nBrennan has repeatedly appealed to Congress to take legislative action to help the Postal Service address what she said were pressing challenges.\n\nDuring testimony before the House Oversight Committee in April, Brennan said a congressional mandate requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund retiree health benefits was a major source of financial strain. She suggested requiring USPS retirees to enroll in Medicare and giving the agency more freedom to raise rates on some services.\n\n\u201cOur financial situation is very serious, but solvable,\u201d Brennan told lawmakers. \u201cThe need to adopt urgent legislative and regulatory reforms is simply too important to delay.\u201d", "description": "Brennan, the first woman to head the U.S. Postal Service, will retire in January after five years in the role.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da807362100007a1134a2fa.jpeg?cache=nyi8kohbep&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
