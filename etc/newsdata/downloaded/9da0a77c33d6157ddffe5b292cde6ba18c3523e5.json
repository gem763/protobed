The winds were moving the flames at a rate of 800 acres per hour, Los Angeles Fire Department officials said at a morning news conference.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic fire,\u201d Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters, as he urged residents in harm\u2019s way to heed evacuation orders. \u201cDo not wait to leave.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Captain Tony Imbrenda told local radio station KPCC that high winds also were making it more difficult to effectively fight the flames from the air, causing dissipation of water and fire-retardant drops before they could hit the ground.\n\nSimilarly strong winds in northern and central California prompted utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric to impose a precautionary shutoff of power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses to reduce the risk of wildfires. Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday the unprecedented measure was the fault of years of mismanagement by the utility.\n\nAt daybreak, the Saddleridge fire was still completely uncontained and its cause was under investigation.\n\nSome 23,000 homes and around 100,000 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders that were expected to remain in effect for at least a few days, fire officials said. A number of emergency shelters quickly filled to capacity.\n\nFirefighters battle a wind-driven wildfire in Sylmar, California, U.S., October 11, 2019.

At least 25 homes in two neighborhoods were destroyed early on Friday, authorities said.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said Friday it had authorized the use of federal funds to assist California in fighting the Saddleridge fire.\n\nAuthorities also fought overnight to contain the Sandalwood Fire in Riverside County, which had scorched about 820 acres near Calimesa, about 70 miles east of downtown Los Angeles by Friday morning. It was only 10% contained, Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD) officials said.\n\nThe Sandalwood fire erupted on Thursday afternoon when a garbage truck dumped burning trash that spread onto vegetation, the RCFD and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said in a statement.\n\nThe Saddleridge and Sandalwood fires were among the latest of roughly 275 wildfires that have broken out so far this year in California. They follow one of the deadliest and most destructive wildfire seasons on record in the state, one that claimed about 100 lives in 2018 and caused billions of dollars in property damage.\n\nPOWER CUTS\n\nMuch of Northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remained under a statewide \u201cred flag\u201d fire alert for heightened fire danger on Friday.\n\nFirefighters have been able to quickly contain most of the other blazes around the state.\n\nBy late Thursday, PG&E announced it had restored power to more than half of its customers whose power was turned off, and that 312,000 remained without electricity.\n\nMore than 250,000 California households and businesses were without power on Friday morning, PowerOutage.US reported, nearly all of them PG&E customers in northern California.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nAs winds moved south Friday, a power cutoff similar to PG&E\u2019s was underway at Southern California Edison, which warned more than 173,000 customers they could face outages.", "description": "A fierce, wind-driven wildfire swept through foothills and canyons along the northern edge of Los Angeles on Friday, engulfing homes, closing roads and engulfing acre upon acre of dry brush and chaparral as 100,000 residents were forced to flee.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439806840&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0Z8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
