Much of the fear of a trade war with China is priced into markets. For investors looking for a sleeping giant in telecoms, Nokia may be just the bet.\n\nHere are three key reasons why Nokia may outperform in the next telecom sector rally:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNOK Is Ready to Rocket With 5G\n\nThe upcoming next-gen standard for mobile telecommunications service, 5G, will deliver significantly faster speed than today\u2019s 4G technology. 5G will allow users to browse data-intensive websites, such as Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, upload or download videos and use data-intensive apps. 5G can also deliver virtual reality much more quickly than the current 4G system.\n\nIn the U.S., Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) will likely be the first to offer 5G speeds. In fact, Verizon is already claiming that its 5G technology will probably deliver speeds 200 times faster than many of its 4G LTE users get now. Globally, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) will likely be the market leader in Europe.\n\nThe market for 5G will likely not take off until 2020. But when it does, users across the globe will need a brand new 5G standard smartphone. Carriers will sink billions into new 5G equipment. And Nokia will be positioned front and center in offering the new hardware across the globe.\n\nAccording to Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri speaking to Bloomberg, \u201cNokia is winning contracts quite handsomely in new 5G telecom networks as the top three suppliers go head-to-head for the emerging business.\u201d He added, \u201cWe compete quite favorably with Huawei, with or without the current security concerns,\u201d Suri said referring to Huawei Technologies, the world\u2019s largest network equipment manufacturer.\n\nThe market is now keenly focused on how far Nokia will pounce on 5G once the new standard introduced onto the global market. \u201cOnly Huawei and Nokia have full end-to-end product portfolios with wireless, fixed networks, and IP routing solutions, positioning Nokia for leadership with the top carriers as networks transition to 5G,\u201d according to Michael Walkley, telecom analyst at Canaccord Research. \u201c[W]ith Huawei still potentially banned from certain markets, we view Nokia as the only global supplier with an end-to-end solution, as evidenced by leading global carriers choosing Nokia as a partner for 5G\u201d.\n\nTight Financial Management\n\nThe history of technology paradigm shifts is filled with examples of companies throwing billions in capital down a black hole \u2014 only to face far more competition in the market and far less revenues than expected. NOK is undoubtedly spending heavily on building their 5G market lead \u2014 but with a certain degree of prudence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last earnings call, Nokia\u2019s CFO, Kristian Pullola, explained that they expect their most recent cost-savings program to result in a nearly $800 million reduction in recurring operating expenses and production overheads in 2020. So while NOK will make the massive capital investment necessary to win in the new 5G market, they are certainly keenly aware of past spending black holes \u2014 and are already implementing tight financial controls.\n\nStrong Guidance for 2020\n\nNOK has managed to meet or beat analysts\u2019 estimates in for of the last five quarters. For their latest earnings call in July, NOK sounded more confident than ever that they will grow their critical metrics across the board for 2020. Full-year revenues are estimated to move into the positive territory up to 40 cents to 46 cents EPS. NOK also expects operating margin increasing from the 9-15% estimated this year up to 12 to 16% in 2020.", "description": "After a solid earnings announcement for the second quarter announced July 29, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) shares enjoyed a brief rally, trading up to around $5.69.
