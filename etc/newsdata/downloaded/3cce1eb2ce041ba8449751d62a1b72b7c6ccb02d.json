(Find the full guide here.)\n\n77 restaurants is a record.\n\nAD\n\nThe previous five fall dining guides have contained between 37 and 53 reviews of area restaurants. (The 2016 edition had 52 Sietsema reviews, plus 10 cheap eats recommendations by Tim Carman and a list of D.C.'s top 10 bars chosen by yours truly.) Sietsema chose to visit more restaurants this time because \u201c20 years is a milestone of sorts,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe guide merited being bigger, because I had more I wanted to say in my introduction and more people and events I wanted to flag\u201d in smaller sections looking back at his tenure. \u201cThis anniversary issue gave me a chance to look back and salute all the good work that had been done on my watch and look ahead at the same time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get in Sietsema\u2019s Top 10. It\u2019s harder to stay there.\n\nEnrique Limardo\u2019s Seven Reasons went straight to No. 1 in the Latin American restaurant\u2019s first dining guide appearance. That\u2019s just one of the prominent changes to this year\u2019s Top 10. (\u201cI like to mix things up,\u201d Sietsema says.) Only two restaurants from last fall\u2019s Top 10 remain among Sietsema\u2019s admittedly personal favorites: the four-star Pineapple and Pearls and the lauded Three Blacksmiths. Three others, including last year\u2019s top pick Del Mar, are still in the guide. Momofuku, Spoken English and Kuya Ja\u2019s Lechon Belly have been dropped altogether, while Himitsu and Little Havana have closed.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story when comparing Sietsema\u2019s picks from the 2019 spring dining guide, which focused on newer restaurants. Mama Chang and Rooster & Owl are both survivors in the Top 10, while three of Sietsema\u2019s spring favorites are nowhere to be found in the fall guide: the Michelin-starred Gravitas, Estuary and, again, Little Havana. Of note: Rooster & Owl, which was Sietsema\u2019s No. 3 in the spring and No. 2 in the new guide, is the only restaurant to move up the Top 10 list.\n\nAD\n\nSo long, sweet 16.\n\nOf the 48 restaurants included in the 2018 fall dining guide, one-third did not return in 2019. This includes the two closed restaurants mentioned above, but also Little Pearl and Momofuku, both of which received three stars last year. The others that didn\u2019t make the cut: Bresca, Joselito Casa de Comidas, Kaliwa, Nasime, Q by Peter Chang, Rasa, Spoken English (all two-and-a-half stars), America Eats Tavern, Elephant Jumps, Kuya Ja\u2019s Lechon Belly, Tortino and Zenebech (two stars each).\n\nTen new additions are \u201cClassics,\u201d to mark Sietsema\u2019s platinum anniversary.\n\nAD\n\nIn contrast to the trendsetters in the Hall of Fame, Sietsema says, the new \u201cClassics\u201d section is a nod to restaurants that \u201cplay a special role in the city, not just because they\u2019ve endured for a long time in a fickle market, but because they\u2019re at least \u2018good\u2019 and add something important to the scene.\u201d Some have been reviewed in the magazine before, such as Filomena and Bombay Club, but none featured in last year\u2019s guide. Be warned: This is a section that might not stick around next year.\n\nAD\n\nThere are now 11 restaurants in the Hall of Fame.\n\nSurprise: Rasika West End joins its sister restaurant in Sietsema\u2019s list of \u201crestaurants that do what they do better than their peers.\u201d None of the restaurants in this category had ratings change, including the three-and-a-half-star Rasika West End. The Hall of Fame is home to seven of the guide\u2019s eight four-star restaurants. The other one is M\u00e9tier, which placed fourth in Sietsema\u2019s Top 10. Eric Ziebold\u2019s dining room earned four stars in 2017, was docked half a star in 2018, but is now back to a \u201csuperlative\u201d rating.\n\nAD\n\nA Michelin star isn\u2019t always enough.\n\nLittle Pearl and Gravitas both celebrated receiving their first Michelin stars this year, but neither is featured in Sietsema\u2019s new guide. Little Pearl had earned three stars in 2018, and Gravitas earned a No. 10 ranking in Sietsema\u2019s spring Top 10, but that wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cOne could argue that I liked two of Aaron Silverman\u2019s restaurants [Pineapple and Pearls and Rose\u2019s Luxury] better than Little Pearl this year,\u201d Sietsema says, \u201cor I thought Rooster & Owl was a more original, and less expensive, tasting menu experience overall than Gravitas. As I said in my introduction [to the Dining Guide], I also had to stop somewhere.\u201d Bresca, Fiola, Masseria and Plume are other Washington restaurants that earned Michelin stars but have not been featured in Sietsema\u2019s recent guides. Kinship, which has one Michelin star, returned to the dining guide after missing out in 2018.\n\nThe big mover: The Restaurant at Potowmack Farm\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChef Tarver King\u2019s Lovettsville escape made its fall dining guide debut with a three-and-a-half-star rating and the No. 5 spot in Sietsema\u2019s Top 10. Pretty impressive for a farm restaurant that first earned a mention in 2017\u2032s spring dining guide, and \u201calmost made it\u201d into the fall guide that year. King is \u201cliving the dream,\u201d Sietsema says, \u201cgetting most of his ingredients from his backyard and really putting ingredients on a pedestal, while also explaining their connection to the tasting menu. I tasted joy in his dishes.\u201d\n\nAs the dining scene grows, so do the options outside the city.\n\nThis was a banner year for restaurants outside Washington\u2019s borders. Eighteen of them \u2014 a dozen in Virginia, six in Maryland \u2014 earned a spot in the dining guide, after eight suburban restaurants were included in 2018, and nine in 2019. It\u2019s worth noting that Jaleo has locations in Bethesda and Crystal City, but only the downtown location is included in the dining guide. Similarly, Buena Vida\u2019s Clarendon location made the guide, not its Silver Spring outpost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia: Artie\u2019s, Banh Mi DC Sandwich, Buena Vida, Clarity, Inn at Little Washington, Makeda, Mama Chang, Nostos, the Restaurant at Potowmack Farm, Thai Square, Thompson Italian, Three Blacksmiths.\n\nMaryland: Charleston, El Sapo Cuban Social Club, Flamant, Il Pizzico, La Limena, Woodmont Grill.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAD", "description": "The restaurant critic's 20th dining guide features a record number of reviews, including a section of \"Classics\" that have stood the test of time.", "authors": ["Fritz Hahn", "Reporter Covering Bars", "Drinks", "Nightlife For The Washington Post'S Weekend Section"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AK9mY_02WZRyAzR-jSUgwRWu5Co=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DEBO3YGLOMI6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
