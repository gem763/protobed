We are innovating in how we deliver the news and it\u2019s working. We are growing multi-platform demand,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe question I want to ask you is why is the money not flowing to where the people are, in environments that are trusted, brand safe, with audiences that are highly engaged.\u201d\n\nThe Newsworks Executive Chair was joined on stage by four of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading digital journalists - Claire Eaton-Rutter from\u00c2 Metro.co.uk, David Tomchak at the Evening Standard, Ben Rankin from Mirror Online and the Telegraph's Robin Hough who explained how they are innovating and driving greater engagement with their respective readers.\n\nDe Groose, added: \u201cThe digital news industry is in rude health \u2013 the numbers speak for themselves \u2013 but the advertising investment has to catch up with us, and fast. Journalism needs it. More than ever.\u201d", "description": "Newsworks Executive Chair Tracy De Groose calls on advertisers to invest in \"quality content environments where real people exist\u201d", "authors": ["Image", "Newsworks"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557895.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Tracy-De-Groose.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
