The large black dot is a shadow cast by Jupiter\u2019s moon Io. (Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Kevin M. Gill)\n\nNASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft recently caught this ominous view of Jupiter, which shows a massive black spot atop the gas giant\u2019s churning clouds. Looks scary, but there\u2019s a perfectly reasonable explanation: It\u2019s a shadow cast by Jupiter\u2019s extremely volcanic moon, Io.\n\nJuno captured this stunning series of images on September 12 while participating in its 22nd perijove, or close encounter, with Jupiter. The NASA spacecraft, which arrived at the Jovian system in July 2017, is in a highly elliptical polar orbit that brings it close to the gas giant\u2019s cloud tops and then out again into deeper space.\n\nIo\u2019s shadow as it appears near Jupiter\u2019s horizon. (Image: NASA / JPL-Caltech / SwRI / MSSS / Bj\u00f6rn J\u00f3nsson)\n\nJuno was around 8000km from the surface when its JunoCam snapped these images, and the probe is now on a trajectory that will take it over eight million km away from the gas giant before swinging back again for its 23rd perijove, according to Universe Today.\n\nJuno is currently scheduled to perform around a dozen more perijoves before the mission ends in July 2021, but the mission could be extended further into the 2020s \u2014 fingers firmly crossed for that, because images such as these and others make our world go around.\n\nAn incomplete photo (hence the huge chunk missing at top right) of Jupiter showing the eclipse.

To be fair, it\u2019s more of an annular eclipse because Io\u2019s shadow is not even close to covering Jupiter\u2019s entire surface.\n\nTo be even fairer, we probably shouldn\u2019t be referring to this celestial event as an eclipse at all \u2014 it\u2019s more of a transit, similar to the way exoplanets travel across their host stars, allowing astronomers to detect them from our vantage point on Earth.\n\nIllustration showing the size of Io (left) compared to Jupiter (right). (Illustration: ThePlanets.org)\n\nStill, the shadow is quite large, all things considered; Io is only slightly larger than Earth\u2019s Moon. The large black circle is due to an optical effect in which the total size of an object\u2019s shadow, the penumbra, increases with distance from the light source, in this case the Sun.\n\nA similar thing happens on Earth during solar eclipses \u2014 an effect that was beautifully captured from space in 2016.\n\nIo is the fourth largest moon in the Solar System and the innermost of Jupiter\u2019s four Galilean moons. This volcanic moon is quite close to Jupiter, requiring just 42.5 hours to make a complete orbit.\n\nIndeed, in addition to being roughly the size of Earth\u2019s moon, Io is also at a similar distance to Jupiter \u2014 a proximity that contributes to its hyperactive geology. The gas giant\u2019s tremendous gravitational influence creates a tidal heating effect on the moon.\n\nIo is subsequently the most volcanic object in the Solar System, featuring hundreds of volcanoes that produce plumes as high as 500km above its surface.\n\nAs a final fun fact, Io\u2019s largest volcano, Loki, is predicted to erupt any moment, so there\u2019s potentially more news about this gnarly, molten moon coming in the next few days.", "description": "NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft recently caught this ominous view of Jupiter, which shows a massive black spot atop the gas giant\u2019s churning clouds.
