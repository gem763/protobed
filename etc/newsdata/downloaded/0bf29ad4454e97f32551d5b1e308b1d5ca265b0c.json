The Trump campaign is selling \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d T-shirts for $25, while the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm mocked a Democratic congressman and his wife for seeking marital counseling. And at a conference for a pro-Trump group at the president\u2019s Miami golf resort, an incendiary animated video was shown depicting Trump on a gun rampage inside a church, murdering members of the media, political rivals and a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protester.\n\nThere is a long history of sometimes rough language and deeply personal attacks in American politics, from the heated rhetoric surrounding the Clinton impeachment to campaigns that stoked racial division. And the shifting tone isn\u2019t limited to the president and his backers: At the same Minneapolis rally this month where Trump went on a swearing spree, anti-Trump protesters chanted profane and angry cheers \u2014 \u201cKill a cop, save a life!\u201d \u2014 while clashing violently with Trump supporters.\n\nAD\n\nBut the 45th president appears to be presiding over a particularly coarse period of American politics \u2014 inviting the rest of the country to splash around in the muck as he upends long-held norms of acceptable behavior.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a unique place in modern American history,\u201d said Joshua DuBois, who served in the Obama White House as a faith adviser to the president. \u201cWe have for decades had presidents who\u2019ve tried, oftentimes imperfectly, to appeal to our better angels.\u201d\n\nTrump, DuBois said, \u201chas said let\u2019s bring out the nastiness, the division, the bitterness, and let\u2019s use that as a mobilizing force and a rallying cry.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment, but the president\u2019s conservative defenders say Trump bears little responsibility for any perceived loss of civility.\n\nSome evangelicals, for example, have objected to Trump\u2019s occasional use of the epithet \u201cgoddamn,\u201d which many Christians view as blasphemy. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the evangelical Liberty University, said that he was unaware of those incidents, however, and that Trump\u2019s other profanities do not offend him, though it\u2019s not the way Falwell himself speaks in public.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s part of his personality,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing un-Christian about saying \u2018damn\u2019 or \u2018hell.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric would likely violate the school\u2019s code of conduct barring \u201coffensive or crude language directed at individuals,\u201d Falwell emphasized that the rules only apply to students on campus.\n\n\u201cSo if somebody leaves Liberty University and decides to be president, we\u2019re not going to say they\u2019re bad because they start cussing,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers are less forgiving and say it\u2019s about far more than swear words. Many of Trump\u2019s critics say his racist and racially charged language is particularly damaging.\n\nIn July, Trump tweeted that four minority congresswomen \u2014 all U.S. citizens \u2014 should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested placed from which they came.\u201d At his profanity-laden rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, the president attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) \u2014 the Somali immigrant who represents the city \u2014 as \u201can America-hating socialist\u201d and also attacked the state\u2019s population of Somali refugees, prompting \u201cboos\u201d from the crowd.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a president who is out of control, who says horrible things all the time about minorities, about marginalized populations, about vulnerable populations, and then it is amplified to all these allies the president has made,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, head of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has tracked a 30 percent increase in the number of hate groups from 2015 to 2018. \u201cYour garden variety racist or anti-Semite sees this stuff and feels justified for his or her beliefs, and so it\u2019s literally soaking all the way down the culture, from the top down.\u201d\n\nMichael Waldman, who served as chief speechwriter for president Bill Clinton during impeachment and is now president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said that Trump is smashing \u201cthe gravity and majesty of the office\u201d and that \u201chis coarseness and demagoguery are undermining his own use of the bully pulpit.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut for Trump, the inflammatory and provocative statements are often intentional. At the Minneapolis rally, he underscored this truth when he gushed to his supporters: \u201cIsn\u2019t it much better when I got off script? Isn\u2019t that better?\u201d\n\nOne of his major targets of late is Hunter Biden, who has come under scrutiny for accepting a paid position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. At a campaign rally in Dallas last week, Trump mocked Biden\u2019s struggles with drug use and said he was \u201cthrown out of the Navy like a dog\u201d \u2014 a reference to Biden\u2019s discharge from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president has also been relentless in his personal assaults on Pelosi, who dubbed Trump \u201ca pottymouth\u201d after his expletive-filled Minneapolis rally. Following a fraught meeting at the White House last week, which ended with some Democrats walking out, Pelosi described Trump as having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d \u2014 prompting Trump to fire back on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast!\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThere is either something wrong with her \u2018upstairs,\u2019 or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today.\u201d\n\nTrump has also moved boundaries in more risque directions. At one point during his rally in Minneapolis, the president performed a mock conversation between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, two senior FBI employees who exchanged anti-Trump text messages while they were having an affair.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c \u2018I love you, Peter.\u2019 \u2018I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking imagined dialogue between the two that crescendoed into breathless panting.\n\nRalph Reed, a conservative Christian activist who is working on a book, \u201cFor God and Country,\u201d about how evangelicals are morally correct in supporting Trump and his policies, said that the current moment is not alarming when viewed through the long arc of American history.\n\n\u201cThis is not a crisis on the level of Watergate, the Civil War or the Vietnam War,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling but it\u2019s not exactly a red light on the dashboard of danger to civil order. We\u2019ve seen much worse and we\u2019ve lived through much worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nAD\n\nPeter Wehner, a Trump critic who served in the past three Republican administrations and is a visiting professor at Duke University, said one irony of Trump\u2019s behavior is that, for years, conservatives had anointed themselves the unofficial gatekeepers of public morality.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time it was Republicans and social conservatives who spoke most forcefully about the state and condition of our culture, including our political and civic culture,\u201d Wehner said. \u201cThey were the ones that made the argument that politics matters in part because it helped set the tone for a nation. Donald Trump is dragging that down.\u201d\n\nCritics on both sides point to what they see as a general debasement of standards by the other.\n\nIn Minneapolis, an anti-Trump protester spotted a lone man in a blue parka as he left the rally by himself and shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a Nazi over here!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA small group of protesters surrounded the man and pulled his ball cap off his head. As he frantically tried to fend them off, a young man walked up and slapped him across the face. The rallygoer scuffled with the protesters and repeatedly tried to run away as they chased him, throwing punches.\n\nAD\n\nMany of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls have also begun using foul language, with Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, often leading the charge in what appears to be an effort to convey passion and authenticity. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), one of the congresswomen attacked by Trump, generated controversy earlier this year when she urged her supporters to \u201cimpeach the motherf---er,\u201d referencing Trump.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at a Trump rally last week in Texas, one of his allies seemed to attempt to channel the president himself. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R), an honorary chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign, warmed up the crowd by mocking \u201cthe rabble\u201d on the Democratic presidential debate stage a couple nights earlier.\n\n\u201cThe progressive left, they are not our opponents \u2014 they are our enemy,\u201d Patrick said.\n\nHe went on to malign O\u2019Rourke as \u201ca moron\u201d and to coin his own nickname for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the impeachment inquiry: \u201cAdam bull-Schiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bull-Schiff, all the time,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI was careful with my words. My pastor\u2019s watching.\u201d", "description": "The president has taken his harsh rhetoric and divisive tactics to a new level since impeachment proceedings began \u2014 and he appears to be pulling a significant part of the country along with him.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UI0w65FbIyRKyF-OiuRfdWLFJOE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MHVRPQXVEAI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
