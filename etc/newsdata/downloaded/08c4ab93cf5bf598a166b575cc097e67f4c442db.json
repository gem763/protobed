Oh boy, do we have a contest for you at the Westminster Arena this week. Only... we can\u2019t tell you who the sides are: anyone could be deselected from Boris Johnson\u2019s team at any moment; Seumas Milne and Justine Greening are, for the moment, as one. And we can\u2019t tell you what the contest is about. I\u2019m pretty sure it was about the European Union once, but that\u2019s like saying the First World War was about Slavic separatism.\n\nWe can\u2019t even say what game is being played: it could be Quidditch, it could be Texas-Hold-\u2019Em, it could be WWE, it could be all of those things at once.\n\nBut while it is impossible to predict how the parliamentary shenanigans will pan out, the tactics of the main players are now becoming clear \u2013 and might offer the best clue as to who will be left standing.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe received view has been that Boris Johnson and his waistcoated wangler Dominic Cummings are the strategic geniuses here, the ones who have \u201cbrought the submachine gun to a knife fight\u201d. The proroguing of parliament was a goading tactic \u2013 government by clickbait \u2013 and everyone fell for it. Johnson and Cummings welcome the street protests and deselection threats; they love it when lifelong Conservatives such as Ken Clarke and Oliver Letwin weep into their pillows about the fate of their party.\n\nWhy? Because it signals to the EU that they are deadly serious about no deal. It\u2019s part of Johnson\u2019s \u201crun down the clock\u201d strategy; and so too is the potential 14 October election that it is assumed Johnson wants (even if he can\u2019t admit that; even if it\u2019s a mad risk). Only if the other EU leaders believe that we are prepared to turn ourselves into an apple republic will we get the actual deal that we are told No 10 actually wants.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nThe problem is, everyone seems to be basing their impression of Cummings on that Benedict Cumberbatch docudrama rather than the unpleasant and weird figure he actually is. Cummings added the irate techno-geekery to the Vote Leave campaign, yes \u2013 but Leave would never have won if it weren\u2019t for the dog-whistling of Nigel Farage (who incidentally detests Cummings), plus decades of anti-EU propaganda, the myriad failures of Osbornomics and so on.\n\nIf you want a glimpse of Cummings\u2019s actual obsessions, you only need to look at his blog: 10,000-word screeds on how \u201cideas like this have to be forced down people\u2019s throats practically at gunpoint\u201d... which seems scary, until you realise his idea is actually just installing a few iPads in the cabinet room. Cummings seems to think he is playing World of Warcraft and that the best way to win is to troll the group chat with \u201cdie scum, LOL ur dead\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, we are also asked to believe that Johnson is a pragmatist disguised as a fantasist. He has no desire to lead a hard-right dictatorship defined by civil unrest, queues at Dover and awkward questions about cancer patients dying because of medicine shortages. This is Boris, guys! He wants everyone to coo at his new puppy.\n\nBut \u201crun-down-the-clock\u201d is signature Johnson: maximum verbiage, maximum risk, minimum actual work.\n\nThere is no evidence the prime minister has been speaking to anyone he actually needs to be speaking to about a deal; nor have we seen the sketchiest of sketches of his vision for the Irish border. According to reports, he has rejected all sensible suggestions from his team, including putting a time limit on the backstop. His bet is that the EU will somehow find a solution so he doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nSo Johnson is playing poker. He can complain about treacherous rebels \u201ccutting the legs off\u201d his strategy all he wants. His strategy is to bluff \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t usually work when you\u2019ve told everyone that you\u2019re bluffing. The only possible way out of that is to pretend you meant to lose all along. No deal.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that Johnson knows what he wants anymore: pretend no deal or actual no deal. Michael Gove (the man who brought Cummings into government) seems persuaded by his own no deal propaganda campaign; he and Johnson are journalists and journalists are susceptible to fancy rhetoric.\n\nIn the face of this the Rebel Alliance is playing a surprisingly disciplined game. The response to the proroguing of parliament and Gove\u2019s unprecedented threat to break the law has been galvanising. There is even talk of an anti-No Deal Progressive Alliance if it comes to a 14 October election.\n\nJeremy Corbyn appeared to be walking into that \u201celephant trap\u201d on Monday, auto-piloting into a rousing \u201cBRING IT ON\u201d in Salford. But that night, his Labour colleagues made a swift correction: no, they will not assent to an election while no deal is still a possibility. Johnson\u2019s allies will cry \u201cHYPOCRITE!\u201d But Labour has an easy comeback: an election is just a sneaky way for Boris to get his way.\n\nThe chess player in all of this may turn out to be Seamus Milne, Corbyn\u2019s own Cummings. He is a man just as feared and detested, yet he is also cautious and capable of charm. Positioning Corbyn as a figure of unity, capable of working with other parties and putting the country first is a far more sensible strategy.\n\nAnd then what? If, as expected, the rebel bill passes and Johnson calls for an election which is then rejected by Labour MPs? Well, it was a referendum that got us into this mess and a referendum that may then seem the only way to get us out of it.\n\nAs for which way Labour would campaign in a second Referendum... well, then we\u2019re into four-dimensional backgammon.", "description": "Welcome\u00a0to the Thunderdome!
