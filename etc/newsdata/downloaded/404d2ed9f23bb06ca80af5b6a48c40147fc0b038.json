House race", "language": "en", "text": "Republican Dan Bishop, who defeated Democrat Dan McCready in a re-do election on Tuesday in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, on Wednesday said President Trump deserves a lot of the credit for his win.\n\n\u201cWe were surging \u2014 you know, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really clear to folks outside North Carolina, but I was only in this race for six months against someone who was in it for two years, and we really only were competitive in terms of funding for about six weeks,\u201d Mr. Bishop said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the president and the vice president stepping in and committing the way they did to this race was tremendous, and a lot of credit goes to the president,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both made recent trips to North Carolina to boost Mr. Bishop in the race, which was a do-over after the results of the 2018 contest between Mr. McCready and Republican Mark Harris were thrown out amid absentee ballot fraud charges tied to Mr. Harris\u2019 campaign.\n\nMr. Bishop said he\u2019s content to take pundits who said the race would be a preview of 2020 at their word.\n\n\u201cFolks said it was a referendum on President Trump \u2014 so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 2020 race coming up, and the president deserves reelection for another four years, and I\u2019m going to be supporting that.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have held control of the GOP-leaning district, which includes parts of Charlotte, for decades, but Democrats had been hoping that antipathy to Mr. Trump would help pull Mr. McCready across the finish line.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
