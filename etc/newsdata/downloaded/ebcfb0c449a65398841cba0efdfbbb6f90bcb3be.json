Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has clearly established herself as the frontrunner.\n\n\"The big takeaway is Elizabeth Warren takes the lead. Everybody's going after her. Everybody respects her. They had arguments on her grounds in terms of attacking her on health care,\" Williams said.\n\nCNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES\n\nWilliams also didn't see former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime frontrunner, as a loser but didn't think he gained much ground.\n\n\"I think Biden was OK to flat for me, but I don't think he lost any ground,\" Williams added.\n\nWilliams also called Warren a \"populist\" and compared her to President Trump.\n\n\"I think Warren, though, is you know, I think this is where ... [she] comes out of this debate the winner. She is a populist. You know how Trump is a populist to the right. She's a populist on the left,\" Williams said. \"And populism, we live in an age where populism sells. And I think she's doing a great job.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCo-host Emily Compagno later mentioned Rep.
