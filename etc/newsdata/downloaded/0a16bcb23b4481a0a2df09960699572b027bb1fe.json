Well, sometimes, when a suspect is under scrutiny in multiple investigations, the Justice Department will ask the court to seal any indictments returned by the grand jury. That way, there can be no credible claim that the grand jurors in one case were swayed by allegations filed by another grand jury. Relatedly, sometimes if a grand jury\u2019s investigation has not yet been completed, but a major development in another investigation involving the subject \u2014 such as an IG report \u2014 is about to occur, the Justice Department will ask the grand jury to file charges, but then seal the indictment. That way, it cannot credibly be said that the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict was swayed by negative publicity surrounding developments in the other investigation.\n\nThat is to say, there could be a dozen or more good explanations for why there has been no public announcement of a McCabe indictment. The other investigations could be complicating things. It could be that the Washington grand jury\u2019s investigation is broader in scope than we\u2019ve been led to believe. It could be something as simple as the availability of necessary witnesses, the availability of enough grand jurors to constitute a quorum, or the happenstance that the case is taking more time to present than the defense lawyers and media think it should.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Mccarthy", "Nationalreview.Com Why-Its-Unlikely-The-Mccabe-Grand-Jury-Voted-Against-Indictment"], "top_image": ""}
