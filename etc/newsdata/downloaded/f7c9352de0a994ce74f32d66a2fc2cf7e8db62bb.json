How do we get better next week?'\n\nEngland led only 17-16 early in the second-half, before scoring 23 unanswered points and leaving their opponents searching for answers.\n\nCaptain Owen Farrell rallies the team after their 40-16 win to keep their hopes of glory alive\n\nProp Kyle Sinckler and wing Anthony Watson followed May over the Wallabies try-line in one of England's most efficient performances under Jones.\n\n'He (Sinckler) found himself in an advanced attacking position (for his try) and got a great pass from Owen (Farrell) and then he was a runaway rhino,' Jones added.\n\n'I'm really impressed by how hard he is working at improving his game.\n\n'I thought (flankers) Tom Curry and Sam Underhill did very well, and the young fella Lewis Ludlam when he went on.\n\nJohnny May secures a try for England to set them on course for a famous win at Oita Stadium\n\n'The effort from Billy Vunipola was outstanding, absolutely outstanding. Maybe it helped having his wife here, so we have to make sure his wife stays next week!'\n\nAnd on May, he said: 'It is a great achievement to play 50 times for your country. There is probably not a more professional player than him.\n\n'He showed what a good finisher he is. He just had a little bit of a twinge at the end, so we took him off, but he should be fine.'\n\n'Runaway rhino' Kyle Sinckler races clear to add another try after Owen Farrell's brilliant pass\n\nFarrell, meanwhile, praised his team's response after Australia clawed the contest back to a one-point game.\n\n'The boys were calm and in control, and we had clear messages about what we were going to do next,' said Farrell, who landed four penalties and four conversions.\n\n'The lads ripped into that and we managed to get some points back straightaway.\n\n'This was a good performance, but we don't feel we are at our best yet.\n\n'We are probably going to have to be better next week, so we are looking forward to working that out.'", "description": "England's 40-16 win against the Wallabies at Oita Stadium was secured by four tries, including a double for wing Jonny May on his 50th cap, and 20 points from captain Owen Farrell.", "authors": ["Andrew Baldock", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19923016-0-image-a-79_1571489338420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
