Further, for almost 4% of borrowers their current loan balance exceeded their property value and over half of them were in Western Australia.\n\n\"So this is an area that bears watching,\" Lowe noted.\n\nOn other threats to financial stability, the RBA board also talked about the possibility that a shock somewhere in the global system could lead to a \"disruptive\" repricing of risks, he said.\n\nThe Board discussed how the Australian economy appears to have reached a \"gentle turning point\" with low interest rates, government tax rebates, infrastructure spending, housing market stabilization supporting the outlook.\n\n\"The economy has been through a soft patch recently, but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year,\" he said.\n\nLowe said the RBA was seeking to make more \"assured progress\" toward both full employment and its 2% to 3% inflation target which has eluded it for more than three years.\n\n\"We still expect to make progress on both fronts, but that progress is slower than we would like. Today\u2019s decision will help,\" Lowe said.\n\nHe listed geopolitical uncertainties led by the U.S.-China trade and technology disputes as well as a global trend toward lower interest rates among other reasons to keep policy accommodative in Australia.\n\n\"As a central bank in a small open economy we have to take the world as we find it,\" he said.\n\n\"While we might wish it were otherwise, we can't ignore these global trends and their impact on our economy. So, the Board is watching these global developments.\"", "description": "Australia central bank governor tells banks 'don't be scared to make loans'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF902EJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
