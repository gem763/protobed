Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in September 2018.\n\nThe Nobel jury stressed that the Peace Prize was \"also meant to recognize all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions.\"\n\nThe Committee singled out Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki for praise, noting that \"peace does not arise from the actions of one party alone.\"\n\n\"When Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reached out his hand, President Afwerki grabbed it, and helped to formalise the peace process between the two countries.\"\n\nThe committee had to choose from more than 300 nominations this year.\n\nOnline betting sites had put Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg -- who has already received Amnesty International's top honor and the Right Livelihood Award, sometimes dubbed the \"alternative Nobel\" -- as the name to beat.\n\nLast year, the honor went to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad, for their work in fighting sexual violence in conflicts around the world.\n\nThis year's prize will be presented at a ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of prize creator Alfred Nobel, a Swedish philanthropist and scientist.\n\nThe award consists of a gold medal, a diploma, and nine million Swedish kronor (around $912,000 or 828,000 euros).\n\nOn Thursday, the Swedish Academy in Stockholm awarded the 2018 Nobel Literature Prize, which it had postponed in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal, to Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nThe 2019 prize was awarded to Austrian novelist Peter Handke, a choice that has sparked outrage because of his vocal support of Serbs during the bloody collapse of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nAchievements in Medicine, Physics and Chemistry have already been honored and the Economics Prize will wrap up the 2019 Nobel prize season on Oct 14.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Hailed as a visionary and reformer, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for his efforts to resolve the long-running conflict with neighboring foe Eritrea.
