Apple is mandating the update because of an issue involving the GPS rollover that occurred earlier this year in April, which is when the GPS system most recently reached its limits and had to reset itself.\n\nIf you don't update your iPhone 5 to iOS 10.3.4 by November 3, you'll have to connect your phone to a Mac or PC to restore it, as Apple says that iCloud backup and over-the-air updates will not work.\n\nTo update your phone, launch the \"Settings\" menu, tap \"General,\" and choose \"Software Update.\" You can also press the \"About\" option to see which software version your iPhone is currently running on.\n\nApple has pushed an alert to iPhone 5 users urging them to update before November 3, as 9to5Mac pointed out.\n\nIt's unclear precisely how many people will be impacted by the update. After all, Apple recently said that 50% of all devices are running on iOS 13, the latest version of its iPhone software that launched in September. Only 9% of devices are using an operating system that's older than last year's iOS 12.\n\nBut some Apple devotees aren't in a rush to upgrade their old devices anytime soon. People from all over the world said they still prefer to use aging models like the iPhone 5 and 5S, mostly because of their more compact size, as USA Today reported in September.\n\nThe iPhone 5, which launched in 2012, is now considered a vintage Apple product and doesn't support recent versions of Apple's iOS software.", "description": "Those who own an iPhone 5 must update to iOS 10.3.4 before November 3 or they'll lose core features like web browsing and the App Store.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6fdecdee0194aca77a427?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
