Days before Hobbs & Shaw is set to hit theaters, he is already working on a new project. Hunkered down in a hotel, he\u2019s poring over the many written tests he\u2019s required to pass before he can fly in various locations abroad.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pain in the ass,\u201d North says, with a French accent and matter-of-fact approach to mortal danger that makes him sound like someone out of a black-and-white caper.\n\nBefore he can do things like chase Jason Statham\u2019s car from the seat of an airborne eggbeater, North and pilots like him have to make sure they\u2019re allowed to fly in the countries where directors want to film. This means filling out worksheet after worksheet, navigating national air-certification details, and taking exams designed for commercial airline pilots. That\u2019s his job in a nutshell: stretches of tedious strategizing followed by nerve-racking moments of risk. In his 20 years in entertainment, he\u2019s flown straight at all sorts of things you really shouldn\u2019t face off with in a helicopter \u2014 speeding trains; planes; and many, many explosions \u2014 and each time was meticulously planned out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more dangerous than working at the post office,\u201d he tells me of his job. \u201cIt\u2019s more dangerous than a lot of work, but we try to make it as safe as possible. We need to be able to do 50 times the same thing, again and again and again, in a safe manner. The reason why we get hired by the studio is because we guarantee the safety of the operation. So we push the envelope, but in a safe way.\u201d\n\nLike his 143,000 followers on Instagram, I am addicted to watching North pull off stunts. Under the unassuming handle @fred_north, he shares heart-stopping behind-the-scenes footage of helicopters toppling over and spinning like a top on flat land, or spiraling from the sky to the ground in choreographed corkscrews. In one video, a sequence for the upcoming ninth Fast & Furious film, he\u2019s flying an orange helicopter so close to the ground that the dust his rotors kick up nearly covers the bottom of the chopper. He\u2019s chasing some kind of armored car, which is itself chasing a motorcycle down a dirt road, straight into an extremely dense and not very helicopter-friendly patch of jungle. North glides behind them, pointed straight at the trees. He flies at the trees until what seems like far past the last second, then shoots straight up into the sky and banks deliriously backwards, circling back for another take. The whole thing is over in about ten seconds.\n\nOn Instagram, he also responds to fans\u2019 unceasing questions about his videos, divulging the mechanics behind simulations and advocating for the movie franchises that take heli-filming as seriously as he does. \u201cIm [sic] curious, do you check visually? Or is there like a setting for the camera that points them out clearly?\u201d one commenter asked recently under a comparatively sedate video of North flying a bright-yellow helicopter down a city street, scouting for wires before an upcoming shoot. His answer was typically sober and detailed: \u201cWe scout them from the ground, then put them on a map to count them and understand their orientation and elevation then we fly scout and put 2 spotters at key places to help me when I\u2019m flying.\u201d That reply is just one of more than a dozen from him on the same post. Two days later, he was answering questions about how much his helicopter weighs (\u201cdepends \u2026 but max weight is 2.6 ton\u201d). He tags specific gyro-stabilized and aerial camera systems in his posts, and includes hashtags like #pilotlife and the less inspired #helicopter. On the platform, he\u2019s the rarest kind of influencer: a helicopter influencer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only five guys in the world doing what I\u2019m doing,\u201d North says.\n\nThe 58-year-old North, who is solidly built and has a head of salt-and-pepper hair, says his unusual career started in 1985, when he was living in France and working as a commercial helicopter pilot. He decided that what he really wanted to do was break into film and TV, so he devised a plan. He bought a bunch of sophisticated aerial camera equipment not readily available in France and began renting it out to studios with a catch: If a renter wanted his equipment, they had to hire North as a pilot on their project, too. \u201cYou need to have a name,\u201d he explains, \u201cbecause producers and directors are not going to call you out of the blue.\u201d\n\nSlowly, his name did get out, and after a few years, he was able to charge for his services as a pilot alone. \u201cBut it took me a while,\u201d he emphasizes. His services span three primary roles: He can fly the helicopters moviegoers see onscreen \u2014 those are called \u201cpicture helicopters.\u201d He can fly the helicopters that photograph the action, called \u201ccamera helicopters.\u201d Then there\u2019s the third role he fulfills, called \u201caerial coordinator,\u201d which involves working with a film\u2019s director and director of photography to not only identify which shots are possible, but to make sure they\u2019re legal to perform in countries like Iceland or the United Arab Emirates or Vietnam. He\u2019s become such a rare and vital source for filmmakers that they often refuse to work without him. When Michael Bay learned North would be unable to personally shoot a scene for his movie 6 Underground in Rome, the director hesitated to work with another pilot. \u201cNo way!\u201d Bay said to North, \u201cI designed that sequence for you to do your thing.\u201d\n\nOn the sets of the Fast & Furious franchise films, North typically embodies the latter two roles: He\u2019s responsible for many of the franchise\u2019s most iconic shots. His specialty is safely shooting from a helicopter while flying through narrow spaces just a few feet from the ground \u2014 a standard vantage point in the F&F universe. That scene in Furious 7 when the cars shoot out of a transport plane? He was the only helicopter camera catching the action. The sequence in The Fate of the Furious that involves a car chase across a frozen lake? Same. The race through Havana in that same movie? Ditto.\n\n\u201cI love car chases! I love everything that goes fast and close to the ground,\u201d North says. \u201cIt\u2019s where I can be like myself. That is where my art comes to place. There is no room for error, everything is maxed out.\u201d\n\nHis penchant for flying close to the ground can be seen in Hobbs & Shaw. When I asked him about the most difficult stunt he filmed for that movie, I was sure he\u2019d cite the sequence in which a series of cars latch themselves to each other in order to weigh down an airborne helicopter, and are then lifted off the ground as the centipede of vehicles winds down a cliffside road in Samoa. Instead, he names a car chase through an abandoned nuclear power plant in England.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely confined,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had 150 feet by 150 feet, and there was a lot of speed and chase in that area \u2026 literally the tail of my helicopter was six to seven feet from the cooling tower, and the camera was maybe five feet from the car. And I had to spin 360 [degrees] around that at high speed with a twin-engine helicopter. It is not super-comfortable for me. That was hard.\u201d Jason Statham captured the moment in a photo he posted to his Instagram, in which you can see North\u2019s helicopter slipping between two huge concrete structures, seemingly feet from the ground. He captioned it, in part, \u201c@FredNorth for making the impossible possible.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult scene from his career, however, occurred out in the open, on that frozen lake featured in 2017\u2019s Fate of the Furious. You can see him, in his helicopter, around 00:12 in this video, following close behind a fleet of around 30 vehicles, including armored personnel carriers, trucks, snowmobiles, and an orange Lamborghini. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you ski, but if you ski on a cloudy day you can\u2019t really see, you don\u2019t have depth perception,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have the same issue, which means if it\u2019s cloudy, I don\u2019t really see if the snow or ice is close to me or not. You can get confused. It\u2019s extremely dangerous \u2026 and on the ice, and you have no reference whatsoever on the ground.\u201d\n\nNorth possesses the ability make threading his helicopter through a pair of skyscrapers sound simple, and filming a car chase almost sleepy. But if one subject gets him worked up, it\u2019s drones. The quality and availability of drones \u2014 small, unmanned flying machines that are also very good at aerial photography \u2014 has increased exponentially in recent years. But North isn\u2019t ready to lose his job to a robot just yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst of all, before I go there, the drone does not \u2026 You don\u2019t have a human being inside that can see the shot. Okay? The guy\u2019s on the ground. There\u2019s a disconnect between the camera and the person operating the camera. The drone will always be behind the action, because it doesn\u2019t see it. It can only do the preplanned shots. There\u2019s no magic to that.\u201d\n\nThen there are the functional setbacks. Good lenses and camera stabilizers can run well over 200 pounds, but drones usually have a weight limit of around 55. Lenses matter, and North\u2019s Instagram is a good reminder of this. His account has more in common with makeup influencers or fashion brands than \u201cbeautiful photography\u201d accounts like National Geographic: If you like what you see, there\u2019s a way you can buy it. It\u2019s why I shelled out almost $30 to see Hobbs & Shaw in 4DX, so I could experience the whooshes of air and camera dives teased on his Instagram. It took me out of myself for at least a little while \u2014 I switched off and was thrilled and transported. As it turns out, this is a gift North usually can\u2019t get for himself.\n\n\u201cWhen I do the stunt I am so focused I don\u2019t \u2026 No, I don\u2019t enjoy anything. [In between takes], then I\u2019ll enjoy the scene,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily love before, but I love after.\u201d", "description": "Getting to know Fred North, the helicopter influencer behind the Fast & Furious franchise: \u201cThere\u2019s only five guys in the world doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d", "authors": ["Chris Chafin"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-how-it-works-cinematography.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
