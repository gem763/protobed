But he is a two-time league MVP, and he hit Jimmy Graham in the second quarter for the only touchdown of the game.\n\nNFL 2019 predictions: our writers call the winners, losers and also-rans Read more\n\nFrom there, it was an aggressive defense that would have made Vince Lombardi proud in the latest edition of the NFL\u2019s longest rivalry, which the Packers lead 98-95-6. Green Bay have won 16 of the last 19 regular-season meetings, and Rodgers is 17-5 against Chicago.\n\nChicago\u2019s defense was good, getting five sacks tying the most it has had against Rodgers. But the Bears could do little with the ball and the Packers had five sacks of Mitchell Trubisky, who never found his stride, and was sacked on Chicago\u2019s final offensive play. Former Bears safety Adrian Amos picked off an end-zone pass into double coverage with 1:58 remaining, the only turnover of the contest. Mason Crosby made a 39-yard field goal in the final period for Green Bay, while defending NFC North champion Chicago got a 38-yarder from Eddy Pineiro.\n\nThe NFL opted to go for a history-tinged opener rather than having the Super Bowl champions host the first game. New England will be at home to Pittsburgh on Sunday night, and it\u2019s unlikely that game will be so dominated by D. Or by mistakes. Each team had 10 penalties, there was a total of 467 yards of only offense, and several drops. At one point, Chicago had three straight penalties to put them in a first-and-40. The Bears didn\u2019t convert.\n\n\u201cThree points is ridiculous,\u201d coach Matt Nagy said. \u201cAny Chicago Bears fan ... should be upset.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The Packers used the Bears\u2019 usual trademark, a staunch defense, and just enough from Aaron Rodgers on to kick off the NFL\u2019s 100th season with a 10-3 victory", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a602f645ac3b9f4c07586de65047adcfa96df617/0_121_4328_2599/master/4328.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cefc21d519304a7d4966c410eb49559", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
