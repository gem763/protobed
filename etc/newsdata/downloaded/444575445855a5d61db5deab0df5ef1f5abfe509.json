Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen you look back at why so many people thought Hillary Clinton was a lock late in the 2016 campaign despite tightening polls, two reasons stand out. The first is that in the month before the election, half the Republicans in captivity distanced themselves from their nominee (with many denouncing him as a disgusting pig) following the release of the Access Hollywood tape. The other was the belief that Hillary Clinton\u2019s massive field operation gave her a thumb on the scales in the event that things really did get iffy.\n\nIn the postelection mythology of 2016, there was a tendency to go far in the other direction and argue that HRC\u2019s \u201cground game\u201d somehow lost the election for her. Nate Silver responded to that strange claim in his series on \u201cthe real story of 2016\u201d:\n\n[W]hat went wrong with Clinton\u2019s vaunted ground game? There are certainly some things to criticize. There\u2019s been good reporting on how Clinton\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn ignored warning signs on the ground and rejected the advice of local operatives in states such as Michigan. And as I wrote in a previous installment of this series, Clinton did not allocate her time and resources between states in the way we would have recommended. In particular, she should have spent more time playing defense in states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Colorado and less time trying to turn North Carolina into a blue state or salvage Iowa from turning red.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: The evidence suggests those decisions didn\u2019t matter very much \u2026\n\nFor one thing, winning Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 states that Clinton is rightly accused of ignoring \u2014 would not have sufficed to win her the Electoral College. She\u2019d also have needed Pennsylvania, Florida or another state where she campaigned extensively.\n\nAnother part of the counter-mythology of 2016 held that the Clinton campaign was playing conventional checkers with its ground game, while Team Trump was playing some sort of three-dimensional social media chess with all those Facebook ads and maybe a little outside help from people who happen to drink a lot of vodka. Unsurprisingly, one person responsible for promoting this view of the election has been 2016 Trump digital director Brad Parscale:\n\nIn an interview with CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Sunday, Brad Parscale said Facebook \u201cwas the method\u201d for President Donald Trump\u2019s stunning rise to the White House. Parscale, who spearheaded the small Trump campaign team\u2019s digital and fundraising efforts, contended that the team took advantage of Facebook in a way Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign did not.\n\n\u201cFacebook now lets you get to places and places possibly that you would never go with TV ads,\u201d Parscale, web director at San Antonio-based marketing and design firm Giles Parscale, told CBS. \u201cNow, I can find, you know, 15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for. And, we took opportunities that I think the other side didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nParscale has since been named as Trump\u2019s overall 2020 campaign manager, and has continued to make noise suggesting he\u2019s some sort of political Zen master who has transcended polls and other timeworn tools of the trade. But Team Trump is also rolling in the kind of money that its 2016 predecessor could barely imagine. So how are they planning to spend it? Pretty much like Hillary Clinton did in 2016, or so it sounds in this account from Brian Bennett, which emphasizes the blue states Trump is targeting but also indicates a very personnel-heavy field operation:\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is betting it can win in New Mexico. Flush with cash, the campaign is planning to announce a state director and additional ground staff there in the coming weeks, a campaign official tells TIME. Internal campaign data has convinced Trump\u2019s political advisors they can energize a slice of the state\u2019s Hispanic voters to vote for Trump in 2020 by emphasizing Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, border security and his trade confrontation with China. According to U.S. Census data, 49.1 percent of New Mexico\u2019s residents identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino \u2026\n\nThe move is part of a series of bets Trump is making to win states that went for Clinton in 2016. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner says that voter data has convinced the reelection effort to fund robust field operations in a much larger number of states than in 2016. \u201cI can see us very aggressively playing in 18 swing states,\u201d Jared Kushner tells TIME, adding that in his view, the 2016 Trump campaign \u201cseriously played\u201d in about 11 swing states.\n\nIt sure sounds like Team Trump disparaged the kind of ground game Hillary Clinton had in 2016 up until, but not beyond, the moment it could afford one of its own. Who knows, maybe we\u2019ll hear the president\u2019s flacks and conservative media arguing next year that prognosticators should put a thumb on the scales for him if things get close. It\u2019s not like they feel any compunction toward consistency.", "description": "After 2016 many observers decided Trump\u2019s social-media-focused campaign was superior to Clinton\u2019s massive field operation.
