He is now basically the leader in name only, as the party\u2019s recent Brexit/general election U-turns show.\n\nQuestion: Who is the current leader of the Labour Party? Well, if you answer \u2018Jeremy Corbyn,\u2019 you\u2019d be technically correct, but that\u2019s as far as it goes. The man who is really calling the shots is Tony Blair, despite stepping down as party leader, and prime minister, 12 years ago. The truth is that Corbyn is now no more than a figurehead, reduced to echoing Blair\u2019s own utterances.\n\nBack in 2015, Labour supporters had valid grounds for believing that things were really going to change. During his successful campaign to become Labour leader that year, the 100-1 shot Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran anti-war leftist, said he was convinced that the Iraq War was illegal and that Tony Blair, if he had committed a war crime, should be put on trial. Labour members, desperate for a clean break with Blairism and all it represented, took great heart that they were getting their party back. Corbyn was still prepared to call for an investigation into Blair as late as May 2016. But since then, it\u2019s all gone very quiet on the anti-war front.\n\nAlso on rt.com BoJo\u2019s motto? If at first you don\u2019t succeed...try, try and try again - MPs to vote on winter snap poll\n\nWhen, in November 2016, the SNP\u2019s Alex Salmond tabled a motion calling for Blair to be held to account for allegedly misleading parliament over the Iraq War, it was defeated by 439 votes to 70. Jeremy Corbyn, the one-time chair of Stop the War, didn\u2019t turn up. The reason given was that he had a \u2018longstanding engagement in his constituency.\u2019 The Guardian noted that several of Corbyn\u2019s \u201ckey allies\u201d including Diane Abbott and John McDonnell didn\u2019t show up either. The message to Blair and the Blairites was clear: \u2018We\u2019re not going to pursue you on this one. It\u2019s over.\u2019\n\nInstead of moving against Blair and his acolytes in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), Corbyn and his \u2018key allies\u2019 backed off and sought to accommodate them in the interests of \u2018party unity.\u2019 Members who voted overwhelmingly for Corbyn in two leadership elections no doubt hoped that his victories would mark an end to establishment-friendly Blairism. In fact, Blair and the Blairites have regrouped and now have Corbyn exactly where they want him. Which is in a terribly weak position. Corbyn is in a box, but as someone on Twitter said yesterday, he\u2019s been handing his enemies the hammer and the nails.\n\nA key turning point was Corbyn\u2019s failure to act swiftly and decisively against his enemies following the 2017 general election. That election was supposed to mark the end of Corbynism, but the party did extremely well, recording its highest increase in the share of the popular vote since 1945.\n\nThe Blairites, who had done so much to undermine Corbyn from 2015, knew they were in a weak position the morning after the night before, so urged \u2018party unity\u2019 on the grounds that a new general election was \u201cjust around the corner.\u201d Corbyn fell for it, showing remarkable clemency when he should have been ruthless. The idea of mandatory reselections was dropped and in its place came \u2018trigger ballots\u2019 which have actually helped to maintain the status quo.\n\nAs Sienna Rodgers noted in the Guardian, \u201cthe reality is that, far from facilitating a Corbynite takeover, the trigger-ballot battles taking place across the country have allowed the Labour leader\u2019s critics to come out largely unscathed and better organized than ever.\u201d\n\nInstead of Blairites being purged, it\u2019s been left-wing supporters of Jeremy Corbyn like Chris Williamson who have been purged, and Corbyn has done little or nothing to help them. In fact, left-wingers have had a more stressful time at the hands of the Kafkaesque party disciplinary machinery under Corbyn\u2019s leadership than they had under Blair and Brown!\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Tony Blair can f**k off & die\u2019: Lib Dems party like it\u2019s 2003 with controversial singalong (VIDEO)\n\nIn 2017, one of the reasons why Labour did so well was their pledge to respect the 2016 EU Referendum results. Labour managed to hold on to key pro-Leave seats in the North and Midlands and even make 28 gains from the Tories. But the Blairites were determined to get the party to shift to a more pro-EU position and they have succeeded, with the People\u2019s Vote campaign playing a key role.\n\nIn 2017, John McDonnell quite rightly slammed Tony Blair\u2019s criticism of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. Stressing that the result of the referendum had to be respected, the shadow chancellor said \u201cTo be frank, Mr Blair hasn\u2019t really listened to the nature of the debate that is going on in the pubs, the clubs and school gates.\u201d\n\nYet two years on, McDonnell and Corbyn are literally echoing Blair\u2019s line.\n\nTake the party\u2019s opposition to an early general election. For over two years, the line was \u2018Bring it on, we want an election now.\u2019 Then, on September 1, Guru Tony spoke, and since then Labour \u2013 to the increasing frustration of its members \u2013 has blocked an election three times.\n\nThe Leader of the Labour Party. https://t.co/Tixnc2wyFm \u2014 Neil Clark (@NeilClark66) October 29, 2019\n\nToday, we learn that Labour will now back a December election (having voted against it only yesterday), but only after the SNP and Liberal Democrats said they would vote for it, meaning it would have gone through anyway. Yet, Blairite opposition to a December poll continues.\n\nREAD MORE: Putting off the inevitable? UK lawmakers reject BoJo\u2019s snap election proposal\n\nThe U-turns of the Labour leadership have been spectacular. In September 2016, John McDonnell received loud applause from the BBC Question Time audience when he told Alastair Campbell, Blair\u2019s former communications chief, that he was the \u201cperson above all else, who actually created a political environment where no one believed a word a politician said.\u201d Yet in October 2019, McDonnell, in a very friendly interview with Campbell, said he did not support his interlocutor\u2019s expulsion from the party. Campbell, like Blair, has been pushing for a second referendum \u2013 with Remain as an option \u2013 to come before any general election.\n\nLabour\u2019s shift to a \u2018Remain in all but name\u2019 position has, quite predictably, seen it plummet in the polls.\n\nOpinium (Con +16), Deltapoll (Con +13) and YouGov (Con +15) all showing Conservative leads in excess of 10pts. \u2014 Britain Elects (@britainelects) October 26, 2019\n\nAdopting a Brexit-blocking/delaying stance makes no sense electorally, given that most of the key marginals the party must win in England and Wales to achieve victory are Tory-held, pro-Leave ones.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that in urging such a suicidal course of action on him, the Blairites want Corbyn to fail, so that any subsequent election defeat can be blamed on \u2018the left,\u2019 whereas in fact it was the left trying to appease and accommodate pro-EU Blairites which is largely behind Labour\u2019s abysmal poll ratings.\n\nLooking at the wider picture, what\u2019s happened to Jeremy Corbyn should make socialists very sceptical of the notion that real, meaningful change can be achieved through the parliamentary system alone in an era of neoliberal globalization. As Labour activist Josh Jackson tweeted yesterday: \u201cA major problem of the left in Britain is that we don\u2019t have leadership outside of parliament.\u201d\n\nA major problem of the Left in Britain is we don\u2019t have leadership outside of parliament. All of our leaders are rooted in parliamentarianism as opposed to having genuine popular power among the working class. Thus our fortune is dependent on parliamentary games and not workers. \u2014 Josh Jackson (@JoshuaYJackson) October 28, 2019\n\nTo keep Corbyn and McDonnell honest, there needed to be extra-parliamentary pressure on them from a UK Gilets-Jaunes-style movement.\n\nBut instead, all the pressure has come from the faux-left and the right.\n\nFaced with the choice of upsetting socialists, or upsetting their opponents, the Labour leadership has chosen to upset socialists \u2013 perhaps in the belief that they\u2019ll still vote for the party anyway. Thus Labour will go into the next election with the uber-Blairite Dame Margaret Hodge, the most vehement critic of Corbyn, as a parliamentary candidate, but not the re-suspended Chris Williamson, Corbyn\u2019s most loyal supporter \u2013 and just about the only MP to have spoken up for Julian Assange.\n\nFirst @jeremycorbyn you betrayed me. Then Ken, Marc, Jackie and @DerbyChrisW and thousands of others. You preferred the company of those whose dearest wish and whose every waking hour was dedicated to destroying you. You have made your bed and now you must lie in it. #Vaz#Hodge \u2014 George Galloway (@georgegalloway) October 29, 2019\n\nThe truth is that even if Corbyn were to defy the polls once again and lead Labour to an against-the-odds election \u2018victory\u2019 in December (if an election then is confirmed), the pro-status-quo PLP would either prevent him becoming PM or else act as a brake on anything too radical being enacted.\n\nAt the moment, it\u2019s looking like game, set and match to Tony Blair, the Labour leader who never really went away. We shouldn\u2019t be too surprised at the way things have turned out. At Oxford in the 1970s, Blair co-founded a band called Ugly Rumours, for whom he sang and played guitar. So you could say he\u2019s got rather used to people dancing to his tune.\n\nFollow Neil Clark @NeilClark66\n\nLike this story?
