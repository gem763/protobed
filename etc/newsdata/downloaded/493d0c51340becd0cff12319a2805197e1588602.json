Racine, who has spent the past two years pursuing families accused of fraudulently seeking to send children to the city\u2019s traditional public schools and charter schools.\n\n\u201cThese lawsuits should remind non-D.C. residents that there are consequences for breaking the rules to avoid paying nonresident tuition,\u201d Racine said in a statement. \u201cThis is a message to everyone that residency fraud is a violation of the law, and our office will hold parents and guardians accountable for falsifying their residency to send their children to District schools for free.\u201d\n\nIn separate lawsuits, Racine\u2019s office accuses Maryland and Virginia families of skirting tuition required from nonresidents, which typically runs between $10,000 and $14,000 a year, according to a statement.\n\nUnder D.C. law, authorities can seek up to triple the amount owed by suburban families in unpaid tuition.\n\nFive Maryland residents who allegedly lied about living in the District also are accused of committing fraud to receive Medicaid, food stamps and benefits under the program Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\n\nThe attorney general identified those parents as Latosha Joseph and Mark Francis, Jocelyn Johnson, and Julia and Kamechia White. Racine said they are being sued for more than $1 million. Julia White is a former D.C. Public Schools educational aide, a statement from the attorney general says.\n\nRacine\u2019s office is also suing a D.C. police officer and his wife, who is a city social worker, for $775,733. Edward Smith and Rayna Bailey-Smith, of Maryland, allegedly sent their four children to D.C. schools for more than a decade, the lawsuit against them states.\n\nThe lawsuits also name former D.C. teacher LaShana Jamison Shubert, now of Hamlet, N.C., and her husband, Raymond Shubert, of Brandywine, Md.; Lynette C. Broadus and Kevin J. Tolson, who lived in Maryland or Virginia while allegedly claiming D.C. residency; Amanda Turner, of Takoma Park, Md.; and LaFonta C. Dublin, of Capitol Heights, Md.\n\nAttempts to reach the defendants Thursday were unsuccessful.\n\nAngel Matthews, a bus attendant for the District\u2019s Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), allegedly enrolled her daughter at a D.C. middle school, then moved to Maryland without informing the District, Racine\u2019s office asserts.\n\nAnother government worker, Marcus Silver, who is employed at the Department of Public Works, allegedly enrolled his daughter in D.C. schools, even though the family lives in Hyattsville, Md., according to the lawsuit filed against him and his wife, Marva, who are being sued by the city for more than $27,000.\n\nResidency fraud garnered attention in 2018 after a city investigation accused more than 160 teenagers at Duke Ellington School of the Arts of living outside the District. In October, parents and school officials said the city determined that at least 90 of those students actually lived in the District.\n\nAlso in 2018, Racine\u2019s office sued six Maryland parents for allegedly sneaking their children into in-demand schools, including Capitol Hill Montessori and Ellington School of the Arts.\n\nAs the District continues to crack down on instances of alleged residency fraud, education officials in recent years have issued regulations designed to ensure that D.C. residents have access to city schools.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a number of steps to improve our residency processes over the past three school years, and we have been careful to balance the need to prevent, detect and address residency fraud with the need to ensure that our processes do not create barriers for D.C. residents in complex situations from being able to enroll their children in school,\u201d Fred Lewis, an OSSE spokesman, said in an email.\n\nSince 2017, the office has launched public awareness campaigns, introduced an anonymous tip line reporting concerns and established an audit process that focuses more on residency verification.\n\nThe children of the adults named in the lawsuits allegedly attended different D.C. schools for varying amounts of time. Joseph and Francis, a married couple from Upper Marlboro, Md., allegedly sent their three children to District schools for 13 years between 2005 and 2019, the lawsuit states.\n\nWoodrow Wilson High School, Columbia Heights Educational Campus, Perry Street Preparatory Public Charter School and Smothers Elementary School are among the schools identified in the lawsuit as campuses where the parents living outside the District allegedly sent their children.\n\nBefore this sweep, Racine\u2019s office had slammed 17 adults with similar lawsuits this year.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The D.C. attorney general is seeking nearly $3 million from Maryland and Virginia families.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZZXxcC1VURHWy9_UjuslFL5m1Ho=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E5JDSXXIGUI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
