On Thursday, just four days later, her sister-in-law and former roommate, Kimberly Hancock, was arrested and charged with murder. The Nash County Sheriff\u2019s Office had found human remains buried in a shallow grave behind the 49-year-old\u2019s trailer in Spring Hope, N.C., and they credited a \u201cvery detailed\u201d email sent to the Facebook page\u2019s administrator for telling them where to look.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI found out a lot of people don\u2019t like talking to law enforcement, so for a lot of people they\u2019re just scared,\u201d the page\u2019s administrator, described as an \u201cunassuming Nash County wife,\u201d told WTVD on Friday. She wanted to remain anonymous, she added, because she has no interest in becoming a public figure.\n\nON SCENE-#Breaking-Authorities believe they have a break in a 14-year-old cold case in Nash County.

They believe it could belong to Deborah Deans, reported missing in 2004. #abc11 pic.twitter.com/I9KFBAzthh \u2014 Gloria Rodriguez (@GloriaABC11) October 24, 2019\n\nThe young mother\u2019s mysterious disappearance from the tiny, pine-forested community of Spring Hope had long been considered a cold case. Deans\u2019s mother first reported her missing in April 2004, and she later told the Rocky Mount Telegram that the last time she saw her daughter was in January of that year, after the 29-year-old was released from a women\u2019s prison where she served time for writing bad checks.\n\nWhen initially questioned by investigators, Hancock reportedly said that she hadn\u2019t seen the missing woman since that January, either. The two had argued, she said, and the 29-year-old called someone to pick her up, leaving behind her infant and 5-year-old, who later ended up in foster care.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHancock was unable to describe the car or the driver that came to take her roommate away, the Telegram reported. She also told police that Deans called her two months after the argument, asking for her children back. Hancock claimed she refused, telling Deans to take up the matter with the state\u2019s department of social services.\n\nDeans\u2019s other two children were with their grandmother when she vanished. Relatives maintained that she wouldn\u2019t have abandoned her family, and remained puzzled over her disappearance.\n\n\u201cWe would talk often, sometimes up to three times a week,\u201d her mother, Elaine Blevins, told the Telegram in November 2004. \u201cShe has four children, and she would not have left those children. Two of those children are living with me now, and two are in foster care. They wonder where their mother is. This is not like Debbie, for no one, not even her friends, to have seen and talked to her.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to WNCN, Hancock was convicted the following year for cashing child support checks that were mailed to Deans. Still, she wouldn\u2019t emerge as a suspect for more than a decade.\n\n#Breaking-Authorities believe they have a break in a 14-year-old cold case in Nash County. They found remains in Spring Hope.

Dedicated to four counties in eastern North Carolina, Fighting Crime News and Who\u2019s Wanted publishes dispatches about the weather, reminders to vote in local elections and traffic updates. But the main focus is disseminating information about crimes of all kinds, and splashy graphics about unsolved homicides are a constant.\n\nThe anonymous woman behind the page, whose name has appeared in some local outlets against her wishes, told WNCN on Friday that her goal is to be a conduit between law enforcement and people who may have crucial information to share. Constantly inundated with hundreds of tips, she has helped solve some other, lower-profile cases by passing along the information to authorities. Before last week, she had posted about Deans\u2019s disappearance many times, starting not long after she created the page in 2013.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter her latest post about the case, she told WNCN, she received an email telling her where the missing woman was buried. The message went into highly specific detail, describing exactly how Deans\u2019s body had been wrapped up. The Facebook page administrator immediately forwarded it to police, who started digging.\n\nThat tip \u201cproved to be very accurate and very reliable,\u201d Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone told reporters on Thursday evening. The human remains found behind Hancock\u2019s home had been wrapped and buried in a way that matched the description in the email, he explained, though DNA testing was needed to say with certainty that the body belonged to Deans.\n\nLater that night, Hancock was arrested and charged after an in-depth interview with police. She is being held without bond and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if she had an attorney.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuspect:\n\nKimberly Hancock 49 YO Female\n\nBased on an in-depth interview with a person of interest, the Nash County Sheriffs Office has charged her with one count of first degree murder for the homicide of Deborah Elaine Deans.\n\n\n\nNo further information at this time. pic.twitter.com/bux21DefKR \u2014 Nash County Sheriff (@NashCountySO) October 25, 2019\n\nThe 49-year-old has faced legal trouble before. In 1989, when she was 18 and still known as Kimberly Kay Privette, she fatally shot her father in the face with a .25-caliber handgun while he was sleeping on the couch. The following year, she pleaded guilty to a reduced charges of felony manslaughter and received a six-year suspended sentence due to unspecified \u201cextenuating circumstances,\u201d a local newspaper reported. The Nash County Sheriff\u2019s Office told WTVD last week that the charges were lowered because her father had been abusive.\n\nPolice haven\u2019t disclosed a motive for Deans\u2019s alleged murder, and it\u2019s unclear what prompted the tipster to come forward after 15 years. It\u2019s also unclear how they knew so much about the 29-year-old\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI am really not sure, and I hate to speculate,\u201d the Facebook page\u2019s administrator told WRAL. \u201cI am not positive how they knew, but they knew enough to raise the eyebrows of detectives over at the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "An unusually detailed tip led police to dig up Kimberly Hancock's backyard.
