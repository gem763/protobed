The bloc until now has instead sought to help mediate peace talks with Norway and Latin American countries.\n\n\u201cA decision to add seven new people has been taken,\u201d one EU diplomat said, following a meeting of EU ambassadors. Two other diplomats confirmed the sanctions, saying they were linked to torture.\n\nNo further details were immediately available but one diplomatic source said the seven Venezuelan officials were deemed responsible for the abduction of Venezuelan naval commandant Rafael Acosta, who died in military custody in June. Relatives say he was tortured to death.\n\nEU ambassadors took their decision on Wednesday and the sanctions were approved on Thursday, diplomats said, taking the number of Venezuelans under EU \u201crestrictive measures\u201d to 25. The European Union imposed an arms embargo in November 2017.\n\nWashington has been urging the European Union to take a tougher stance on Maduro, who France, the United States and several Latin American nations accuse of installing a dictatorship as a political and economic crisis deepens in Venezuela.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams, in Brussels this month to meet EU officials, told reporters he \u201casked the EU to join us in keeping the pressure\u201d on Maduro\u2019s government because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to give up power.\u201d\n\nUnder Maduro, Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves but suffers hyperinflation, chronic food shortages and has seen mass migration to neighbouring countries, has slid towards authoritarianism and a ruined economy.\n\nThe United Nations has estimated the number of Venezuelan migrants abroad is currently 4 million.\n\nLike the United States, most of the European Union has publicly backed Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Guaido as the man to help restore democracy. Maduro is accused of human rights violations and rigging the 2018 presidential election.\n\nHowever, much of the EU\u2019s diplomacy has been focused on trying to agree a negotiated end to the crisis and move towards a timetable for new presidential elections, so far to no avail.", "description": "The European Union will impose economic sanctions on another seven people close to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday, three EU diplomats said, in a decision that may disappoint opposition leaders looking for sweeping action.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
