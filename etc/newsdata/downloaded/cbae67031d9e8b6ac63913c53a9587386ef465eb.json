Photo: Jonathan Wong Share:\n\nSiu said while the initial signs of the programme were promising, the devil was often in the details.\n\n\u201cThere must be enough medical professionals enrolled in the programme to minimise waiting times for injured workers, otherwise some like Wong will still pay for faster treatment outside.\u201d\n\nEmployers must also be encouraged to re-employ rehabilitated workers, she added.\n\nWong, meanwhile, wants the programme to give great autonomy to workers to choose their preferred doctors, and even opt for others on the list in the middle of treatment, referring to his own experience of a failed operation.\n\nHe said he still hoped to get his old job back one day but admitted it was unlikely.\n\n\u201cI used to make between HK$20,000 and HK$40,000 a month depending on the amount of work, and I took great pride that I put food on the table, and a roof over my family\u2019s head,\u201d Wong said.\n\n\u201cI contemplated suicide when I realised I was unable to provide for my wife and daughter, and I seemed to be getting nowhere.\u201d\n\nWong saw a specialist at publicly run United Christian Hospital in February this year, and is receiving physiotherapist training and support.", "description": "Hong Kong has seen a spate of work injuries in recent years with the government pushing ahead with major infrastructure projects.", "authors": ["Siu Sin-Man", "Association For The Rights Of Industrial Accident Victims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/27/8cef0a30-f851-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_235816.JPG?itok=_rrGYY7Z&v=1572191905", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
