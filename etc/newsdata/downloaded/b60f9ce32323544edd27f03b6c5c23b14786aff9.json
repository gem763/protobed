His party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, said Monday the unit would issue a warning statement to Malema. The 38-year-old was filmed allegedly shooting a rifle into the air during the party\u2019s five-year anniversary celebrations in the southern town of East London last year.\n\nMalema told reporters the Hawks informed him further investigations are being conducted on the incident after a prosecutor refused to move on the evidence presented before him. Known for his abrasive politics, Malema heads the country\u2019s third-biggest opposition party and often portrays himself as a defender of the poor.\n\n\u201cSomeone, somewhere is sitting and making stupid decisions and not applying the law,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is happening here is that they are using us as a diversion.\u201d\n\nHis appearance before the Hawks came a day after the Daily Maverick, a Johannesburg-based news website, alleged that Malema was a beneficiary of funds embezzled from failed VBS Mutual Bank and used the money to finance his political aspirations and lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of Gucci apparel and other luxury items.\n\nEFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said he couldn\u2019t immediately comment when contacted on Tuesday. The party has previously said there\u2019s no proof its officials did anything wrong.\n\n\u201cThe allegations on VBS are a fabrication and unfounded,\u201d Malema said. \u201cLouis Vuitton and Gucci, I have worn it before. I don\u2019t buy it with VBS money.\u201d\n\nHe said he won\u2019t take any action against the Daily Maverick.\n\nRead more on EFF and VBS Mutual Bank\n\nMalema established the EFF in July 2013 after he was expelled from the ruling African National Congress. His party won 11% of the national vote in May 8 elections.\n\n(Updates with Malema\u2019s comments starting in fourth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Amogelang Mbatha.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nkululeko Ncana in Johannesburg at nncana@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Richardson at pmrichardson@bloomberg.net, Rene Vollgraaff, Pauline Bax\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- South African opposition leader Julius Malema presented himself to the police\u2019s special investigative unit over allegations that he illegally fired a weapon.Malema arrived at the offices of the so-called Hawks in the capital, Pretoria, on Tuesday.
