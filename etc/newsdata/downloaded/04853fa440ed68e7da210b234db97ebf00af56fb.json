The injuries are very unfortunate, especially with the number being higher than the previous year,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Fireworks are dangerous and need to be handled with care. Guy Fawkes continues to be a massive headache that we can frankly do without. The City has done all it can in terms of our legislated authority.\n\n\"Given the ongoing complaints from the public, we hope that National Government will look at banning the sale of fireworks, as trying to stop the ensuing chaos once those fireworks are in circulation is almost impossible,\" Smith said.\n\nMeanwhile, 182 people were arrested and 833 fines were issued for various offences by the City\u2019s traffic services.\n\nThese included outstanding warrants and drunk driving.", "description": "More than 30 people have been injured during Guy Fawkes celebrations in Cape Town, including a 14-year-old boy who lost parts of three fingers, according to the City of Cape Town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4333/1862a623ad8a4188b60fc4666a442ce8.jpg", "published_at": "2016-11-07"}
