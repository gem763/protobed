He talks so much and with such velocity that it can make your hair flutter. Whatever wife he has at the time tends to say nothing,' wrote Carter.\n\nThe magazine editor later wrote: 'He has touched - embraced - every third rail in American politics. He has offended (and I apologize if I've left some group out): African-Americans, Native Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Muslims, war heroes - war heroes! - families of war heroes, the disabled, women, and babies. Babies! Through word or action, Trump has promoted gun violence, bigotry, ignorance, intolerance, lying, and just about everything else that can be wrong with a society.'\n\nCarter also detailed the night he took Trump as his guest to the 1993 White House Correspondents' Association dinner.\n\nHalfway through the evening the guest next to him, the model Vendela Kirsebom, came over in tears.\n\n'It seems that Trump had spent his entire time with her assaying the 'tits' and legs of the other female guests and asking how they measured up to those of other women, including his wife,' wrote Carter.\n\n'''He is,' she told me, in words that seemed familiar, 'the most vulgar man I have ever met.'''\n\nKirsebom, 49, spoke about that interview during an interview with DailyMail.com back in October of last year.\n\n'Everything he said was so vulgar. I couldn't listen to his nonsense for an entire night so I asked if I could be moved,' she said.\n\n'He talked about big breasts, small breasts, how one was better than the other and the differences between them.\n\n'His main focus was breasts and the sizes of women's bodies. Fat women were not real women in his opinion.'\n\nShe added: 'He basically said if you are not attractive and beautiful, then you don't have any purpose as a woman.'", "description": "Ivanka Trump and rogue Vogue editor Anna Wintour organized a secret meeting between the first daughter and Conde Nast editors.
