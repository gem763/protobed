(Will Newton)\n\nMaryland running back Jake Funk tore his left ACL against Temple and will be out for the remainder of the 2019 season, Coach Michael Locksley said Monday. Funk, who also is a key contributor on special teams, tore the same ACL late last season. Funk will have surgery soon.\n\n\u201cJake played an integral role, not just on offense but on our special teams,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a huge blow for us. As we say with most injuries, the next-man-up mentality has to take place.\u201d\n\nRunning back Lorenzo Harrison III, who missed most of last year because of a knee injury and is now healthy after dealing with hamstring issues, will help fill the void on both offense and special teams. While running backs Anthony McFarland, Javon Leake and Tayon Fleet-Davis are all ahead of Funk on the depth chart, the redshirt junior from Gaithersburg had already made meaningful contributions this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so upset about that, but it comes with a game,\u201d Leake said of Funk\u2019s injury. \u201cJake is a great player. He did a lot of stuff for us, on special teams, offense. That\u2019s a big, big player to lose, and I just hope Jake gets well soon. That\u2019s definitely a big loss.\u201d\n\nIn Maryland\u2019s 79-0 win over Howard, Funk tied as the leading running back with 79 rushing yards on 12 carries, including 49-yarder on the final drive. Against Syracuse, a 63-20 win that again showed off a prolific offensive attack, Funk ran for 94 yards. In Maryland\u2019s last drive against the Orange, Funk took the handoff on all three plays, rushing for 54 yards, 28 yards and finally a 10-yard score.\n\n\u201cFunkster!\u201d Leake said mid-question when asked about his teammate following the Syracuse game. Leake then answered: \u201cFunk is one of the leaders on this team. He couldn\u2019t do as much as he wanted to last year due to an injury, but he came back this year strong, ready. He\u2019s been waiting for this moment, and I\u2019m so glad he gets to have a chance to come back and do what he loves. It was good to see him finally get out there, break a couple runs.\u201d\n\nIn the past two years, Funk has dealt with multiple injuries, hurting his wrist early in the 2018 season and then tearing his ACL against Ohio State, the Terps\u2019 11th game of the year. Funk played in just three games last season. Locksley said he is hopeful that by using another redshirt this year, Funk will still have two years of eligibility remaining. (Usually players can redshirt only once, but the NCAA can make exceptions for medical reasons.)\n\nIn recent years, Maryland football has dealt with an abundance of knee injuries, and the trend has continued. Since Locksley\u2019s arrival, defensive back Antwaine Richardson tore an ACL in April, standout receiver Jeshaun Jones tore one in August and linebacker Durell Nchami tore one just before the season began. Funk is now the fourth Maryland player sidelined this season by a torn ACL.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland has an entire bye week to stew over its offensive line issues\n\nTerrance Davis, Maryland\u2019s most experienced offensive lineman, out for four to six weeks\n\nRalph Friedgen, back in fold with Maryland, will be honored during Penn State game\n\nMaryland\u2019s new indoor football facility, set to be finished next year, brings program up to speed", "description": "Special teams contributor injured same knee last season.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics", "September At Pm", "Emily Giambalvo Covers University Of Maryland Athletics For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ITkJ00Wc1F5dbITXZFz4gNXuu_A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4UOKOMGTJYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
