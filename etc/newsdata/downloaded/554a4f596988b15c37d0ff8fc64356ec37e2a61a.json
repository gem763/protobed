That's all I have to say about that.\"\n\nThe Welsh Rugby Union had earlier stressed that Biggar was \"symptom-free\" and had been cleared by an independent expert after passing return-to-play protocols.\n\nThe 30-year-old failed a head injury assessment after taking a blow in Wales's win over Australia on September, but was passed to play against Fiji 10 days later.\n\nHowever, he suffered a nasty aerial collision with team-mate Liam Williams during the game in Oita and had to leave the field once again.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland said Biggar \"felt better after the (Fiji) game, it was clear\" and the \"right people\" had been consulted to get him properly scanned and assessed.\n\n\"We feel that we've gone through that due diligence and making sure we've covered all the bases in terms of Dan,\" Gatland said.\n\n\"He's obviously done all the protocols and been fit for three or four days in terms of having passed those so we are obviously taking all the proper precautions from our point of view.\"\n\n\"He's desperate as a player to play,\" Gatland said, adding that the Wales management had previously dealt with multiple-concussion cases, including a 2015 controversy involving winger George North.\n\n\"We've just got to make sure if it does happen, if he gets a knock in the next few games or the next couple of months, obviously there would probably be a different course of action. But he's very confident that he's 100 percent,\" Gatland said.\n\nConcussion has become a major issue in several sports including rugby, and prompted a crackdown on high tackles which has resulted in a rash of red cards at the World Cup.\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Liam Williams, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Josh Navidi, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Ross Moriarty, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen Watkin\n\nFrance\n\n15 Maxime Medard, 14 Damian Penaud, 13 Virimi Vakatawa, 12 Gael Fickou, 11 Yoann Huget, 10 Romain Ntamack, 9 Antoine Dupont, 8 Gregory Alldritt, 7 Charles Ollivon, 6 Wenceslas Lauret, 5 Sebastien Vahaamahina, 4 Bernard Le Roux, 3 Rabah Slimani, 2 Guilhem Guirado (captain), 1 Jefferson Poirot\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Cyril Baille, 17 Camille Chat, 18 Emerick Setiano, 19 Paul Gabrillagues, 20 Louis Picamoles, 21 Baptiste Serin, 22 Camille Lopez, 23 Vincent Rattez", "description": "Wales flyhalf Dan Biggar would have been ruled out of the Rugby World Cup quarter-final with France under French concussion rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9464/782197bf22564fc5993582a98dd9f39e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
