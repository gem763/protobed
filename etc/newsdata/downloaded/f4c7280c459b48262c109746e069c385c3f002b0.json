We do it for the children, so they can have more opportunities. Mohammed Polash Basher, Italian Bangladeshi taxi driver\n\nWhile the centre of gravity for the British Bangladeshi community has historically been Tower Hamlets, closer to the City of London, many families were priced out when the area was gentrified and began to attract wealthy young professionals.\n\nItalian Bangladeshi families, most of whom arrived in the last decade as London property prices soared, were pushed to rent further east.\n\nThere are said to be 13 coffee shops on Romford Road alone in which the main language spoken, after Bengali, is Italian.\n\n\"When I got my [Italian] passport in 2010, something clicked in my head. I thought: 'I am fine here',\" said Maula, a former trade unionist who later got involved in politics with the centre-left Democratic Party in Italy.\n\n\"But my children, I just couldn't see their future. Italy seemed to me at the time, and today still, not yet ready for this diversity.\"\n\nGolam Maula, represents Italians abroad in an official capacity, said diversity is more vibrant in the UK than in Italy [Ylenia Gostoli/Al Jazeera]\n\nAfter 18 years in Italy, he moved his family to the UK, arriving with the first wave of Bangladeshis to have obtained Italian citizenship.\n\nIn Italy, they represent one of the largest migrant communities - 140,000 people, many of whom live in the industrialised north.\n\nThe economic crisis was a push factor, as several factories shut down. But according to Maula, it is not the principal reason for migrating.\n\n\"Second generations have to do something to demonstrate they are not foreigners,\" Maula said. \"I looked at the only mixed-race guy working at my local bank and I thought: 'This young man, how much will he have to struggle to emerge?'\"\n\nA recent film by emerging director Phaim Bhuijan about a young Italian Bangladeshi growing up in Rome was the first of its kind in portraying a second-generation story on screen, in a country that is just beginning to navigate its increasing diversity.\n\nLondon, on the other hand, offered people like Maula a well-established Bangladeshi community and family contacts from home.\n\n\"There is something else that you can say, it's in our DNA as South Asians. We were a British colony, they came to our country to rule. Only the children of ministers and the elite could come to the UK to study,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, we have this opportunity that our children can come to London to study. What used to appear like a dream, now was within reach.\"\n\n190626084708432\n\nBrexit has now thrust this dream into uncertainty, as young people with EU passports may have to pay higher university tuition fees, like current non-EU \"international students\", from 2021.\n\nThis worries Mohammed Polash Basher, a 34-year-old taxi driver on a break at a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in nearby Ilford.\n\n\"I had a good life in Italy. But together with my wife, we decided we wanted our children to study in English,\" he said in a northern Italian accent, having grown up in Brianza, an area near Milan.\n\nThe other customers, mostly taxi drivers, too, nod in agreement.\n\nThe chat around the counter quickly switches from Bengali to Italian as they begin voicing concerns about their business plans, mostly import-export, that are now on hold because of continued Brexit uncertainty around trade tariffs.\n\n\"No one comes here for the money. We do it for the children, so they can have more opportunities,\" said Polash as he walked to a supermarket next door, where Italian biscuits, olive oil tuna cans and pasta line the aisles, as well as Italy-grown fresh produce, including traditional Bangladeshi foods like bitter melon.\n\n\"At home, I speak to them in Italian,\" said Polash, whose children are nine and six. \"They are Italian citizens and I want them to maintain a link with the country where they were born.\n\n\"The parents of the friends I grew up with call me regularly to ask me to visit them. Now, it is not possible, but one day, I would like to go back to Italy.\n\n\"The UK has always seemed to me like an open-air prison. Brexit isn't helping.\"", "description": "Italian Bangladeshis seeking better education for their children and more diversity now live under threat of Brexit.", "authors": ["Ylenia Gostoli", "About The Author", "Ylenia Gostoli Is A London-Based Reporter Who Previously Freelanced Rome", "The Occupied Palestinian Territories."], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/cd68a08802c1484fb2b9868d7669b608_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
