Islands are being swallowed by superstorms. Water is toxic, drugs are contaminated, and hackers are after your identity \u2013 and your last dollar.\n\nThe Franklin Institute in Philadelphia can\u2019t mitigate all the world\u2019s dangers, of course.\n\nBut the science museum is doing its part to help us survive some increasing threats \u2013 floods, for instance \u2013 and some much more \u201cHollywood blockbuster\u2019\u2019 in nature (killer bees and pythons and pirates, oh my!).\n\nNo need to panic. We're just going to learn how to defeat cyber criminals, flee a swarm of killer bees and jump between moving train cars at The Franklin Institute's 'Worst-Case Scenario Survival Experience.' (Photo: Tammy Paolino/Courier-Post)\n\n\u201cWorst-Case Scenario: A Survival Experience,\u2019\u2019 a world-premiere, hands-on experience opened Saturday at the museum and runs through April 19 before setting off on a national tour.\n\nTwo installations in the exhibit were designed by Mount Laurel-based design firm Kubik-Maltbie Inc., which works on museum experiences all over the world.\n\nThe exhibit draws upon \u201cstrategies of survival and elements of escape\u2019\u2019 from the best-selling Quirk guidebook series by Philly natives and Penn grads Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht (Chronicle Books). Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the series has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nDo you have what it takes to make it through \"The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Experience'? (Photo: Tammy Paolino/Courier-Post)\n\nThe exhibit kicks off with a \u201cWorst-Case Scenario\u2019\u2019 Hall of Fame, meant to celebrate everyday heroes such as first responders and wildlife rescue workers.\n\nInside the main gallery, guests are advised to \u201cBe Prepared. Don\u2019t Panic. Have a Plan\u2019\u2019 in a giant sign beside a wall of orange traffic cones.\n\nFrom there, visitors can test their survival skills in a series of 13 challenges that make up the \u201cSurvivor Gym.\u2019\u2019 Here, you will need to draw upon a mix of practical knowledge, physical strength, a grasp of physics and biology, and common sense.\n\nAt one station, you will be asked to answer a series of questions to determine how best to survive an unexpected encounter with a bear, a python, an alligator or swarm of killer bees.\n\nA boy plays in a giant ball pit located in the center of 'Worst-Case Scenario Survival Experience' at the Franklin Institute.

Well, we hope you don\u2019t. But it is certainly not a bad thing to learn the best ways to survive a rip tide or escape if your car goes underwater.\n\nWalk through a neon-blue tunnel of plastic strips and see how germs attach themselves to every household surface, then learn what you can do to survive an epidemic or even a pandemic.\n\nAs you navigate the stations, you can read step-by-step instructions and glean expert advice to increase your chances of surviving each threat.\n\nKids on opening day discover what being upside-down can do to their perceptions. (Photo: Courtesy of The Franklin Institute / Darryl Moran)\n\nAt a media preview last week, authors Piven and Borgenicht, founder of Quirk Books, greeted guests from inside a giant vat of plastic balls meant to simulate an avalanche in the center of the exhibit. They talked of growing up with The A Team, Indiana Jones, Rambo and James Bond for company \u2013 and inspiration.\n\n\u201cWhen David approached me about this book, you know I loved the idea, plus like all writers I was desperate for cash so I said that sounds great,\u2019\u2019 recalled Piven. \u201cSo we got together and started brainstorming this book and the key to the book is that all the information is real even though it is outlandish. We went out and actually found experts to give us the survival advice on the various scenarios \u2026 and it was a little weird, like a kid doing a book report on how to escape quicksand.\u2019\u2019\n\nWant to learn how to jump between moving train cars? A Mount Laurel firm designed this portion of the 'Worst-Case Scenario' experience at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. (Photo: Tammy Paolino/Courier-Post)\n\nLike the book series, the aim of the exhibit, according to the Franklin, is to \u201chelp develop the fundamental skills that are used in all worst-case scenarios: staying calm, thinking logically, using creativity and being prepared.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cFrom evading an angry lion to surviving a shark attack, this exhibit answers: what were the survivors thinking? And what skills did they employ?\u2019\u2019\n\nIf you find yourself faced with landing a pilotless plane in the middle of the exhibit and don\u2019t know what to do, no need to panic. Simply walk up to one of the nearby phone booths and get some help from Burt Reynolds, who narrates the original audiobook.\n\nThe exhibit at the Franklin Institute is based upon 'The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook' by Joshua Priven and David Borgenicht (Chronicle Books). (Photo: Tammy Paolino/Courier-Post)\n\nIf you enjoy the exhibit, you can escape to the gift shop and pick up a revised 20th anniversary edition of the book, which has additional advice for surviving 21st-century threats, such as superstorms, online bullies and \u201cfake news.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt might come in handy if, say, you need to decide if that balloon-clutching clown crawling out of that storm drain plans to murder you.\n\nDavid Campbell of Riverton is project manager for Kubik-Maltbie Inc. in Mount Laurel, which has worked with the Franklin Institute on previous exhibitions. The company designed the train jumping and animal roulette wheel installations.\n\nTheir task was to \u201cbring to life\u2019\u2019 the scenarios illustrated in the handbook as closely as possible.\n\nWorst-case scenario for Kubik-Maltbie? That would be one of their installations not holding up to the beating it will take from months\u2019 of hands-on fun.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to exhibits, well children are a force of nature. So durability is kind of a big factor for us, so not just figuring out how we can manipulate the motions of what it\u2019s like to jump between trains but making sure it\u2019s going to work for the number of people who are going to jump on this thing.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis wheel, part of the 'Worst-Case Scenarios' experience at the Franklin Institute, was designed by a Mount Laurel firm. It offers tips on escaping attacks by various wild animals. (Photo: Tammy Paolino/Courier-Post)\n\nCampbell said he enjoyed working on the roulette wheel concept and would be bringing his own kids so they could spin the wheel and learn how to escape a charging bull.\n\nSo, what is Campbell\u2019s worst-case scenario?\n\n\u201cCreaturewise, I guess a rhino. That\u2019s an intimidating animal. I don\u2018t think that would end well. I don\u2019t want to be anywhere near a rhino. It\u2019s like a living dinosaur.\u2019\u2019\n\n'Be Prepared. Don't Panic. Have a Plan.' That's the motto of the authors of 'Worst-Case Scenario' handbook.
