The Greatest Romance Ever Sold (1999)\n\nBy the end of the 90s, Prince obviously wanted commercial success again. The album Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic came packed with guest appearances; the smooth hip-hop-soul balladry of The Greatest Romance Ever Sold was a good indication of its musical style. It wasn\u2019t a bad song, but the sense Prince was following trends rather than going his own way was hard to avoid.\n\n49. Letitgo (1994)\n\nBy 1994, Prince was more interested in fighting with his record company than the quality of his releases. Come was evidently thrown together to fulfill his contract. But even when he didn\u2019t really care, he couldn\u2019t turn his talent off completely. Letitgo isn\u2019t a classic, but nor is it a disaster. Perhaps he made more of an effort because it\u2019s about his desire to leave the Warners label.\n\n48. U Make My Sun Shine (2000)\n\nPrince hadn\u2019t lost his ability to spot talent: U Make My Sun Shine featured a great guest appearance from neo-soul singer Angie Stone. Her presence seemed to rouse him \u2013 it\u2019s a gospel/southern soul-inspired ballad, and a minor gem.\n\n47. Dinner With Delores (1996)\n\nAnother thrown-together contractual-obligation album, Chaos and Disorder had a rough charm and immediacy, as evidenced by Dinner With Dolores, a sweet, if slight, song cut from the same pop-rock cloth as Manic Monday.\n\n46. Gold (1995)\n\nA lost nugget from 1995\u2019s The Gold Experience, Gold reiterates the anti-materialistic message of 1992\u2019s Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night. It\u2019s not groundbreaking in the way Prince\u2019s singles once were, but it\u2019s exquisitely written.\n\n45. Batdance (1989)\n\nThe Batman soundtrack was the first real artistic wobble in Prince\u2019s career, arriving replete with filler, including the phoned-in ballad The Arms of Orion. Nor has its largely instrumental first single dated well: it picks up when the vocals come in, but Prince had made umpteen more creative 12in remixes than this.\n\n44. The Work Pt 1 (2001)\n\nBeloved of Prince diehards, a bit of a schlep for everyone else, the jazz and Jehovah concept album The Rainbow Children underlined that Prince was now more interested in stubborn self-indulgence than commercial success. But it did yield The Work, a relentless, horn-laden James Brown-ish groove that unexpectedly collapses into slowed-down vocals and synth-y ambience.\n\n43. Cinnamon Girl (2004)\n\nMusicology was Prince\u2019s biggest-selling album in more than a decade. It helped that copies given away with gig tickets counted as sales, but so did the presence of straightforwardly enjoyable songs such as Cinnamon Girl, which you could have imagined him writing circa Around the World in a Day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince on the Purple Rain tour. Photograph: Ebet Roberts/Redferns\n\n42. I Hate U (1995)\n\nThe Gold Experience was a better album than its relatively lukewarm reception suggested. I Hate You is The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\u2019s evil twin: more pillow-soft soul, this time attacking rather than hymning a woman, complete with a faintly problematic faux-courtroom scene.\n\n41. The Truth (1997)\n\nAn interesting single from Prince\u2019s artistically lean years, primarily because it took him somewhere new. Stark, acoustic and blues-influenced, performed solo and boasting a great vocal performance, The Truth didn\u2019t sound like any Prince single before it.\n\n40. Thieves in the Temple (1990)\n\nPrince clearly intended Graffiti Bridge to have a similar impact to Purple Rain, but the film was abysmal and the accompanying soundtrack uneven. Its lead single isn\u2019t a bad song by any means \u2013 its sound is slinky and luscious, the chorus is great \u2013 but it\u2019s no When Doves Cry.\n\n39. Delirious (1983)\n\nIn the best possible way, the 1999 album was the sound of a man showing off: name a musical style and he could bend it to his own ends. Hence the US-only Delirious, a kind of dry-run for Let\u2019s Go Crazy, with its roots in 50s rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\n\n38. Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? (1979)\n\nOne aspect of Prince\u2019s genius lay in his inability to be confined by musical genres. Early on in his career, Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? offered dancefloor-focused R&B that was influenced by both AOR and the emergent new wave, and concluded with a startling display of guitar pyrotechnics.\n\n37. Soft and Wet (1978)\n\nReleased at the height of disco, Soft and Wet\u2019s skeletal, off-kilter synth funk \u2013 complete with jazzy inflections \u2013 sounded like it came from another planet to the rest of the US chart. A minor hit, it quietly announced the arrival of a unique and uniquely unbiddable talent, so obsessed with sex he mentions his penis in the opening line.\n\n36. Let\u2019s Work (1981)\n\nIt\u2019s all about the 12in mix. Not content with merely extending an album track for the dancefloor, Prince went to town, completely overhauling Let\u2019s Work, interpolating sections of Controversy\u2019s title track and Annie Christian, enhancing the song\u2019s sweaty urgency with new vocals and keyboards, demonstrating a meticulous attention to detail where lesser artists would have expended no effort at all.\n\n35. The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1994)\n\nIt is incredible that The Most Beautiful Girl in The World is Prince\u2019s only UK No 1, given the singles that preceded it. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a deft homage to the super-soft 70s soul of the Delfonics and the Stylistics, both of whom he subsequently covered.\n\n34. 7 (1992)\n\nIf you want evidence of Prince\u2019s unique, almost mystical, abilities, 7 is an intriguing place to start. At heart, the song is a rousing acoustic campfire singalong with lyrics of a spiritual bent, albeit a fairly baffling one. Deeply unpromising on paper, he somehow makes it work to striking effect, spooning on the harmonies and vintage sitar effects.\n\n33. Black Sweat (2006)\n\nThe problem with Prince\u2019s wilderness years wasn\u2019t a decline in talent, but a fatal lack of focus. The minimal funk of Kiss reimagined for the 00s, Black Sweat was evidence that Prince was marshalling his abilities once more. It wasn\u2019t up to his 80s standards, but it was close enough to pass muster.\n\n32. Screwdriver (2013)\n\nLater included on Hit n Run Phase Two, Screwdriver is the rawest single of Prince\u2019s career, its overloaded, ragged sound verging on garage rock, or at least Prince\u2019s take on the genre. In fact, your average garage-rock band couldn\u2019t reel off remarkable solos the way he does throughout.\n\n31. U Got the Look (1987)\n\nOf all the artists on whom Prince bestowed his star-making qualities, the least likely was Scottish MOR singer Sheena Easton, recast on U Got the Look as a snarling sexual predator. The song itself is a little lumpy by Prince\u2019s 80s standards, but not without a weird charm, embodied by its fake sportscaster announcements: \u201cBoy v girl in the World Series of love\u201d.\n\n30. I Wish U Heaven (1988)\n\nPrince was fond of describing Lovesexy as a gospel album, but that\u2019s not a term you would use to describes the music on I Wish U Heaven: a thumping, tom-tom heavy beat, thick, chugging guitars, Prince\u2019s vocal floating beatifically above in a cloud of electronics. The lyrics could be about God, or a lover. Either way, it\u2019s a strange and lovely single.\n\n29. America (1985)\n\nAnother single arguably best heard in its 12in version, which in America\u2019s case lasts for nearly 22 minutes of frantic, paranoid acid funk, Hendrix-y soloing and claustrophobic harmonies. The darkness of Vietnam-damaged late-60s US psych recast for the Reagan years.\n\n28. Dirty Mind (1980)\n\nStartling, audacious and filthy from soup to nuts, the Dirty Mind album was Prince\u2019s first masterpiece. Its melding of funk and rock and gleeful nose-thumbing at pop\u2019s standard racial boundaries was Sly Stone-esque, but updated for the 80s. The razor-sharp robot funk of its title track was the perfect calling card: no one else sounded like this.\n\n27. My Name Is Prince (1992)\n\nThe grip he had once exerted over the public slipping, you can see why Prince felt the need to reassert his authority in 1992. My Name Is Prince did it in style. Its intro listed his hits, its lyric switched between proclaiming himself divinely chosen and fretting about judgment day, and its music dealt in heavy breakbeats and noise that suggested he had been listening to Public Enemy.\n\n26. Take Me With U (1985)\n\nThe influence of musical consiglieres Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman started drawing Prince towards the sound of 60s psychedelia on the Purple Rain soundtrack. You can hear the first signs on Take Me With U, a gorgeous, carefree song enveloped by a groggy string arrangement \u2013 written by Coleman \u2013 that never quite drifts in the direction you expect.\n\n25. Guitar (2007)\n\nPlanet Earth wasn\u2019t the best of his latterday albums, but its standout track was among his best his latterday singles, an infectious glam stomp with a typically witty kiss-off lyric: \u201cI love you baby and I wish you well, I\u2019ll write you a letter when I learn how to spell\u201d.\n\n24. I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man (1987)\n\nA return to the pop-rock territory of Little Red Corvette and 1980\u2019s When You Were Mine, I Could Never Take the Place Of Your Man is straightforward compared with a lot of the material on Sign o\u2019 the Times, its lyrical conceit notwithstanding, but it\u2019s a perfect example of Prince\u2019s songwriting craft.\n\n23. Gotta Stop (Messin\u2019 About) (1981)\n\nPerhaps only Prince in 1981 would think a song about voyeurism and compulsive masturbation was just the thing to break him in the UK. Never released as a single in the US, it unsurprisingly wasn\u2019t a hit, but that\u2019s no reflection on its thrilling, wildly idiosyncratic staccato funk.\n\n22. I Would Die For U (1984)\n\nMore personal myth-making \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not a woman, I\u2019m not a man, I am something that you\u2019ll never understand\u201d \u2013 on a single where the indelible chorus masks a genuinely odd production: an unsettling stop-start rhythm that precludes dancing; rattling, incessant hi-hat perplexingly loud in the mix. Still, he knew what he was doing \u2013 it worked.\n\n21. Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night (1992)\n\nCo-written with Rosie Gaines, its commercial chances in the US scuppered by a Spike Lee-directed video that MTV deemed too political and refused to show, Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night is a fantastic song, the smoothness of its sound and delivery masking a punchy, politically engaged lyric that takes in both consumerism and Operation Desert Storm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince in 1997. Photograph: Rick Diamond/Getty Images\n\n20. Controversy (1981)\n\nEffectively early 80s Prince\u2019s manifesto \u2013 \u201cI wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules\u201d \u2013 Controversy also addressed the furore caused by Dirty Mind\u2019s songs about troilism and incest with a blithe shrug and featured a bit of the Lord\u2019s Prayer for good measure. The music, meanwhile, is awesome: tight, funky, fluently melodic.\n\n19. Girls & Boys (1986)\n\nBafflingly unreleased as a single in the US, much to chagrin of some members of the Revolution, Girls and Boys returned Prince to appealingly tough funk, albeit decorated with weird production flourishes \u2013 honking duck-call synths \u2013 and lyrics that spike the mood of sultry eroticism with wit: \u201cShe had the cutest ass he\u2019d ever seen \u2013 but he did too, they were meant to be\u201d.\n\n18. Cream (1991)\n\nT Rex never broke the US, but Prince was clearly a fan and never more so than on this glorious, loving homage to Get It On, complete with lyrical echoes (the object of Prince\u2019s affections is \u201cfilthy-cute\u201d as opposed to \u201cdirty-sweet\u201d). Never given to underestimating his own importance, Marc Bolan would doubtless have adored it.\n\n17. Baltimore (2015)\n\nPrince\u2019s death came amid suggestions he was in the grip of another artistic renaissance. Baltimore was strong evidence: inspired by Black Lives Matter, lyrically angry and confrontational in a way that was unlike his previous political work, it was also blessed with an elegant melody and striking string arrangement.\n\nHow we made Prince's Purple Rain Read more\n\n16. Pop Life (1985)\n\nThe brand of psychedelia found on 1985\u2019s Around The World In A Day never sounded retro or like a pastiche. For all Pop Life\u2019s backwards tapes and melodic nods in the direction of the Beatles, it was resolutely a product of the mid-80s, more evidence of Prince\u2019s ability to not merely absorb influences but recast them in his own image.\n\n15 Let\u2019s Go Crazy (1984)\n\nThe emotional flipside of the eerie, troubled When Doves Cry, Let\u2019s Go Crazy can barely contain itself. One of the greatest intros of the 80s \u2013 \u201cDearly beloved \u2026\u201d \u2013 leads into a relentless rhythmic clatter, explosions of metal guitar, raw-throated exhortations to party and utterly bizarre lyrics: \u201cLet\u2019s look for the purple banana\u201d; \u201cPills and thrills and daffodils can kill\u201d. A joy from start to finish.\n\n14. Head (1980)\n\nThe sound of a libido gone berserk, Head is both irresistible and insane, a falsetto-voiced song about \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a virginal bride-to-be en route to her wedding, who bumps into Prince and is overwhelmed by the desire to fellate him. It should be ridiculous, but its raw funk groove is utterly compelling; Prince\u2019s alchemical powers in full effect.\n\n13. Alphabet St (1988)\n\n1988\u2019s Lovesexy was received coolly on release, which tells you more about the standard of the Prince albums that preceded it than its quality. In reality, it\u2019s the last unequivocally superb album he made, while its lead single is a delight: an explosion of stop-start funk, popping bass and \u2013 in its full-length version \u2013 rapping from his new female foil Cat Glover.\n\n12. Little Red Corvette (1983)\n\nPrince at his most unrepentantly commercial. If MTV and US rock radio wouldn\u2019t play black soul artists, then here was a black soul artist who could make pop-rock singles of a calibre they couldn\u2019t ignore. It was his biggest hit to date, censors apparently missing a reference to its heroine\u2019s pocketful of condoms (\u201csome of them used\u201d) in the second verse.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince in 1990. Photograph: David Brewster/AP\n\n11. Sexy MF (1992)\n\nBoasting the kind of lyric his subsequent conversion to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses would preclude, Sexy MF offers up a JB\u2019s-ish groove that\u2019s simultaneously raw and tightly controlled, a chorus punctuated by the kind of lip-smacking noise also featured on Kiss and its author on superb priapic form: \u201cI got wet dreams comin\u2019 out my ears!\u201d\n\n10. If I Was Your Girlfriend (1987)\n\nA dark, sparse crawl of a song, alternately sexy, pained and weirdly unsettling, If I Was Your Girlfriend played with ideas of gender (the androgynous sped-up vocal was credited to his female alter-ego Camille, a name under which he initially intended to release a whole album) that are commonplace now, but were uncharted territory for mainstream black music 30 years ago.\n\n9. I Wanna Be Your Lover (1979)\n\nPrince\u2019s first truly spectacular single \u2013 and first US hit \u2013 I Wanna Be Your Lover was a fabulous, effortless-sounding song. The sound bore the influence of Chic in its scratchy, Nile Rodgers-ish guitar, while its synth-heavy arrangement presciently suggested what the post-disco future would sound like.\n\n8. Mountains (1986)\n\nA last outing for Prince\u2019s unique contemporary take on psychedelia: an addictive, dizzying wash of sound \u2013 rumbling drums (possibly influenced by Kate Bush\u2019s Running Up That Hill), synths, brass, rolling piano \u2013 topped with a falsetto vocal. The horn breakdown 30 seconds from the end is particularly glorious.\n\n7. Sign o\u2019 the Times (1987)\n\nPrince fired his backing band the Revolution during the making of Sign o\u2019 the Times: a bad move in retrospect, but initially at least his genius seemed unaffected. The title track is brilliantly stark: Aids, the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the crack epidemic co-mingled in a bleak state-of-the-nation address. If Prince was the Sly Stone of the 80s, this was his There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On.\n\n6. Purple Rain (1984)\n\nOriginally a 10-minute-long country and western song intended for Stevie Nicks (who found it \u201ctoo much\u201d), Purple Rain was transformed into an epic power ballad during a six-hour rehearsal and recorded onstage at Minneapolis\u2019 First Avenue club to astonishing, heart-stopping effect. Its elegiac tone makes it fitting that it was the last song Prince played live.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince at Hop Farm festival in 2011. Photograph: Neil Lupin/Redferns\n\n5. 1999 (1982)\n\n1999 is so familiar, it\u2019s easy to forget what a weird idea for a hit single it was: a party-starting P-Funk-y anthem about a vision of imminent apocalypse. Perhaps its lyrics chimed with the fear and paranoia engendered by the escalating cold war. More likely, it was a huge crossover smash because it\u2019s an incredible, impossibly assured piece of music.\n\n4. Gett Off (1991)\n\nPrince\u2019s early 90s albums were nowhere near as consistent as his 80s work, but initially at least, he could still be relied upon to come up with stunning singles. From its opening scream to its ferocious concluding guitar solo, Gett Off is prime-quality Prince: funny, lubricious, preposterously funky, every bit the equal of his best work.\n\n3. Raspberry Beret (1985)\n\nCompared with everything else happening in pop in the nadir year of 1985, Raspberry Beret was in a different league. It represented the pinnacle of Prince\u2019s psychedelic phase: another of Coleman\u2019s superbly woozy string arrangements, a song so perfect and simple it had a kind of instant familiarity, as if you had known it for years on first listen.\n\n2. Kiss (1986)\n\nBy 1986, Prince was peerless, so far ahead of everyone else in contemporary pop it was almost laughable. Kiss was all the evidence you needed. It repeated When Doves Cry\u2019s hugely impressive trick of conjuring up funk without a bassline, and added perhaps the most indelible chorus of his career and a vocal that turns into an astonishing lust-racked scream at 3min 20sec.\n\n1. When Doves Cry (1984)\n\nAgain, the familiarity of Prince\u2019s most famous song tends to obscure what an audacious and daring piece of music it is. Everyone knows that funk is utterly rooted in the drums and the bass. When Doves Cry \u2013 the biggest-selling single of 1984 \u2013 insouciantly turns that on its head. It originally had a bassline, but Prince thought it sounded \u201ctoo conventional\u201d and removed it, leaving only a sparse framework of drums and synth. For a song that inexorably propels people to the dancefloor \u2013 whether at a hip club or a wedding reception \u2013 it\u2019s remarkably downcast. Played in an minor key, its lyrics are alternately desolate, soul-searching and just weird: \u201cAnimals strike curious poses\u201d. Experimental but multi-million-selling, it\u2019s a work of era-transcending genius.", "description": "As a remastered and expanded version of classic album 1999 is announced, we rate the Purple One\u2019s finest funk hits", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c22fa6d116b5b826a01fdb3ad9c1fabd49bff5/0_210_4475_2685/master/4475.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=702e8a03aa9eeef3f904593e9ea42ce9", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
