Not only is she sparking rumours of a possible Oscar nomination for her role in blockbuster hit Hustlers, she turned 50, been on her sellout \u2018It\u2019s My Party\u2019 tour and got engaged to her boyfriend of two years, Alex Rodriguez. It\u2019s been a big year for J-Lo and it\u2019s just got even bigger because she\u2019s launched her 25th scent in her fragrance empire.\n\nThe singer first launched her signature scent Glow in 2002 and it\u2019s been a staple of ours ever since. In fact she\u2019s earned a staggering \u00a32 billion in revenue from her perfumes since they launched. It's fair to say Lopez has dominated the fragrance game.\n\nWe earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.\n\nSHOP NOW\n\nThe actress' newest perfume 'Promise', is available online from today and in stores from the 9th October. A delicious mix of jasmine, honeysuckle and pink berry notes, 'Promise' is well within the sweeter scent palette we've come to know and love from J-Lo.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: . More\n\nWhen asked what inspired the music icon to create the scent, Lopez said:\n\n\n\n\u2018I was having dinner with Warren Buffett and he told me something that really resonates with me: a brand is a promise. It\u2019s a foundation that keeps us going. We all make promises to ourselves and one another, they are meant to be forever\u2019.\n\nFragrances just got deep. And monied. Buffett has a casual net worth of $82billion so we're guessing J-Lo got some pretty good business advice...\n\nThe bottle will set you back \u00a332 for 50ml or \u00a342 for 100ml, which you can buy here.\n\nThe news comes as Lopez also announced on her Instagram yesterday that she will be joining Shakira to play the Pepsi Half Time show at the 54th Super Bowl, taking place on the 2nd February 2020. Is there anything J-Lo can\u2019t do? We think not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Smell rich in one spritz", "authors": ["Charlotte Bitmead"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PxGp3lmYLEwzYTX_trzPcA--~B/aD03MTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/f7bf93a1fd542f16cfc9db5f4ef4e07c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
