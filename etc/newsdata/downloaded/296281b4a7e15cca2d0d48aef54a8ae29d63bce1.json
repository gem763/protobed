The photo was posted to Australian broadcaster Channel Seven's AFL Facebook page and the comments that followed sparked outrage.\n\nTayla Harris of the Blues kicks the ball during the 2019 NAB AFLW Round 07 match between the Western Bulldogs and the Carlton Blues at VU Whitten Oval on March 17, 2019 in Melbourne, Australia.

So when Channel Seven's AFL Facebook page decided to remove the photo, rather than moderate the comments, the outrage grew greater.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with this... its an awesome photo ...great technique of kicking an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AFL</a> ball... we have truly lost our minds if this is what we have to take this down!!! <a href=\"https://t.co/NnIwNyJ0jk\">https://t.co/NnIwNyJ0jk</a> \u2014@CoreyMcKernan\n\nAfter an outpouring of support from players and fans alike, Channel Seven's social media team decided to re-post the photo and admitted their mistake.\n\nWe're sorry. Removing the photo sent the wrong message.<br><br>Many of the comments made on the post were reprehensible & we'll work harder to ban trolls from our pages. <br><br>Our intention was to highlight <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taylaharriss?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@taylaharriss</a> incredible athleticism & we'll continue to celebrate women's footy. <a href=\"https://t.co/p24Ll08LRC\">pic.twitter.com/p24Ll08LRC</a> \u2014@7AFL\n\nAt the statue unveiling ceremony Wednesday, Harris said the statement is \"a big step\" in helping eradicate online bullying.\n\n\"Through the whole situation, it gave people a voice and a bit of power to actually rebut against someone who's said something in a trolling manner. And I think that is a step forward.\"", "description": "An iconic photo of AFLW player Tayla Harris was removed from social media last March after the footballer became the target of relentless online trolling.
