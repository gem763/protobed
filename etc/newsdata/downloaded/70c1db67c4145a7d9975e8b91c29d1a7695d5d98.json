I did not want to leave to leave.\n\n\u201c Because playing at PSG is special. You are part of a team that can win a European competition, that is not something many players can say.\n\n\u201cI could have signed with Everton \u2013 a good club. I would have played a lot, that\u2019s for sure, and had a lot of fun too.\n\n(Image: CHRISTOPHE PETIT TESSON/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cBut Everton doesn\u2019t play in European competition.\u201d\n\nDespite a difficult start to the new season, Everton secured their first Premier League league win since the start of September against West Ham on Saturday to ease pressure on manager Marco Silva.\n\nBernard put the Toffees ahead in the first half at Goodison Park before Gylfi Sigurdsson secured all three points in the final moments of the match to put them 13th in table.", "description": "The Belgium international was heavily linked with a move away from the Parc des Princes over the summer", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Bertrand Guay Afp Getty Images", "Christophe Petit Tesson Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658388.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-FRA-LIGUE1-PSG-REIMS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
