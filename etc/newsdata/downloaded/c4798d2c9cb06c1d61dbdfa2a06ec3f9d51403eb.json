Who did it? Where did they do it? And what did they destroy?\" he told AFP.\n\nVictims marched through Rome to the Vatican, holding signs accusing Francis of being deaf to their cries, and urging the expulsion from the Church of both the abusers and also those who enabled them.\n\n\"I didn't remember my rape - it was very, very violent - until 50 years after it happened,\" Tim Lennon, from the survivors' network SNAP, told AFP.\n\n\"The harm and injury caused by child sex abuse is a life-long injury.\"\n\nInvestigations have shown that in many cases, priests accused of assaulting minors were transferred to other parishes as bishops turned a blind eye to protect the Church's reputation.\n\n'Trampled underfoot'\n\n\n\n\"The rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot, and left to the whims of individuals,\" Marx said.\n\nThe cardinal said it was essential that victims felt they could \"trust the system\".\n\n\"There are no alternatives to traceability and transparency,\" he said, admitting that efforts to cover-up scandals had badly undermined the Church's credibility.\n\nFrancis has told his bishops he wants \"concrete measures\" drawn up against child sex abuse.\n\nBut survivors have lambasted the centuries-old institution for not releasing the names and case files of priests convicted of abuse or possessing child pornography.\n\nThe Vatican has in the past refused to hand over internal documents about child sexual abuse cases to civil authorities investigating paedophilia.\n\nOn Friday, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, one of the organisers of the summit, said the call for statistics to be released was \"legitimate\".\n\nMarx, who belongs to the Church's more liberal wing, said telling the public about what sort of investigations were under way and how many, would help counter \"mistrust\" in the church which \"leads to conspiracy theories\".\n\nA call for transparency\n\n\n\nTransparency was also \"extremely important\" in other areas of the Church's workings, such as \"the area of finances\", he said, calling for \"a courageous step in this direction\".\n\nScandals surrounding the Vatican bank have prompted a clean-up in recent years, first under Pope Benedict XVI and then under Francis, with around 5000 bank accounts being closed.\n\nBut the decision to sack the bank's deputy director in 2017 without explanation prompted a flurry of rumours that he had been dismissed because his investigations into possible illegal activity had hit too close to home.\n\nThe bank's reputation first came into question in 1982 after the body of senior banker Roberto Calvi was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London.\n\nCalvi was often referred to as \"God's Banker\" because of his close ties to the Vatican.\n\nNo-one has ever been convicted of his murder but prosecutors believe it was a mafia killing linked to money laundering via Banco Ambrosiano, the bank he chaired.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A top Catholic cardinal has admitted that church files on priests accused of sexually abusing children were destroyed or never even drawn up in a move which allowed paedophiles to prey on others.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4284/0411455ef1704497b11b1977500bdf91.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-24"}
