(No cabs to be had out there)\" - could refer to date rape.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Legend said he and writer Natasha Rothwell had penned some new lyrics for the song and he had recorded it with Clarkson.\n\nHe said the new version included the lines: \"What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice) / If I have one more drink? (It's your body, and your choice).\"\n\nThe new version will feature on Legend's seasonal album A Legendary Christmas.\n\nLast year's controversy began when the Star 102 radio station in Cleveland, Ohio, removed Baby It's Cold Outside from its playlist following complaints.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams sang Baby It's Cold Outside in the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter\n\nCritics saw it as the story of a man pressuring a woman into spending the night with him when she doesn't want to.\n\nStation host Glenn Anderson blogged that although the song was written in a different era, the lyrics felt \"manipulative and wrong\".\n\nHe said at the time: \"The world we live in is extra sensitive now, and people get easily offended, but in a world where #MeToo has finally given women the voice they deserve, the song has no place.\"\n\nThe song, written by Frank Loesser in 1944, was recorded for the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter and won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1950.\n\nIt has been covered by Lady Gaga, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews, and actors Will Ferrell and Zooey Deschanel in the movie Elf.", "description": "John Legend and Kelly Clarkson rework the Christmas hit that caused a #MeToo outcry last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16DAE/production/_109441639_legend_clarkson_comp_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
