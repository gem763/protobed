Those same fans, it turns out, inspired the two pop stars to mend fences.\n\nIn a Wednesday appearance on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d Perry opened up about her much-ballyhooed beef with Swift, which dates back to 2012 and apparently began over a disagreement about backup dancers. The origins of that conflict, she told the host, were a simple \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe made amends,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have such big groups of people that like to follow us, so they kinda started turning against each other a little bit, too.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019m all about redemption and forgiveness and for setting an example for those younger people that it can be cool to, you know, ask for forgiveness and confront someone you may have an issue with.\u201d\n\nThe two stars captured their eventual truce for posterity in Swift\u2019s \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d music video while dressed as fast food products. Prior to the June release of the video, however, Perry had signaled a cease-fire when she shared a photo of cookies made by Swift with the words \u201cPeace at Last\u201d drawn in red icing.\n\nThe desserts were a particularly fitting gesture, as Perry said she and Swift \u201chave so much in common.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably only 10 people in the world that have the same things in common [that we do],\u201d she added.\n\nLater in the interview, Perry gushed over her fianc\u00e9, Orlando Bloom, whom she described as the \u201ckindest soul\u201d and \u201can encouragement spiritually, emotionally and physically.\u201d\n\nThe pair\u2019s relationship has \u201cdefinitely matured\u201d Perry in many ways, too.\n\n\u201cI used to not wake up until, like, 11 a.m.,\u201d she explained. \u201cNow I\u2019m in bed like a normal person at 10 p.m. ... I guess this is adulting! That\u2019s why I still dress like a child, to fight against [it]!\u201d", "description": "The \"Small Talk\" singer told Ellen DeGeneres she and Swift wanted to set an example of making amends.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8247dc24000012277db489.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
