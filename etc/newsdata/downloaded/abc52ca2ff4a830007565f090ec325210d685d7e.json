I had auditioned for a part on, I believe, NCIS: LA, and I had gotten it,\u2019 he said at the Fandemic Tour in Houston last weekend.\n\n\u2018I was going to go do that show \u2014 I would still be doing that show. But I had read that script, and I said, \u201cI can\u2019t take this part until I at least audition for The Walking Dead.\u201d Everybody thought I was out of my damn mind, but I was like, \u201cI just gotta try.\u201d\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final round of auditions for the show had whittled down the search for Rick and Shane to about ten actors, when they had to read an early scene that introduced Rick and Shane over burgers in their squad car.\n\nPeople told Jon he was \u2018out of his mind\u2019 for auditioning for The Walking Dead (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Normally these auditions are the most artificial, worst-ass things you\u2019ve ever seen. You go into a room with a bunch of people in suits, and you do the scene in front of them, and they\u2019re all awkward and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking at, and they\u2019re thinking about numbers and all this bullsh*t. It\u2019s a real kind of artificial kind of situation,\u2019 Jon said.\n\n\u2018But [showrunner] Frank Darabont did something very different. For the audition for Walking Dead, he had all the people that he was interested in, all the Ricks and Shanes, and he brought them onto a soundstage, and there was a real police car.\u2019\n\n\u2018I remember praying the night before I went in, I just said, \u2018I want to be me tomorrow. Don\u2019t let the situation get the better of you.\u2019 I wanted it real bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And I said, just be graceful and gracious to everybody, and it was a really beautiful process,\u2019 he added. \u2018So they ended up casting me as Shane, and that\u2019s really the part that I wanted.\u2019\n\nSometimes things really do work out for the best.\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 continues on Sunday in the US, and airs in the UK on Fox on Mondays.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
