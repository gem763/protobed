Girardi will be introduced at a news conference Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for this next chapter of my career,\u201d Girardi said in a statement. \u201cThe Phillies have a strong commitment to winning from the owners to the front office to the players to the fans. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve seen up close for the last 30 years of my baseball career. I played against the great Phillies players of the early \u201890s from Dutch Daulton to John Kruk to Dave Hollins, and I managed against their teams during the incredible run they had from 2008 to 2011. To have my name now associated with this great franchise is something that I couldn\u2019t be happier about.\u201d\n\nIt was a busy day around the league for managerial hirings. The Chicago Cubs tabbed former catcher David Ross to replace Joe Maddon, and the San Diego Padres turned to rookie manager Jayce Tingler. The Los Angeles Angels introduced Joe Maddon.\n\nKapler was fired after an injury-depleted team went 81-81 despite significant offseason additions highlighted by Bryce Harper\u2019s arrival. He was 161-163 in his two seasons. The Phillies also interviewed Dusty Baker and Buck Showalter. Girardi was the favorite among vocal fans, who didn\u2019t accept Kapler mainly because of his California-cool personality.\n\nGirardi was one of the most prominent candidates to fill vacant managerial spots across baseball. He also interviewed with the Cubs and New York Mets.\n\n\u201cJoe brings high character and a tremendous work ethic to his position, and he is a proven winner,\u201d Phillies general manager Matt Klentak said. \u201cI look forward to working with him and I believe that he is the right manager to lead our team to the next level.\u201d\n\nGirardi succeeded Joe Torre after the 2007 season and spent a decade in pinstripes. He led New York to its 27th World Series title, beating the Phillies in six games in 2009. He also managed the Marlins one season and was NL Manager of the Year after going 78-84 in 2006, the only manager in the history of the award to win it with a losing record.\n\nGirardi\u2019s record with the Yankees was 910-710, the sixth most wins in team history. Girardi won at least 84 games each season in New York and had four years with 95 or more, including 103 in 2009. He led the Yankees to three AL East titles and six postseason appearances.\n\nThe 55-year-old Girardi hit .267 as a catcher for 15 seasons in the majors. He won three championships with the Yankees in the 1990s and was an All-Star for the Cubs in 2000.\n\nThe Phillies haven\u2019t had a winning season since 2011 when they finished a run of five straight NL East titles, two pennants and one World Series championship under Charlie Manuel.\n\nPhillies CEO John Middleton fired Kapler, overruling Klentak and team president Andy MacPhail. Both men face a critical offseason trying to address the team\u2019s needs. The Phillies sorely lack pitching, especially starters.\n\n\u201cMatt did a great job running the search, culminating with the three exceptional candidates we interviewed,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cUltimately, we all agree that Joe is the right person to lead our team, and I am excited to welcome him to the Phillies.\u201d\n\nGirardi is the 55th manager in franchise history. He\u2019ll wear No. 25.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Philadelphia hired former Yankees manager Joe Girardi to replace Gabe Kapler on Thursday.
