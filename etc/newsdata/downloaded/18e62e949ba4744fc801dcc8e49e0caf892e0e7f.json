We all know how Mr. Trump is against immigrants and he want all immigrants deported.\u201d\n\nAs much as New York City fancies itself a bastion of multicultural liberalism, in recent years, it has seen an uptick in bias-related crimes. MTA workers at Linden yard say the culture there and the agency\u2019s official response to their concerns fit into a larger pattern of increasing hostility toward immigrants and people of color in this majority-minority city \u2014 and they see the Trump presidency as a catalyst.\n\nThey complained to one of their supervisors, Jake Liberovich, about the stickers. His response, they felt, left something to be desired.\n\n\u201cWrite a f-----g complaint. I\u2019m not a policeman,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhat the f--- can I tell you?\u201d\n\nLiberovich, in an interview, confirmed that\u2019s \u201cexactly\u201d what happened.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018Make it official,\u2019 because I\u2019m not going to police who\u2019s putting something on their toolboxes \u2014 it\u2019s not exactly my job,\u201d he said in an interview with POLITICO last week. He also said discrimination was nonexistent in his department.\n\nKhan and his colleagues disagree.\n\n\u201cTrump and his administration's acceptance of Bigotry has made it ok for his supporters to Abase, Demean and Discriminate against Muslims , Immigrants, People of color and last but not least Women,\u201d wrote Khan in an email to POLITICO last week. \u201cIt has gotten so bad that it has almost, if not became a norm. It is happening in our Workplace, on the Media, at Schools you name it. The sad thing is, not enough is being done to put a stop to this and prevent this from happening.\u201d\n\nFor the past year, Khan and several of his colleagues have sought redress for a culture in their corner of Linden yard they describe as rife with \u201ccronyism\u201d and discrimination against workers of color. In a thick portfolio of memos they have sent to New York City Transit\u2019s equal employment opportunity office and shared with POLITICO, they describe a nearly all-white band of supervisors trying to force them to do overtime, when there are no emergencies and other workers are willing to go in their place. They describe being assigned the least desirable jobs, including bathroom cleaning duties \u2014 duties from which white employees appear exempt. They describe complaining to superiors and then suffering retaliation. New York City Transit\u2019s equal employment opportunity office, they say, has provided little relief.\n\n\u201cThe MTA is committed to ensuring that the workplace is free from unlawful harassment and discrimination,\u201d said the MTA\u2019s chief diversity officer, Michael Garner, in a statement. \u201cAs such, we have policies prohibiting discriminatory behavior, as well as other forms of inappropriate workplace behavior. We take these allegations seriously and are investigating them thoroughly.\u201d\n\nLinden yard, where Khan and his colleagues work, is one of the largest maintenance yards in the subway system. Track equipment maintainers like Khan repair payloaders and cranes and hand tools. They build railroad tracks, too.\n\nKhan and his colleagues say the problems with their supervisors began last October, shortly after they\u2019d started their new job assignment there. Khan, 32, has worked for the MTA since 2009. Sharaz Basdeo, his 33-year-old colleague, has worked there since 2012.\n\nBoth had understood that in their new crew, they would have the opportunity to work overtime and earn extra pay. They understood that under certain circumstances, like emergencies, overtime would be mandatory. But they were taken aback one week in early October when a supervisor, Paul Sammons, demanded that they work scheduled overtime the coming Saturday, even though both had family obligations and other workers were willing to do the job.\n\nBasdeo had been planning to take his daughter apple-picking. Khan\u2019s wife, who had suffered several miscarriages, was pregnant again and he had to take her to the doctor.\n\nSammons insisted. They refused. They say a year of retaliation and threatening behavior ensued \u2014 on the part of Sammons and on the part of Howard Brown, who is African American and was their only supervisor of color.\n\n\u201cI am not going to go back and forth with you guys,\u201d Brown told them one day later that month, following another confrontation about workplace rules, Basdeo and Khan say. \u201cI\u2019m letting you guys know I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like my life was in danger\u2026 I genuinely felt like my safety was at risk,\u201d testified Khan in a later memo recounting the incident.\n\nNeither Sammons nor Brown responded to requests for comment.\n\nSoon, Basdeo and Khan found found themselves \u201cconsistently\u201d being sent to do roadwork, often in the \u201cfreezing cold\u201d weather, said Khan. On the weekend, when they did overtime, they were routinely assigned the least desirable jobs, like working with the wet saw, whose fumes would burn their eyes and make it difficult to breathe. They noticed that their white colleagues seemed curiously exempt from bathroom cleaning duties.\n\n\u201cAre white employees superior to colored employees?\u201d wrote Basdeo, Khan, and two other colleagues, Peter Pe\u00f1a and Aehsanullah Hashimi, in April. \u201cIs that the reason why they aren\u2019t assigned cleaning jobs.\u201d\n\nPe\u00f1a and Hashimi were also tired of being referred to as \u201cfluffers,\" a term used by the pornography industry to refer to someone who arouses male actors before they appear on-screen.\n\nIn January of this year, Pe\u00f1a told MTA higher-ups that his supervisor, Liberovich, had been sexually harassing him.\n\nLiberovich had taken to pushing Pe\u00f1a\u2019s head downward in a motion that simulated oral sex, Pe\u00f1a said. He allegedly did this in front of other workers. He called Pe\u00f1a a \u201cfluffer\u201d \u2014 in front of workers, and in front of supervisors Sammons and Brown, who allegedly didn\u2019t bat an eye.\n\n\u201cI do not feel comfortable at work and do not want to be treated like this,\u201d wrote Pe\u00f1a in a memo to the equal employment opportunity office in January.\n\nHe said some of his supervisors asked him to withdraw the complaint, but he wouldn\u2019t.\n\nLiberovich had started calling his colleague, Hashimi, \u201cFluffer No. 2,\" Hashimi said in a memo.\n\n\u201cI told him that was disgusting,\u201d Hashimi wrote. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn an interview, Liberovich, a Russian immigrant, said Hashimi and Pe\u00f1a were just making stuff up, and that he was the real victim.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 59 years old. I\u2019m a grandfather of two. I\u2019m going to do that stupid stuff?\u201d he said.\n\nHashimi, Pe\u00f1a and their colleagues, he added, were \u201cbullying management.\u201d\n\nAsked why, Liberovich said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m Jewish and they are Muslim, that\u2019s one of the main reasons.\u201d\n\nPe\u00f1a is Catholic. Khan said he had no idea Liberovich was Jewish until asked for comment about his remarks.\n\n\u201cIf we have a [vendetta] against him because he is Jewish what about the rest of supervision and management that we wrote letters against,\u201d Khan wrote in an email to POLITICO.\n\nSharaz Basdeo\n\nUltimately, Liberovich said he was transferred to the MTA equivalent of the Department of Education\u2019s \u201crubber room\u201d \u2014 where employees under investigation sit in purgatory, and then to a different rail yard. He was then pressured to retire early, he says.\n\nBrown, according to Basdeo, was transferred to another yard pending the outcome of an investigation.\n\nEven as their supervisors have borne down on them, the supervisors themselves seemed to flout the rules. Basdeo provided photos of a supervisor sleeping on the job and another working on his personal car at an MTA facility.\n\nThe photos have been shared with MTA higher-ups. It\u2019s not clear what\u2019s come of it.\n\n\u201cWe do not provide information as to steps we are taking as we conduct our investigations in a confidential manner,\u201d wrote an assistant vice president of investigations to Khan on May 17.\n\nEddie Yesiltepe, Basdeo\u2019s and Khan\u2019s representative with the Transport Workers Union, who has also complained of retaliation but declined to speak with POLITICO, responded with anger.\n\nDecrying the \u201ccontinued discrimination and harassment,\u201d he urged an investigations official with the agency to act with more haste.\n\n\u201cYour office being understaffed is not the fault of the [members],\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey deserve equality in the work place. I hope you will make it your priority to put this to [an] end.\u201d\n\nBasdeo and Khan say the stress of being targeted at work is seeping into their personal lives and want the MTA to step in and address the situation.\n\n\u201cThe MTA is funded by taxpayer\u2019s money, how would they feel if they found out the work environment employees are working in is inhumane and we are being treated like second-class citizens?\u201d Basdeo wrote in a January memo to his union representative. \u201cThe public has the right to know about our working conditions, and I believe it\u2019s my duty as a tax payer and an employee of New York City Transit to let them know my story.\u201d", "description": "As much as New York City fancies itself a bastion of multicultural liberalism, in recent years, it has seen an uptick in bias-related crimes.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/75/3b/a5252aaa4acb85492a0b887b4d2a/170816-new-york-subway-mta-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
