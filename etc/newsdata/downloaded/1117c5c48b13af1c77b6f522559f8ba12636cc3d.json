Phillip/AP)\n\nContributing columnist\n\nIt\u2019s after Labor Day and the race for the Democratic nomination is now well underway. Despite the fact that it\u2019s a long road trip, the field seems determined to use the byways instead of the highways. Democrats know where they\u2019re headed, but they aren\u2019t so sure when they\u2019ll get there. And at this point, they might be better off with fewer passengers along for the ride.\n\nWatching last night\u2019s debate didn\u2019t do much to help clarify the route. Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren. You can flip the order, but nothing about this latest debate has changed anything about their standings. If you\u2019re Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg, the good news is that you\u2019re still in the next tier, well below the top three, and not at the bottom. Each of the other five had a memorable moment or two, but nothing that\u2019s likely to thrust them into the top five.\n\nSo, where does that leave voters?\n\nDebates are not the best way to assess the most important qualities in a nominee \u2014 their capacity to sort through competing views, consume vast amounts of information and to make considered decisions \u2014 but they are part of the process. For them to be productive, we need more time to explore complex issues and sort through who can take on President Trump, and the only way to get more time with each contender is to put fewer candidates on stage.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s increasingly difficult for some candidates to claim a rationale for remaining in the race. Looking at weeks of national and state polls, most of the candidates have remained in the low single digits, even some who made the debate stage last night. And no offense, but four or five of those microphones could have been put on mute, and we would still have quality, diverse choices for the 2020 nomination. Whatever they might hope, a candidate can meet the de minimis requirements for the debate stage, have a strong single-night performance and not be in the hunt \u2014 really.\n\nThe campaign calendar is moving fast, especially factoring in the coming holidays and the short few weeks early in the year before Iowa and New Hampshire voters take center stage. It\u2019s time to start narrowing this field \u2014 seriously. All props to those who have tried \u2014 putting yourself out there is difficult and so is taking yourself out. But here\u2019s a reality check. If you\u2019ve been in the race for more than a year, had the exposure provided in two national debates, did not qualify for the third debate, and cannot convince donors to give to you or even one person in a poll to identify you as their choice, it\u2019s over. And, when you\u2019ve been sitting at the bottom of the barrel in early-state polls since the flowers started to bloom in the spring, it\u2019s likely that voters believe your viewpoint is represented already by someone else in the field. Or they just aren\u2019t buying what you\u2019re selling.\n\nIn a primary, voters want to absorb the narrower differences among Democratic candidates on some issues, among them climate, guns, criminal justice and the broad differences on others, including health care, immigration and trade and the economy. On health care, it was fascinating to hear and see Warren, Sanders and Biden, side by side defending and explaining their ideas. Is America ready for big change with a plan to get there, or is it easier to transition from Obamacare allowing people to choose what they want? More of that debate, please.\n\nWhat does a person\u2019s style, demeanor and deftness in handling questions tell you about the kind of president she would be? Voters deserve these answers without the distraction of candidates who just aren\u2019t hitting the mark. We had to wait to the bitter end to catch a few moments of authenticity. You could feel the stillness of the room as Biden shared the tragic loss of his wife and daughter and later a son to cancer. When Warren talked about her joy of being a special-needs teacher and the pain and anger of leaving a job because of her pregnancy, she seemed like a neighbor or a friend.\n\nWhether by natural selection or volunteerism (and whether they know it or not), time is up for most of the field. Just because the rules allow you to continue to breathe shallow breaths into your campaign does not mean you should.\n\nAre we there yet? It\u2019s time to get on the interstate.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Moderates stood out in the third debate. Too bad it won\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\nE.J.
