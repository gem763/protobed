There is no shortage of fry cooks. Hence the job pays poorly. They should learn a trade Did you think your tweet was profound or insightful? It wasn't \u2014 Baby eating Robot (@Red_Eye_Robot) October 5, 2019\n\nI'm sure the average fry cook works harder than Tom Brady as well. Does that mean the average fry cook provides more marginal value in his role than Tom Brady does in his? No. Perhaps you should consider learning basic economics before running for congress. \u2014 BattleSwarm (@BattleSwarmBlog) October 5, 2019\n\nFry cooks have no idea about the complexity and risks of running a company. This is not a good comparison. \u2014 Oscar (@RandomFLDude) October 5, 2019\n\nCEOs have more responsibility, specialized skills, and provide far more value than a fry cook. Hence why fry cooks can be replaced with a timer and a robot arm. \u2014 Wander_vibe (@Ashaldaron) October 4, 2019\n\nI think what you are missing is that 1. Most fry cooks would tank a company if they were the ceo. Working smarter>working harder. 2. You can work harder intellectually than someone else. You are just focused on manual labor that any able body can do. \u2014 Zach Williamson (@ZCuddz13) October 4, 2019\n\nSocialists still don't understand shit\u2026\n\nIt's not about how hard you work, but about how easily you can be replaced.\n\nAnyone can stand at McDonald's and make fries, not everyone has the brain and guts to do what needs to be done as a CEO\u2026 \u2014 that guy (@czljp) October 5, 2019\n\nMost fry cooks can\u2019t do the CEOs work but a CEO could do the fry cooks work. After the business closes the fry cook goes home and leaves work there. Many CEOs are still working. \u2014 beauyoung (@beauyoung) October 4, 2019\n\nAnybody can be a fry cook. Very few could be a CEO. \u2014 \u1d18\u1d00\u1d1b\u0280\u026a\u1d04\u1d0b \"\u1d1b\u029c\u1d07 \u0262\u028f\u1d0d\u0299\u0280\u1d0f\u0274\u026a\" \u1d04\u1d0f\u029f\u029f\u026a\u1d00\u0274\u1d0f \u00a9\ufe0f (@65pjc) October 4, 2019\n\nKnowing some CEOs, I doubt that. They live their job. When they aren't in the office, they're at their phones. When they aren't at their phones, they're still ready to be, 24/7. Sure, they've got shitloads of money, but no time to enjoy it. \u2014 Able Archer (@Abl3Archer) October 4, 2019\n\nI cooked for 10 years. Now I own the restaurant. The cooking part was the easy part. \u2014 Neilslocum (@neilslocum1) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd your point is?? \u2014 YoliBurt (@BurtYoli) October 5, 2019\n\nCite your sources \u2014 Bearded Potato (@InclusiveTwit) October 5, 2019\n\nThat is a really really dumb take. \u2014 Michael (@RollCall79) October 5, 2019\n\nThe fact that nearly 77k people think this is true is mind boggling. Then again, people like this elected AOC. Why not an economically challenged neckbeard soyboy too? \u2014 D Wenke (@DaveWenke) October 5, 2019\n\nI was a fry cook for 4 years and you're on autopilot 90% of the time and oh maybe an occasional grease burn. Training took maybe a week or two. These takes need to end. \u2014 Andrew (@agoodwin_) October 4, 2019\n\nSo, go be a CEO. It must be super easy, right? (Anyone with 5 minutes of training can be a fry cook. I know\u2026 I was one. It\u2019s not hard work, it\u2019s tedious and unskilled and doesn\u2019t pay well. Which is why I worked and found a better job.) \u2014 Fenn (@Fenn42132758) October 5, 2019\n\nYou don\u2019t know any CEOs do you? \u2014 varsityredheads (@varsityredheads) October 5, 2019\n\nI hope that\u2019s a joke. Otherwise it may be the stupidest thing I\u2019ve seen on Twitter, and that\u2019s saying a lot. CEOs work harder in ways a fry cook could never imagine or understand. Not to mention when a fry cook goes home, they leave their job at the restaurant. \u2014 Neil Axelrod (@NeilAxelrod) October 5, 2019\n\nI'm starting to think this is a parody account. \u2014 Siberian Tigger (@TiggerSiberian) October 5, 2019\n\nConsidering I have done both, it's not even remotely true or equal. Its an immature way to look at a myriad of problems and boil it down to a false equivalence. \u2014 Preston Hill (@jibannjibartik) October 5, 2019\n\nLol they definitely do not. Maybe you could say the manual labor , but the stress and intensity is definitely not even close. Fry cook, you clock in and clock out. You don\u2019t clock out as a ceo. Your life is that job. \u2014 \u0410ngel (@Angel_the_SLoth) October 4, 2019\n\nRespectfully disagree. Mentally, it\u2019s no contest. \u2014 Michael (@wongisrite) October 4, 2019\n\nYou: complains about how much power CEOs have.\n\nAlso you: Vote me into a position with lots of power. \u2014 Jer\u2122\ufe0f (@jerbergmann) October 5, 2019\n\nFry cooks don't make decisions that affect the entire company \u2014 Space Skelly (@Skullnaught80) October 5, 2019\n\n|\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3 |\n\n| FRY COOKS |\n\n| WORK HARDER |\n\n|THAN YOUR MOM |\n\n| \uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f\uff3f_________|\n\n(__/) ||\n\n(\u2022W\u2022) ||\n\n/ \u3065 \u2014 Cormbreab!!!
