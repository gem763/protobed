If you already have fire, it\u2019s going to catch. Even pull onto the overpass on the 10 freeway. Anywhere but here,\u2019\u201d Melvin recalled telling him, to ABC7.\n\nThe footage shows a CR&R garbage truck smoking from its rig in Calimesa, which authorities have now identified as the cause of the blaze, which destroyed more than seventy homes and has left at least two people dead\n\nSheriff's tape surrounds a smoldering pile of garbage discarded by the CR&R driver on 7th Street as firefighters battle the Sandalwood Fire\n\nBut Melvin said his desperate cries were met only with a vacant stare from the driver, before he dumped the load of burning garbage near Sandalwood Drive and Seventh Street.\n\n\u2018He honestly said I don't know what to do, and him trying to follow protocol by dumping the trash that was on fire, he was trying to save a $150,000 rig and ended up that protocol bit him in the butt, because you don't do that on a windy day,\u2019 he continued.\n\nWithin minutes, the fire quickly erupted, growing to more than 800 acres in size and roaring through the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park, vanquishing 76 homes and killing 89-year-old great-great-grandmother Lois Arvickson, and one other resident who hasn't yet been publicly named.\n\nFamily members of Lois Arvickson are demanding answers. They last spoke to Lois on the phone as she was trying to escape the blaze but lost contact when the line went dead.\n\n\u2018My husband was on the phone with her and her phone went dead,\u2019 Kim Turner, Arvickson's daughter-in-law told KESQ. \u2018She was telling him about the smoke and everything and that's when we lost contact yesterday.\u2019\n\nShawn Melvin (above) said: \u2018I was pleading with him, \u201cDon\u2019t stop here.
