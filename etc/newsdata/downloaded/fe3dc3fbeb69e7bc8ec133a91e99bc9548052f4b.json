The suits themselves start at $17 for women and $22 for men, but if you feel like splurging, you can also get a helmet and some space boots for moonwalking on the office dance floor.\n\n(Image: Netflix)\n\nEleven from Stranger Things\n\n\n\nNetflix's Stranger Things is a phenomenon most of the office has probably binged at least once, so show up dressed as the most memorable character from the series, Eleven. It's based on her look from the first season. The jacket is $32, and the dress to complete the look comes in at $30. You can even grab a couple boxes of Eggo's and paint on a nose bleed for added effect.\n\n(Image: Amazon)\n\nStar Trek uniform\n\nIn many ways, your office is probably like the deck of the Starship Enterprise, so show them who Captain Kirk is by showing up in the StarFleet Officer's uniform. There are versions for both men and women, and they start at $21.\n\n(Image: Amazon)\n\nStar Wars Jedi\n\nIf you're trying to find the right blend of comfort and cool in a Halloween costume, then becoming a Jedi might be the answer. The robe looks as soft as pajamas, but it's a little more expensive at $65. We recommend getting a lightsaber to complete the look.\n\n(Image: Amazon)\n\nGameboy\n\nSee it now: Gamekid costume at Amazon\n\nLastly, this one is perfect for gamers. It mimics the look and style of the original Gameboy. And it only costs $25, making it considerably cheaper than the latest handheld console from Nintendo.\n\nFor more great deals, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.", "description": "We've rounded up our favorite workplace-appropriate costume ideas that you can buy online and get shipped to you in a day or two.", "authors": ["\u00c9lyse Betters-Picaro"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/98ca20c6-e7d5-4c2f-a7c0-383aec4875b5/thumbnail/770x578/87a35dd272959c047148bba22a7d08bc/floppydisc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
