The misleading nature of the so-called facts and some of the ways they assembled their data was so curious and just fundamentally flawed,\" White says.\n\n\"The fact that it was completely without prior warning and in the middle of a trading day has got to be a deliberate attempt to manipulate the market.\n\n\"It is a complex issue, but I just don\u2019t see how you can allow the market to be assailed the way it was, and I think we all need to have a good conversation about what we can do about an overseas entity that appears willing to go to any length to make money.\"\n\nWhite wants investors to know that things will not change a jot in terms of his aggressive global growth and expansion strategy.\n\nHe says he is \"absolutely convinced\" that his company's disclosure around organic and acquisitive growth has been adequate, and that its accounts have been audited to the highest standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I just don\u2019t think we need to change our strategy, because it is correct,'' he says. \"That doesn't change just because there is somebody running around with a loony hat on doing crazy things.\n\n\"The strategy is to grow the company and to build the operating system for global logistics. We have been very clear to the market about what we are going to do going forward, and that hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\"You shouldn\u2019t change your strategy because somebody comes at you from a vector that is very misleading and entirely self serving.\"\n\nThe problem WiseTech faces is that its stock was already eye-wateringly expensive by global standards, and the falling share price shows White's rebuttals are failing to break through the sense that something must be amiss.\n\nThe claims in JCap's reports are hard for investors to verify, so in a sense it has become a question of who you believe - White or JCap.\n\nJCap's claims that customers hate using WiseTech's software are all but impossible to check, as those contacted by AFR Weekend refuse to talk about it. But it was somewhat easier to find those among WiseTech's acquired companies willing to speak up.\n\n\"We sought a strategic partner who understood the complexities of the logistics software industry and had the financial strength and market presence to realise the enormous opportunities around global e-commerce fulfilment, and we found all of those attributes at WiseTech,\" says Bob Malley, managing director of US-based WiseTech subsidiary Pierbridge.\n\n\"My team was pleasantly surprised to discover, during the post-acquisition integration phase, WiseTech\u2019s culture of operational excellence and productive execution, referred to internally as the 'WiseTech Way'. It quickly became apparent why WiseTech has achieved such historic high growth and profitability, while embracing innovation.\"\n\nMichael Thomas, the boss of fellow WiseTech US acquisition Trinium, was similarly effusive, saying WiseTech had lived up to every promise made ahead of the deal in August last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They have improved compensation and benefits for our staff, helped us to improve and secure our hosted infrastructure, and provided management training unprecedented in its rigour,\" he says.\n\nABC 'car crash?'\n\nWhite's attempts to get his message out to investors since the JCap reports have not all gone entirely to plan. An interview on ABC TV on Thursday night showed him looking uncomfortable and being interrupted from off camera while explaining the impact of a Deed of Cross Guarantee on transparency.\n\nJCap's Twitter account was quick to seize on the footage, describing the performance as a train wreck. White says he was just a software engineer trying to answer a technical question that was outside his area of core expertise.\n\nWilliamson says the footage was presented in a way that looked worse than reality.\n\n\"We were approached with the usual thing that it was a pre-record and if any of the questions needed to be redone then it was absolutely fine, and that is not what happened,\" she says.\n\n\"We tried to clarify a technical point for the interviewer so that they could frame the question so it provides the right intel and information in the question. It\u2019s a shame that it has been portrayed as something else.\"\n\nHedge fund manager Ben McGarry, of Totus Capital, remains unconvinced. He says it is hard to see how anyone could justify buying into a stock that is trading at such high multiples, while seemingly growing largely through acquisition.\n\nMcGarry says growing through acquisitions is highly capital intensive and therefore reliant on strong performance in equity markets to maintain the pace of growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That is why it is on people's radar \u2013 a high valuation and an unconventional method of growth which is different to how other types of software companies grow,\u201d he says.\n\n\"These activist reports do shine a light on these businesses and get people asking more questions. Tech businesses that need a lot of capital to grow like Uber, WeWork and Lyft are being de-rated and even some high quality tech businesses which are growing organically have also been de-rated in recent weeks.\"\n\nFor his part White says he remains calm about the share price, as it is one of the few aspects of the company that he cannot control.\n\nWhile the falling price has dented his wealth, he says the valuation is something for the market to deal with; all he can do is be precise in what he promises to investors.\n\n\"I worry about our investors and how the market has to be properly informed, they are my concerns,\" he says.\n\n\"I\u2019m a software guy. If we get that right and grow the business then everything else flows in the right direction - that has always been the case so far.\n\n\"We have had instances before where the shares have fallen, and there is no real difference here, they came back forward again.\"\n\nWith Jonathan Shapiro", "description": "Richard White has pledged to keep an aggressive growth and acquisition strategy, despite his company losing $2.6b in value in a week from short reports he said were wilfully misleading investors into panic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3362%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_597%2C$y_48/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3073c1103c6471709ba4a3731ddd08348651a5f9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
