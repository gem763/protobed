The sister who gave her the sat nav has been described as a 'very sensible' mum-of-two who wouldn't do it.\n\nSpeaking about the voice, Tracy said: 'It was a bit like it was my dirty secret and I felt a bit ashamed.\n\n'I did wonder if I was hearing things at first.\n\n'I've been using it for months with a lady's voice and then all of a sudden one day it said 'turn right a******' in a chap's voice - well I nearly crashed the car.\n\nTracy (pictured) was given the GPS device by her sister Donna Brooke, 12 months ago, after repeatedly getting lost\n\nThe 53-year-old (pictured) was told by TomTom that the mysterious voice on her sat nav was likely recorded by a previous owner or a cheeky friend\n\n'I remember thinking 'oh my god this is dreadful' and told it 'I can't believe you're talking to me like that' then all of a sudden it swore at me again but even worse.\n\n'It then said 'you have reached your destination motherf***er'. It's like it's possessed.\n\n'You can imagine how shocked I was. When I was a child I had my mouth washed out with soap by my mum if I swore so I don't swear. I didn't laugh, I was put out by it.'\n\nDonna offered Tracy the GPS device after discovering that she had ended up driving round Heathrow terminal three on her way home from visiting her in Brentwood, despite having made the trip countless times before.\n\nTechnophobe Tracy spent months hopping out of her blue Nissan Note to stop people on the street and ask them to input her destination into the GPS.\n\nOne day a kind-hearted passerby gave her a crash course in how to use it and activated the voice instructions so that she wouldn't have to rely on reading the map while behind the wheel.\n\nTracy claims that a day out of the blue, six months ago, instead of the soothing strains of the female sat nav voice a 'deep growly' male voice popped up and started spouting filth.\n\nShe continued: 'It's hit and miss, he doesn't come on all the time.\n\nTracy (pictured with Jade) claims the uncouth voice emerges when she makes driving mistakes or delays in following its guidance\n\n'If I delay in taking the turning because of traffic or I go past a turning that's when he generally starts.\n\n'As I'm driving along I start to think the horrible man has gone away and it's just the nice lady and then all of a sudden when you least expect it the chap butts in and he starts again.\n\n'My sister Donna gave it to me because I get lost quite easily.\n\n'When I first got it I couldn't figure out how to use it so I used to stop and ask strangers to show me, but then someone showed me how to set up the 'home' button.\n\n'When I started using it it used to get me lost even more so I used to have rows with it.\n\n'I would shout 'you're a stupid sat nav, you don't have a clue where we're going, I'm not listening to you anymore.\n\n'All of a sudden it just started talking to me and swearing at me, I was most put out.'\n\nAfter six months of putting up with the rude voice, Tracy confessed to her 22-year-old primary school teacher daughter the issue she was having.\n\nJade (pictured with Tracy) admits that she was sceptical that her mother's sat nav was spewing obscenities until she heard it for herself\n\nJade (pictured with Tracy) initially thought the 'possessed' sat nav voice was recorded by her brother Ethan, 17\n\nTracy said: 'I was in the car with Jade and said 'I've got a rude sat nav'.\n\n'She found it funny and thought her 17-year-old brother Ethan was responsible but he hasn't been near it and it doesn't sound anything like him.'\n\nJade admits she was unconvinced that the sat nav was actually swearing at her mum but burst out laughing when she heard the foul language for herself.\n\nJade said: 'I wasn't convinced that the sat nav was swearing at her, I thought maybe she was mishearing it.\n\n'Then it did it and I was crying with laughter.\n\n'I knew people wouldn't believe me so I tried recording it, it was really frustrating when I kept missing this voice.\n\n'I have minutes of video on my phone just trying to capture it and managed to catch it when we arrived at our destination.\n\n'I confronted Ethan over it and he said he hadn't touched it. It doesn't sound like his voice, he's never in the car with my mother and has sworn on all our lives it's not him.\n\n'My aunty and uncle had bought it new. But they are very sensible and have two young children, so it's not likely to have been them.'\n\nTracy (pictured) revealed she's used to the rude voice now, but wouldn't miss it if it suddenly disappeared\n\nTracy added: 'I'm used to it now so it doesn't shock me as much as it did when it first started. I wouldn't miss him if he suddenly disappeared.'\n\nA TomTom spokesperson said: 'It's likely that Tracy has a sat nav where it's possible to record your own voice guidance (this is possible on some of our older devices).\n\n'Whether it's a previous owner, or a cheeky family member or friend, we can assure Tracy that it's not the sat nav shouting obscenities at her.\n\n'If Tracy changes the voice on her sat nav, the swearing will be gone.\n\n'Because this story brought such a smile to our faces, we're going to send Tracy our latest and greatest TomTom Go Premium sat nav.\n\n'It's the most feature-packed, best connected, and smartest navigation device on the market, and best of all, it doesn't have a potty mouth!\n\n'She can also add more fun to her drive with TomTom navigation voices such as Brian Blessed, Billy Connelly or even Spongebob Squarepants.'", "description": "Tracy Dockerill, 53, from\u00a0Buckinghamshire,  claims her satnav unexpectedly changed from using a calm female voice to a potty-mouthed bloke, after she repeatedly yelled at it.", "authors": ["Latoya Gayle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20333402-0-image-a-12_1572363949521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
