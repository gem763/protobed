You\u2019re entitled to do that,\u201d said Kovac, who endured a crisis of four competitive games without a win around the same time last season.\n\nBayern\u2019s 15 points is the team\u2019s worst mark at this stage since Louis van Gaal was in charge in 2010. The Dutch coach, whose side had 11 points at the time, was fired the following April.\n\nKovac doesn\u2019t enjoy the unflinching support of Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, but he has been backed for now by sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pulling in the same direction,\u201d Salihamidzic said.\n\nCoutinho and M\u00fcller, his substitute on Saturday, missed good chances to put Bayern up 3-1 before Alfred Finnbogason equalized for Augsburg in injury time. It was the sixth consecutive game in which Kovac started with Coutinho instead of M\u00fcller.\n\n\u201cWe live in a competitive society,\u201d Kovac said.\n\nThis time last year, Rummenigge and club president Uli Hoene\u00df attacked the media for \u201cderogatory, slanderous reporting\u201d and threatened to take legal action if unfavorable coverage of the team\u2019s struggles continued.\n\nKovac managed to turn the side\u2019s fortunes around and eventually led it to a record-extending seventh straight Bundesliga title, as well as a German Cup victory in Berlin.\n\nThis year, Kovac has been charged with doing better in the Champions League, where his side has already delivered a statement with a 7-2 rout of Tottenham. Bayern next visits Olympiakos on Wednesday, then it returns to Bundesliga action against visiting Union Berlin on Saturday.\n\nDespite its lackluster start, Bayern is just behind leader Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach at the top of the Bundesliga.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one point behind first place. Do you want to talk us into a crisis?\u201d Hoene\u00df said on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with everything but our goal tally.\u201d\n\nLEIPZIG STRUGGLING\n\nLeipzig, which had ambitions of challenging Bayern for the league title this season, is also struggling.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann\u2019s side has not won any of its last four competitive games, leading to criticism from chairman Oliver Mintzlaff after Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Wolfsburg.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a defeat. Five points from the last four home games is too little, two points from the last two Bundesliga games, too. We can do better,\u201d Mintzlaff said.\n\nLeipzig next hosts Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bayern Munich's problems are mounting after its worst start to the Bundesliga in nine years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/germany_soccer_bundesliga_52511_c0-168-4044-2527_s1200x700.jpg?8f4df776a8a4480eeb851f516d5bee9cc4b95236", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
