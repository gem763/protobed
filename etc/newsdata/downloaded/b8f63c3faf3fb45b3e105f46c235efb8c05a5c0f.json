Al Green has been trying for nearly two years to get his Democratic colleagues to start down the path of impeaching President Trump. He finally got his way \u2014 though the reasons now look far different than those the Texan laid out in his first attempt.\n\nThen, it was over the president\u2019s words after the 2017 racially-charged violence in Charlottesville that Mr. Green took to the House floor, and was roundly defeated.\n\nDemocrats have since tested out impeachment over Russian \u201ccollusion,\u201d then impeachment for Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to hinder the Russia probe, then the president\u2019s phone call trying to rope Ukraine\u2019s president into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nNow, in the latest iteration, Democratic leaders say Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stymy that Ukraine probe could be grounds for impeachment on its own.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been everything and anything they think they can throw against the wall and make stick,\u201d said Samuel Dewey, a lawyer at McDermott Will and Emery who used to lead congressional investigations. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a rush to take anything they remotely think is negative and turn it into an impeachment posture.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, though, counter that it\u2019s Mr. Trump who keeps giving them ammunition, making it impossible for them to duck their duty to the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,\u2019\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement this week, as she inched closer to pulling the trigger on impeachment.\n\nIt\u2019s a major evolution from the early days when Mr. Green\u2019s push was marginal.\n\nThe vote on his first impeachment resolution, accusing Mr. Trump of racism, drew support from just 58 members in December 2017. A do-over vote a month later earned 66 members\u2019 backing. And a final attempt this July was backed by just 95 members.\n\nBut things were beginning to move on another track.\n\nIn March Rep. Rashida Tlaib, joined by Mr. Green, introduced a resolution calling for an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump over the Russia probe. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, released to the public in April, fueled the effort, and by the time Mr. Mueller publicly testified in July, support for an inquiry reached the 100 mark among House Democrats.\n\nIt stalled there as lawmakers went back home for a lengthy summer vacation, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged them to focus on legislation rather than impeachment politics.\n\nEven still, House Democrats began to argue to federal courts that they were already in the midst of an impeachment inquiry, despite the lack of an approval-resolution from the full House.\n\nCongress returned to Washington last month with a new gift from Mr. Trump \u2014 the phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Mr. Trump pressed for an investigation into Mr. Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son Hunter.\n\nCiting that phone call, Mrs. Pelosi announced in late September that the House was now officially engaged in an impeachment inquiry, and told committee chairs to pursue the matter wherever it led. This week she called Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to hinder the probe \u201cunlawful,\u201d and suggested the case for impeachment is growing.\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s gotten buy-in from across her party.\n\nEven those who\u2019d been early backers of impeachment over other issues, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, say they\u2019re comfortable with Mrs. Pelosi choosing to take a stand on the Ukraine matter.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely understandable as the right approach because the Ukraine complaint is arguably the complaint that unites the majority of the members of the caucus,\u201d the New York Democrat told The Washington Times.\n\nMr. Green, the early ringleader for impeachment, didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from The Times, but he told Democracy Now in an interview that Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s reversal is \u201cvindication\u201d of his efforts.\n\n\u201cWe need 218 people to impeach. And I think we\u2019ve reached critical mass,\u201d he said.\n\nJennifer Victor, a politics professor at George Mason University, said that before the Ukraine revelations, impeachment was chiefly backed by Democrats with very liberal pedigrees from solidly blue House districts.\n\n\u201cThey were all moving at a relatively glacial pace, and it didn\u2019t seem like the temperature was changing at all,\u201d she said.\n\nUkraine \u201ctipped the scales,\u201d she said.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told The Times that Mrs. Pelosi may have been reluctant to pursue impeachment over Russia because of what it could mean in an eventual impeachment trial in the Senate, opening the door to Mr. Trump creating a spectacle by challenging the origins of the Russia probe.\n\nLimiting impeachment to Ukraine could still put Mr. Biden in an embarrassing position, but it would spare other Obama administration officials from having to explain their involvement in accusing Mr. Trump of conspiring with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections \u2014 a charge the special counsel\u2019s report shot down.\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell said Democrats have treated impeachment as a \u201cprerogative\u201d ever since the 2016 election and the first Russian-interference allegations. An ability to do something about it, though, became a reality when they retook control of the House in the 2018 election.\n\nMr. Trump and the White House see the evolution of the impeachment push as the latest iteration in attempts to undo his surprise victory in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of the USA!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted, using the same words to describe the Ukraine probe as he used to attack the Russia investigation.\n\nPolling shows support for impeachment has grown since Mrs. Pelosi announced the official inquiry, though most of those gains appear to be among Democratic voters who had been opposed, but are now on board.\n\nMr. O\u2019Connell said things could change if the House takes the next step and actually votes on articles of impeachment. The White House this week all but dared Mrs. Pelosi to do just that \u2014 telling her they would refuse to cooperate with subpoenas unless there was a formal vote authorizing the impeachment investigation.\n\nMr. O\u2019Connell warned that a vote like that carried political risks for both sides, but thinks it could turn out well if persuadable voters side with Mr. Trump.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
