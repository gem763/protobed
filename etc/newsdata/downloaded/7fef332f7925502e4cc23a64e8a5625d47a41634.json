Even though Giuliani has lobbied the Ukrainian government for months to probe Biden ahead of the 2020 election, the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in May that there was no evidence Biden and his son violated the law.", "description": "\u201cMaybe they are going to tell us, oh, why they really gave into Joe Biden\u2019s pressure basically leveraging a billion of our taxpayer dollars.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568949705/hannity_78_lkyhdy", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
