It worked!\"\n\nOn Saturday, there were boos ringing around the studio when Simon decided to send Olivia home and save Martin.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGiving his verdict, Simon said: \"I think you're both in this situation because of song choices. Being impartial, I\u2019m making this decision on who I believe the public would like to see through to next week.\n\n\"Based on that reason the person I\u2019m sending home is, unfortunately, Olivia.\"\n\nEven saved celebrity Martin admitted that Olivia was a much better singer than him.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOn whether he expected to be saved, he said: \"I didn\u2019t and Olivia is a wonderful vocalist. 10 times what I am.

Martin Bashir's not great but he knows that.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe added: \"He had a great story and he's a great raconteur, he's just not a great singer.\"\n\nThe hard nosed journalist has secured some of the most coveted interviews ever.\n\nFrom Princess Diana to Michael Jackson, the news man has never been afraid to ask the hard questions.", "description": "After Simon Cowell sent home Olivia Olson instead of the journalist, Martin has joked that he bribed the music mogul with a Bentley", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Pa", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745697.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pride-of-Britain-Awards-2019-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
