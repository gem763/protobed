However, it\u2019s also had a positive effect on commodity currencies NZD and CAD, with the Kiwi dollar close to confirming a bullish reversal pattern, despite printing weak electronic retail sales and a third month of contracting manufacturing PMI. Of course, if data is to improve alongside US-China trade relations, we\u2019d expect further upside. Whilst we remain hesitant to suggest a trade deal is close, we see the potential reversal on NZD/USD as a corrective move as opposed t a full trend reversal.\n\nNZD Large Speculative Positioning\n\nOn the 30th of September we noted the potential for a reversal on NZD/USD, due to extreme market positioning. \u201cNZD is at high risk of a sentiment extreme so could be vulnerable to a bullish rally if economic data allows. With many kiwi crosses looking overstretched to the downside, we\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the potential for bases to form\u201d. With gross-short ant net-short poisoning sat at fresh record highs and the 3-year Z-score at -3.8, the odds of bearish capitulation has only increased. So we\u2019re watching price action very closely as it could be on the cusp of confirming a bullish reversal pattern.\n\nNZD/USD Daily Chart\n\nOn the 1st of October, NZD/USD found itself at a 4-year low. Yet it\u2019s failure to test the August 2015 low produced a spinning top doji just above key support, and the subsequent bullish engulfing candle provided a two-bear reversal pattern. Not only did this coincide with a bullish divergence with the RSI, but the -bar reversal pattern could be the \u2018head\u2019 of an inverted head and shoulders pattern. Yesterday\u2019s bullish engulfing candle suggests the right shoulder (RS) is being formed so, if we\u2019re to see a break above the neckline, we\u2019d assume the bullish reversal pattern to be confirmed.\n\nA break above the neckline confirms an inverted head and shoulders pattern which, if successful, projects an initial target around 0.6450.\n\nTraders may want to wait for a break of 0.6350 for extra confirmation of a breakout.\n\nA minor break below 0.6277 (RS) doesn\u2019t necessarily invalidate the potential pattern, but we could use a volatile break beneath it to step aside or reconsider bearish setups in line with the dominant trend.\n\nThe daily trade remains bearish below 0.6451, so the inverted head and shoulders pattern is assumed to be part of a correction as opposed to trend reversal for now,\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
