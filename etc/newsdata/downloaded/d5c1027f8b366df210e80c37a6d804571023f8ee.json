Following his departure, Gojek president Andre Soelistyo and co-founder Kevin Aluwi will become Gojek\u2019s co-CEOs. Makarim will remain a passive shareholder in the company.\n\nAt a press briefing on Thursday, Soelistyo said there was no set date for the IPO, adding that the company\u2019s aim was to derive half its user base from the international market and half from home market Indonesia.\n\n\u201cWe are already moving along with the journey and processes that we need to improve, to be able to be at that world class standard that global public companies are at, so we've done a lot of things in building better governance,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors and analysts alike are watching the leadership transition closely as the firm continues to compete with rival Grab in the region.\n\n\u201cKevin and Andre have mentored me to be the leader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek\u2019s best,\u201d said Makarim in a letter sent to Gojek staff on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThey have been running this company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their technical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity and their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Gojek introduced a mobile app that allowed users to book rides, and later expanded to a variety of services including payments, as well as on-demand services such as food delivery. But the departure of Makarim, who has long been the face of Gojek, comes at a critical juncture for the ride sharing company. Over the past year it has attempted to expand regionally to markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore, breaking away from a singular focus on home turf Indonesia as it remains locked in competition with Singapore-based Grab \u2013 a rival that had a head start in regional expansion.\n\nGojek\u2019s regional expansion has not always been smooth. Its Vietnam affiliate Go-Viet has seen several top executives leave after less than a year, and Grab remains the market leader in Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand. Gojek also faces questions about its strategy to appoint co-CEOs at a time when it is fighting to keep up with market leader Grab.\n\n\u201cThe co-CEO model will be a challenge for Gojek going forward,\u201d said Chua Kee Lock, chief executive of Singapore venture capital firm Vertex Ventures, which was an early investor in Grab.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t usually happen at most companies. Usually [they] make the best bet [on who should be CEO].\u201d\n\nChua pointed out that a co-CEO model could hinder quick response time when it comes to decision-making, especially in industries like ride-hailing, food-delivery and payments where the conditions can be constantly changing.\n\nA company losing its founder can also be a difficult thing to navigate, especially since they tend to embody the spirit of the company, according to Li Jianggan, founder and chief executive of Momentum Works, an early-stage start-up accelerator in Singapore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a co-CEO before and while it\u2019s good to have someone to share that responsibility, during critical times the decision-making can be challenging,\u201d said Li, adding that often investors will think twice about investing in companies that do not have a clear leader.\n\nBut Gojek\u2019s investors appear to be less worried about the handover. Hian Goh, co-founder and partner at backer Openspace Ventures, said Gojek is a company that plays a \u201cteam sport\u201d.\n\n\u201cAndre and Kevin, as well as many other members of the management have been a quiet foundation stone in executing Nadiem\u2019s vision for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that the transition has been so smooth and the succession has taken place without much fanfare is testament to the depth of the management team and the resilience of the company and the people running it today.\u201d\n\nGojek\u2019s Aluwi said on Thursday that the company looked at a number of different companies globally that had a de facto co-CEO model.", "description": "Ride hailing company Gojek said on Thursday it was still preparing for a future IPO despite a change in leadership structure after its founder and CEO Nadiem Makarim stepped down to join Indonesia president Joko Widodo\u2019s cabinet.Makarim has helmed Gojek since 2010 and steered the firm to a US$10 billion", "authors": ["Zen Soo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2LbnrMJZVg0Rre4xEQ6Zsg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/b8741ffa400d4d76d1fee4a9924e6930", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
