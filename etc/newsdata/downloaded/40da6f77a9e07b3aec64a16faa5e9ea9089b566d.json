The president added: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Clapper said of Trump\u2019s statement: \u201cAt a minimum, it is witness retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt actually conflicts with the spirit of the intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, because one of the purposes is to insulate complainants from retaliation,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cClearly, this is retaliation threatened in the worst way.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that the White House placed the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a secure, limited access, server.\n\n\u201cI never experienced the step of isolating the president\u2019s calls,\u201d Panetta told USA Today.\n\n\u201cThey were always kept in the same place. This is clearly an indication that they were at least thinking of a cover-up if not, in fact, doing that. It\u2019s a very serious matter because this is evidence of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAs House speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered Democrats to narrow the focus of the impeachment inquiry to the Trump-Ukraine scandal, more than 300 former national security officials said in a joint statement that the accusations against Trump amount to an \u201cunconscionable abuse of power\u201d.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes. That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cIt also would represent an effort to subordinate America\u2019s national interests \u2013 and those of our closest allies and partners \u2013 to the President\u2019s personal political interest.\u201d\n\nThe signatories include William Burns, former deputy secretary of state, and Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.", "description": "Pressure on Trump mounts as 300 national security officials say president\u2019s actions constitute \u2018unconscionable abuse of power\u2019", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e8717dc0f4d462f16b876a16bff586e782b529/0_93_3552_2130/master/3552.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d3ff137bf5683855bb9787a358957cf", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
