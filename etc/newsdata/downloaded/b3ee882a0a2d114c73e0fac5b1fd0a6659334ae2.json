This includes public servants, members of the national executive, MPs and members of the provincial executive.\n\n\"After adjusting for inflation, this is more than double the number of civil servants earning more than R1m in 2006-07.\"\n\nThe average wage increase across government was 6.8% in 2018-19, he said, or 2.2% above inflation.\n\n\n\n\"And after adjusting for inflation, the average government wage has risen by 66% in the last 10 years,\" said Mboweni.\n\nFor all civil servants, Mboweni said government will cap the cost of official cars at R700 000 (including VAT) as well as limit cellphone, travel, subsistence and accommodation allowances.\n\nMboweni told MPs that reducing spending on the public service was one way in which he hoped to save the fiscus R150bn in three years.\n\nThe minister said he looked forward to \"meaningful engagements\" with public service unions on reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Treasury's research found that 29 000 public servants earned more than R1m each in 2018 and the average government wage has risen by 66% in the last 10 years, said the finance minister.", "authors": ["- Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6006/bc95fd3ce002463ca3eb4e36f7124429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
