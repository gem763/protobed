Psychologically harder.\n\n\u201cI feel very disappointed, in the first half I wasn\u2019t happy with our performance, from the beginning we had a plan and we didn\u2019t respect the plan, that is what disappointed me most and that is what I told the players at half-time.\n\n\u201cWe scored two goals in my opinion, from the penalty and a good goal from Lucas, but if you only analyse the performance it wasn\u2019t great, we conceded a lot of chances to Olympiacos, the way we conceded the first goal was so painful.\u201d\n\nSpurs looked back to their best against Crystal Palace on Saturday, but they were unable to reproduce that in one of Europe\u2019s most hostile atmospheres.\n\nThey endured a torrid opening 20 minutes and could have been behind by the time Kane smashed home his 15th Champions League goal in 20 games from the spot.\n\nMoura\u2019s powerful drive from the edge of the area put Spurs in control before Podence\u2019s goal on the stroke of half-time allowed Olympiacos back into it.\n\nValbuena completed the comeback with a 53rd-minute penalty, to leave Spurs licking their wounds.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t translate from Saturday that aggressiveness that this level of game demands and that is my biggest disappointment,\u201d Pochettino added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility and it\u2019s not possible for, in three days, how we start the game today to be a massive difference. That is my disappointment. I feel disappointed for everyone.\n\n\u201cAt half-time we realised it and changed it and in the second half we were a little bit better and we conceded a very soft penalty.\n\n\u201cWe created many chances to score, we dominated the second half. Overall, I thought the result was fair.\u201d\n\nOlympiacos coach Pedro Martins was happy his side were able to come back from a sticky situation, but was left wanting more.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe dominated the game. We had more chances, but we paid for two mistakes. We reacted well after that.\n\n\u201cOur reaction was more than positive and we were better.\n\n\u201cTomorrow critics will say Tottenham didn\u2019t play very well, but Olympiacos did play well.\n\n\u201cThe draw is good because we came back from 2-0 but at the end we could do better.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino accepts his side have some hard work to do to cure their defensive woes after shipping a two-goal lead in the Champions League at Olympiacos.
