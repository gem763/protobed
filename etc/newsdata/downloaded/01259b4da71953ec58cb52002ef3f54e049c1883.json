Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe Lyndon LaRouche PAC claimed responsibility for Thursday's stunt, writing in a tweet: 'It was us. Malthusianism isn't new, Jonathan Swift knew that. Sometimes, only satire works.'\n\nSwift, the 18th century satirist, famously proposed eating babies in 'A Modest Proposal,' an essay rebutting the Malthusian theory that catastrophic famines would always limit population and economic growth.\n\nThe town hall incident, which sparked a Twitter feud between Ocasio-Cortez and Trump, puts a spotlight on the esoteric Larouche group, a fringe movement that originated in Marxist student outfit in the 1960s and has evolved to focus on conspiracy theories involving the Queen of England and George Soros.\n\nThe woman at AOC's town hall (both pictured) in New York said, 'I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, we got to start eating babies'\n\nLaRouche movement supporters are seen protesting in Manhattan in 2014. The group has claimed responsibility for planting the audience member at Ocasio-Cortez's town hall\n\nAt the town hall meeting in Corona, Queens on Thursday night, the unidentified woman ranted: 'We're not going to be here for much longer because of the climate crisis! We only have a few months left! I love that you support the Green Deal but getting rid of fossil fuel is not going to solve the problem fast enough.'\n\n'I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, we got to start eating babies,' she added to increasing disquiet among the crowd.\n\nAs Ocasio-Cortez, 29, watched on, the woman removed her coat to reveal a homemade T-shirt that read: 'Save the Planet, Eat the Children.'\n\nThe video was quickly picked up on Twitter, with Donald Trump Jr. posting the clip, saying the woman 'seems like normal AOC supporter to me.'\n\nThe president then retweeted his son's post, adding 'AOC is a wack job.'\n\nThe congresswoman clapped back to Trump, saying, 'Better than being a criminal who betrays his country.'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders also weighed in, telling Trump, 'It's going to be a real pleasure defeating you.'\n\nAs the video went viral, Ocasio-Cortez, who has called for a Green New Deal to combat the climate crisis, called for those critical of the woman's rant to show some restraint, suggesting she may be 'suffering from a mental condition.'\n\n'Hey everyone! We had a fabulous town hall tonight & I'll be highlighting some moments from it. At one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis & want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately. Let's not mock or make a spectacle & let's work on Medicare for All!'\n\nThe unidentified woman ranted, 'We got to start eating babies! We don't have enough time!'\n\nShe added: 'This person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it's not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.'\n\nOcasio-Cortez later tweeted that the woman had been an audience plant.\n\n'Turns out the woman yelling was a Trump supporter,' she wrote.\n\n'Doesn\u2019t rule out potential mental issue,' she continued. 'Earlier this year I was stalked & very nearly hurt by a disturbed person. I don\u2019t take chances & immediately try to de-escalate.'\n\nOn Twitter, the LaRouche PAC took credit for the stunt within hours, claiming they had 'trolled' Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe group took the radical Democrat to task because she didn't 'rule out' eating babies when the audience plant began ranting.\n\nLyndon LaRouche, who died earlier this year, is seen at a press conference in 1986\n\nLaRouche supporters are seen protesting President Obama in 2014\n\nThe LaRouche group have been described as politically unclassifiable, but are strong Trump supporters, believing that the president is the only hope for preventing World War III.\n\nThe group has previously inserted itself into presidential races with political stunts.\n\nIn 1988, LaRouchies circulated leaflets at the Democratic National Convention claiming that the party's presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis, was mentally ill.\n\nThe allegations, though never substantiated, made it into print, and it wasn't long before Republican nominee Ronald Reagan referred to Dukakis as 'an invalid' in public remarks.", "description": "The Lyndon LaRouche PAC claimed responsibility for the stunt on Thursday, writing in a tweet: 'It was us.
