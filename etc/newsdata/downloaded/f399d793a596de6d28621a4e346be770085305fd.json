I wanted to know where the sound came from and it came from him, which you're not allowed to do.\n\n'It's against the rules, it's hindrance, you shouldn't do it. But he said I should have a sense of humour about that but in that moment neither of us were in a joking, laughing kind of mood.\n\nThe Scot wanted the umpire to deal with Fognini but the official failed to do anything\n\n'He [umpire Fergus Murphy] wasn't saying anything to him. I was obviously frustrated with that. He wanted to engage with me, I probably shouldn't have done but I'm not having him talk to me like that on the court.'\n\nFognini has a history of misdemenours on court and the world No 12 has the biggest fine in tennis history on his record. He was charged \u00a3120,000 at the 2017 US Open for a number of different acts, one of which was calling a female umpire a 'c***sucking whore'\n\nNo doubt Murray's anger was exacerbated by the fact that he lost the thrilling match. He had two opportunities to serve out for victory but failed to grasp either and was blown away in the tie-break (7-2).\n\nDespite the defeat, the 32-year-old has made major strides and this was only his sixth singles tournament back from his hip resurfacing operation in January.", "description": "The angry dispute between Andy Murray and Fabio Fognini at the Shanghai Masters continued to rage in the locker room after the Italian's win.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19502246-0-image-a-44_1570640513804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
