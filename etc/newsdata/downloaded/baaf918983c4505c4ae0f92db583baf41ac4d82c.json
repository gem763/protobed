Ardern said: 'We have to now make sure...that we have this conversation, that we talk about our history much more openly'\n\nBritain delivered a 'statement of regret' to indigenous Maori this week for the killing of nine of their number immediately after Cook's landing, although it did not offer a formal apology.\n\nHigh commissioner Laura Clarke was overcome with emotion on Wednesday after acknowledging the 'pain' Cook's men had caused by killing some of the first indigenous people they encountered.\n\nWiping tears from her face, Ms Clarke told elders in the town of Gisborne: 'To you, as the descendants of those killed, I offer my every sympathy.'\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern (left) and British High Commissioner to New Zealand Laura Clarke (right) at Te Poho o Rawiri in Gisborne, New Zealand\n\nHowever, Ms Clarke's words fell short of the full apology that some had demanded from the British royal family.\n\nThe meeting took place near 'Poverty Bay' where Cook and his men docked with HMS Endeavour in October 1769.\n\nThe envoy, 41, said after the meeting: 'Their story needed to be told and needed to be heard... pain doesn't diminish over time.'\n\nBritain's high commissioner to New Zealand Laura Clarke (right) rubs noses with a Maori elder in a traditional hongi greeting in the town of Gisborne\n\nThe commemorative events to mark Cook's landing have been a major source of controversy among the Maori community.\n\nTwo-hundred-and-fifty years ago, Cook's sailors feared they were under attack after finding Maori armed with weapons.\n\nA fight broke out and nine Maori including tribal leader Te Maro were killed over the following days until a Tahitian priest who was travelling with Cook managed to mediate between the sides.\n\nMs Clarke hugs the Maori woman in Gisborne, close to where James Cook landed on the HMS Endeavour 250 years ago and where several native people were killed\n\nHigh Commissioner Laura Clarke (left) wipes her tears after meeting the Maori elder (right) in Gisborne\n\nMany scholars now believe the Maori were probably only making a ceremonial challenge to Cook's men.\n\nMaori tribe Rongowhakaata recently described the first encounter in blunt terms: 'After only being here for two hours, Cook and his crew had trespassed, terrorised, killed and stolen from us.'\n\nIn a public statement last week, Ms Clarke said: 'Here on behalf of the four countries of the United Kingdom, on behalf of the people of those four countries ... I acknowledge the pain of those first encounters.\n\nBritish explorer Captain James Cook (pictured in an 18th-century portrait) sighted New Zealand from HMS Endeavour in October 1769 and landed at what he called Poverty Bay\n\n'I acknowledge the deaths of nine of your ancestors including Te Maro who were killed by the crew of the Endeavour.\n\n'It is impossible to know exactly what led to those deaths but what is clear is your ancestors were shot and killed by the crew of the Endeavour.\n\n'That was greatly regretted by the crew of the Endeavour at the time ... and it is regretted here today.\n\n'It is deeply sad that the first encounter happened in the way that it did and to you as the descendants of those killed, I offer my every sympathy, for I understand that pain does not diminish with time.'\n\nThe high commission's statement said both Captain Cook and botanist Joseph Banks had written in their diaries that they regretted the deaths.\n\nBritain has also been returning some historic artifacts taken by Cook's crew, including canoe paddles.\n\nHowever, officials were careful to point out that Wednesday's expression of regret came from the British government and not from the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.", "description": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country must be more open about its history after the commemorations kicked off to mark landing of British explorer.", "authors": ["Emily Webber", "Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/16/19336304-0-image-a-13_1570290200369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
