It may be too early to call a trend, but with impending arrival of both Zombieland: Double Tap and Little Monsters, we\u2019re feeling these up-tempo undead vibes after a run of very serious entries in the genre. Monsters stars Lupita Nyong\u2019o as a plucky schoolteacher who has to protect her young students from a sieging zombie horde while making them think the whole situation is one big game. Josh Gad is there, leaning into his maximum annoyance mode, and in addition to slaying zombies and keeping a positive attitude, Nyong\u2019o gets to land a right cross on him in a cathartic moment for the folks at home. The new red-band also comes with a special treat: a U.S. release date! Little Monsters will live on Hulu, and it starts streaming on October 11.\n\nRelated", "description": "Lupita Nyong\u2019o has to protect children, slay zombies, and keep Josh Gad in line in the trailer for Little Monsters.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/31/31-little-monsters.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
