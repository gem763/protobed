The Dutch lorry driver, Perry Wacker, received a jail sentence of 14 years for manslaughter at Maidstone Crown Court.\n\nWhile reporting on the Dover deaths, The Independent found links between gangs engaged in trafficking in humans, drugs and guns in the Netherlands and Turkey.\n\nBritish and Dutch investigators, meanwhile, revealed how these elements and accompanying laundering operations revealed contacts between organised crime and political extremists.\n\nThe investigation into the Snakeheads was carried out by a number of different police forces.\n\nIn 2016, Theresa May announced the UK\u2019s intelligence services would be pursuing human smugglers.\n\nMI6 and GCHQ were to be given extra resources to go after networks abroad while MI5 were tasked to work with police to track down those who had been trafficked in the UK and the criminal elements who were controlling their lives.\n\nThe 39 people whose bodies were found in the lorry in Essex on Wednesday were also, it has now emerged, Chinese nationals. The trade in humans, with gangs getting rich on their misery, continues two decades on.\n\nThe investigation into the deaths of the 39 people in the container at Greys Thurrock is being carried out by Essex Police. Mo Robinson, the 25 year old lorry driver from Portadown in Northern Ireland is under arrest.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Two separate warnings were issued, by the NCA, and Border Force, about Purfleet in Essex becoming a destination for smugglers three years ago.\n\nThe primary focus of investigation will now be in Northern Ireland and Bulgaria.\n\nIn Sofia, Boyko Borisov, the prime minister, said the lorry in which the people died, had not been in Bulgaria since 2017.\n\n\u201cWe are all affected by this mass death. Two more trucks are registered here. There is no way we can be connected except the truck sign. Nevertheless, we are working very well with the English services, so we will cooperate as much as possible,\u201d he insisted.\n\nA spokesman for the country\u2019s foreign affairs ministry said the truck was registered in the country under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. He said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that they were Bulgarian citizens.\n\nBulgaria, however, has become a hub for smuggling, including of people, to Western Europe. The US State Department\u2019s \u201cTrafficking in Persons\u201d report, published in June 2019, said government in Sofia does not meet the minimum of standards for elimination of trafficking, but are making efforts to do so.\n\nThe report was based on published CIA findings.\n\nThis stated: \u201cBulgaria is a source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour; Bulgaria is one of the main sources of human trafficking in the EU; women and children are increasingly sex trafficked domestically, as well as in Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and the US; adults and children become forced labourers in agriculture, construction, and the service sector in Europe, Israel, and Zambia; Romanian girls are also subjected to sex trafficking in Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cBulgaria does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, authorities prosecuted and convicted fewer traffickers and issued suspended sentences for the majority of those convicted; victim protection efforts declined and were minimal relative to the number of victims identified; funding for the state\u2019s two NGO-operated shelters was significantly cut, forcing them to close; specialised services for child and adult male victims were non-existent; the government took action to combat trafficking-related complicity among public officials and police officers (2015).\u201d\n\nThere are established British connections to the trade. Six members of a Bulgarian gang were sentenced to a total of 24 years in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court last week after being convicted of trafficking women for prostitution.", "description": "Those inside the container had suffocated, trying to scramble over each other in a forlorn hope of opening the door.\u00a0 Just two of the human cargo were alive.
