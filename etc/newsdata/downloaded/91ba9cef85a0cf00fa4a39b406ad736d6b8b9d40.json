Brexit negotiators. Talks are stuck on proposals to keep open the border and preserve the peace between Ireland, which is staying in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe European Union is always to ready to negotiate with a proper proposal from the United Kingdom side,\u201d Finnish European Affairs Minister Tytti Tuppurainen said Monday. \u201cSo far I haven\u2019t seen any proposal that would compensate\u201d for current insurance plans to keep the border open, she said.\n\nJohnson and Juncker planned to meet for a lunch of snails, salmon and cheese to discuss British proposals for the Irish border, British officials said ahead of the meeting. Johnson is seeking a way to keep Northern Ireland partly aligned with E.U. regulations to avoid a hard border with Ireland, but E.U. negotiators have said that his proposals are not yet specific enough to negotiate in earnest. Officials on both sides of the Irish border fear that if any border controls are imposed, it could reignite dormant violence that was quelled by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nAfter weeks of parliamentary drama in Britain, the House of Commons has now been shuttered until mid-October, the result of a decision by Johnson to suspend the legislature for weeks in the middle of Britain\u2019s biggest political crisis in generations. Before Parliament closed its doors last week, it handed Johnson one embarrassing loss after another, passing legislation to try to bind his hands and request a delay of Brexit until at least Jan. 31 if no transition deal has been agreed before mid-October. Rivals are hoping for a general election.\n\n\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a speech at the Convention of the North at the Magna Centre in Rotherham, England, Friday, Sept. 13, 2019.

Now, many can\u2019t wait for them to leave.]\n\nJohnson has said he does not plan to ask for a delay, raising questions of whether he is preparing to defy British law, and parliament\u2019s will, to lead Britain out of the E.U. without a deal.\n\nJohnson\u2019s allies said Monday that the E.U. needs to make some compromises.\n\n\u201cIt is about whether there\u2019s the political will on the EU\u2019s side to do a deal which I still believe would be in both sides\u2019 interests,\u201d Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News.\n\nJohnson has been calculating that E.U. fears of the economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit will drive them to make concessions at a last-call summit that begins Oct. 17.\n\nBut E.U. policymakers say they cannot grant Johnson what he is asking \u2014 the ability for the United Kingdom to part ways with the E.U. in regulations and trade deals, but to keep an open Irish border. That would harm Europe\u2019s vaunted borderless market and cost businesses more than a no-deal Brexit, diplomats and policymakers say.\n\nJuncker has been deeply pessimistic about whether there is currently enough common ground between the sides to come to an agreement.\n\n\u201cTalks continue to be intense,\u201d said French European Affairs Minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, ahead of a meeting of top E.U. ministers.\n\nJohnson\u2019s comparison of himself to the Incredible Hulk super hero from movies and comic books drew dismay from European policymakers, who said that it was unlikely to help reach a deal.\n\nThe British leader told the Mail on Sunday that Britain would be like Bruce Banner, the mild-mannered physicist who can transform into the Hulk when angered.\n\n\u201cBanner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be \u2014 and that is the case for this country. We will come out on 31 October and we will get it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,\u201d he said.\n\nE.U. policymakers shot him down.\n\n\u201cEven to Trumpian standards the Hulk comparison is infantile. Is the E.U. supposed to be scared by this?\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, a Belgian lawmaker who is leading Brexit negotiations inside the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd so did Mark Ruffalo, the actor who currently plays the Hulk in the movies.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole,\u201d Ruffalo wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nA chaotic final night for Parliament leaves Johnson with bleak choices on the path to Brexit\n\nEx-PM David Cameron \u2018sorry\u2019 for creating Brexit divisions\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The meeting comes after Johnson likened himself to the Hulk who will burst out of the E.U.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/46gSQxwm37G6uYHU-JrqFX-M0hI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LVRYCTWYNII6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
