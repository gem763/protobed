A company is a group of individuals gathered together to solve a problem for other people. This helps to define what the true focus of business creativity should be: intense and lateral thinking about what could be missing from customers\u2019 lives.\n\nBusiness creativity involves skill at identifying and profitably meeting the needs (many of them unspoken and vague) of an audience. Everything else \u2013 the factories, the technology, the logistics, the spreadsheets \u2013 is secondary to this aim. A business cannot succeed if it hasn\u2019t zeroed in on a real, sufficiently urgent, human requirement.\n\nThink of business creativity as intense and lateral thinking about what could be missing from customers\u2019 lives. iStock\n\nA good business understands our needs better than any competitor. Thus, the creativity that really counts \u2013 and that companies should attempt to foster \u2013 is the one that best helps a business to enter the minds of its customers accurately and powerfully.\n\nThe stresses of running any business with even moderate success are all-consuming. It is no wonder, therefore, that enterprises sometimes lack the time to stand back and think creatively \u2013 and suffer accordingly. Nevertheless, we can get into the habit of mentally \u201cstanding back\u201d and wondering whether the future of our business could be a bit different, and richer, than its past.\n\nWe can start by wondering what customers might secretly be hoping for. It sounds odd, but many customers privately harbour hopes of companies that go a long way beyond what is currently on offer.\n\nTake some of the feelings that hover around financial services. When we step back, a bank is not just a place to store money safely, with a competitive interest rate and decent customer service. We want these things, of course, but the secret hope is about something else: help in living well around money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have questions about how to deal with envy, worries about what to spend money on, speculations about how to build up capital and a desire to teach children about the value of money. There are big opportunities for the financial sector in better understanding people\u2019s biggest needs and ambitions around their income.\n\nIt is easy for a company to become fixated on the medium in which it first launched and therefore fail to see that its helpful moves could happily and lucratively transfer. Of any current business activity we can ask ourselves: what is the bigger version? What is the underlying principle within the business? What would it look like for the business to apply the principle in larger ways?\n\nWhen teasing out the underlying principle of a business, we shouldn\u2019t look at what the company actually does so much as the move it is making. The principle of a nut manufacturer isn\u2019t packaging nuts; it is making healthy snacks. The principle of a phone company isn\u2019t making phones; it is communication. This means that one can imagine the business operating in ways that stay faithful to its principles yet involve quite different products and services.\n\nThe underlying principle of the paper clip company is temporary order. The paper clip is a beautifully simple micro-tool devoted to keeping sheaves of paper in order, while allowing them to be easily released. The larger version of this activity could lie in filing cabinets, shelving, bags and briefcases \u2013 in each case, the same principle is involved. One day, the paper clip company could logically get around to car parks.\n\nA brilliant idea will always disappoint certain people \u2013 and yet be worth holding on to.\n\nBeing properly mature involves a frank, unfrightened relationship with one\u2019s playfulness, complexity and ambition.\n\nOr take a company that is making ear plugs. Its underlying principle is quiet. It taps into the need for serenity, for focus in a noisy world, where sound is a disturbing and intrusive factor. This could lead it into new markets: noise-cancelling equipment, acoustic insulation or scented candles that promote tranquillity. They might develop a brand of fee-paying luxury rest rooms that are havens of quiet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe products that any company currently offers tend to be only a small part of the customer\u2019s real needs in a given area. Creatively redefining the business area that a company is working in radically alters the sense of what its core tasks might be \u2013 and therefore where its richest future opportunities might lie.\n\nPlayfulness\n\nWe are the inheritors of a view of life that may be called \u201cbourgeois\u201d in honour of its most ambitious advocates. It sees work and play as radically distinct. Work is serious. It is not meant to be particularly enjoyable. It is what we are paid to do and probably wouldn\u2019t want to do unless we were paid. Play is secondary. It is carefully confined to weekends, holidays and \u2013 characteristically \u2013 childhood; that is, to the non-productive corners of existence.\n\nBut there is another tradition that can be seen as \u201caristocratic\u201d or \u201cbohemian\u201d, that doesn\u2019t draw a sharp line between work and play. The playful person isn\u2019t a slacker; rather, they add a crucial ingredient to productive labour. The playful person finds a way out of the less fruitful aspects of tradition.\n\n\"Being properly mature involves a frank, unfrightened relationship with one\u2019s playfulness, complexity and ambition.\" Niki Fisher/The Illustration Room\n\nThe enemy of play is fear. The problem with fearful people isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t work, but that their work can\u2019t be original. Another way of thinking of fearful people is that they start off as overly \u201cgood\u201d children. They do their homework on time; their writing is neat; they keep their bedroom tidy; they are often shy; they want to help their parents; they use their brakes when cycling down a hill.\n\nBecause they don\u2019t pose many immediate problems, we tend to assume that all is well with \u201cgood\u201d children. They aren\u2019t the target for particular concern \u2013 that goes to the kids who are spray painting graffiti on the underpass. People imagine that the \u201cgood\u201d children are fine because they do everything that is expected of them.\n\nAnd that, of course, is the problem. The secret sorrows and future difficulties of the good child begin with their need for excessive compliance. The repression of more challenging emotions stores up a huge amount of difficulty later in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt work, the good adult has problems too. They can\u2019t play. As a child, they followed the rules; never made trouble and took care not to annoy anyone. But following the rules won\u2019t get you very far in adult life. Almost everything that is interesting, worth doing or important will be met with a degree of opposition.\n\nA brilliant idea will always disappoint certain people \u2013 and yet be worth holding on to. The good child is condemned to career mediocrity and sterile people-pleasing.\n\nBeing properly mature involves a frank, unfrightened relationship with one\u2019s playfulness, complexity and ambition. It involves accepting that not everything that makes us happy will please others or be honoured as especially \u201cnice\u201d by society \u2013 but that it can be important to explore and hold on to it nevertheless.\n\nThe desire to be good is one of the loveliest things in the world, but in order to have a genuinely good life, we may sometimes need to learn to play \u2013 and play naughtily.\n\nThis is an edited extract from The Emotionally Intelligent Office: 20 Key Emotional Skills for the Workplace, published by The School of Life, which runs programs for businesses in Australia.", "description": "The \"soft skills\" of creativity and playfulness can help move a business from fair to flourishing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3784%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_57/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cc936cab6cbe830eab4ea7e17d1139de64dfda1d", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
