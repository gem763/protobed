We will shoot them down, shoot anything that encroaches on our airspace,\" said Salami.\n\nHis remarks came only days after the strikes on Saudi oil facilities claimed by Yemen's Huthis, but the US says it has concluded the attack involved cruise missiles from Iran and amounted to \"an act of war\".\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has been bogged down in a five-year war across its southern border in Yemen, has said Iran \"unquestionably sponsored\" the attacks.\n\nThe kingdom says the weapons used in the attacks were Iranian-made, but it has stopped short of directly blaming its regional rival.\n\n\"Sometimes they talk of military options,\" Salami said, apparently referring to the Americans.\n\nYet he warned that \"a limited aggression will not remain limited\" as Iran was determined to respond and would \"not rest until the aggressor's collapse\".\n\n- 'Crushing response' -\n\nThe Guards' aerospace commander said the US ought to learn from its past failures and abandon its hostile rhetoric.\n\n\"We've stood tall for the past 40 years and if the enemy makes a mistake, it will certainly receive a crushing response,\" Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said.\n\nThe United States upped the ante on Friday by announcing new sanctions against Iran's central bank, with President Donald Trump calling the measures the toughest America has ever imposed on another country.\n\nWashington has imposed a series of sanctions against Tehran since unilaterally pulling out of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal in May last year.\n\nIt already maintains sweeping sanctions on Iran's central bank, but the US Treasury said Friday's designation was over the regulator's work in funding \"terrorism\".\n\nAlso on Saturday, Iran denied its oil infrastructure had been successfully attacked by a cyber operation, after reports of disruptions to the sector online.\n\n\"Contrary to Western media claims, investigations done today show no successful cyber attack was made on the country's oil installations and other crucial infrastructure,\" the government's cyber security office said.\n\nThe statement did not specify which reports it was addressing.", "description": "Any country that attacks Iran will become the \"main battlefield\", the Revolutionary Guards warned Saturday after Washington ordered reinforcements to the Gulf following attacks on Saudi oil installations it blames on Tehran.
