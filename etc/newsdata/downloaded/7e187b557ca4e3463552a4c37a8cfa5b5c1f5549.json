The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.\n\n\u201cHour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,\u201d said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career. That amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.\n\nA study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week \u2013 nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.\n\nMr Harper added: \u201cIn a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon\u2026 It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.\u201d\n\nOne explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.\n\nLast month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain\u2019s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.", "description": "Weekends in Britain would by now be starting at lunchtime on Friday and in 20 years we would not work on Fridays at all were it not for the decline of trade unions in the 1980s, new research suggests.
