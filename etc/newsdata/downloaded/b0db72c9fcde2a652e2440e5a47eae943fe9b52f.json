Can\u2019t wait to get going.\u201d\n\nThe Faf du Plessis-led side have included three uncapped players - paceman Anrich Nortje, wicketkeeper Rudi Second and all-rounder Senuran Muthusamy - in their squad as they begin life without retired veterans Dale Steyn and Hashim Amla.\n\nThe touring side will have interim team director Enoch Nkwe in charge after the decision not to renew the contract of West Indian coach Ottis Gibson following a disappointing World Cup campaign for the side.", "description": "Limited-overs batting stalwart Rohit Sharma will have another chance to resurrect his stop-start test career, but this time as an opener, when India kick off their three-match home series against South Africa at Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435476844&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0J1-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
