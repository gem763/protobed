Recreational weed is still illegal in Pennsylvania.\n\nJohnstown Police Department via Facebook\n\nYet one expert, who has been researching the phenomenon of \"tainted\" Halloween candy -- an issue he said that pops every couple of years -- told ABC News he's never seen a credible threat in his 40 years of research.\n\n\"I've never found any evidence that anybody has been seriously hurt this way,\" Joel Best, who also works as a University of Delaware professor, told ABC News. \"I don't think there's any danger.\"\n\nJohnstown Police Department via Facebook\n\nHe said the concern around Halloween candy usually correlates to a new public concern.\n\nWhen recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado in 2012, he remembered warnings that kids may be fed marijuana-laced treats.\n\nThis year, he noted, it lines up with vaping.
