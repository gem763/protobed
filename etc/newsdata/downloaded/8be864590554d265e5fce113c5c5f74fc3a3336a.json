Please help us keep his spirit alive and happy.\u201d\n\nThe mum then asked that when people see the blue bucket, they \u201cshare a piece of candy\u201d and spread awareness.\n\n\u201cThese precious people are not \u2018too big\u2019 to trick-or-treat,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe post has since been shared more than 27,000 times - with others commenting that they would keep an eye out for the blue pumpkin.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
