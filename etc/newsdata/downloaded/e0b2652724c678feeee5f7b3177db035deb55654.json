I don\u2019t know. Are they going to give Ole \u00a3300million in the transfer window? I don\u2019t know \u2013 nor do the supporters.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cNow, if the youngsters from the academy can\u2019t bridge the gap to the first team, then the executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward needs to take some pressure off Ole and explain how they are going to get back on the up.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come out and given Ole a vote of confidence recently, but the fans want to know what the plan is.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to give youth a chance, tell them. If not, tell them \u2013 but please give them something. From where I\u2019m standing, they\u2019ve got nothing.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see it improving massively before they can do something in the January window. The situation they have \u2013 the lack of goals \u2013 was entirely avoidable.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had all summer to address it. And now it could get worse before it gets better.\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking at the game against Liverpool, but I think a lot depends on the next two matches \u2013 against Norwich City and Bournemouth .\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly a lack of confidence and leadership. No one is barking orders at anyone. When Newcastle scored their winner a couple of weeks ago, no one said a word.\n\n\u201cHarry Maguire tries, but where are those leaders demanding standards are maintained?\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, Bryan Robson and Mark Hughes were setting the levels. Then Peter Schmeichel and Steve Bruce, then myself and Roy Keane, before it passed down to Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, and then Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.\n\n\u201cI watched the interview David de Gea gave after the defeat at Newcastle \u2013 and this is someone who has been a Manchester United player for eight years now.\n\n\u201cHe was being asked questions and was struggling to explain what was going on.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a clue \u2013 and, coming from a senior professional with a wealth of experience at the club, it was worrying.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Former Red Devils' skipper doesn't see the situation improving before the January transfer window", "authors": ["Steve Bates", "Image", "Pa", "Sunday Mirror", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657075.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Former-football-player-Paul-Ince-watches-Bolton-v-Blackpool.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
