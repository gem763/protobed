News of the call came out after a whistleblower filed a complaint saying Trump asked Zelensky to work with the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the matter.\n\nHunter Biden worked with a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma while his father was still vice president in 2016, but they have not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to that work.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump continued to deny that he had engaged in anything other than a congratulatory call, denying there was no impropriety in the conversation and characterizing it as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cwarm\u201d and \u201cnice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a very great conversation, very straight, very honest conversation,\u201d Trump said, saying he\u2019d like to release the transcript of the call while at the same time warning that foreign leaders should feel comfortable speaking \u201copenly and good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love to do it but you have to be a little bit shy about\u201d releasing the transcripts, Trump told reporters.\n\nThose claims have been echoed by senior officials in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who went on a media blitz this weekend to say the conversations were and should remain \u201cprivate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders,\u201d another administration official, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWhat I have a problem with is Congress asking for a transcript between world leaders. I think that those are confidential discussions, and that\u2019s a difficult precedent.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, both Trump and Giuliani have ramped up their criticisms of Biden in an attempt to deflect from the growing scandal. Giuliani said last week that he pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, but both he and the president have leveled vague charges at the former vice president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son,\u201d Trump told reporters in Texas, per The Washington Post. \u201cJoe\u2019s got a lot of problems. Joe\u2019s got enough problems.\u201d\n\nDespite the administration\u2019s assurances that there was no wrongdoing in the White House, the reports have made waves among Democratic leadership.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Sunday called on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower complaint to lawmakers, which the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has so far refused to do.\n\n\u201cThe Administration\u2019s blocking of Acting DNI Maguire from providing Congress with the whistleblower complaint calls upon him to violate the federal statute, which unequivocally states that the DNI \u2018shall\u2019 provide Congress this information,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter this weekend. \u201cThe Administration is endangering our national security and having a chilling effect on any future whistleblower who sees wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nPelosi has largely opposed factions within her party that want to open an impeachment inquiry against Trump, but hinted at the possibility in her letter, saying any effort to block the whistleblower complaint would \u201ctake us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d", "description": "The president said the July call was \u201clargely congratulatory,\" saying he\u2019d release a transcript but had to be \u201ca little bit shy about\u201d these things.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8822142100000a06e9df9e.jpeg?cache=pn1fwvgh9u&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
