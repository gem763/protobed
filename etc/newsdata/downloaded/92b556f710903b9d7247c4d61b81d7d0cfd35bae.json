Push-ups? What actually can help you live to a ripe old age.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n(Matthew Richardson for The Washington Post)\n\nSo you want to live to a healthy old age. But how?\n\nYou could start doing push-ups. A study published in February found that men who can hammer out 40 push-ups in one session had a lower risk of heart attacks and cardiovascular disease compared with guys who could do only 10 or fewer.\n\nOr you could practice going from sitting on the floor to standing. Another study concluded that how easily people over 50 can do that is a good predictor of how long they might live.\n\nPerhaps you want to work on your grip strength. That\u2019s another measure that tracks longevity in middle-aged folks.\n\nAnd if none of those appeal, you could always try improving your walking speed, which researchers have used to predict mortality rates in older adults.\n\nThe problem with any of these approaches is that you would just be training for a particular test, which misses the point. It's not the push-up itself that makes you live longer; it's that you are still strong and nimble enough to execute one.\n\nWhat these tests have in common is they\u2019re good shorthand of things that matter for longevity: overall health, fitness and muscle strength. A fit person walks faster than someone out of shape, and getting up off the floor is tricky for people with weak bones and muscles.\n\n\u201cFrailty is a really bad thing starting in middle age, and even worse as you get older,\u201d says Michael Joyner, a physician and human physiology researcher at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nOne way to think of longevity is \u201cnot as some magic property of a body, but as the lucky state of not having a fatal disease,\u201d says Steve Cole, professor of medicine and psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the UCLA School of Medicine. \u201cBy and large, people don\u2019t die of being old; they die of disease.\u201d Therefore, the study of longevity is a way of looking at disease risk or the rate of disease development, he says.\n\nOver the years, various drugs and nutritional supplements have been studied for their potential to help us live longer, but nothing has been shown to work in humans to the extent that would be required for the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval, says Gordon Lithgow, chief academic officer at the California-based Buck Institute for Research on Aging.\n\nWhile researchers continue searching for a pill to extend life, you\u2019ll have to try these verified methods.\n\n\n\n(Matthew Richardson for The Washington Post)\n\nExercise is key\n\nThe most powerful way to promote longevity and improve your long-term health is also simple and, depending on how you do it, free.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that exercise is the biggest anti-aging medicine there\u2019s ever going to be \u2014 it\u2019s really huge,\u201d Lithgow says.\n\n\u201cHands down, nothing compares to exercise,\u201d says Laura L. Carstensen, founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. \u201cThe great thing is that most people can do it, and you don\u2019t need 10,000 steps per day to get the benefits.\u201d It takes remarkably little exercise to get longevity benefits.\n\nEven 10 to 15 minutes per day provides measurable rewards, says Michael Joyner, a physician and human physiology researcher at the Mayo Clinic. Going from sedentary to even just a bit of exercise is where you get the biggest payoffs. The health benefits \u2014 such as reducing your risk of heart disease and diabetes \u2014 increase with greater amounts of exercise, until you get to about an hour of exercise per day. After that, the rewards start to level off.\n\n\u201cAlmost anyone doing more than that is doing it for things other than health,\u201d Joyner says.\n\nGo ahead and train for that Ironman if that\u2019s what you want, but if you\u2019re exercising for health and longevity, you don\u2019t need to run a marathon. Work by Iowa State University epidemiologist Duck-Chul Lee suggests that even running a little less than 10 minutes per day could decrease your mortality risk by about 30 percent.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to run. Walking or other moderate activities are just as good if you\u2019re looking for a longevity boost.\n\nSome of the early evidence for the heart benefits of moderate exercise came from studies in the 1950s by British epidemiologist Jeremy N. Morris showing that conductors on double-decker buses, who spent their shifts walking up and down, had lower rates of coronary heart disease and thus lived longer than bus drivers who spent their workday sitting. Since then, studies showing the cardiovascular benefits of exercise have been \u201cincredibly consistent, Joyner says.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Physical activity also reduces the risk of diabetes, which one study found shaved six years off life expectancy.\n\nAnd it keeps your brain healthy, too. \u201cExercise has better effects on cognitive performance than sitting around playing brain games,\u201d Carstensen says. A 2006 study in Neuroscience found that exercise spurs the brain to release growth factors that promote new connections between neurons, keeping the brain healthy. There\u2019s even research suggesting that strength training can reverse some age-related changes in your muscles.\n\nThere seems to be something about keeping an active lifestyle, too.\n\nWhen you look at centenarians as a group, they might not be Arnold Schwarzeneggers, but they typically maintain a high level of physical function, says author Bill Gifford, who interviewed quite a few of them while writing his book, \u201cSpring Chicken: Stay Young Forever (Or Die Trying).\u201d \u201cThey can go up and down stairs, probably because they never stopped going up and down stairs,\u201d Gifford says.\n\nHis research for the book spurred him to make sure he was exercising at least a little bit every day.\n\n\n\n(Matthew Richardson for The Washington Post)\n\nGet enough sleep\n\nExtend your life span while you sleep. It sounds like a bad infomercial, but it turns out that sleeping well is a good way to keep your body healthy for the long haul. Sleep is a time when your brain gets caught up on maintenance. In 2013, a team led by Maiken Nedergaard at the University of Rochester Medical Center published a study in Science concluding that sleep helps the brain clear out metabolic waste that accumulated during waking hours, providing a kind of restorative maintenance.\n\nSkimp on sleep, and you hinder this important work.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever missed a night of slumber, you know that sleep deprivation hampers your mood and makes it hard to think clearly, but it can have severe consequences for your metabolic health, as well. Take someone who needs seven hours of sleep per night and restrict them to only five hours of shut-eye for five nights and they experience metabolic changes that look a lot like diabetes, says Satchidananda Panda, who studies circadian biology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.\n\nIndeed, numerous studies have shown that sleep deprivation can decrease insulin sensitivity \u2014 a measure of how well your body regulates blood sugar \u2014 and increase your risk of diabetes. A 2015 meta-analysis found that Type 2 diabetes risk was higher in people who sleep less than seven hours or more than nine hours, compared with people who got seven to eight hours per night.\n\nSo why is sleeping more than nine hours associated with greater mortality? \u201cPeople who sleep 14 hours per day are probably not healthy,\u201d Carstensen says, but it\u2019s hard to say right now whether it\u2019s possible to get too much sleep. Most people are on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nRegularly sleeping too long may indicate a health problem\n\nThe consensus among sleep researchers is that seven to eight hours of sleep is ideal, but that\u2019s just a best guess based on the current data, Carstensen says.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is that most of the data is self-reported and people are really bad at that,\u201d Carstensen says.\n\nThe advent of sleep trackers can help with the measurements, but they aren\u2019t always accurate, so avoid fixating too much on the exact numbers or you may end up in a cycle of anxiety that prevents you from sleeping. The problem is common enough that researchers have coined a term for it \u2014 orthosomnia.\n\nDon\u2019t make a habit of skimping on sleep during the week with the idea that you\u2019ll catch up on the weekends. It doesn\u2019t take many nights of short sleep to reduce insulin sensitivity, and a small study published earlier this year in Current Biology found that recouping on sleep over the weekend didn\u2019t entirely make up for the metabolic problems that developed during sleep deprivation. Furthermore, when volunteers in the study were given the opportunity to catch up on sleep over the weekend, they ended up shifting their body clocks so that it became harder to get up Monday morning.\n\n(Getting enough sleep every night might also improve your work life. In the throes of writing his book, Gifford made a decision to start prioritizing sleep over work. His deadline was fast approaching, and he\u2019d been getting up early and staying up late. Allowing his body to sleep as long as it needed to led to a \u201cradical transformation in my ability to write,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cI\u2019d been trying to work 14 hours per day, and then suddenly I was getting twice as much done in six or seven hours.\u201d)\n\n\n\n(Matthew Richardson for The Washington Post)\n\nEat right\n\nForget all those headlines you\u2019ve seen about \u201canti-aging diets\u201d and anti-aging \u201csuperfoods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese notions are generally not supported by science,\u201d Lithgow says. That\u2019s not to say diet isn\u2019t important, only that \u201cnutrition is just a very difficult science,\u201d he says.\n\nSeverely restricting calories in lab animals makes them live longer, but \u201cit\u2019s not clear that it works in humans,\u201d Lithgow says. Although there\u2019s plenty of evidence that it\u2019s not good to overeat, he says, whether drastically limiting food intake can extend life in people remains an open question. The joke, of course, is that calorie restriction will surely make your life seem longer.\n\nIt might be possible to get some of the benefits of calorie restriction without giving up so much food. Intriguing work by Panda suggests that restricting the timing of when you eat, rather than the amount, might provoke some of the healthy metabolic changes that reduce the risk of diabetes. Most of these studies have been done in mice, however, and Panda acknowledges that the human studies are small.\n\nAlthough Panda is confident enough in the results to have written a book, \u201cThe Circadian Code,\u201d which includes instructions on how to try it, some skepticism is warranted, Joyner says.\n\n\u201cTime-restricted eating has shown some interesting results in small studies,\u201d Joyner says, but \u201cwill it be sustainable over time in the real world? This is important because most dietary strategies work only if they are adhered to.\u201d\n\nHe says he wonders whether the metabolic benefits that Panda has found with time-restricted eating is really about the timing or simply related to people eating less when their dining hours are restricted. One thing shown repeatedly in anti-aging studies is that things that initially look like magic bullets never live up to their initial hype, Joyner says.\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that metabolic health is important for long-term health, because it keeps diabetes in check and that insulin sensitivity in particular appears crucial.\n\nGiven what we know right now, a Mediterranean diet \u2014 with its heart-healthy emphasis on fish, vegetables, fruits, nuts, healthy fats like olive oil, whole grains and limited consumption of red meat \u2014\u201d is probably the best approach for improving longevity,\u201d Carstensen says.\n\nBut the benefits are pretty modest. If you hate eating that way, then the payoff probably won\u2019t feel worth it to you, she says. At least try to eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.\n\nDrink alcohol in moderation\n\nThe idea of red wine as a health elixir became popular in the 1980s with the observation that rates of coronary heart disease were low in France, despite the predominance of a diet relatively high in fat and cholesterol. The French penchant for a glass of red wine with dinner was proposed as an explanation for this \u201cFrench Paradox,\u201d popularizing the notion of red wine as heart helper.\n\nSubsequent studies have indeed found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, and a two-year randomized clinical trial in Israel showed that people with Type 2 diabetes who were assigned to drink a glass of red wine with dinner every night experienced some improvements in blood markers associated with cardiovascular disease risk.\n\nBut other studies suggest that alcohol may raise the risk of many cancers, and a report published last year in the journal Lancet concluded that there\u2019s no amount of alcohol that improves health. What gives?\n\nDrinking red wine is good for you \u2014 or maybe not\n\n\u201cAlcohol studies are very much like nutrition studies \u2014 based almost exclusively on self-reports, and we know that people are really bad at self-reporting,\u201d Carstensen says. \u201cMost people, when they say they\u2019re drinking two drinks per day, are probably consuming more. We don\u2019t know the amounts that people are consuming nor do we know what else they do.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that people who abstain from alcohol are sicker or less healthy than those who imbibe a little.\n\n\u201cThat probably reflects not a lack of alcohol in their system, but something about their world \u2014 that they\u2019re sick or isolated or don\u2019t have friends to meet at the pub,\u201d Carstensen says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a study that\u2019s really controlled for all of those factors.\u201d Which means that the studies calculating the health consequences of alcohol consumption depend on consumption figures that are inherently unreliable and may fail to account for other factors that could be at play.\n\nDrinking to excess \u2014 more than one or two drinks a day \u2014 is unhealthy, and will take a toll on your longevity \u2014 no doubt about it. But taking the published studies together, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a lot of evidence that moderate alcohol is bad for you,\u201d Carstensen says. At the same time, she\u2019d \u201cbe very hesitant to recommend that people who don\u2019t drink should start.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Matthew Richardson for The Washington Post)\n\nManage stress\n\nIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s easy to live in a state of chronic stress, and the problem isn\u2019t just that stress feels lousy. It also makes you more susceptible to diseases that could shorten your life.\n\nResearchers are now learning that many conditions associated with older age \u2014 such as cancer, heart attacks and Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 share a common ingredient: inflammation.\n\nUnder normal conditions, inflammation is simply the body\u2019s response to injury \u2014 it\u2019s how the body heals cuts and wounds and other insults, Cole says. \u201cInflammation by itself is not inherently evil.\u201d But when we\u2019re feeling chronically threatened or under siege, our bodies amp up their inflammatory machinery to ready our biological response to injury, and that inadvertently fuels the development of an array of age-related diseases, where inflammation is a common fertilizer, Cole says.\n\nResearch has identified chronic stresses that can provoke harmful biological changes, including living in poverty, caregiving for a dying spouse, losing a loved one, suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, and experiencing prejudice.\n\n\u201cAny way of feeling threatened or insecure seems to be enough to activate the body to produce more inflammation,\u201d Cole says. \u201cThis is one of the best defined connections between the world as we experience it and how we end up generating a body that\u2019s a fertile ground for the development of these diseases.\u201d\n\nYour chance of developing chronic inflammation also rises with the passing years. \u201cInflammation seems to be a general sign of aging, where our inflammatory processes are being turned on or accumulated,\u201d Lithgow says. \u201cAge-related inflammation is very much like inflammation from an injury, but now it\u2019s coming on without a source of infection.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the antidote?\n\n\u201cObviously we should all just be happy,\u201d Cole says with a laugh, as if it were that easy. He knows that it\u2019s not and says you probably can\u2019t eliminate stress from your life, but you can find ways to manage it. Identify the recurring stressors in your life, and work on a plan to diffuse them.\n\nWellness strategies such as yoga, tai chi and meditation can reliably help diffuse stress, Cole says, although he acknowledges that they often don\u2019t make a huge difference.\n\n\n\n(Matthew Richardson for The Washington Post)\n\nConnect with people, have a purpose\n\nForging connections with other people has been found to be a powerful way to manage stress and improve your overall well-being.\n\n\u201cPeople who report having stronger relationships live longer than people who are socially isolated,\u201d Carstensen says. A meta-analysis published in 2015 calculated that loneliness and social isolation were associated with 29 percent and 26 percent increases in mortality risk, respectively, and living alone was linked to a 32 percent increase risk of dying.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that people who have a strong sense of purpose and meaning in their lives have a markedly lower risk of death than those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHow we can bottle that and make it useful is more of a challenge,\u201d says Cole, who has studied loneliness and longevity.\n\nTelling a lonely person to stop being lonely doesn\u2019t work, Cole says, \u201cbut if you can go to the lonely person and say, \u2018Hey, we really need your help. Is there anything you can do to help others?\u2019 \u2014 that is incredibly powerful. The mechanism here seems to be turning attention away from yourself and your own suffering and toward a community or cause greater than yourself.\u201d\n\nCentenarians tend to have a sense of purpose in their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people who are entering the later phases of life have a clear purpose, something to get up for everyday,\u201d Lithgow says. That thing can be anything from looking after a grandchild or working or tending a garden.\n\nMany centenarians continued working into their 80s, 90s and beyond, Lithgow says, and usually these jobs are in environments where they interact with younger people. Interacting with other generations can keep older people engaged, and some retirement communities and nursing facilities are now taking steps to give their residents opportunities to connect with kids \u2014 for instance, placing kindergarten classrooms in nursing homes.\n\nAging lessons: The things that let you thrive in old age are easier than you think\n\nMaster the basics\n\nMost of the proven tips for living a long, healthy life are not products that you buy, but good lifestyle habits that you adopt (or bad ones, such as smoking, that you either quit or never take up and is clearly associated with diminished longevity).\n\nEven something as simple as always wearing a seat belt can reduce your chances of dying early. Most of the things that make up a longevity lifestyle are simple \u2014 exercise, eat (and drink) healthily, sleep adequately, stay engaged \u2014 if only people would do them.\n\n\u201cTo me, the bottom line is: Live a reasonably moderate life and you\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Carstensen says.\n\nRead more\n\nCliches about only being as old as you feel are starting to have scientific backing\n\nAn ageless questions: When is someone \u2018old\u2019?\n\nVideo: Researchers designed this fitness test to predict longevity.", "description": "The rules are pretty simple \u2014 regular exercise most of all, healthy eating (and drinking), adequate sleep and staying socially engaged", "authors": ["Christie Aschwanden", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zIZEBAAgjCM0lUXn1K8TaHuwPPM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5MQC4DHBJQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
