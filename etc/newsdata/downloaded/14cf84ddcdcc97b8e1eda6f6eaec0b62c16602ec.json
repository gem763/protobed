Prosecutors revealed in court that they want to use allegations from another 12 accusers against him.\n\nGooding is not charged in relation to these other 12 accusers, and a judge will decide later whether prosecutors can use their allegations in court.\n\nAs a handcuffed Gooding, looking somewhat fatigued and bewildered, was escorted into the courtroom, some people in the hallway shouted, \u201cWe love you!\u201d\n\nGooding\u2019s court appearance today came several days after his groping case took a more serious turn.\n\nThe actor initially landed in legal hot water this June, for allegedly grabbing a woman\u2019s breast at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar and Lounge at the Moxy NYC Times Square hotel.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office charged Gooding with two misdemeanor counts in relation to this alleged incident: sexual abuse in the third degree and forcible touching. He pleaded not guilty to these charges.\n\nBut prosecutors revealed in court last week that he had been indicted on Wednesday \u2014 and that this indictment included an \u201cadditional incident.\u201d\n\nCourt proceedings and paperwork today revealed that the two new counts involve allegations that Gooding \u201cpinched the buttocks of a woman without her consent\u201d at Tao nightclub in October 2018; he is charged with forcible touching and sexual abuse in the third degree for this alleged incident.\n\nThe uncharged allegations against Gooding include forcible biting, licking, and kissing on some 12 occasions since 2001.\n\n\u201cDefendant\u2019s past behavior shows that he routinely approaches women while at bars or nightclubs with whom he has limited or no prior interaction, and touches them inappropriately,\u201d prosecutors argued in court papers. \u201cHis prior acts demonstrate that his contacts with their intimate parts are intentional, not accidental, and that he is not mistaken about their lack of consent.\u201d\n\nMark Heller, one of Gooding\u2019s lawyers, contended that the new accuser was after money and went to the cops when it didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cThe new accuser sought to secure a confidential settlement from Cuba after he was arrested and before going to the police,\u201d Heller said in court, further claiming that Gooding \u201cbravely chose not to be shaken down.\u201d\n\nHeller also cited Joe Biden, who has been accused of inappropriate touching, in defending his client from the \u201chysteria and unusual environment and climate that exists today to such an extent that a commonplace gesture is now perceived to be inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look, for example, to the incredible condemnation of Vice President Joe Biden for touching the shoulder of a woman,\u201d Heller said.", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. pleaded not guilty to a four-count misdemeanor indictment charging him with inappropriate conduct involving two women, and prosecutors revealed in court that they want to use allegations from another 12 accusers against him.", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-cuba-gooding-jr.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
