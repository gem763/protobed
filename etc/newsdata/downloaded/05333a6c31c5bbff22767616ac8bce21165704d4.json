REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Files\n\nBlue-chips .FTSE were up 0.4% at 0755 GMT after four straight sessions in the red that wiped off nearly 5% from the index. The FTSE 250 midcap bourse .FTMC climbed 0.2%.\n\nLSE (LSE.L) topped the FTSE 100 leader-board with a 2% rise after a Reuters report that some of its investors had asked Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to sweeten the takeover bid.\n\nA parade of shockingly weak readings on services and manufacturing sectors from multiple major economies has left little doubt that the U.S.-China trade war has constricted global growth.\n\nThe silver lining for investors was growing hopes that central banks will step in with further stimulus. The Federal Reserve - the world\u2019s biggest central bank - has already cut interest rates twice this year.\n\nAdding to anxiety at home, updates this week have not dispelled no-deal Brexit worries, while a survey that showed an unexpectedly sharp downturn in the dominant services sector last month signalled the economy has slipped into a recession.\n\nYields on UK 10-year gilts were below those on 2-year bonds for the second consecutive session.
