However, he is devoted to a life without responsibility, getting drunk and blazed on his boat in Florida, living off of the fortune of his wealthy wife (Isla Fisher).\n\nThis philosophy is tested when a series of unusual events throw his life off course.\n\nMatthew McConaughey plays an hard-partying poet in The Beach Bum (Image: NEON)\n\nNarratively speaking, this is a film that shouldn\u2019t work.\n\nIt is essentially McConaughey wandering round in a haze looking for the next \u2018good time\u2019, which usually involves beer, marijuana, and beautiful women. No matter who dies, who ends up in court, whether he\u2019s penniless or literally sitting on a fortune, Moon Dog seems unaffected and devoted to the idea of greeting success and failure as the same.\n\nThere\u2019s no character arc, no-one learns anything, it breaks every storytelling rule\u2026 and still it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nThere are a thousand films out there that teach valuable lessons, that either inform us or motivate us to do better. But once in a while, it\u2019s fun to follow a film with no message or destination, that just leans on the charisma of its cast and premise.\n\nMuch like The Big Lebowski, the appeal lies in meeting and spending time with these larger than life characters, with McConaughey our slurring tour guide.\n\nZac Efron has a small but memorable role as a rehab patient that Moon Dog spends a wild night with, before throwing his lot in with a sleazy boat captain (Martin Lawrence). Like us, they\u2019re just passengers passing through the Moon Dog experience, giving some kind of strange credence to his meandering.\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Snoop Dogg are the duo you didn\u2019t know you needed (Image: NEON/Vice films)\n\nAs for the star of the show, McConaughey has never seemed more at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is clearly a very cartoonish take on what people perceive him to be, but the actor makes the most of it and slides into every scene like it\u2019s a documentary.\n\nHe enjoys a fun chemistry with Fisher, although his easy connection with Snoop Dogg (playing drug/plane connection \u2018Lingerie\u2019) is so entertaining it\u2019s worthy of a sequel.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for meaning in your cinema, go and see something else.\n\nLike its protagonist, The Beach Bum is a good time that breezes through its obvious flaws thanks to a witty script and the pleasant atmosphere it creates.\n\nBeach Bum is in UK cinemas 25 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
