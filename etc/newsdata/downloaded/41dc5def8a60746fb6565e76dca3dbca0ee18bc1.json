The Eagles! We weren\u2019t playing the Little Sister of the Poor \u2026 and I did this with Case Keenum completing 16 of 22 passes for 257 yards. Did I mention my quarterback was Case Keenum? That\u2019s not Aaron Rodgers back there.\u201d\n\nIt was such a glorious first half \u2014 a Gruden coaching clinic. Every play seemed like the right one. Philadelphia coaching genius Doug Pederson had no answers. The Redskins went into the locker room with a 20-7 lead, having rolled up 278 yards of offense, more than double what the Eagles managed to gain.\n\nOf course, when they ask in that interview about the second half and the final outcome \u2014 a 32-27 Eagles win \u2014 Gruden will try to come up with something funny. Like when he was asked by reporters last week if 2018\u2019s most valuable player on offense, running back Adrian Peterson, would be inactive for the game, and Gruden replied, \u201cIfs. You know \u2014 if the hurricane hits, then we won\u2019t have a game. So I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThen, as Gruden takes his impressive Philadelphia first half video and slinks out the door, someone might ask, \u201cDid you really not dress Adrian Peterson for that game?\u201d\n\nWhat is there to say? It seemed like a good idea at the time? He wouldn\u2019t dare use that special teams rationale again, would he?\n\nI know some will say Sunday\u2019s opening season loss to Philadelphia came down to a number of things \u2014 the defense\u2019s failure to contain former Redskin DeSean Jackson, who had two touchdown catches of 51 and 53 yards, or Keenum\u2019s overthrow of Terry McLaurin in the third quarter for what would have likely been a touchdown after the Eagles had taken a 21-20 lead.\n\nBut I suspect the moment the game changed for Washington was so brief, most probably didn\u2019t notice.\n\nAfter the Eagles took possession at the start of the second half and went down the field in 12 plays for 75 yards, using up 7:10 of the clock, Washington still led 20-14 when they got the ball back on their own 25. First down \u2014 Derrius Guice, no gain. Then a false start penalty put the ball on the 20. Guice got the ball again and lost five yards. On third and 20, Keenum completed an 11-yard pass to Chris Thompson to move the ball to their 26, where Tress Way punted 44 yards to the Eagles 30, and Darren Sproles returned it 17 yards to their 47 yard line.\n\nThat sequence of plays took 2:18.\n\nPhiladelphia scored on their next possession quickly on the 53-yarder to Jackson to take the lead 21-20. Washington got the ball back on its 27 yard line. Three incomplete passes later, they were punting to the Eagles.\n\nTime of possession for the Redskins offense in the third quarter? A grand total of 2:58, putting the defense on the field for more than 12 minutes \u2014 without an injured Jonathan Allen. So of course they wilted.\n\n\u201cWe never had the ball,\u201d were the first words out of Gruden\u2019s mouth to reporters Sunday about what went wrong for his team in the second half. \u201cThey held the ball.\u201d\n\nAll Washington needed in their first possession of that third quarter was to move the chains, grind it out a little, take some time away from the Eagles offense and give the Redskins defense a little more rest. Even if they went four and out on the next series or the series after that, they would have likely buried Philadelphia deep in their own territory with a Way punt \u2014 instead of at the 47, setting up the touchdown pass to Jackson.\n\nWould Peterson have done that? I don\u2019t know. But I know he has in the NFL \u2014 and Guice hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI can just control the things that I can control,\u201d Peterson said after the game about his inactive status.\n\nThe Peterson benching was a disaster for Gruden, who does control such things. Guice carried the ball 10 times for 18 yards.\n\nWashington won\u2019t win many games this year if they have to rely solely on the arm of Keenum, who, nonetheless, had an impressive day Sunday, completing 30 of 45 passes for 380 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nKeenum has to be part of the plan. He can\u2019t be the plan.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
