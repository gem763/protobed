After they departed, CNN continued adding supportive commentators during Trump\u2019s presidency, with Duffy the most recent.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to find people who will come on and support the president\u2019s point of view,\u201d CNN chief Jeff Zucker said at the network\u2019s \u201cCitizen\u201d conference last Thursday. \u201cWe need these voices.\u201d\n\nWhile few Republican Senators have been willing to appear on television to defend Trump pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens, Duffy has become a go-to supporter and lightning rod for controversy.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Duffy suggested Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official and decorated U.S. military veteran who testified that he believed Trump had undermined national security on the infamous Ukraine call, might be loyal to the Ukraine, a country he left with his family at age three.\n\n\"It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy,\u201d said Duffy, who suggested Vindman has an \u201caffinity\u201d for his homeland of Ukraine.\n\nLt. Colonel Alexander Vindman. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo\n\nCNN anchor John Berman challenged Duffy, asking whether he believes Vindman is looking out for America first. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Duffy replied. (Duffy later tweeted that Vindman is \u201can American war hero,\u201d but it\u2019s Trump \"who sets the policy\").\n\nLater on \u201cNew Day,\u201d CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that \u201cwith all due respect to our new contributor, former Congressman Duffy,\u201d his remarks were \u201cinsanity, and frankly, anti-immigrant bigotry.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, anchor Brianna Keilar ripped Duffy for his \u201canti-immigrant bigotry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd questioning of patriotism coming from Sean Duffy, the guy who spent part of his 20s on MTV\u2019s 'The Real World' and \u2018Real World/Road Rules Challenge\u2019 while Alexander Vindman spent his on foreign deployments, including one to Iraq where he earned a Purple Heart after he was injured by a roadside bomb,\u201d Keilar said. (Duffy appeared on Real World: Boston in 1997 and later on the reality competition show.)\n\nAlso, CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza wrote in an online article how it\u2019s \u201cappalling\u201d how some \u201cRepublicans are trying to do to discredit Vindman,\u201d citing Duffy\u2019s appearance on CNN and smears from Fox News hosts and guests.\n\nRegarding Duffy\u2019s comments, Kutler pointed out that Berman, Toobin, and Keilar forcefully pushed back on air. \u201cI think our air speaks for itself,\u201d she said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6e/3c/b5ef77a74b21bb27ba62153b6508/20191029-sean-duffy-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
