Thai Truong said the project began when two female victims of trafficking contacted them last year about a suspected pimp, Jonathan Nyangwila.\n\nTruong said the women, who were from Quebec but based in Ontario, had tried to escape from Nyangwila. \"I know they were extremely terrified to call police.\"\n\nIn the subsequent investigation, police uncovered a \"large criminal network,\" said Truong, who described Nyangwila as the \"kingpin\" at the top of a complicated hierarchy.\n\nThe 28-year-old from Markham, Ont., is now facing more than 30 charges relating to human trafficking, firearms possession, harassment and fraud.\n\nUnderbosses and strikers\n\nPolice said they discovered a criminal organization, which Truong said has no name police are aware of, that was involved in a variety of criminal activities, including fraud and drug trafficking.\n\n\"Organized frauds are occurring across the country. The profit from the frauds that the organization is making is fuelling the human trafficking,\" said Truong.\n\nPolice said the organization was structured with Nyangwila at the top, delegating to several figureheads, including three of his brothers.\n\nInsp. Thai Truong told reporters at York police headquarters in Aurora, Ont.: 'Organized frauds are occurring across the country. The profit from the frauds that the organization is making is fuelling the human trafficking.' (CBC)\n\nUnderneath the figureheads was a group of underbosses, followed by several strikers \u2014 men paid to carry out high-risk frauds in banks and stores.\n\nMany people working under Nyangwila \"had their own stable of girls,\" said Truong. \"For the first time we're actually seeing girls being traded within and controlled by other individuals for the benefit of the organization.\"\n\nOf the 300-plus charges laid against the 31 suspects, about 100 relate directly to human trafficking.\n\nTruong also noted that Nyangwila was arrested in July, but was able to continue controlling and directing the people working under him while in custody.\n\nVictims assaulted, controlled, police say\n\nUltimately, police identified 12 confirmed victims as well as 33 other women who police believe are in the sex trade and were associated with the group over the last year.\n\n\"We're hoping they reach out to us,\" said Truong of the 33 women.\n\nTruong also said the majority of the women came from Quebec and were recruited there, but had been moved to Ontario and then west to other provinces.\n\nHe said women had been recruited from both inside and outside the sex trade, and controlled in \"every way imaginable.\" The confirmed victims range in age from 20 to mid-30s.\n\n\"They may smile at you, they may not appear to be controlled or victimized,\" said Truong.\n\n\"That is not true. We have seen the horrific things that are happening to these women.\"\n\nYork police Deputy Chief Brian Bigras said: \"These victims endured violent assaults, sexual assaults and other degrading circumstances as they were controlled by these violent criminals.\"\n\nInvestigation remains active\n\nTruong told reporters the investigation remains ongoing, with police still seeking several suspects.\n\nYork police also said they continue to urge human trafficking victims to seek assistance.\n\n\"We urge anyone looking for a way out of that lifestyle\" to contact police, said Bigras.\n\nThe five police services involved in Project Convalesce are:\n\nYork Regional Police.\n\nOntario Provincial Police.\n\nToronto Police Service.\n\nPeel Regional Police.\n\nThe Quebec integrated human trafficking task force.\n\nThe Quebec task force is led by Montreal police and includes representatives from the RCMP, the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, and police forces in Quebec City, Laval, Gatineau and Longueuil.", "description": "Thirty-one\u00a0people, including a central \"kingpin,\"\u00a0have been arrested and over 300 charges laid\u00a0in a major\u00a0investigation into human trafficking and organized crime that involved women being moved\u00a0across Canada in the sex trade.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322651.1571239005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/york-police.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
