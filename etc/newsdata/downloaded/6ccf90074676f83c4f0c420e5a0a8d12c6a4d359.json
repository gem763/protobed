Uber can apply for a new license before November and could potentially be granted a longer permit.\n\nIn the next two months, Uber will have to show TfL that its drivers have appropriate insurance and training, and that it has systems in place to prevent driver fraud, a spokesman said. In 2018, Uber was given a 15-month probationary license to operate in London - far less than the five-year private-hire permit it had sought.\n\n\"TfL's recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London,\" said Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, in an emailed statement. \"We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information.\"\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe San Francisco-based company rocked London's traditional black cab service when it arrived in the country in 2012, causing protests and calls for additional legislation in the following years that were echoed across Europe.\n\nTfL said in 2017 that Uber wasn't a \"fit-and-proper\" operator because of safety and governance concerns.

Brash co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive officer and his successor Dara Khosrowshahi struck a more conciliatory tone with London regulators. After the company lost its license in 2017, he wrote an open letter to the TfL apologising for \"the mistakes we've made.\"\n\n\"While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way,\" Mr Khosrowshahi said in the statement.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [LONDON] Uber Technologies Inc has been granted a two-month licence to operate in London as the ride-hailing app makes stuttering progress in winning over the city's regulator. .
