Atul Gupta, Rajesh Gupta and Salim Essa could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Guptas left South Africa shortly after Zuma\u2019s removal from power and are believed to be living in Dubai.", "description": "The United States on Thursday sanctioned the three Gupta brothers at the center of the South African corruption scandal that contributed to the downfall of former President Jacob Zuma, saying they had misappropriated state assets.", "authors": ["Nqobile Dludla", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
