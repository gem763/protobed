Why? Chinese leaders are no longer in complete control of their destiny.\n\nFor more than two millennia, China\u2019s emperors knew how to maintain themselves in power. In fact, they and Japanese and Korean rulers \u201ctraditionally maintained internal stability by keeping their borders sealed,\u201d Arthur Waldron told me this month. \u201cThey understood what today we would call globalizing forces could uncontrollably topple their precarious internal hierarchies.\u201d\n\nAs the famed China historian at the University of Pennsylvania noted, \u201cthe fear of simple horse trading led the Ming dynasty to build immense, useless walls.\u201d\n\nJapan and South Korea later opted for openness. North Korea is determined to remain shut. All three, for vastly different reasons, have models that look sustainable.\n\nChina, however, is half-open and half-closed, and as a result is neither sturdy nor sustainable. This means outside forces\u2014such as customers like the United States\u2014have influence.\n\nXi\u2019s answer is to reverse course and close itself off. His role model is Mao, who did exactly that, ending the relative openness of Chinese society under Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Nationalist Party rule.\n\nNow, Xi is attempting to regain control by, for instance, repudiating the gaige kaifang\u2014\u201creform and opening up\u201d\u2014policies of Deng Xiaoping, Mao\u2019s mostly pragmatic successor. The current supremo has worked to bulk up the state sector at the expense of foreign companies and domestic entrepreneurs, to cut off dissenting voices in the Communist Party and society at large, and to vigorously promote Chinese culture as a cure for foreign influence.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Seven decades after the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, the communist project in China is in jeopardy.", "authors": ["Gordon G.
