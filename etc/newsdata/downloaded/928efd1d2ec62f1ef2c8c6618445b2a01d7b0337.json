He assured the prospective clients that he had connections and solutions.\n\nThe message stoked Dan Larson\u2019s anxiety about his daughter\u2019s college prospects. \u201cWow, I thought my kid was doing well,\u201d he recalls thinking. \u201cNow I\u2019m learning that\u2019s not good enough. I better sit down with Rick.\u201d\n\nMr. Singer pleaded guilty in March to masterminding a $25 million college-admissions cheating scheme. Court hearings and documents laid bare the mechanics of his operation, including how he bribed coaches and fixed test results. Yet a fundamental question remains: How exactly did he persuade families to go along?\n\nIn interviews with The Wall Street Journal, former employees, former clients and parents who thought about retaining Mr. Singer said he knew just how to play on the fears of college-bound students and their parents. He scared them into thinking the teens were at a disadvantage at name-brand schools if they didn\u2019t have an angle or special access, according to parents who hired him and others who considered it. Then he made a tantalizing offer\u2014surefire strategies to gain admittance.\n\nProsecutors say parents who were charged were willing participants. People close to Mr. Singer said those parents generally weren\u2019t naive and understood what he was doing. Other parents who had dealings with him say they were unaware of Mr. Singer\u2019s improper actions.\n\nParents who worked with him and those that considered it described him as a disciplined, confident and sometimes charismatic man who claimed to have influence at top schools. Yet when prospective clients questioned certain tactics, some of these people said, he could grow angry or evasive, sometimes even threatening.\n\nHis message to parents hit on their deepest concern, says Mr. Larson, the swim-team dad and owner of an executive coaching firm: \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not doing enough to help my kid?\u201d\n\nMr. Larson says his daughter is bright and was a competitive swimmer but not a good test taker. When he consulted Mr. Singer around 2012 about the tutoring service he offered, he says, the college counselor floated an unusual plan. Mr. Singer proposed having doctors diagnose the girl with a condition such as anxiety\u2014making it sound like a sure thing\u2014thereby allowing her to take her college-entrance exam with a proctor arranged by Mr. Singer, according to Mr. Larson. The charge would be a $15,000 tax-deductible \u201cdonation\u201d to Mr. Singer\u2019s charity.\n\nWhen Mr. Larson pressed for specifics, Mr. Singer became dismissive and acted surprised, Mr. Larson says. \u201cIt was a \u2018This is what we do every day\u2019 kind of thing,\u201d he recalls. Mr. Larson found the interaction odd. \u201cIt never stacked up as legitimate to me,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t hire Mr. Singer. His daughter worked with other tutors and went to the University of Houston.\n\nMr. Singer\u2019s mode of operation, and how some parents came to step over ethical and legal lines in working with him, are expected to play into the legal defenses of some of the 34 parents who were charged criminally, and in the sentence-mitigation strategies of the 15 who have pleaded guilty thus far, according to defense lawyers and a college consultant close to one family implicated. The sentencings begin this month in federal court in Boston.\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, left, announced charges on March 12 against dozens of individuals allegedly involved in a nationwide college-admissions cheating scheme.

Walker/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nMr. Singer, 58 years old, has admitted to leading a criminal scheme and pleaded guilty to four felonies. \u201cWhat made it very attractive to so many families is I created a guarantee,\u201d he said in a March plea hearing in Boston.\n\nHe has suggested he was just giving parents what they wanted. In a video he made around 2011 in an unsuccessful pitch for a college-admissions reality show, he referred to parents as \u201cout of control.\u201d He described his phone ringing off the hook on Sunday mornings after competitive moms and dads had spent Saturday dinner parties comparing notes on their children\u2019s college prospects.\n\nMr. Singer\u2019s lawyer said his client, who is awaiting sentencing, wouldn\u2019t comment.\n\nMr. Singer could be vague initially about his tactics for securing spots at schools including the University of Southern California and Georgetown University, and he discouraged parents from asking too many questions, according to clients and prospective clients.\n\n\u201cHe was a marketing guy,\u201d says a former employee of Mr. Singer\u2019s Newport Beach, Calif., counseling company, called The Key. \u201cConvincing and persuasive.\u201d\n\nMany affluent parents hire private college consultants as early as a child\u2019s freshman year of high school. The advisers can steer class and extracurricular selections, test preparation, essays and the college search.\n\nMr. Singer promoted his company as a master of admissions, openly playing on parental fear about what he said was a cutthroat process. \u201cDon\u2019t take a chance on your son or daughter being locked out of attending the college of their dreams,\u201d read one ad in a California lifestyle magazine. \u201cThe Key can help you win the college admissions game!\u201d\n\nAn advertisement for Mr. Singer\u2019s Newport Beach, Calif., counseling company, called The Key.\n\nHis company offered legitimate services to some parents and sold others on darker arts.\n\nFederal prosecutors say some paid Mr. Singer $15,000 to $75,000 through a sham charity to cheat on SAT and ACT college entrance exams. They allege he steered clients to doctors to secure special testing arrangements, whether or not teens had medical conditions meriting them, and then a proctor he paid would correct students\u2019 answers at test sites in Texas and California.\n\nOther parents, prosecutors say, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Mr. Singer\u2019s charity for access to what he called a \u201cside door\u201d into colleges, in which he funneled money to coaches or athletic programs. They say he explained to parents that coaches would designate their children as recruited athletes, regardless of ability, nearly guaranteeing their admission. Some parents helped craft bogus athletic profiles for their teens.\n\nWhen San Francisco retail executive Diane Blake emailed Mr. Singer in January 2017, calling her daughter\u2019s top choice of USC \u201cin the reach stretch category,\u201d Mr. Singer responded \u201cthere is a way to garner a guarantee at USC,\u201d but it would be best to discuss it without her daughter present, according to federal charging documents. \u201cLook forward to discussing,\u201d she allegedly replied.\n\nMs. Blake and her husband have pleaded not guilty to conspiring with Mr. Singer to bribe an athletic administrator to get their daughter into USC as a purported volleyball recruit. The former administrator has pleaded not guilty to a charge she conspired with Mr. Singer.\n\nDiane and Todd Blake, shown leaving the Boston federal courthouse in March, have pleaded not guilty to conspiring with Mr. Singer to bribe an athletic administrator to get their daughter into USC.

A former basketball coach, he once challenged a client\u2019s child, who had spouted off about his athletic prowess, to a push-up contest, and beat him.\n\n\u201cI liked him because he got in the kid\u2019s face,\u201d says that client, a Los Angeles-area father who hired Mr. Singer to counsel his two sons. \u201cHe took the gloves off.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts How far would you go to help your child get into college? Join the discussion below.\n\nMackin Carroll, from Orange County, Calif., says Mr. Singer\u2019s message resonated with his mother, who worried he would be left behind in the college-application process. Mr. Carroll, now 24 and a songwriter, says he rejected the directive to \u201ctweak your narrative.\u201d\n\nMr. Carroll says Mr. Singer urged him to say the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks influenced his music and moved him to write patriotic ballads. He was 6 when the attacks occurred. His mother declined to comment.\n\nMr. Carroll says he worked with Mr. Singer for a few years in high school and was admitted to USC, without resorting to any trickery, to study music.\n\n\u201cRick was so good at selling that by the time he got done, you thought you needed what he was selling,\u201d says Tre Conway, a former director at a Los Angeles school where Mr. Singer counseled students. She said he regularly dropped the names of high-profile clients, including executives and celebrities.\n\nMr. Singer allegedly used illegal tactics to get students into the University of Southern California.

Fallon for The Wall Street Journal\n\nEric Webb, a Peoria, Ill., executive, says Mr. Singer\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of colleges helped his son find a school that was a good fit.\n\nMr. Webb hired him again for a daughter, who he says is athletic and had excellent grades. He says Mr. Singer warned that she faced stiff competition to get into schools that were on her short list.\n\nHe recalls Mr. Singer advising: \u201cThere are some schools that you might not be able to get into even though you have straight A\u2019s and a good r\u00e9sum\u00e9. But if you go there through sports, you may have a leg up.\u201d\n\nMr. Webb says Mr. Singer recommended that his daughter pitch herself for the crew team\u2014even though she wasn\u2019t a rower. Mr. Webb bought an ergometer to see whether his daughter\u2019s times were in the ballpark of competitive. She wasn\u2019t interested in the sport, so they didn\u2019t pursue it further. She landed at a top choice.\n\nA Nevada chief executive says he hired Mr. Singer in 2012 to counsel his daughter, after a referral from a Bay Area CEO. He says Mr. Singer, on his first visit, asked his daughter, ranked second in her sophomore class, to talk about herself.\n\nShe told him about her grades, PSAT scores and community-service work. \u201cNope, you\u2019re not special,\u201d she recalls Mr. Singer saying. \u201cIt just destroyed me, and it scared my parents. He was really smart about this. He would pick at every insecurity. He would make you feel absolutely worthless and completely dependent on him to get into college.\u201d\n\nSays the father: \u201cParents want a quick fix. This is on parents, too.\u201d\n\nDuring their third or fourth meeting, she says, Mr. Singer explained casually that there was an admissions \u201cfront door,\u201d where applicants got in the regular way, a \u201cback door,\u201d where families made big donations to increase their odds, and a \u201cside door\u201d\u2014a sure-thing strategy he had invented.\n\nCollege coaches had excess walk-on spots that could go unused each year, she recalls him saying. He matched clients to those spots. Teens wouldn\u2019t have to play, and no harm resulted because the \u201cspot would go to waste\u201d otherwise, she recalls him saying.\n\nShe says he didn\u2019t mention money and made it sound like a benign hack, and that her family just brushed it off. They were confident she could get in to one of the roughly dozen colleges she applied to the regular way.\n\nIn her senior year, she says, Mr. Singer told her to decide \u201chow to identify\u201d on her college application to be most competitive. Though she is white, she recalls him telling her that if she identified with the African-American struggle, she could categorize herself as black, and that he could get her a \u201ctribal card\u201d if she wished to check Native American.\n\n\u201cThere is zero chance I do that,\u201d she says she replied. He told her he was merely offering options, she says. Other clients did fudge their ethnicity, say people familiar with the federal investigation.\n\nThe girl, who graduated as valedictorian, didn\u2019t get her top choice but landed at another elite university.\n\nHer father says he also hired Mr. Singer to help his son. Though a good student and competitive tennis player, the boy\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was a cut below his sister\u2019s. His father was interested in Georgetown, where prosecutors said Mr. Singer paid then head tennis coach Gordon Ernst more than $2.7 million in bribes between 2012 and 2018 to promote students for admission. Mr. Ernst pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit racketeering.\n\nThe father recalls that while visiting Georgetown for another reason in 2017, he called Mr. Singer to discuss his son\u2019s chances. \u201cDo you want me to make it happen?\u201d he recalls Mr. Singer responding, suggesting a donation of $400,000 to Georgetown\u2019s tennis program.\n\nProsecutors said Mr. Singer bribed Gordon Ernst, left, Georgetown University's former head tennis coach, to promote students for admission. Photo: brian snyder/Reuters\n\nMr. Singer arranged a private meeting with Mr. Ernst for that same day, the father recalls. The meeting turned strange fast, he says. When the dad pressed Mr. Ernst on how the donation would be spent\u2014scholarships? travel costs?\u2014the coach acted confused, he says.\n\n\u201cWell, a coach has to eat,\u201d Mr. Ernst finally said, according to the father.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Ernst declined to comment.\n\nThe father says he left stunned and was still on campus when Mr. Singer called minutes later. \u201cRick, I don\u2019t understand. I thought this was going to the program,\u201d the father recalls telling Mr. Singer.\n\nMr. Singer, he says, insisted that money to the coach was the same thing. The father resisted and hung up thinking Mr. Singer got the message he wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2017, Mr. Singer texted the father: \u201cD-Day is here,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cI need to know what you decided.\u201d\n\n\u201cRick, I thought I told you,\u201d the father says he told Mr. Singer over the phone. \u201cThis is not something we would do in our family.\u201d\n\nHe says Mr. Singer barked back: \u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d Mr. Singer fired him as a client on the spot, promising to never help his son with admissions. He even canceled academic tutors his company had arranged, the father says.\n\nHe worried Mr. Singer had enough clout to sabotage his son. \u201cI was scared out of my mind,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter his son was safely into college\u2014he was rejected by Georgetown but admitted elsewhere\u2014the father texted Mr. Singer. \u201cHow sad I was at the way you chose to conduct yourself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI assume that you have financial pressures\u2026what a terrible choice you made.\u201d\n\nHe wrote that his daughter \u201calways thought you were a bluff,\u201d and conceded, \u201cTurns out the kids are a lot smarter than I am.\u201d\n\nMr. Singer, he says, never responded.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com and Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "description": "Rick Singer played on parents\u2019 anxieties, suggesting their children were at a disadvantage getting into name-brand schools if they didn\u2019t have an angle or an inside track.", "authors": ["Jennifer Levitz", "Melissa Korn", "Jennifer.Levitz Wsj.Com", "Melissa.Korn Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104101/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
