According to various reports, the overall amount of funds raised through ICOs in 2017 ranges from a fiat equivalent of $4 bln to $5.6 bln. At the end of 2016, this figure stood at \u2018just\u2019 $225 mln.\n\nThat said, according to the same reports, less than a half of the total number of ICOs held in 2017 were actually successful, while 25 percent of the overall amount was raised by just 10 projects. Those statistics once again prove that potential investors need to be very careful when choosing a startup to invest in.\n\nIn this installment of our guide on ICOs, we will discuss 10 of the most successful ICO campaigns to date. However, as this guide is created for investors, not startups, we will focus on projects with the biggest Returns On Investment (ROI). To put it simply, ROI measures the amount of return on an investment relative to the cost of said investment.\n\nHere\u2019s a helpful formula:\n\nIf you want to check the current ROI ratio of any given project, all you need to is compare their token\u2019s price at the time of an ICO to its current value.\n\nThe ICO fiat price is usually calculated by dividing the amount of money in USD raised during the campaign by the number of tokens sold during it.\n\nYou can always look up a token\u2019s value on any exchange it is listed on (a simple Google search should point you in the right direction). Alternatively, you can use CoinMarketCap, which lists pretty much every token there currently is.\n\nIt is important to mention that there can\u2019t possibly be a definitive list of top 10 ICOs of all time, as a possible return on investments fully depends on the current value of a project\u2019s token. Naturally, there is quite a lot of movement on the all-time top performers list. Anyway, here\u2019s our list of best performing ICOs in terms of returns on investment as of the end of February 2018:\n\n1. NXT \u2014 1,265,555% ROI\n\nNXT is one of the oldest Blockchain-related projects out there. The official announcement was made on the BitcoinTalk forum on Sep. 28, 2013 by an anonymous developer, who claimed to be a veteran member of the forum using a new account to stay anonymous.\n\nIn this announcement, NXT was described as a descendant of Bitcoin, which was meant to improve some features of Bitcoin, resolve some of its issues, such as a bloated Blockchain, and switch to a proof-of-stake mining algorithm.\n\nThe crowdfunding campaign was held on the forum as well. By the end of it, the anonymous developer managed to amass around $16,800 worth of Bitcoin, distributing one bln tokens. So, the NXT token\u2019s value during its ICO was just $0.0000168. At the time of writing, the token was trading for $0.213, generating astronomical profits for its early investors and making it the most profitable ICO token ever at today\u2019s market valuations.\n\nToday, NXT is a fully-operational advanced Blockchain platform. It provides its users with a modular toolset, which enables them to build their own Blockchain-related applications. The platform also has its own asset exchange, a messaging system and a marketplace.\n\n2. IOTA \u2014 424,084% ROI\n\nThe name of the projects is a synecdoche based on the term IoT, or \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d The term is used to describe an envisioned future in which many different \u201cthings,\u201d such as appliances, cars, automatic service providers and so on communicate with each other. For example, a smart fridge capable of automatically re-ordering certain products and automatically paying for it. IOTA aims to provide a token for such transactions.\n\nMoreover, IOTA is the only major cryptocurrency which doesn\u2019t actually use a full Blockchain to perform transactions. Instead, it runs on a system called The Tangle. The system requires its users to verify a transaction at the exact same the as it is being conducted. This solves the scalability issue, which is one of the most pressing problems for a lot of cryptocurrency networks out there and allows for transactions without any fees.\n\nAll of this makes IOTA is an innovative, stand-out project. Moreover, it aims to provide service to an extremely new market, quite obviously looking ahead and planning for the future. So, it\u2019s easy to see why their ICO held at the end of 2015 was a success, with over $400,000 raised. All of one bln IOTA tokens were sold for less than $0.001. These days, it trades at around $1.8.\n\n3. Neo (Formerly Antshares) \u2014 378,453% ROI\n\nNeo is a project often referred to as \u201cChina\u2019s Ethereum.\u201d It also utilizes smart contract applications, but also adds decentralized commerce, digitized assets and identification into the mix.\n\nThe Chinese developers are creating a Blockchain that would represent legal proof-of-ownership and will be accepted by the broader society, not just the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAt the time of their ICO, there probably wasn\u2019t even a single investor out there doubting whether it\u2019ll be worth investing in Neo. The project was backed by such big names as Microsoft and Alibaba. Naturally, their ICO held in October 2015 was a big success, they sold 17.5 mln tokens raising $556,500. A year later, in September 2016, Neo had a second crowd sale during which they sold 22.5 mln tokens and raised over $4.5 mln dollars.\n\nThe original ICO price of the Neo token was $0.032. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was trading at $120.38. The token was at its all-time high on Jan. 31st, 2018, trading at $162.11.\n\n4. Ethereum \u2014 279,843% ROI\n\nEvery single person who is even remotely interested in cryptocurrencies has heard of Ethereum. It is a public, open-source distributed ledger platform, which enables its users to create and run decentralized applications (dapps) as well as implement and use smart contracts.\n\nThe platform\u2019s mastermind Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the most well-known person and sort of a poster-boy for the entire cryptocurrency community. Moreover, through their Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the platform works in cooperation with hundreds of major clients, including world\u2019s biggest corporations, towards the implementation of Blockchain technology and smart contracts into business worldwide.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ICO was held in the summer of 2014. Naturally, it was a great success \u2013 the team managed to raise $15.5 million, selling 50 mln tokens at the price of $0.311 per token. Today, Ethereum trades at $871.8. On Jan. 14th, 2018, Ethereum reached its all-time high of $1,377.72.\n\n5. Spectrecoin \u2014 149,806% ROI\n\nSpectrecoin is one of several cryptocurrency networks that prioritize privacy and anonymity above everything else. In order to achieve this, Spectrecoin combines a Blockchain with a tokenized ring signature scheme.\n\nIn cryptography, a ring signature is a type of digital signature which can be done by any member of a group of users that each have keys. It is impossible to trace which particular member of the group signed for a transaction. Moreover, any group of users can be used as such group without any additional setup.\n\nUnlike most other cryptocurrency networks, Spectrecoin utilizes the Tor network in order to increase the network-level privacy. All the nodes communicate with each other exclusively through Tor, meaning that Spectrecoin transactions go through a series of \u201cmiddlemen\u201d before reaching their destination, thus becoming untraceable. The network even offers a way to hide the fact that it uses Tor via a technology called OBFS4.\n\nThe team behind Spectrecoin (naturally, completely anonymous) held its ICO from Nov. 18th, 2016 to Jan. 6th, 2017. 19 mln tokens were sold and the team managed to raise $15,500. Each token was sold at just $0.001, while these days it trades at $1.22.\n\n6. Stratis \u2014 102,338% ROI\n\nStratis is a project that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of Blockchain applications for businesses worldwide. The project\u2019s main slogan is \u201cWe make Blockchain easy for you.\u201d Indeed, the startup created a platform that is fully compatible with .NET and C#. Having done that, they struck gold.\n\nFirst of all, their project appeals to basically every major enterprise out there that uses Microsoft products. Secondly, Microsoft themselves actually added Stratis\u2019 Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) to its Azure cloud service, which is aimed at businesses wishing to create in-house Blockchain solutions.\n\nWith such overwhelming support from Microsoft, Stratis\u2019 ICO was always going to be a success. The project managed to raise $610,000. The tokens were sold for $0.007, while their current value is $7.45. Stratis reached its all-time high of $21.21 on Jan. 8th, 2018.\n\n7. Ark \u2014 37,805% ROI\n\nArk is all about integration and collaboration. Their main goal is to create an entire ecosystem of linked Blockchains, essentially bringing them together into one massive \u201cspiderweb of use-cases.\u201d The project seeks to integrate other cryptocurrencies into its Blockchain.\n\nInterestingly enough, the project is collaborative and decentralized through and through: it has 17 core members hailing from 11 different countries.\n\nThe project held its ICO in November to December 2016, managing to raise almost $950,000. Its token\u2019s ICO price was just $0.01. Currently, it stands at $3.77. On Jan. 10th the token managed to reach $10.20, setting its all-time record.\n\n8. Lisk \u2014 26,367% ROI\n\nLisk is the world\u2019s first modular Blockchain-based platform. What this means is that it has a mainchain - a chain that currently hosts the LSK currency and will become a hub for all sidechains once the platform is fully live. Sidechains are very much like personal Blockchains, they can be easily built and tailored with Lisk\u2019s tools.\n\nThe platform will allow developers to build their own applications, house them on their own customized sidechains and even hold ICOs. Most importantly, Lisk\u2019s apps are the natural first-choice for most developers, as they are built using Javascript.\n\nThe project has many big-name players from Ethereum on board, so naturally, their ICO was an astounding success. Held in February and March of 2016, the crowdfunding campaign brought the List team $5.7 mln. The token was sold for $0.076, and it is now worth $20.24. Its all-time high was $38.8, set on Jan. 7th, 2018.\n\n9. DigixDAO \u2014 12,044% ROI\n\nOne of the main features of Ethereum is that it enables its users to create and run DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. It is a completely new way of structuring businesses, as there are no bosses or people in charge of the entire company. Instead, all the decisions are made via proposals and voting.\n\nDigixDAO was one of the first major DAOs to be created on the Ethereum platform. Interestingly enough, the project uses two tokens: DGD and DGX.\n\nDGD tokens were sold to the investors during the ICO. It is worth noting that when it comes to DAOs, token sales are held not just to attract funds. Purchased coins actually give the investors voting rights in proposals submitted to the DAO. This way, every token holder can take part in shaping the future of the organization.\n\nDigixDAO aims to create a new and stable cryptocurrency, backed by actual bars of gold. This is where the DGX tokens that represent one gram of gold come into play. The gold bars have all gone through a Proof of Asset protocol and their existence is proven on the Ethereum Blockchain. DGX tokens can actually be recanted into gold bars and redeemed by every token holder.\n\nThe participating custodian vault is located in Singapore and it is capable of safely storing up to 30 tons of gold. In the future, however, DigixDAO is hoping to open more vaults around the world.\n\nDigixDAO made history holding the very first Ethereum\u2019s on-chain crowdsale. In March 2016, the project managed to raise its target of $5.5 mln in just 12 hours. The DGD tokens were sold for $3.235, and their current value stands at $392.88. The token reached its all-time high of $409.6 on Feb. 3rd, 2018.\n\n10. QTUM \u2014 9225% ROI\n\nQTUM, which is actually pronounced \u201cquantum,\u201d is a project the bridges Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts with Bitcoin Core\u2019s stable Blockchain, all the while utilizing a proof-of-stake algorithm for verification. The main goal of the project is to increase the range of applications utilizing smart contracts, especially for business purposes.\n\nThus, QTUM benefits from the best of the new developments from both Bitcoin and Ethereum communities. Also, QTUM is aiming to introduce tools, templates and various other smart contracts options to make building and executing smart contracts for businesses easier and more secure.\n\nQTUM held its ICO in March 2017 and managed to raise $15.6 mln in 117 hours. The tokens were sold for $0.3, while their current value stands at $27.2. An all-time high of $103.45 was reached on Jan. 8th, 2018.\n\nSo far you\u2019ve already learned how to evaluate the legitimacy and possible returns of an ICO and had a look at some of the all-time greats.
