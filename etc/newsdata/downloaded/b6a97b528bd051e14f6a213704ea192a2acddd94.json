Oppenheim and his boss Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, at the time said NBC News' biggest star had been guilty of 'inappropriate sexual conduct.'\n\nHowever on Wednesday, it was revealed that Nevils has broken her silence to Pulitzer prize-winning investigative journalist Ronan Farrow for his new book, Catch and Kill \u2013 and accused Lauer of rape.\n\nVeteran NBC staffers had a heated call with the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim (pictured) on Thursday, DailyMail.com has learned. They grilled Oppenheim on the revelation Wednesday that Brooke Nevils claimed Lauer sexually assaulted her in Russia in 2014\n\nNevils accused Lauer of anally raping her in 2014 while they were working for NBC to cover the Sochi Winter Olympics. She reported the alleged incident in 2017 - leading to Lauer's firing. Oppenheim and his boss Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, at the time said Lauer had been guilty of 'inappropriate sexual conduct'. Lauer is pictured at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Nevils was working as a producer for his colleague Meredith Vieira\n\nOn Thursday morning, one veteran NBC correspondent asked Oppenheim directly if Nevils 'used the word assault when she reported it', according to a source with knowledge of the call.\n\nOppenheim dodged the question and responded that Nevils 'has her right privacy on that.'\n\nHis answer was met with mocking laughter from staffers and the correspondent shot back: 'I'm pretty sure she's waived that right. We deserve answers from you.'\n\nAmong those on the call or present at the meeting were veteran NBC figures including its justice correspondent, Pete Williams, and chief environmental affairs correspondent Anne Thompson. Williams denied to DailyMail.com that he had asked the question about assault.\n\nFarrow's book Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to protect Predators is scheduled for release on October 1\n\nOn Wednesday, Lauer strenuously denied the rape in a lengthy statement and called the alleged assault 'consensual'. Nevils responded that Lauer's statement was 'a case study in victim shaming'.\n\nThe book, released next week, details how Lauer's alleged sexual misconduct may have influenced NBC management's decision back in 2017 to kill Farrow's reporting on Harvey Weinstein's rampant sexual assaults.\n\nNevils told Farrow that when she got back to New York, she had more sexual encounters with Lauer and that she had told many of her colleagues at NBC about her interactions with him.\n\nFarrow says that sources 'close to Lauer' say she initiated those encounters.\n\n'What is not in dispute is that Nevils, like several of the women I'd spoken to, had further sexual encounters with the man she said assaulted her,' Farrow wrote.\n\n'This is what I blame myself most for. It was completely transactional. It was not a relationship,' she said.'\n\nNevils said she was 'terrified' about the control Lauer had over her career.\n\n'This was not a secret,' Farrow writes, citing her claim that 'like a million people knew'.\n\nBut Nevils says her allegations were dismissed by staff who said Lauer had done nothing 'criminal'.\n\nFarrow also claims that because Andy Lack (pictured with Lauer), NBC's Chairman, wrote in an email to staff that Lauer had been fired over an alleged incident which occurred at the Sochi Games, it narrowed down the list of possibilities as to who his alleged victim might be. She had been promised anonymity, she said, but everyone soon figured out that she was the person who had reported him\n\nIt was only when the #MeToo movement against Harvey Weinstein erupted that Nevils was sincerely asked by colleagues about Lauer, who had a reputation for infidelity and impropriety.\n\nIt was then she went to Meredith Vieira, who she had been working for at the time, and told her what had happened, she said.\n\nFarrow writes that Vieira told her to go to NBC HR with a lawyer and that she was 'distraught'.\n\n'Nevils's work life became torture. She was made to sit in the same meetings as everyone else, discussing the news, and in all of them colleagues loyal to Lauer cast doubt on the claims, and judgment on her,' Farrow wrote.\n\nFarrow also claims that because Lack, NBC's Chairman, wrote in an email to staff that Lauer had been fired over an alleged incident which occurred at the Sochi Games, it narrowed down the list of possibilities as to who his alleged victim might be.\n\nShe had been promised anonymity, she said, but everyone soon figured out that she was the person who had reported him.\n\nNevils said she then went on paid medical leave and eventually took a payout from NBC.\n\nShe still works for NBC, in its long-form production unit, Peacock Productions.\n\nFarrow says it was a seven-figure sum but that it came with a 'script' from executives who wanted her to paint the network glowingly.\n\n'The network proposed a script she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue other endeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive example of sexual harassment,' he wrote.\n\nFollowing Lauer's ouster, Lack released a statement to colleagues, where he wrote that the Today Show anchor's employment had been terminated following 'a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace'.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lauer strenuously denied the rape in a lengthy statement and called the alleged assault 'consensual'. Nevils responded that Lauer's statement was 'a case study in victim shaming'\n\nLauer released a three page, 1,400 word letter on Wednesday to defend himself\n\nCatch and Kill also contains more details of how Farrow was turned away by NBC - his then employer - when he started investigating Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe journalist's expose against the disgraced media mogul was published by The New Yorker and helped, alongside a first piece in The New York Times, to bring down Weinstein.\n\nFarrow says he first took the reporting to NBC but that it was vetoed by NBC President Noah Oppenheim.\n\nNBC has said in the past that Farrow's reporting did not meet its editorial standards because he did not have enough women willing to on record to say that Weinstein assaulted them.\n\nIn Catch and Kill, he claims Oppenheim asked him: 'Like, is this really worth it?' when he presented his findings on Weinstein.\n\nHe also alleges that Oppenheim suggested no one would 'know who Weinstein' was.\n\nIn Catch and Kill, Farrow says he was then instructed to cease work on the story by Richard Greenberg, the head of the NBC News investigative unit.\n\nFarrow says Greenberg told him it was an order that had come from Lack and Steve Burke, the CEO of NBCUniversal.\n\nDailyMail.com has also learned that Greenberg, is telling people at 30 Rock that Oppenheim and Lack will try to throw him under the bus for the 'bad actions' they have taken.\n\nSources at NBC told Variety they were yet to read the book, but they plan to defend the company against any of Farrow's criticisms.\n\nAn NBC spokesman told DailyMail.com on Wednesday morning: 'Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time.\n\n'That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint.\n\n'Our hearts break again for our colleague.'\n\nSavannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb on Wednesday said the new allegations against Lauer were 'disturbing'\n\nLauer has been a hermit for the last two years. He is shown above in a Tik Tok video posted online by his daughter this week\n\nIn the past, the network has refuted Farrow's claims that it killed the story, saying: 'The assertion that NBC News tried to kill the Weinstein story while Ronan Farrow was at NBC News, or even more ludicrously, after he left NBC News, is an outright lie.'\n\nAt least four other women came forward in the wake of Lauer's firing with their own allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nOne woman told the Washington Post that the anchor exposed himself in his office and asked her to touch him.\n\nA second said she had sex with Lauer in his office in the middle of the work day and a third claimed that he gave her a sex toy.\n\nFormer Today production assistant Addie Zinone alleged that she had a troubled, but consensual, relationship with Lauer in 2000.\n\nLauer refused to comment on any allegations of misconduct, claiming in April 2018 that he wanted to 'protect' his family from 'embarrassment'.\n\nHe and his wife Annette Roque separated in the wake of the allegations and finalized their divorce earlier this month.\n\nThe couple had been together for over 20 years and share three children - son Jack, 18, daughter Romy, 15, and son Thijs, 12.\n\nRoque issued a statement through her lawyer, John M. Teitler, on Wednesday evening which read: 'In response to your inquiry, our client has asked us to tell you that now that the parties are officially divorced, her priority and only concern is for their wonderful children. Our client will make no further statements.'\n\nIn the past, the network has refuted Farrow's claims that it killed the story, saying: 'The assertion that NBC News tried to kill the Weinstein story while Ronan Farrow was at NBC News, or even more ludicrously, after he left NBC News, is an outright lie.'\n\nLauer has hired a team of lawyers ahead of the October 15 release of 'Catch and Kill', Page Six reported, citing an informant who said the disgraced anchor and his team were given the opportunity to fact-check and comment on the book.\n\nPublishers at Little, Brown and Company declined to comment but said they are 'extremely proud of the important reporting in 'Catch and Kill', which has been meticulously fact-checked and vetted'.\n\nFarrow, son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the extensive cover-up of Weinstein's sexual misconduct on the leading edge of the #MeToo movement two years ago.\n\nThe book is marketed as 'the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth', detailing 'surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse.'\n\nIt has long been documented that Ronan Farrow took his reporting on Harvey Weinstein to NBC before he published it in The New Yorker and helped bring the disgraced movie mogul to justice.\n\nHe has also intimated in the past that NBC pressured him to drop the story and that it was protecting Weinstein, something the network has always denied.\n\nIn his new book, Farrow however claims that NBC was being blackmailed by American Media Inc., which owns The National Enquirer, and that Weinstein was behind it.\n\nAccording to sources cited by Farrow, Weinstein knew that he was closing in on him and he did not want his alleged misconduct to become public.\n\nHe and his wife Annette Roque (pictured together in 2013) separated in the wake of the allegations and finalized their divorce earlier this month. The couple had been together for over 20 years and share three children. Roque issued a statement through her lawyer,on Wednesday which read: 'In response to your inquiry, our client has asked us to tell you that now that the parties are officially divorced, her priority and only concern is for their wonderful children. Our client will make no further statements'\n\nIn one phone call to Andy Lack, Farrow reports that Weinstein told him: 'It was the '90s. You know? Did I go out with an assistant or two that I shouldn't have, did I sleep with one or two of them, sure. We all did that.'\n\nHe says Lack replied: 'Harvey, say no more. We'll look into it.'\n\nFarrow does not say who he got details of the phone calls from.\n\nNBC denied the claim that it squashed the story after receiving pressure from Weinstein and AMI.\n\n'NBC News was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter.\n\n'And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity,' a spokesman said.\n\nWeinstein's alleged attempts to silence Farrow's report are also described in the book.\n\nAccording to Farrow, he received an email from Clinton's publicist Nick Merrill who said his 'big story' was 'of concern for us'.\n\nWeinstein was a frequent Clinton donor and he had also supported other Democratic candidates.\n\nWhen the Weinstein scandal broke, Merrill denied that either he or anyone in Clinton's camp knew about it.\n\n'We were shocked when we learned what he'd done. It's despicable behavior, and the women that have come forward have shown enormous courage. As to claims about a warning, that's something staff wouldn't forget,' he said.\n\nHe has not responded to the more recent allegations.\n\nFarrow also describes how Weinstein called his father, Woody Allen, for help to silence him. Farrow reports that his father told Weinstein: 'Jeez, I'm so sorry. Good luck.'\n\nWood-vey: Days before the expose dropped, Weinstein even called Farrow's estranged father Woody Allen (above in 2008), who said: 'Jeez, I'm so sorry. Good luck'\n\nFarrow and his father are estranged due to his sister Dylan's claim that he molested her when she was a child.\n\nWeinstein's former attorney also said in a letter that Farrow was motivated to investigate the story because he wanted to exact revenge on behalf of his sister.\n\n'Mr. Farrow is entitled to his private anger,' Charles Harder, one of Epstein's old attorneys, wrote.\n\nHe also mentioned Mia's brother who was once sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing two boys and said Farrow had done nothing to publicly denounce him.\n\n'We have yet to find any evidence that Ronan Farrow has publicly denounced his uncle, and he might have publicly supported him.'\n\nFarrow recalls going to Lauer's office in December 2016 to ask for career advice from the 'biggest star in morning TV' as he was at the time.\n\n'I was struggling to find a niche,' Farrow wrote.\n\nHe said Lauer asked him where he saw himself in a few years and he said he wanted to be an anchor.\n\n'You're searching for something. Maybe you'll find it.\n\n'But you're going to have to figure out yourself what you really care about,' Farrow claims Lauer told him.\n\nAfter he broke his story on Weinstein in The New Yorker, Lauer texted him to say congratulations.\n\n'Ronan, it's Matt Lauer. Let me be the 567th person to say congratulations on an amazing piece!'\n\nAt a gala in April 2017, Farrow claims he congratulated Megyn on her show and apologized for calling one of her tweets racist.\n\nHe said a 'tendon stood out in her neck' as she replied: 'I made a lot of mistakes when I was at your point in my career, too.\n\n'You're kind of a rookie reporter.'\n\nFarrow's story was still months away from being reported. Kelly had just moved to NBC from Fox.\n\nShe went on to congratulate his reporting and commend it on her show, in addition to calling for an independent investigation into why it never ran on NBC.\n\nWeinstein's alleged attempts to silence Farrow's report are also described in the book. According to Farrow, he received an email from Clinton's publicist Nick Merrill who said his 'big story' was 'of concern for us'\n\nFarrow describes in his book how he was followed by spies and had to 'run' away from them in the street at times because of how close he was getting to publishing allegations against Weinstein.\n\nHe was previously reported that the movie mogul hired ex-Mossad agents to follow him and 'hack his phone'.\n\nIn his interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday, Farrow said it 'upended' his life and forced him to move.\n\n'I had to literally go on the run from people hired to stake me out.\n\n'Obviously getting chased around by hired spies is not a normal experience. It's surreal. It's stressful.'\n\nHe said his mother, Mia Farrow, became scared for him.\n\n'She was very scared for me as I was on the run from these spies, and I was trying to tell her as little as possible because none of us wants our mom freaking out,' he said.\n\nFarrow also paid tribute to his partner, Jon Lovett.\n\n'He didn't break up with me when I was an insane ball of stress and everything in my life was falling apart and I was needy and demanding all the time,' he said.\n\nWhen his contract ended with NBC, Farrow said Lovett - a former Obama speech writer - joked: 'I'll take care of you, baby. I'll keep you in finery and smoothies.'\n\nA separate NBC source told DailyMail.com: 'It was not heated, it was calm and orderly, and Noah very calmly and capably took every question that came his way. There were many pointed and tough questions.\n\n'At the top of the meeting, Oppenheim said: 'I am sure you guys and folks on your teams have questions, you will have questions in the days ahead, and I want to literally beg you to please ask them. Please tell the folks you work with to ask them. Whether it's this morning or by reaching out to me by phone or email, anytime day or night there is not a question that I'm afraid to answer. I only ask to opportunity to do so.'\n\n'When asked about how Nevils described what happened to her when she first brought her complaint to NBC, Oppenheim responded: ''I appreciate that question. Our first obligation when someone brings forward a complaint is to protect that person's confidentiality. All of our communication to you guys and externally, frankly to anyone, the words were carefully chosen to characterize it exactly the same way that her attorney was characterizing it. That confidentially is not something that I am ever going to breach, not only for her sake. The whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however she chooses to and she is doing so now, I think that is appropriate.'''", "description": "Veteran NBC staffers had a heated call with the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim on Thursday morning, DailyMail.com has learned.", "authors": ["Louise Boyle For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/19553470-0-image-a-29_1570731927692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
