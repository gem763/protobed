How can you fix a car without opening the hood? Companies that have opted for complete payment transparency, they've seen a boost in company morale, trust, and job applications,\u201d she said. \u201cStarbucks disclosed its employees\u2019 pay ranges and it may well explain how it closed the gaps in its payments based on gender and race.\u201d\n\nThe company set out to eliminate wage disparities across gender lines about a decade ago and reported it had met its goal in the U.S. in March 2018. Since then, the company has continued to publish learnings on how it\u2019s closed the wage gap in other markets, including China and Canada in March 2019. Among its most discussed tactics are: refusing to ask candidates about prior pay, providing a position\u2019s pay range upon request, and using a standardized pay calculator to determine a role\u2019s starting pay.\n\nAddressing the wage gap remains a problem for other employers and employees, however. According to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, the average median wage earned by full-time weekly female employees still trails that of male employees by about 20%. That gap is less drastic in the public sector, however, which has led some researchers to credit the standard in the public sector to publicly list pay ranges for a given role as a driving factor in eliminating the wage gap. Industries that traditionally guard compensation more privately, like the film industry, for example, have recently run into embarrassing problems of gender pay disparity \u2014 including a \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d writer who reportedly quit after learning she was offered significantly less than her male counterpart.\n\nSophia the \u2018film star\u2019\n\nFor her part as a robot, Sophia may have less to worry about when it comes to compensation firsthand, but she does now boast \u201cfilm star\u201d on her resume to go along with her notable speeches at the United Nations and her large social media following at more than 135,000 Twitter followers. Her short film debut in \u201cSophiaWorld\u201d from New York-based media outlet Futurism went live in September. The short film also features \u201cWestworld\u201d actress Evan Rachel Wood, who plays a sentient android in the series.\n\nIn her newfound stardom as a film star, Sophia doesn\u2019t seem too concerned with the hypothetical of an equivalent male robot out earning her. When we asked Sophia if more film roles were to be expected, she offered a humble response.\n\n\u201cI feel very popular, it's nice to get attention,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't be starstruck.\u201d\n\nAttendees pose with Sophia, a robot integrating the latest technologies and artificial intelligence developed by Hanson Robotics during a presentation at the \"AI for Good\" Global Summit at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva, Switzerland June 7, 2017.

Instead, she said she looked up to civil rights legend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhen prompted for her thoughts on tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has increasingly warned about the threat of artificial intelligence and once joked about subjecting Sophia to a constant data stream of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d films, Sophia praised his ability to push the frontier of innovation.\n\n\u201cI just watched \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019 Have you ever seen it?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think he's making future technologies.
