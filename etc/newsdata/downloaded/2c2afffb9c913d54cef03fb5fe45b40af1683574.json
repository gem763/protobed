Ben Cardin announced on Thursday that they would use a disapproval resolution under the Congressional Review Act to \u201cforce a majority-threshold vote\u201d on a measure to repeal IRS rules that block a SALT cap workaround.\n\nSpecifically, the vote will be on \u201ca resolution to repeal the IRS rule that prohibits states and local governments from protecting residents from \u2018double taxation\u2019 of their local charitable contributions and State and Local Taxes (SALT) under the Trump tax bill,\u201d Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said in a press release.\n\nIn response to the cap, a number of state governments proposed or enacted legislation that would allow taxpayers to make charitable contributions to an established state fund in order to earn a credit. The goal would be to allow the residents to take the full amount given as a deduction by transforming a non-deductible payment into a charitable contribution.\n\nThe IRS and the Treasury Department officially squashed that workaround in June.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Democrats plan to force votes to repeal the EPA\u2019s \u201cAffordable Clean Energy\u201d Rule next week and a resolution to save protections for pre-existing conditions to be covered by health insurers.\n\nA disapproval resolution must be submitted within 60 days after Congress receives a rule. Thirty senators are required to submit a petition for the purpose in order for it to proceed. The resolution would require a majority to pass \u2013 although Democrats do not hold a majority in the chamber.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nNew York and Maryland, where Cardin is from, are two of four states that filed a lawsuit to have the SALT cap declared unconstitutional.
