Twelve years ago, finding halal or even vegetarian marshmallows was tricky, making even simple recipes like this feel like quite a challenge. But now alternative ingredients are much more widely available, and I can find halal and veggie marshmallows in most big brand supermarkets. This apple rocky road has all the loveliness of a rocky road, but with a difference. Squidgy marshmallow, sweet white chocolate, tart dried apples and fruity sultanas. A little bit goes a long way. But a little bit is better than none at all.\" - Nadiya Hussain\n\nApple Rocky Road\n\nBy Nadiya Hussain\n\nIngredients\n\n200g white chocolate (or chocolate chips)\n\n2 tbsp golden syrup\n\n130g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing\n\nA pinch of salt\n\n\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon\n\n200g cinnamon biscuits (or digestives)\n\n100g white mini marshmallows (if you can only find big marshmallows, use scissors to chop them into small pieces)\n\n100g dried apples, chopped into small pieces\n\n50g raisins\n\n1 tbsp icing sugar, for dusting\n\nPreparation\n\nLightly grease the inside of a 23cm square baking tin. You can be very light-handed. This is just to keep the paper in place. Then line the base and sides of the tin.\n\nPut about 2.5cm of water into a medium saucepan. Find a heatproof bowl that will fit the top of the pan snugly. Make sure the base of the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water, because this can scald the chocolate.\n\nPut the pan on the stove and turn it up to a high heat. As soon as the water is boiling, turn it down low.\n\nChop the chocolate, or alternatively use chocolate chips. Put the chocolate into the bowl with the golden syrup and butter.\n\nStir occasionally, making sure to agitate the chocolate, as this will encourage the mixture to come together.\n\nAs soon as the mixture is smooth and liquid and runny, take off the heat and allow to cool for about 10 minutes. If it\u2019s too hot when the marshmallows are added, there will be a sticky mess.\n\nAdd the salt and cinnamon and mix through.\n\nCrush the biscuits very roughly, by putting them into a freezer bag and crushing them here and there with a rolling pin. Empty the contents of the bag into the chocolate mix. Give it a stir.\n\nNow add the marshmallows, apples and raisins and stir, making sure everything is well coated.\n\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, then, using the back of a spoon, really go to work to flatten it and press it into the corners.\n\nPut the tin into the fridge for at least 1 hour, or until it has set.\n\nTake out of the tin and unwrap. Dust with the icing sugar and slice into 18 bars, or choose your own size according to your sweet tooth.\n\nYield: Makes 18 bars\n\n(Credit: Hungry Gap Productions Ltd.)\n\nThis recipe originally appeared on Nadiya's Family Favourites - Series 1.
