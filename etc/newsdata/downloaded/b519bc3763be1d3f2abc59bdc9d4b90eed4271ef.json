REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File Photo\n\nThe U.S. air accident investigator unveiled on Thursday several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the wake of fatal crashes of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX that killed 346 people in total and led to the plane\u2019s grounding.\n\nBoeing has said the feeding of erroneous Angle of Attack (AOA) data to a system called MCAS that pushed the planes lower was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to the crashes.\n\n\u201cWe want FAA to ensure that Boeing takes a close look at all these different failure conditions that can activate MCAS and ensure that they have evaluated the pilots\u2019 response to that,\u201d Dana Schulze, director of the NTSB Office of Aviation Safety, told reporters at a briefing. NTSB wants that assessment completed before the plane\u2019s grounding is lifted.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX simulator tests with test pilots \u201cdid not look at all potential flight deck alerts and indications that pilots might face when this specific failure condition occurred in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines,\u201d Schulze said, adding Boeing did not evaluate the \u201cactual scenario\u201d in the two fatal crashes in the simulator.\n\nThe NTSB said the FAA should address assumptions Boeing and other manufacturers make in designing software systems to address emergencies and whether the systems should be revised to account for varying pilot reactions to cockpit alarms and alerts.\n\nThe safety board also said the FAA should develop \u201crobust tools and methods\u201d to validate assumptions about pilot response \u201cto safety-significant failure conditions as part of the design certification process.\u201d\n\nBoeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both AOA sensors, and added additional safeguards.\n\nFAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell said on Wednesday at a congressional hearing that if the AOA sensors differ by 5.5 degrees or more then MCAS cannot operate. If MCAS does operate it can only operate once unless the problem had been \u201ccompletely resolved,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Elwell said.\n\nThe NTSB said it was not analyzing the pilot actions in the two fatal crashes and said the recommendations were not a reflection on the pilots in those crashes but rather in response to assumptions in the U.S. certification process.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement it \u201cwill carefully review these and all other recommendations as we continue our review of the proposed changes to the Boeing 737 MAX.\u201d\n\nBoeing said in a statement it is \u201ccommitted to working with the FAA in reviewing the NTSB recommendations.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX safety system assessments assumed \u201cimmediate and appropriate pilot corrective actions in response to uncommanded flight control inputs, from systems such as MCAS,\u201d the NTSB said, and should take into account how other possible flight deck alerts and other factors could impact pilots\u2019 decision making and makes changes as warranted.\n\n\u201cWe want them to step up how they certify these airplanes with regard to human interface,\u201d said Schulze. \u201cMachines are deterministic. They are going to fail the same way if the same conditions are present. Humans are not that way. We are just asking the FAA to ... consider that factor more scientifically in how they certify airplanes.\u201d\n\nThe NTSB wants the FAA to require the same assessment for all other airplane manufacturers and thinks other international regulators that certify airplanes should consider making the same changes.\n\nIt is not clear when Boeing will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service, but the company has said it hopes to resume flights early in the fourth quarter. The FAA said last week it will need a month after the test flight is completed before it could allow flights to resume.\n\nElwell said the FAA has not decided on what training changes it will require.", "description": "Boeing Co should take a harder look at pilot response to cockpit emergencies in its 737 MAX safety assessment and potentially make changes to flight deck alerts, pilot procedures and training, the National Transportation Safety Board said.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434163833&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P18F", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
