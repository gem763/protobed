As a result, readers should always check whether Hollysys Automation Technologies has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Hollysys Automation Technologies\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Hollysys Automation Technologies has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 10% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 11% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNasdaqGS:HOLI Historical Dividend Yield, October 16th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Hollysys Automation Technologies's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past three years, Hollysys Automation Technologies has increased its dividend at approximately 1.6% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nShould investors buy Hollysys Automation Technologies for the upcoming dividend? Hollysys Automation Technologies has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past three years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. There's a lot to like about Hollysys Automation Technologies, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It looks like Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.
