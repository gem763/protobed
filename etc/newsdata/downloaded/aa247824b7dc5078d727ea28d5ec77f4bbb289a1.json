In comments to reporters, he said homeless people in California are living in the \u201cbest entrances to buildings . . . where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige.\u201d (Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump maligned the problem of homelessness in California as he arrived in the nation\u2019s most populous state Tuesday, arguing that people living on the streets here have ruined the \u201cprestige\u201d of two of the state\u2019s most populous cities and suggesting the possibility of federal action.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Silicon Valley, where he hosted a campaign fundraiser to kick off a two-day visit to California.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s direction, the administration has quietly been eyeing sweeping unilateral action on homelessness, with top government officials from multiple agencies touring California this month to formulate a strategy. Housing Secretary Ben Carson was also visiting San Francisco on Tuesday, and had plans to discuss the issue.\n\nIt is unclear what legal authority the federal government has to clear the streets and how that might be accomplished, however.\n\nCalifornia is controlled by Democrats and has become a bastion of resistance to Trump\u2019s presidency. As he arrived here, Trump claimed that he had personally heard complaints from tenants in the state, some of them foreigners. He expressed sympathy for real estate investors here and other Californians whose property values or quality of life are threatened.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, they came from other countries and they moved to Los Angeles or they moved to San Francisco because of the prestige of the city, and all of a sudden they have tents,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building. And they want to leave.\u201d\n\nIn the two largest cities in California, Trump said, people are living on the \u201cbest highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings . . . where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be doing something about it.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have considered razing existing tent camps for the homeless, creating new temporary facilities and refurbishing existing government facilities, according to two senior government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTrump claimed in his comments to reporters Tuesday that police officers here are \u201cgetting sick\u201d from dealing with homeless people. \u201cThey\u2019re actually sick,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to the hospital. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Associated Press reported that a Los Angeles police detective in a division that polices downtown Los Angeles was diagnosed with typhoid fever. Several others in the same station showed symptoms, the AP reported.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s remarks are abhorrent. He\u2019s apparently more concerned with the doorways and streets than with the people who are homeless and sleeping on them,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nThe administration appears to be focused on Los Angeles\u2019s \u201cskid row,\u201d a homeless encampment where officials from multiple agencies toured last week. Government officials also toured an abandoned Federal Aviation Administration facility in nearby Hawthorne as a potential place to relocate the thousands of homeless people in the area.\n\nTrump has characterized the homeless problem in California and other places as a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d saying this July: \u201cWe may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d He more recently directed aides to figure out \u201chow the hell we can get these people off the streets,\u201d one senior administration official said. Fox News has aired at least 18 segments on California homelessness in 2019, according to a review of Fox closed-captioning transcripts.\n\nPlanning has involved officials from the White House, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Justice Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services, among other agencies.\n\nTrump made his remarks about homelessness as he began a two-day fundraising swing across California that is expected to raise approximately $15 million for Trump Victory, a joint effort for the president\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nTrump addressed a luncheon at a private home in Portola Valley, which is in the Silicon Valley area, that was expected to net $3 million. Later Tuesday, Trump is scheduled to fly to Southern California, where he will hold a dinner at the Beverly Hills home of real estate developer Geoff Palmer that is expected to raise $5 million.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump will hold a fundraising breakfast in Los Angeles that is expected to raise $3 million and a luncheon in San Diego that should net $4 million, according to a Republican official familiar with the plans.\n\nStein reported from Washington.", "description": "Under Trump\u2019s direction, the administration has quietly been eyeing sweeping unilateral action on homelessness, with top government officials from multiple agencies touring California this month to formulate a strategy.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UE2a2RIz272hPfupEKMdhRcS1lk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRBDCPGZPEI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
