The global shipping industry currently consumes about 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of HSFO.\n\nThe trade sources declined to be identified as they are unauthorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe new IMO regulations will affect fuel supplies to more than 50,000 merchant ships globally.\n\n\u201cWe expect roughly 2,400 scrubbers will cover 600,000 barrels per day (16-17% of demand) for January, 2020,\u201d S&P Global Platts said in a statement on Monday during an industry conference in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThat increases to over 3,500 by end 2020 with more upside potential,\u201d according to S&P Global Platts.\n\nShip classification society DNV-GL forecasts the number of ships with installed scrubbers is expected to rise steadily to about 3,800 by 2023.\n\nThe DNV-GL data also shows bulk carriers would form the majority of ships with scrubbers.", "description": "Asia's spot premium for 380-centistoke (cst) high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) is expected to ease gradually from its recent record highs as shippers adopt cleaner marine fuels next year to meet new, tougher rules on emissions from ships.", "authors": ["Koustav Samanta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
