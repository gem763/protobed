In doing do, she has been drawn into sharp conflict with the company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe question went first to Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cAs usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem,\u201d he replied, before laying out why he disagreed with her plan to break up the titans of the tech industry \u2013 Facebook, Google, Amazon \u2013 and regulate them more heavily.\n\nThe candidates then grappled with the issue for the first time in a meaningful way during a presidential debate. From breaking up the the largest companies, to data privacy legislation, political fundraising in Silicon Valley and whether Donald Trump should be banned from Twitter, the discussion illustrated a deepening disenchantment with big tech \u2013 and why Zuckerberg fears a Warren presidency would \u201csuck for us\u201d.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re begging for regulation\u2019\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments, made to employees, were not meant to be made public. But their leak this month triggered a very public showdown between the fast-rising frontrunner for the Democratic nomination and one of the most powerful executives in the world \u2013 a fascinating subplot of the 2020 primary.\n\n\u201cIt is the one thing that the CEOs of these companies absolutely hate,\u201d said Sarah Miller, deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based thinktank that advocates against monopolies.\n\nThey\u2019re begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it Sarah Miller\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it and they know that it will likely inhibit their competitors who won\u2019t have the same resources. But, more than anything, they do not want to be broken up.\u201d\n\nWarren wants to regulate tech platforms as utilities, targeting companies that earn $25bn or more in global annual revenue. She would appoint regulators to unwind \u201cillegal and anticompetitive tech mergers\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies,\u201d she said, announcing her policy, \u201chave too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\u201d\n\nAccording to audio recordings leaked to the Verge, Zuckerberg called Warren\u2019s plan an \u201cexistential\u201d threat.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019,\u201d Warren tweeted in reply, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe war of words escalated after Facebook\u2019s decision to allow Trump\u2019s re-election campaign run a $1m ad campaign containing lies about Joe Biden. Warren responded by placing her own ad on Facebook.\n\nIt started with Warren announcing \u201cBreaking News\u201d, before declaring that Zuckerberg and Facebook were supporting Trump\u2019s re-election. Warren then says, \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018How could this possibly be true?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe point Warren was making is that by allowing her ad, Facebook was showing itself to be a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine\u201d.\n\nSince the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Zuckerberg has worked to smooth relationships with politicians in DC. But Warren seems in no mood to play nice. The two sparred again after Zuckerberg defended Facebook in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,\u201d Zuckerberg said, speaking in the ornate Gaston Hall, where presidents and foreign dignitaries have delivered major addresses. \u201cOr we can decide the cost is simply too great. I\u2019m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s response was withering: \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election.\u201d\n\n\u2018Mark\u2019s power is un-American\u2019\n\nWarren has taken the most aggressive posture toward big tech, part of a call for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d to the American economy. After she introduced her proposal in March, her campaign put up a billboard near a busy transit station station in San Francisco that said in capital letters: \u201cBreak up big tech\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University.

Last week, the organization he co-chairs, the Economic Security Project, announced the creation of a $10m \u201canti-monopoly fund\u201d.\n\nWriting in the New York Times in May, Hughes said Zuckerberg\u2019s influence had far exceeded \u201canyone else in the private sector or government\u201d and said Facebook\u2019s concentration of wealth, power and influence \u2013 2.7bn people use it or its other platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, each month\u2013 posed a threat to democracy itself.\n\n\u201cMark\u2019s power is unprecedented and un-American,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cIt is time to break up Facebook.\u201d\n\nNick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook\u2019s vice-president for global affairs and communications, responded in the New York Times later that month: \u201cFacebook shouldn\u2019t be broken up \u2013 but it does need to be held to account. Anyone worried about the challenges we face in an online world should look at getting the rules of the internet right, not dismantling successful American companies.\u201d\n\nThe drive to break up Facebook has plenty of critics who agree the company has too much power but do not believe such action would address many of the major concerns with the platform, including how to strengthen user privacy protections, improve election security and stop propaganda intended to incite violence and extremism.\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year, shortly after Warren unveiled her plan, Zuckerberg called for \u201cupdating the rules of the internet\u201d and outlined four areas where he said new regulation was needed: \u201cHarmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.\u201d\n\nWe need to say to Facebook, 'We\u2019re going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&T or the electric company' Dipayan Ghosh\n\nDipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, has argued breakup is not the only way to thwart Facebook\u2019s capacity for \u201ccapitalistic overreaches\u201d and \u201ceconomic exploitation\u201d. He favors a \u201cnovel, stringent\u201d set of \u201cpro-competition policies\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to say to Facebook, \u2018We\u2019re going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&T or the electric company,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cWe are going to make sure you can\u2019t make any mergers or acquisitions, we\u2019re going to tax you heavily, we are going to develop stringent privacy regulations that you\u2019re going to need to follow.\u201d\n\nThere are those who argue Facebook should not be singled out by a president, as the former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said during the Democratic debate. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee and another presidential contender, advocated for bolstering regulatory agencies to promote competition.\n\nThe debate underscored a broad consensus: that tech companies wield far too much power and influence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that virtually all of these candidates are saying that there are a handful of tech companies that have too much power,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \u201cIf you turn the clock back even just three years, the idea that that discussion would have happened would seem pretty far-fetched.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dinners with lots of people\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has faced a reckoning in Washington since 2016. But the events of the past few weeks have sharpened the divide and pulled Zuckerberg far more publicly and personally into the political maelstrom.\n\nHe is expected to testify on Capitol Hill this week, for the first time since he faced a public grilling in April 2018 over the company\u2019s handling of user information, whether it should be more heavily regulated, alleged censorship of conservative content and the extent of Russian meddling. In the 18 months since, Democrats and Republicans have only grown more frustrated, setting the stage for another contentious hearing.\n\nMeeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning \u2026 I suggest you do! Mark Zuckerberg\n\nRepublicans have long alleged that Facebook silences conservative personalities and websites, charges the company denies. According to Politico, Zuckerberg has hosted conservative lawmakers, commentators and journalists, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the radio host Hugh Hewitt, at his California home over the past several months.\n\nZuckerberg appeared to confirm the report in a Facebook post, writing that he had \u201cdinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time.\n\n\u201cMeeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t tried it, I suggest you do!\u201d\n\nRegardless of who wins the White House in 2020, Facebook\u2019s political and legal woes show no sign of relenting.\n\n'Meltdown': Donald Trump and the impeachment week from hell Read more\n\nThe audio of Zuckerberg leaked just weeks after state attorneys general from both parties opened an antitrust investigation.\n\nThis summer, Facebook agreed to pay a $5bn fine as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The new settlement order requires Facebook to improve the way it handles its users\u2019 personal information and to designate an employee tasked with coordinating those efforts.\n\nJust last week, the Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a prominent critic of big tech, introduced a bill that would strengthen privacy protections and threaten to jail Silicon Valley executives who knowingly lie to the FTC.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg won\u2019t take Americans\u2019 privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. \u201cA slap on the wrist from the FTC won\u2019t do the job, so under my bill he\u2019d face jail time for lying to the government.\u201d", "description": "The presidential hopeful and Mark Zuckerberg are facing off over big tech and its influence over our lives", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3918dda7b1a2c3a3a05c9cb1e2fbdb3f58757ccd/127_0_4673_2804/master/4673.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e02fa25fc7a2026446247f879e85831", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
