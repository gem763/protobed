And continue to do so as long as men do. Shocker.\n\nWe have grown so used to wrinkly old men being found fabulously attractive by young women on screen that we even have a term for it: the Woody Allen syndrome. Yet Mirren, who literally pants for her key ally, Grigory Potemkin, on screen, is very unusual \u2013 I can\u2019t think of any other female septuagenarians showing flesh on screen (unless they are playing a corpse).\n\nThat Mirren is a generation older than the 50-year-old Jason Clarke, who plays Potemkin, is one thing, but the fact that she genuinely seems to be wanting \u2013 nay craving \u2013 post-menopausal sex is the real surprise.\n\nIt is unprecedented and has drawn comparisons from some reviewers with other TV hits that subvert sexual power play \u2013 the lesbian love triangle in The Favourite, for instance, or Gentleman Jack.\n\nThe power shift of Catherine the Great comes because she was a monarch. There still aren\u2019t quite as many of those who are women as there are men, but maybe, as the stories we see on screen become more diverse, we will see many more brilliant older women playing romantic roles against younger men. Then we can call it the Helen Mirren syndrome.", "description": "In her portrayal of the much younger Catherine the Great, the actor is reminding us that many women continue to enjoy sex as long as men do, writes Jane Martinson", "authors": ["Jane Martinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b8cc726ff63282f74c954db5601b27c515bf29/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bf3c03b227c14fb509328252bf6dc21f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
