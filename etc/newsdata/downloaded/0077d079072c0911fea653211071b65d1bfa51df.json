Ilhan Omar defends her controversial World Trade Center remarks: '9/11 was an attack on all Americans'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Ilhan Omar responded to criticism from a 9/11 victim\u2019s son, who, during a memorial reading of victims\u2019 names at Ground Zero last week, called out the freshman congresswoman for past remarks she made about the terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201c9/11 was an attack on all Americans,\u201d said Omar, D-Minn., on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cIt was an attack on all of us, and I certainly could not understand the weight of the pain that the families of the victims of 9/11 must feel, but I think it\u2019s important for us to make sure that we are not forgetting the aftermath of 9/11,\u201d she added.\n\nRep.

She said the organization \u201cwas founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly could not understand the weight of the pain that the victims of the families of 9/11 must feel,\u201d @IlhanMN says, but we should also remember that many Americans had \u201ctheir civil rights stripped from them\u201d in the wake of the attacks. pic.twitter.com/m6LbX3i2DG \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 15, 2019\n\nThe New York Post lambasted her \u201csome people did something\u201d phrasing, and President Trump tweeted a video of Omar\u2019s remarks spliced together with footage of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n\u201cOn that day 19 Islamic terrorists, members of al-Qaida, killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage,\u201d Haros said during his speech. \u201cIs that clear?\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was attacked. Your relatives and friends were attacked. Our constitutional freedoms were attacked, and our nation\u2019s founding on Judeo-Christian principles was attacked. That\u2019s what some people did. Got that now?\u201d\n\nNicholas Haros, who lost his mother, Frances, in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, wears a shirt critical of Rep.

The group includes Omar and Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.\n\n\u201cWe are here today, congresswoman, to tell you and the squad just who did what to whom,\u201d he said. \u201cShow respect in honoring them, please.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by CBS\u2019s Margaret Brennan if she has struggled \u201cto be less of an activist and try to be a legislator,\u201d Omar said she didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cSome people would say, \u2018Ilhan, you should speak a certain way. Ilhan, you should do something a certain way,\u2019 and I believe that\u2019s contradictory to the purpose of my existence in this space,\u201d she responded. \u201cMy constituents sent me to make sure that I was bringing in a conversation that others weren\u2019t having, that I was speaking for people who have felt voiceless for a long time.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt's really important for us to recognize that it's a new Congress. It's a diverse Congress, and we're not only diverse in our race or ethnicity or religion, but we are also diverse in our perspective, in our pain and our struggles, and in the hopes and dreams that we have, and the kind of America that we want to shape for all of us.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Rep.
