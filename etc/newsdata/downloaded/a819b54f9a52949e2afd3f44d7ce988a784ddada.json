Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday urged President Trump to endorse House-passed gun measures and pledged to join him for a \u201chistoric signing ceremony at the Rose Garden\u201d if the legislation is passed.\n\nThe Democratic leaders said in a joint statement that they spoke with Trump by phone Sunday morning at their request, 200 days after the House passed H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. The two measures, which would expand federal background checks for gun purchases and transfers, represent the first major firearm restrictions to advance in a generation. Trump has threatened to veto both measures.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 push for action comes amid public outrage over mass shootings across the country, including rampages last month in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso that left 31 people dead.\n\n\u201cThis morning, we made it clear to the president that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done, as dangerous loopholes will still exist and people who shouldn\u2019t have guns will still have access,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said in their statement.\n\n\u201cWe know that to save as many lives as possible, the Senate must pass this bill and the President must sign it,\u201d they added. \u201cWe even promised the President that if he endorses this legislation and gets Senator McConnell to act on what the House has passed, we would both join him for a historic signing ceremony at the Rose Garden.\u201d\n\nThe call was made shortly after 11 a.m., when Trump was at his golf course in Northern Virginia, and lasted 11 minutes, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the conversation. The Rose Garden idea mentioned in the statement was Schumer\u2019s, said the aide, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the call.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said that Sunday morning\u2019s phone conversation was \u201ccordial\u201d and that it centered on Pelosi and Schumer\u2019s interest in action on H.R. 8, the expanded background checks bill passed by the House.\n\nTrump, Deere said, \u201cmade no commitments\u201d on the measure \u201cbut instead indicated his interest in working to find a bipartisan legislative solution on appropriate responses to the issue of mass gun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president reiterated his commitment for his administration to continue work on these issues,\u201d Deere said in a statement.\n\nAccording to an official familiar with the negotiations, who was not authorized to speak publicly, Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he was having a \u201cbig meeting\u201d Monday on the issue and would be doing something \u201cthis week.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d hours earlier, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said \u201cthere are a number of pieces of legislation the president is considering\u201d on guns, although she did not offer any specifics.\n\nIn February, Trump issued a veto threat for both measures. H.R. 8, he argued, would \u201cimpose burdensome requirements on certain firearm transactions\u201d and was \u201cincompatible with the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an individual right to keep arms.\u201d H.R. 1112, he said, would allow the government to \u201crestrict firearms purchases through bureaucratic delay.\u201d That measure would extend the window for completing a background check to 10 business days.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has repeatedly said he would bring legislation to the floor only if it has the president\u2019s endorsement.\n\nIn an exchange with reporters at the Capitol last week, McConnell accused Schumer of a \u201cstunt\u201d after the Democrat called on the Senate to take up the gun bill, which McConnell noted \u201cthe president already said he is going to veto.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy members know the very simple fact that to make a law you have to have a presidential signature. . . . And so, we do, in fact, await word from the White House about what the president is willing to sign,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nPolls show an overwhelming majority of the public supports tightening gun laws. A Quinnipiac University survey released late last month showed that 93 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers, 82 percent support requiring a license to purchase a gun, and 80 percent support \u201cred flag\u201d laws allowing guns to be taken away from people deemed to be a threat to themselves or others.\n\nTrump has gone back and forth on the issue. Immediately after the El Paso and Dayton shootings, the president said \u201cthere is great appetite\u201d for tightening background checks. But weeks later, he appeared to back away from his potential support for such legislation, shifting the focus from background checks to mental health in his public remarks on the matter.\n\nIn their statement, Pelosi and Schumer touted the House-passed gun measures as \u201cbipartisan, commonsense legislation to expand background checks, which is supported by more than 90 percent of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet, for 200 days, Senator McConnell has refused to give these bipartisan bills a vote on the Senate Floor, again and again putting his own political survival before the survival of our children. . . . We will not stop until these bills are passed and our children\u2019s lives are safe,\u201d they said.\n\nSeung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "description": "The two Democratic leaders urged the president to endorse House-passed gun measures and pledged to join him for a \u201chistoric signing ceremony at the Rose Garden\u201d if the legislation is passed.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Coho_O8dPyKzfzwVA_LvMvFO2e8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QAIXMCWX34I6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
