On a 2-1 count, the St. Louis Cardinals outfielder saw Scherzer\u2019s fastball leave his hand cleanly and watched as it screamed toward him. There it was \u2014 right over the plate, middle-in, belt high \u2014 a rare mistake from Scherzer on this or any day.\n\nIt was also one of few hittable pitches a Cardinals batter saw on Saturday, but the result was the same as when Scherzer paints the corners: Edman swung and missed. Two pitches later, he struck out. His teammates followed the same course, as Scherzer held them hitless through six innings.\n\nAfter a Friday night of butterflies from An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, it was a Saturday afternoon of darts from Scherzer. The Cardinals couldn\u2019t hit either one, and after a 3-1 loss, they\u2019re in a 2-0 hole as the National League Championship Series moves to Washington, where the final two of the Nationals\u2019 \u201cBig Four,\u201d Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin, will start Games 3 and 4.\n\n[Max Scherzer gives Nationals their second straight gem, and a 2-0 series lead over Cardinals]\n\nCardinals Manager Mike Shildt spent Friday night and Saturday pregame saying he didn\u2019t want to make knee-jerk changes to goose the St. Louis offense. He admitted after Saturday\u2019s game that he might have to now.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t ignore the fact we have been shut down pretty much for two games in a row,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t make excuses for it. There\u2019s a lot of variables to it. But the reality is we haven\u2019t been able to get it done.\u201d\n\nThe lone bright spot offensively for the Cardinals has been pinch hitter Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez, who has two of the team\u2019s four hits in the series and their only RBI. Shildt hinted he might find more at-bats for Mart\u00ednez.\n\nGoing into Game 2, Shildt might not have been feeling offensive urgency, but his hitters showed evidence of it by repeatedly jumping at pitches out of the zone. In the first inning, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt waved harmlessly at a first pitch off the plate after a four-pitch walk to second baseman Kolten Wong; later in the at-bat, Goldschmidt struck out on a shin-high pitch. The next batter, left fielder Marcell Ozuna, lunged at a first pitch that had to be blocked by the catcher before eventually striking out.\n\nTherein lies the Cardinals\u2019 offensive woes. Nationals pitchers have offered them few pitches to hit, leading the Cardinals to be aggressive on bad pitches to try to kick-start their dormant offense. The Cardinals\u2019 constant swings at bad pitches have meant the Nationals haven\u2019t had to throw them good ones.\n\n[Father, husband, pitcher: Daniel Hudson has his priorities straight, and Nats are better for it]\n\nCardinals hitters and Shildt offered many solutions. Get better pitches to hit (and hit them when they do). Be more selective. Stop trying too hard to make something out of nothing.\n\n\u201cOnce you get two strikes, keep battling instead of going down easily like we have been,\u201d Edman said.\n\nIn the fifth inning, the Cardinals temporarily backed off their Hack-A-Max approach, and that didn\u2019t work either. Matt Carpenter worked a 3-0 count and then watched three strikes go by. Edman followed that by taking two strikes in a three-pitch strikeout. In fairness, several of those pitches were snaking bullets on the black that they probably couldn\u2019t have hit with an oar. So, the problem isn\u2019t just that the Cardinals need to lay off, it\u2019s that they\u2019re getting beaten by superior pitching.\n\n\u201cGood pitching usually makes bad scuffling,\u201d Wong said. \u201cGuys are attacking you and not really giving you any pitches to hit, really staying off the middle of the plate, you\u2019re going to tend to chase because you understand you\u2019re in holes right away.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals scored 13 runs in the first three innings of Game 5 of the NLDS against Atlanta on Wednesday. In the 24 innings since, they\u2019ve scored just one, in the eighth inning on Saturday, and even that came on a double by Mart\u00ednez on a ball misplayed by Nationals center fielder Michael A. Taylor. It came at the end of a good at-bat by Mart\u00ednez \u2014 the kind that has Shildt now contemplating inserting him into the starting lineup. He fouled off five pitches before hitting a liner that Taylor broke in on when he should have broken back. Clean hit or not, it was well struck and finally ended the scoring drought.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of been the story of our season,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cOur offense at times has been hit or miss as a group. We have stretches where we struggle to score, and we\u2019ve had stretches where we just pour it on. Hopefully we just pour it on in the next couple of days, get some confidence back and get rolling.\u201d", "description": "Constant swings at bad pitches have meant the Nationals haven\u2019t had to throw them good ones.", "authors": ["Matt Crossman", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wetuyZkjdgIcETQL3L2N7gK1oeE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVWVREHNLEI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
