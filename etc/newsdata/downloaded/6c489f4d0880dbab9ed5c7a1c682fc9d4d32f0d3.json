While none of them want to be been interfering in the U.K.\u2018s domestic politics, France is at loggerheads with the others.\n\nMacron wants to grant a delay until Nov. 30, or even sooner, to put pressure on the House of Commons to back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. Other EU governments see that as too much of a gamble because it could lead to a no-deal Brexit. They are pushing to postpone Brexit until Jan. 31 to allow time for a general election.\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson said he will seek an election on Dec. 12. But to hold it, he needs the support of two-thirds of members of Parliament, and the opposition Labour party has said it will block it.\n\nThe diplomats have given themselves until Tuesday to make a decision. If they don\u2019t, the EU could convene an emergency summit of EU leaders that would leave the U.K. hanging as time ticks down toward the country\u2019s scheduled departure. Without a deal or an extension, the U.K. would crash out of the bloc without the economic safety net of an agreement at the end of the month.\n\nNo EU government will refuse a delay of some sort -- the question is when they will decide to grant it, officials said.", "description": "Macron Blocked EU\u2019s Decision to Delay Brexit for Three Months", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3c3ca77e8b0048f4f11c94faca2c8be4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
