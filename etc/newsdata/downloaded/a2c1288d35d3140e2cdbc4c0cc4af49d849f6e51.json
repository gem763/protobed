It finds that in 2018 the average effective tax rate paid by the richest 400 families in the country was 23 per cent, a full percentage point lower than the 24.2 per cent rate paid by the bottom half of American households.\n\nIn 1980, by contrast, the 400 richest had an effective tax rate of 47 per cent. In 1960, their tax rate was as high as 56 per cent. The effective tax rate paid by the bottom 50 per cent, by contrast, has changed little over time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe analysis differs from many other published estimates of tax burdens by encompassing the totality of taxes Americans pay: not just federal income taxes but also corporate taxes, as well as taxes paid at the state and local levels. It also includes the burden of about $250 billion (\u00a3204 billion) of what Mr Saez and Mr Zucman call \u201cindirect taxes,\u201d such as licenses for motor vehicles and businesses.\n\nThe analysis, which was the subject of a column in The New York Times on Monday, is also notable for the detailed breakdown of the tax burden of not just the top 1 per cent but also the top 0.1 per cent, the top 0.01 per cent and the 400 richest households.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The top 400 families are a \u201cnatural reference point,\u201d Mr Zucman says, because the IRS publishes information on the top 400 taxpayers as a group, and other sources, such as Forbes, track the fortunes of the 400 wealthiest Americans.\n\nThe relatively small tax burden of the super-rich is the product of decades of choices made by American lawmakers, some deliberate, others the result of indecisiveness or inertia, Mr Saez and Mr Zucman say. Congress has repeatedly slashed top income tax rates, for instance, and cut taxes on capital gains and estates. Lawmakers have also failed to provide adequate funding for IRS enforcement efforts and allowed multinational companies to shelter their profits in low-tax countries.\n\nBut the tipping point came in 2017, with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That bill, championed by president Donald Trump and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, was a windfall for the wealthy: it lowered the top income tax bracket and slashed the corporate tax rate.\n\nBy 2018, according to Mr Saez and Mr Zucman, the rich were already enjoying the fruits of that legislation: the average effective tax rate paid by the top 0.1 per cent of households dropped by 2.5 percentage points. The benefits the bill\u2019s supporters promised \u2013 higher rates of growth and business investment and a shrinking deficit \u2013 have largely failed to materialise.\n\nNot all economists accept Mr Saez and Mr Zucman\u2019s analysis. It is based in part on their previous work, along with French economist Thomas Piketty, on the distribution of wealth and income in American society. Other economists have generated estimates of that distribution that show smaller disparities between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots. Mr Saez, Mr Zucman and Mr Piketty have defended their research and maintain that their methods are the most accurate.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A person who paid $1,000 (\u00a3820) in federal income taxes and then received a $1,500 (\u00a31230) credit would have a total federal tax burden of -$500 (\u00a3410), but Mr Furman said that under Mr Saez and Mr Zucman\u2019s analysis, that person would instead show a burden of $0. That result would make total tax burdens at the lower end of the income spectrum appear higher than they actually are.\n\n\u201cThe best estimates indicate that the tax system is progressive \u2013 with the rich paying a higher tax rate than everyone else,\u201d Furman said.\n\nMr Zucman countered that his and Mr Saez\u2019s analysis considers the EITC and other credits like it as transfers of income, akin to food stamps or jobless benefits, rather than tax provisions.\n\n\u201cIf you start counting some transfers as negative taxes, it is not clear where to stop,\u201d he said via email. \u201cDo you treat the EITC as a negative tax? Veterans\u2019 benefits? Medicaid? Defence spending? ... There\u2019s no clear line, and the results become arbitrary.\u201d\n\nThere is general agreement among economists, however, that the tax burden of the rich has fallen considerably in recent decades.\n\n\u201cThe rich definitely pay less in taxes than they did in the past and less than they should,\u201d Mr Furman said.\n\nThe bulk of Mr Saez and Mr Zucman\u2019s new book explores how that happened, and how the trend might be reversed.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "A new book-length study on the tax burden of the ultra-rich begins with a startling finding: In 2018, for the first time in history, America\u2019s richest billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate than the working class.", "authors": ["Christopher Ingraham"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/12/trump-tax-bill.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
