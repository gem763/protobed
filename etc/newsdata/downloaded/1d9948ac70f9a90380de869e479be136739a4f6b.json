After initial setbacks and adjustments to the system, Ocean Cleanup reported earlier this month that it managed to pick up plastic from the high seas for the first time.\n\nThe river version, called the Interceptor, consists of a vessel that is anchored to a riverbed while floating arms -- which leave space for animals and river traffic to pass, organizers say -- divert waste into its collection system.\n\nThe system has already been tested on rivers in Jakarta, Indonesia and in Klang, Malaysia, the organization said on Saturday. Two more are planned for Can Tho in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. Ocean Cleanup said that is still testing the river system and will not give out numbers on plastics collected until a rollout phase has been completed.\n\nAccording to the group each device is capable of extracting thousands of kilograms (pounds) of detritus per day.\n\nSlat said that 1% of rivers are responsible for 80% of the pollution in the world's seas. That makes finding a solution to the problem of plastic pollution emanating from rivers \"quite achievable\", Slat said.\n\n(Reporting by Stephanie van den Berg; Editing by James Drummond)", "description": "Rotterdam (Reuters) - A Dutch foundation devoted to fighting plastic pollution in the world's oceans on Saturday unveiled a new device designed to stop it from reaching the sea in the first place: by collecting and cleaning plastic waste from major rivers.", "authors": ["Hilde Verweij"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
