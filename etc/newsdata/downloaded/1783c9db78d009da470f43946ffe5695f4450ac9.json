After her three fake stories duly appeared in print, she concluded that the culprit was fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy, or someone with access to her Instagram account. Gotcha!\n\nStop it. I know. There are so many more serious matters to concern ourselves with.\n\nEco-terrorists causing havoc on the streets of London, the UK teetering on the brink, John Bercow\u2019s nanny getting a \u00a3490 taxpayer-funded washing machine and \u2014 let\u2019s press pause on that spin cycle for one moment. We all know the Speaker has a lot of size X-Small dirty laundry to process but even still. For that amount of money, I hope the machine steam-presses his jabots in a way we would all find gratifying.\n\nMeanwhile, hurrah for Coleen and the WAGs who have a knack of cheering up the nation at moments of national crisis, just when we need them most.\n\nSuper sleuth Coleen Rooney (right) set a Scouse trap to uncover the person leaking information from her private Instagram account - eventually concluding it was fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy (left)\n\nJAN MOIR: What kind of a woman is Rebekah Vardy? When she married footballer Jamie Vardy in 2016 (pictured together), his parents were so horrified by their prospective daughter-in-law, they refused to attend the wedding\n\nI like to think of plucky Coleen, puffing on a herbal Meerschaum under her Burberry-print deerstalker, clicking away at her iPad with her French manicured nails, whittling down the Cluedo wag suspects until only one was left.\n\nMrs Vardy denies that she is guilty of anything and took time off from her holiday in Dubai \u2014 things must be serious! \u2014 to clear her name. To this end she said she was going to hire forensic experts to prove her innocence, whomsoever they might be.\n\nOh my goodness, this is just like Velma and Roxie in Chicago; it is The Shawshank Redemption all over again, only with better clothes and a demand for deliverance and freedom that is only slightly less noble. \u2018I liked you a lot Coleen and I am so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I am heavily pregnant,\u2019 complained Mrs Vardy. Perhaps she is right, perhaps she is wronged, but I have long noted that it is a tendency of those who feel guilty to try to elicit sympathy in the first instance.\n\nWhat kind of a woman is Rebekah Vardy? When she married footballer Jamie Vardy in 2016, his parents were so horrified by their prospective daughter-in-law, they refused to attend the wedding. Married once before, she left her first husband after a fling in a hotel with the singer Peter Andre \u2014 whom she described as being equipped with \u2018a miniature chipolata\u2019. She seems like a nice girl, doesn\u2019t she?\n\nColeen has been stoic in the face of her husband Wayne Rooney\u2019s multiple infidelities, including a fling with a middle-aged prostitute who wore rubber catsuits and was known locally as the Auld Slapper.\n\nJAN MOIR: Coleen has been stoic in the face of her husband Wayne Rooney\u2019s multiple infidelities (the two are pictured together), including a fling with a middle-aged prostitute\n\nChipolatas. Sleuthing. Creaking rubber. If someone doesn\u2019t turn this drama into a film or a ten-part television series soon, they are missing the opportunity of the century. Perhaps even an opera!\n\nWagatha Christie has all the elements of a blockbuster, every detail down pat. The fake stories Coleen came up with were so deliciously WAGgish, from the fake visit to the fake baby gender Mexican clinic to her possible appearance on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nPerhaps Coleen let herself down with the mundane Storm Lorenzo fake news that her home had been flooded. For any Tami, Nik or Harriet in Cheshire can get a damp basement any day of the week. How I wish I lived in WAGland like Coleen and Rebekah! The land of the eternal tan and the acrylic talon, where milk and honey are neither sustenance nor luxury but shades of blonde on a highlights chart.\n\nIn this spangled landscape of big hair and ever bigger boobage, there is little to task the tiny mind, and life goals do not extend beyond surrounding themselves with fashionable luxuries.\n\nMost WAGs commit fully to the life of the lotus eater (gluten-free, no carbs, love it). They shop for Cartier bracelets, succumb to all manner of beautifying tweakments and take a holiday between holidays quite often, like Rebekah, in Dubai \u2014 the international capital of WAGdom.\n\nColeen Rooney posted the results of her investigation on her Instagram account (pictured)\n\nThen every now and again a spear of truth punctures their pleasuredome of delights \u2014 and all hell breaks loose.\n\nColeen is now seen as a heroine, and all credit to her. As Dolly Parton once sang, it\u2019s hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world.\n\nYet in her epic quest for the truth, she somehow overlooked the duplicitous behaviour of her own husband.\n\nIt is no secret that Wayne Rooney has been known to play away on multiple occasions. There were call-girls when she was pregnant with their first child and two years ago he was caught drink-driving another woman\u2019s car while Coleen (pregnant again) was at home.\n\nThen, more recently, he was pictured near a hotel lift with the deadliest of all creatures \u2014 a \u2018mystery brunette.\u2019\n\nIt is interesting that Coleen Rooney feels Rebekah Vardy\u2019s putative behaviour is more worthy of examination than her own husband\u2019s tomcatting tendencies.\n\nWAG-on-WAG crimes have their own complex loyalty systems but I fear this case is less about a lust to uncover the truth and more about the need to control the narrative.\n\nBangs gavel. Next!\n\nCan anyone carry off culottes?\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge wore culottes this week and no, for once she wasn\u2019t playing in a hockey match.\n\nShe looked lovely in them \u2014 or as lovely as anyone can, pinned between two rolls of fabric like a limp peg doll going through a broiling carwash. I mean, is anything more unflattering?\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, in her role as patron of the Natural History Museum, visits the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the museum in London this week\n\nCulottes are up there with the male monokini, Ugg boots, camouflage print, Crocs, grey tracksuit bottoms, fringed shawls and shorteralls. Shorteralls? Cut-off denim dungarees, I am afraid to say. Please don\u2019t Google search \u2014 it will hurt your fashion-friendly eyes.\n\nKate can wear culottes, Keira Knightley maybe. I\u2019m giving 6ft supermodel Karlie Kloss and willowy actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut even Holly Willoughby would struggle, while for most women they remain a gym nightmare.\n\nSandi Toksvig, Miranda Hart, me, you, her, Lady Justice Hale, Mrs Normal \u2014 just say no.\n\nMy heart breaks for 'groper' Jamie\n\nI am deeply upset about the case of student Jamie Griffiths. The \u2018shy and awkward\u2019 19-year-old Durham student faces jail after he touched a teenager in an attempt to befriend her.\n\nHe had Googled \u2018how to make a friend\u2019 and came into contact with the 17-year-old during two attempts to engage her in conversation.\n\nHe touched her arm and then her waist \u2014 and in this post #MeToo era, that was enough to convict him.\n\nJamie Griffiths, 19, faces jail after he touched a teenager in an attempt to befriend her\n\nThe \u2018victim\u2019 burst into tears during the second encounter and went to police with her mother, claiming Griffiths \u2018would have touched her breast had she not moved away\u2019.\n\nWith the best will in the world, and all respect to the court and the judge, how could she have possibly known that? HOW? HOW?\n\nThe anonymous miss claimed her school work suffered as a result of the contact, leaving her unable to sit her mock exams and apply to Oxford University. God forbid that she ever suffers from genuine trauma.\n\nGriffiths, who lives with his parents, denied two charges of sexual assault, claiming he was \u2018shy, anxious and awkward\u2019. The court believed the girl\u2019s version of events rather than his \u2014 but what was his crime?\n\nGriffiths, 19, (outside Manchester Magistrates' Court) said he had 'clumsily' approached the girl in an attempt 'to make a friend but the words didn't come out'\n\nIs this what the tentative fumblings of lovestruck kids have come to, those clumsy stirrings of affection between young people that are now criminalised to such a grotesque extent?\n\nIt breaks my heart.\n\nNot least of all because this guilty verdict will follow this young man around for the rest of his life, while the woman he touched on the waist fades back into the shadow of legal obscurity.\n\nHonestly, Fergie's face tweaks give us all a lift\n\nHow marvellous to read Fergie\u2019s pens\u00e9es on her face-lift.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like garden trellising for sweet peas,\u2019 she said in the Mail yesterday. \u2018You insert the threads under the skin with a fine needle and they hold everything up. Before I had it done, I thought: \u201cOh, this is going to be painful\u201d \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t bad.\u2019\n\nCan we pause to note there is a variety of sweet pea called the Red Flake? And move swiftly on.\n\nAs well as having treatments on her face, the duchess (pictured) has had regenerative stem cell therapy on her feet, which had been \u2018ruined\u2019 by years of horse-riding\n\nI am totally down with the Duchess of York on garden-based face-lifts for the elderly. Many of us could benefit from some potato-chitting, or a bit of light work with the pruner and the dibber.\n\nBut whatever Sarah has done or not done, absolutely well done for encouraging young people to stay out of the sun \u2014 especially redheads such as her.\n\n\u2018The tan I have is out of a bottle,\u2019 she said. Just like my gin, she might have added, in defence of us all.\n\nAs well as having treatments on her face, the duchess has had regenerative stem cell therapy on her feet, which had been \u2018ruined\u2019 by years of horse-riding.\n\nYes, ma\u2019am. Fine. But my question is this. What about the poor horse?\n\nAngelina's adrift on Starship Luvvie\n\nAngelina Jolie has suggested aspiring actresses should consider a different career \u2014 because the pressures of showbusiness have become \u2018so hard\u2019. Indeed they have! It\u2019s getting to the stage where any darling starlet doesn\u2019t know where her next million-pound deal is coming from.\n\nAngelina said all this in a sparkly gown on a red carpet to launch her new film. So it\u2019s still going OK for her. And if the whole business is so ghastly, why did she drag half of her kids to pose alongside her on the red carpet? I loathe seeing children so casually weaponised in this way.\n\nMeanwhile, what is truly frightening about Angelina\u2019s type of fame is just how far from reality she has travelled. Long ago she climbed aboard a spaceship called Starship Luvvie and didn\u2019t stop until she reached Plane Silly Billy.\n\nOh hurrah, Boots has launched a selection of vegan Christmas sandwiches. That\u2019s my festive season sorted.\n\nTop of the list is the double negative of the drear Vegan No Salmon and No Cream Cheese sandwich.\n\nIt\u2019s just strips of smoked carrot with a non-dairy effluence smeared on top.\n\nI first came across vegan salmon (aka carrot) at my dear friend Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop festival and noted that sometimes it is hard to understand the vegan psyche.\n\nWhat lies beneath their need to be cushioned from the blow of their lifestyle choice by indulging their eats with meat and fish-friendly terms?\n\nIt is rather like carnivores ordering a parsnip-shaped steak, if you get my drift.\n\nWhat is the point of the artifice? If the No Salmon treat were billed as a carrot and marge sandwich, would any vegan buy it?
