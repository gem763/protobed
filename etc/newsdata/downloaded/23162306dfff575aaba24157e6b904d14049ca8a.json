You just need to stay clam and stay focused. It is more about how you respond to that kind of mistake.\u201d\n\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino accepted the blame for Lloris\u2019s mistake,\n\n\u201cI demand that he plays in this way,\u201d he said.\n\nPochettino, who has spoken of the problems in his squad this season, said he was delighted with their spirit in battling for more than an hour with 10 men.\n\n\u201cI am really proud, and happy for the players and fans. They deserve a victory like this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe needed to work a lot, to stay together and it showed our spirit.\u201d\n\nPochettino said he thought both cards given to Aurier were \u201ccompletely unfair\u201d but said he did not want to complain.", "description": "Harry Kane's eighth goal in six Premier League games against Southampton steered 10-man Tottenham Hotspur to an unlikely 2-1 victory after errors from his team mates on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434930620&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0L8", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
