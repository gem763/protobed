And they and other prominent Democrats junked the party\u2019s supposed concern for women\u2019s empowerment to savage Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones and others who came forward with claims about the president\u2019s extramarital sexual activity, including serious accusations of sexual violence.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t equate the potential fall of the president with the fall of the Republic. They didn\u2019t go full apocalypse. Bill Clinton didn\u2019t prophesy that his impeachment would lead to a kind of \u201ccivil war\u201d from which the country would \u201cnever heal,\u201d as Trump did by tweeting an evangelical pastor\u2019s comments on Fox News along those lines.\n\nI wrote last week that the prospect of Trump\u2019s impeachment terrified me, and one of the main reasons I cited was what we\u2019re seeing now: his histrionic response, which is untethered from any sense of honor, civic concern or real patriotism.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Bruni", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Impeachment-Clinton.Html"], "top_image": ""}
