The team announced Sunday that the big man will undergo an MRI on Monday to confirm the severity of the injury.\n\nDavis sustained the injury while swatting at the ball midway through the first quarter against the Nets. He started the preseason game at center as the Lakers deployed a small-ball starting lineup, matching him with LeBron James, Rajon Rondo, Avery Bradley and Danny Green.\n\nThe former New Orleans Pelicans star initially remained in the game after getting the thumb taped during a timeout. He later went to the locker room between the first and second quarters and returned with an ice pack taped to his right hand.\n\nDavis finished with six points on 2-of-7 shooting, three rebounds, two blocks and a steal in 12 minutes. Both of his scores came off assists by James.\n\nThrough two preseason games this year, Davis was averaging 19 points on 50 percent shooting, six rebounds, 3.5 assists and a block in 22 minutes per game.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 next preseason matchup is Monday at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers superstar Anthony Davis suffered a right thumb sprain in the first half of the team\u2019s preseason game", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
