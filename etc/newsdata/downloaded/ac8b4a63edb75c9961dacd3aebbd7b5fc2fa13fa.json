Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s claim that the \u201ccorporate media\u201d are attempting to rig the 2020 Democratic presidential primary appeared to receive a boost Tuesday from Project Veritas.\n\nA hidden-camera video released Tuesday by the guerilla journalism organization showed a CNN media coordinator saying that the cable network\u2019s powers that be \u201cdon\u2019t like Tulsi Gabbard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the one they don\u2019t like is Tulsi,\u201d said CNN\u2019s Christian Sierra in the video. \u201cThey don\u2019t like Tulsi Gabbard. Because she supports [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad and she is not taking the conventional route when it comes to foreign policy and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe video came as the second in the Project Veritas #ExposeCNN project, in which former CNN satellite technician and contractor Cary Poarch secretly recorded network staffers as well as CNN Worldwide CEO Jeffrey Zucker.\n\nWho is ready for round II of #ExposeCNN? The #DemDebate is tonight. @CNN wouldn\u2019t admit to practicing favoritism amongst the candidates, would they? ATTN: @TulsiGabbard\n\n\n\nWe launch at noon\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Kmga8X1iSG \u2014 James O\u2019Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\nLast week, Ms. Gabbard said she was \u201cseriously considering\u201d skipping Tuesday\u2019s 2020 Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 debate, to air on CNN, citing what she described as efforts to \u201chijack\u201d the race by the Democratic National Committee and \u201ccorporate media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe DNC and the corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said in an Oct. 10 video. \u201cSo in order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy, and ensure that your voice is heard, I\u2019m seriously considering boycotting the next debate on October 15.\u201d\n\nShe later said she would attend the debate, sponsored by CNN and the New York Times, at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary. Not against Bernie this time, but against voters in early states Iowa, New Hampshire, South\u2026 \u2014> https://t.co/x5P3GFGbyn pic.twitter.com/UgKCj6DGI0 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 10, 2019\n\n\n\nIn the hidden-camera video, CNN\u2019s Sierra said that the Hawaii Democrat was \u201cactually pretty liberal. But when it comes to that one position, I think there are a lot of people who are not cool with her.\u201d\n\nStaffers were also shown discussing which candidates CNN did like. \u201cI think they like Warren a lot,\u201d said Mr. Sierra, adding that \u201cthey like to cover the people who are at the top,\u201d which could be said of most media outlets.\n\nIn a discussion about why CNN didn\u2019t cover rallies held by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, media coordinator Nick Neville said it was because Biden rallies are \u201cboring,\u201d adding, \u201cPeople would change the channel.\u201d\n\nWhile CNN media coordinators are not reporters, Project Veritas also released video of a man identified as CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez saying that \u201cJoe Biden has a problem\u201d with his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in China and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden has a problem. Because his son was trading in name,\u201d said Mr. Perez in the video. \u201cIt looks bad. It smells bad.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal. There\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d even though \u201cyou\u2019re benefiting from your father\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nSo far CNN has ignored or dismissed the Project Veritas investigation. CNN spokesman Matt Dornic said Monday that there was \u201creally nothing to comment on.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Ms. Gabbard stunned Democrats by meeting with Bashar al-Assad without informing them first, prompting Sen. Kamala Harris to call her an \u201cAssad apologist\u201d at the Aug. 1 debate, which Ms. Gabbard denied.\n\nAsked by CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo to denounce the Syrian strongman she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never defended Assad,\u201d arguing that she opposes U.S. military involvement in Syria.\n\nMs. Gabbard has polled well enough so far to make the debate cuts but has been unable to mount a challenge to frontrunners like Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, and Sen. Bernard Sanders.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Rep.
