WTI briefly hit 6-week highs of $58.29 on the EIA data, before reversing course.\n\nLondon-traded , the international benchmark blend, settled down $1.57, or 2.5%, to $60.81 per barrel. The session high was $63.26.\n\nOIl prices were driven lower by the sacking on Tuesday of U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton by President Donald Trump.\n\nBolton\u2019s ouster could pave the way for negotiations between Washington and Tehran on a new nuclear deal for the Islamic Republic that may eventually see U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil being removed. Bolton, a hawk on Iran, had practically blocked all attempts of diplomacy between the Trump administration and Tehran while in office, those in the know said.\n\n\u201cOil traders are reacting to the fact, as we expected, that Bolton quit over the suggestion that the U.S. loosen sanctions on Iran,\u201d said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\nAsked if he would consider easing sanctions on Iran, Trump on Wednesday replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d He added that he believed the Islamic Republic wanted to make a deal. The president repeatedly said in the past that any negotiations with the Islamic Republic would have to be unconditional.\n\nShould there be no more embargoes on Iranian oil, an additional 1 million barrels from Tehran could end up in the market -- not exactly something that OPEC would welcome. Iranian oil exports peaked at about 2.8 million bpd in April 2018.\n\nOPEC, in its monthly report on Wednesday, forecast that demand for its own crude will average 29.4 million barrels per day in 2020, down 1.2 million bpd from this year.\n\nThe EIA, meanwhile, reported U.S. crude exports at a blistering pace of 3.3 million bpd for the week ended Sept 6. That, and another drop of 180,000 bpd in crude imports last week, ostensibly from OPEC sources, were among the key drivers for the near 6.9-million-barrel drop in U.S. crude stockpiles for the week, the EIA\u2019s weekly data showed.\n\nstocks have fallen nearly 22 million barrels in a span of just three weeks, with the draws coming unusually at the tail end of summer, when driving activity in the U.S. is typically on the decline. While that should have boosted prices, the market fell instead on worries that OPEC, which accounts for about 40% of world oil supply, could again be faced with a global glut like a few years ago. Indeed, the cartel\u2019s monthly report highlighted the need for production cuts to prevent more oversupplies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking and talking about OPEC losing market share from their production cuts and now we\u2019re finally seeing evidence of it from the burgeoning weekly export numbers of ,\u201d said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. \u201cUnderstandably, OPEC is worried and the market even more at what lies ahead for the cartel.\u201d\n\nWoods Mackenzie said last month that the U.S. port of Corpus Christi, Texas could emerge as the country\u2019s top crude export hub over the next decade, linking three new pipelines from the Permian, the country\u2019s most prolific shale oil basin.\n\n\u201cCrude exports (at) above 3 million bpd ... is starting to look like the norm, now that Permian pipelines have started up to Corpus Christi,\u201d said Matthew Smith, who tracks crude cargoes for New York-based Clipperdata.\n\nThe EIA also said slipped by 0.68 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a drop of about 0.85 million. rose 2.7 million barrels, compared with forecasts for a slight rise of 0.07 million.", "description": "Oil Slumps on Iran Fear Factor, OPEC\u2019s Weak Demand Outlook", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEC060ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
