Spend it to treat addiction, experts say", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nAngela Mallette never saw opioid addiction coming.\n\nThe civil engineer from Mississippi was 27 and in her eighth month of pregnancy when she suffered a miscarriage. Doctors performed a cesarean section to remove the deceased baby. She went home with a prescription for OxyContin, a strong opioid for pain management.\n\n\"I had no clue how to cope with the situation,\" Mallette said, referring to the grief and depression that followed the loss of her child. \"I thought, I'm just going to go back to work, pretend this didn't happen, and move on with my life. The pills helped me do that, and that's where my addiction began and flourished.\"\n\nWith help, Mallette was able to stop. However, nearly 400,000 people in the U.S. died by overdosing on prescription or illegal opioids between 1999 and 2017.\n\nToday, as the director of a law enforcement diversion program for opioid users who have been arrested, Mallette has a new worry: Will the states and municipalities that are negotiating multimillion-dollar settlements with drugmakers, distributors and other companies use the money to do the most to end the epidemic?\n\n\"A huge concern is making sure that this money goes to help the people that have been affected by this crisis and continue to be affected by this crisis,\" Mallette said.\n\nThe latest settlement was announced Monday: A $260 million deal that avoided a federal trial pitting two Ohio counties against three pharmaceutical distribution companies \u2013 McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen \u2013 and Israel-based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\nMallette and others who have struggled with addiction, along with health-care providers and addiction experts, say money from these settlements should go to:\n\nHarm-reduction efforts such as clean syringe services and wider distribution of Naloxone, an emergency drug used to treat overdoses.\n\nsuch as clean syringe services and wider distribution of Naloxone, an emergency drug used to treat overdoses. Drug-abuse prevention programs , including counseling by people who have struggled with addiction themselves and outreach to children at risk for drug abuse.\n\n, including counseling by people who have struggled with addiction themselves and outreach to children at risk for drug abuse.

Long-term recovery support services to help people find housing and jobs, reconnect with their families and communities, navigate the criminal justice system and avoid relapsing.\n\n\"We need to invest in things that show we're treating addiction like a public health crisis. And we're just not doing that right now,\" said Marcia Lee Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Center on Addiction, which joined with other groups to issue recommendations last year on how settlement funds should be spent.\n\nSettlements to fund addiction research, prison scanners\n\nDirecting funds to these sorts of efforts might seem obvious. However, plans for some settlements have prompted questions.\n\nA $270 million opioid settlement that Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter announced in March with drugmaker Purdue Pharma will channel $200 million not to treatment but to addiction research by Oklahoma State University.\n\nOklahoma lawmakers were dismayed they had no role in the spending decisions. In May, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a law requiring funds from state lawsuits settled by the attorney general's office to go into the state treasury.\n\nThat gives legislators a say in spending generated from subsequent settlements, including an $85 million settlement reached with drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals USA in May.\n\nThat same month, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced a $37 million settlement with the drug distributor McKesson. A bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Morrisey to hold onto the money so the legislature could use it to combat the state's drug epidemic.\n\nMorrisey's office said in late July he believed most of the McKesson funding should go to addiction treatment. However, a portion of the initial spending was earmarked for scanners to stop contraband from being brought into West Virginia's jails and prisons.\n\n'People are dying \u2026 right now'\n\nRyan Hampton, the author of \"American Fix: Inside the Opioid Addiction Crisis \u2013 and How to End It,\" is in recovery from heroin addiction. He says these settlements should be channeled to front-line treatment and support programs.\n\n\"Research is important,\" he said, referring to the Oklahoma settlement. But \"we may not see outcomes for the next five to 10 years, when people are dying on the street corners in Oklahoma right now.\"\n\nDuring a phone interview, Hampton questioned early discussions about spending from Purdue Pharma's September agreement in principle to settle a lawsuit with 24 states and more than 1,000 counties, municipalities, Native American tribes and individuals. The tentative deal represents \"more than $10 billion of value,\" the company said.\n\nTax deductions from opioid settlements:'Clearly a game.' Opioid lawsuit settlements appear aimed at giving tax breaks to drug firms, experts say\n\nRather than analyzing gaps in drug treatment, prevention, and support programs, government representatives appear to be compiling lists of potential funding recipients, Hampton said.\n\n\"I've probably received a dozen calls in the last two weeks from state attorney general offices and public health offices in states, saying, 'Send us a list with your recommendations on where to spend this money,' \" Hampton said in a September phone interview. \"That is not the right way to go about this.\"\n\nWill states repeat the mistakes of the tobacco settlement?\n\nThe landmark tobacco settlement reached in 1998 is a cautionary tale about ensuring that money from opioid lawsuit settlements goes to early intervention, treatment and long-term recovery programs.\n\nThe agreement between the nation's five largest cigarette manufacturers and 46 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories requires the tobacco industry to pay states billions of dollars annually for expected spending on smoking prevention and cessation programs.\n\nHowever, states use most of the funding to pay for general government services, according to the advocacy group Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2019, states will receive a total of $27.3 billion from the settlement, not including tobacco taxes, the group said in its most recent report. Just 2.4 percent of that money will fund programs to prevent children from smoking and to help smokers quit.\n\n\"It obviously would have been great if states had put into the settlement a legal requirement that they needed to spend a certain portion of the tobacco funds on tobacco prevention and cessation programs,\" said John Schachter, a spokesman for the advocacy group. \"If you don't mandate it, there's going to be a time when legislators will do what they want\" with the funding.\n\nThat experience is playing into calls for government officials to spend opioid settlements carefully. The recommendations are coming from advocates like Mallette and Hampton, whose expertise comes from personal experience, as well as addiction treatment programs and health care experts.\n\nIn the report advising how to spend the money, the Center on Addiction and other organizations recommended bolstering education about addiction prevention, starting early intervention programs, and expanding access to treatment.\n\nTreating victims of the opioid epidemic:FDA-approved medications for opioid addiction\n\n\"I think there needs to be an outcry from people who have been impacted by this disease that state legislators have to ensure that the money that comes from any settlements be put toward fixing the addiction problem,\" said Taylor, the center's spokeswoman.\n\n\"These dollars have to be used to change the system so that this type of crisis never happens again,\" she said.\n\nTransforming jails into support centers\n\nThat outcry has been amplified from a place that might seem unusual \u2013 a jail.\n\nSoon after Karl Leonard became the sheriff of Virginia's Chesterfield County in 2014, he started seeing 10 to 12 heroin addicts sent to the county jail every day. In March 2016, the county recorded its 10th heroin overdose death of the opioid epidemic.\n\n\"There was something about the number 10 that just struck me as being ridiculous,\" Leonard said. \"We define insanity as doing the same things over and over and over in jails and having the same results and nothing changes. It became very frustrating.\"\n\nJails are great places for drug addicts to become sober, he said. But if they relapse after they're released, they can overdose because their bodies can't cope with the sudden return to highly potent opioids.\n\nLeonard announced the department was \"going to release recovered addicts back into the community\u201d with tools to deal with addiction \"so they don't need to go back to drugs.\"\n\nThe program, based on the 12-step recovery program pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous, is called Helping Addicts Recover Progressively, or HARP. It \"really breaks all the standards that we have become used to in running jails,\" Leonard said.\n\nThe first step, he said, is making sure prisoners struggling with addiction \"know that we believe in them, and that they have value in our community.\" They receive counseling to identify psychological trauma and deal with things that trigger that pain and send them back to drugs.\n\nAfter release, people who have completed the program can come back to the jail anytime day or night \"and be with others in recovery\" if they think they're in danger of relapsing, Leonard said.\n\nThe program also provides medical care, addiction recovery, peer-to-peer recovery specialists from the community, and classes in parenting, high-school education and job skills such as driving forklifts and food preparation.\n\nAbout 900 people have gone through the program, Leonard said. A Virginia Commonwealth University study found that graduates of his jail\u2019s program are less likely to be rearrested.\n\nAsked how the settlement money should be spent, Leonard, who is seeking reelection in November, said officials have to look at treatment.\n\n\"This money has got to make it to those who are struggling with the disease of addiction,\" he said. \"It has to make it to recovery programs. It has to make it to treatment centers. It has to make it down to the individuals who are really struggling with this.\"\n\nFrom designing bridges to rebuilding lives\n\nMallette offered a similar prescription based on her own experience.\n\nAfter succumbing to opioid addiction, she went from taking pain pills to injecting the drugs. Ultimately, she turned to heroin. She committed crimes to get drugs and careened in and out of jail, eventually losing her job and home.\n\nIn 2013, Mallette was ordered into a treatment program where she began her recovery. Afterward, she landed a job at another engineering firm in Jackson, Mississippi. She fell in love, and in 2015 she gave birth to her daughter, Stella.\n\nShe relapsed when Stella was about 6 months old. It started with OxyContin pills. A week later, she was back to injecting a highly addictive opioid called Dilaudid.\n\n\"At that point, I'd been sober for about 18 months,\" said Mallette. \"I thought I was OK and didn't realize I could relapse that quickly and that hard.\"\n\nShe returned to a treatment program, where she decided to devote her life to raising her daughter. She said she \"desperately needed somebody to teach\u201d her how to rebuild and maintain her family and work lives.\n\nMallette no longer designs bridges and highways. With the help of grants from a local church and a philanthropic organization, she launched Mississippi LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) in one Mississippi community. She hopes to expand to a second community in 2020.\n\nThe program, based on one pioneered in Seattle, enables police officers to send low-level arrestees who struggle with addiction to local treatment and recovery programs, not jails.\n\nThe program is meant to address a misconception that people simply need treatment to beat addiction. Mallette said they also need locally based, affordable services to help them find housing, navigate the criminal justice system and more.\n\nRebuilding these parts of one's life is hard, Mallette said. \"I hope that those in charge of allocating funds from opioid settlements realize this as they make their decisions,\" she said.\n\n\"As a country, I hope we don't miss this opportunity to establish a sustainable, long-term recovery support system that can help people for decades.\"", "description": "Firms are paying millions of dollars to settle opioid lawsuits.
