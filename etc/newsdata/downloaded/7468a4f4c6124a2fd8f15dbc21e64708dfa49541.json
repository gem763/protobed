Some roads were blocked by downed trees.\n\nWallabies arrival delayed\n\nAnd at least 138 domestic flights were cancelled, with the weather even delaying the arrival of the Australian rugby team due to arrive in Tokyo on Monday ahead of the World Cup that kicks off on September 20.\n\nThe French team managed to sneak in just ahead of the typhoon and reach their training camp near Mount Fuji.\n\nHowever, the Wallabies squad found their preparations disrupted by Faxai's arrival.\n\nBy mid-Monday morning, the storm had moved back offshore and was headed northeast away from Japan, back into the Pacific.\n\nThe weather agency warned that landslides were still possible in Chiba as well as the northern Fukushima region as the storm headed away from land.\n\nJapan is used to severe tropical storms and typhoons during late summer and autumn.\n\nStrong typhoon Krosa lashed western Japan in mid-August, bringing strong winds and torrential rain that claimed one life.\n\nAnd in late August, heavy rains left three people dead when massive floods also hit western Japan.\n\nBut this year, the typhoon season coincides with the Rugby World Cup, presenting a possible headache for teams and organisers.\n\nTournament rules say that if a pool match has to be scrapped due to extreme weather, it is classed as a draw, which could have a major impact on what is set to be a very close competition.", "description": "A powerful typhoon that battered Tokyo overnight with ferocious winds and driving rain caused commuter chaos with trains halted and more than 100 flights cancelled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5046/bdc8cfcbc1dc43d8a2158db891693892.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
