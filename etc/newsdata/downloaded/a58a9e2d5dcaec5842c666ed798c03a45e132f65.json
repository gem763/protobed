In August alone, 53 people died in mass shootings in the United States. Using the Justice Department\u2019s definition of mass killings \u2014 in which at least three people die \u2014 there have been five mass killings involving firearms since the Dayton massacre last month. West Texas is the sixth.\n\nRepublicans have long been resistant to gun safety legislation, but the political landscape around the issue is changing. The N.R.A., mired in lawsuits and personnel battles, is at its weakest in decades. Outrage over mass shootings is growing and gun safety groups are ascendant, amid a wave of student activism that emerged from the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThe El Paso and Dayton shootings left even the most ardent Republican defenders of gun rights feeling rattled, and the party began coalescing around red flag laws. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, along with Mr. Blumenthal, is sponsoring a bipartisan measure, and Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican, has said he is \u201cconfident Congress will be able to find common ground\u201d on the issue.\n\nOn Sunday, Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, said the federal government should follow the model set by his home state, which passed a red flag measure after the Parkland massacre.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure this out,\u201d Mr. Scott said on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how we get guns away from mentally ill people who want to harm others or themselves.\u201d\n\nBut for Democrats \u2014 many of whom also favor banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines \u2014 red flag laws do not go nearly far enough. Mr. Blumenthal and others say such measures must be married with expanded background checks, at the very least, to produce meaningful gun safety improvements.", "description": "After shootings in Dayton and El Paso last month, the issue was already expected to top the agenda when lawmakers return from their recess next week. Now the pressure has intensified.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/us/politics/01dc-guns2/01dc-guns2-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
