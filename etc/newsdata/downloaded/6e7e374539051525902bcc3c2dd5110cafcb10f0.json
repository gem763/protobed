Parliament was scheduled to vote on the new law on Tuesday, but the vote has since been delayed.\n\nThe country's Criminal Code was developed in 1946 and was based on Dutch colonial law. According to the Guardian, there are over 18 changes to the law that have sparked the controversy, but students are particularly concerned about the government trying to control their private lives.\n\nThe most controversial laws include banning sex outside of marriage and prohibiting unmarried couples from cohabitating.\n\nSex outside of marriage is punishable by up to one year in jail under the draft law. Couples who live together outside of marriage could also face up to six months in jail.\n\nThe bill also discusses sex education, contraception, and proposes a four-year prison sentence for abortions performed outside the law. Critics say the new changes would also make it a crime to be gay, and may limit human rights and restrict freedom of speech.\n\nAccording to Reuters, students say they're also against changes to a law concerning the country's anti-corruption watchdog Corruption Eradication Commission, also known by its initials KPK. The words \"RIP KPK\" were scribbled by protesters on walls near the country's parliament, Reuters said.\n\nRead more: Indonesia is spending $33 billion to move its capital from a sinking city to an island where forests have been burning\n\nPolice fired tear gas and water cannons at students to break up rallies on Tuesday in Jakarta, with over 300 people injured.\n\n265 students and 39 police officers were injured in clashes, Reuters said, citing Jakarta's police chief Gatot Eddy Pramono.
