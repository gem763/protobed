With all but two of our Ultimate Stock-Pickers having reported their holdings for the second quarter of 2019, we now have a sense of which stocks piqued their interest.\n\nThe buying activity was somewhat concentrated within the industrials, energy, and technology sectors. Several of the stocks these managers added--including Booking Holdings BKNG and John Deere DE--are fairly valued by our metrics. Several, however, are undervalued by our standards.\n\nFor instance, three managers bought Cognizant Technology Solutions CTSH. This narrow-moat IT-services company is trading well below our fair value estimate, and we think it\u2019s an attractive investment opportunity today.\n\nTwo managers picked up Microsoft MSFT. We think the wide-moat company is firing on all cylinders: Adoption of its cloud services has been strong and margins are improving. It, too, is trading below our fair value estimate.\n\nAnd two other managers purchased shares of Diamondback Energy FANG. We think Diamondback is among the best-positioned oil producers in the business and can thrive at Morningstar's $55 per barrel West Texas Intermediate midcycle price estimate. Shares are undervalued today.", "description": "Managers were attracted to industrials, energy, and technology stocks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltb383cfbf7fca7e83/5cae95f6529a88e3487efd50/AuthorPlaceholder_1x1.png"}
