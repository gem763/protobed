Ramos Miranda\n\nA demonstrator holds up a banner reading 'Sorry Mom, but is my future' during a protest against Chile's state economic model in Concepcion, Chile October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Juan Gonzalez\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Students and state workers dispersed peacefully in cities across Chile late on Wednesday, following mass protests against inequality, even as President Sebastian Pinera pledged social reforms to try to quell days of rioting.\n\nThousands of striking workers, including healthcare professionals and teachers, banged pots and carried banners late into the evening in the capital Santiago. The largely peaceful marches were monitored by police and soldiers.\n\nOfficials decreed a 10 p.m. curfew, for the city\u2019s fifth consecutive night of military lockdown. Tear gas used to disperse protesters lingered in many main squares and downtown streets.\n\nThe day\u00b4s marches and demonstrations dovetailed four days of protests, arson attacks and looting in which more than 6,000 people have been detained and at least 18 killed.\n\nTrade unions and social groups wanted a voice in the rollout of a social reform plan announced by Pinera on Tuesday, said Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Debelli, president of the National Grouping of Fiscal Employees (ANEF), one of the unions that called the strike.\n\n\u201cWe must carry the voice of those who are on the street, to channel anger and discontent over the inequality of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Copper Workers Federation (FTC), which includes unionized workers from each division of state miner Codelco, the world\u2019s top producer of the metal, joined the strike, prompting it to shut down its Andina mine and drastically scale back operations at its Ventanas smelter.\n\nThe federation called an end to the strike late in the day, after agreeing to further talks with government officials aimed at improving work conditions.\n\nTop copper miner Antofagasta Plc said on Wednesday protests in Chile could cut its production by about 5,000 tonnes, roughly less than 3% of third-quarter output, because of delays in supplies and travel disruptions for workers.\n\nIt was only \u201ca matter of time\u201d before knock-on effects in the supply chain had a negative impact on the mining industry, said Jimena Blanco, head of Latin America research at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.\n\n\u201cFor example, yesterday\u2019s strike by the port workers\u2019 union affected 20 of the country\u2019s maritime facilities, including key mining export ones in Antofagasta and Iquique,\u201d she said.\n\nREFORM PACKAGE\n\nIn his announcement, Pinera, a billionaire businessman, said he hoped to turn the violent protests into an \u201copportunity\u201d for Chile..\n\nHis proposed reforms include a guaranteed minimum wage, a hike in state pensions and stabilization of electricity costs.\n\nFor many protesters, these were a step in the right direction. Others demanded more.\n\nTextile worker Norma Carrasco, 68, joined the marches with her husband, 10 years her elder, carrying a home-made sign that read: \u201cIn Chile, pensions bring only hunger.\u201d\n\nBetween them, their pension amounts to $300, Carrasco said. \u201cAnd I worked since I was a girl.\u201d\n\nThe president said his social reform package represented \u201cconcrete and urgent steps\u201d to resolve inequality that has sent tens of thousands into the streets to demand economic overhaul and, in some cases, his removal.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicolas Maduro, on Wednesday celebrated developments in Chile as representing victory in a battle \u201cto dismantle the neoliberal model.\u201d\n\nPope Francis, originally from neighboring Argentina, expressed concern.\n\n\u201cI hope that by ending the violent demonstrations, through dialogue, efforts are made to find solutions,\u201d Francis said at a general audience in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Tuesday.\n\nThere were angry scenes in the Chilean chamber of deputies on Tuesday after a group of far-left lawmakers sought to challenge Interior Minister Andres Chadwick over the numbers of people detained, injured and killed since the protests began.\n\nPhotographs and videos circulating on social media purport to show excessive force used by police and soldiers. Reuters has been unable to confirm their authenticity, however.\n\nChile\u2019s Human Rights Institute (INDH) said it received a complaint of torture in a central Santiago metro station and urged the authorities to investigate. The group said it had also registered 173 civilians injured by firearms since the weekend.\n\nProsecutors said on Wednesday afternoon that 6,493 people had been charged for involvement in protests and rioting since Saturday.\n\nSlideshow (28 Images)\n\nJustice Minister Hernan Larrain said the deaths and injuries was a source of \u201cdeep pain\u201d for the government.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to democracy is inalienable and inseparable from the respect and protection of human rights and the operation of the Rule of Law,\u201d Chilean daily La Tercera quoted him as saying.", "description": "Students and state workers dispersed peacefully in cities across Chile late on Wednesday, following mass protests against inequality, even as President Sebastian Pinera pledged social reforms to try to quell days of rioting.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444332730&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N03C", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
