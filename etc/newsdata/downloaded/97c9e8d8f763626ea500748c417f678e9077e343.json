Iceland topped the list this year, followed by Switzerland and Norway.\n\nSee: 15 signs that a wonderful retirement lies ahead\n\nThe other countries in the top 10 were Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Australia and Luxembourg. The United States was ranked 18th.\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s highest score was in health, at 86%, followed by quality of life, which was 76%. The country scored a 71% in finances in retirement, but only 58% in material well being. Although the U.S. has a low unemployment rate, the country suffers from a large income inequality gap and government indebtedness, which dropped its score, said Ed Farrington, executive vice president at Natixis Investment Managers. The U.S. did rank 10th in the finance subindex\n\nNatixis Investment Managers\n\nStill, countries across the globe have many of the same concerns about retirement security as the U.S. Australia has a employer-sponsored plan in place, which mandates employers contribute to employees\u2019 retirement accounts with the company\u2019s own assets, but Australians still need to save on their own to ensure they have enough money in retirement. The U.K. is similar \u2014 it has a nationwide program where employers must automatically enroll workers in a retirement plan, but the contribution rate may not be high enough for future retirees to live off.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s how other countries financially support their retirees\n\nThe Social Security system in the U.S. is stable, but only for now, and requires attention from policy makers. The trust funds that support the system are expected to run out of money in the next 15 years, in which case, all retirees would receive only about 80% of the benefits they\u2019re owed. Old age pension problems exist in other parts of the world as well. Brazil has had a far too generous system, and is in the midst of revamping its pension structure. The changes will require Brazilians to work longer, but it will keep the government pension afloat. China\u2019s version of Social Security is also teetering, partially because there are not enough young workers to support retirees.\n\nComparing countries from different regions isn\u2019t always fair, especially when they\u2019re not the same size or have the same natural resources to monetize, Farrington said. But there are lessons the U.S. can glean from others, including the Nordic countries\u2019 quality of life and health care.", "description": "What can we learn from other countries to help our retirees?", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR575_flag_ZG_20190918153423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
