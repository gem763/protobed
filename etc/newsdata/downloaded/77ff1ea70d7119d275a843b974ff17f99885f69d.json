General Assembly\u2019s annual gathering of world leaders (all times local):\n\n5 p.m.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have called on world leaders to take a firm stance with Iran, siding squarely with Saudi Arabia after an attack on its oil facilities earlier in the month that has been widely blamed on Tehran.\n\nUAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan said Saturday that Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement with world powers should have included the Arab Gulf states, and addressed its ballistic missile program and support for armed groups.\n\n\u201cWe are speaking here about a country that seeks to export its revolution,\u201d he said, referring to Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution that brought its Shiite clerical leadership to power.\n\nBahrain accused Iran of perpetuating terrorism, and of specifically endorsing militant groups that have transformed Iraq \u201cinto a launching pad to hit its targets.\u201d\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the committee to draft a new constitution for Syria will meet under U.N. auspices in Geneva for the first time on Oct. 30.\n\nGuterres made the announcement in a document on terms of reference and rules of procedure for the committee released Saturday.\n\nIt says the new constitution is a step toward a political settlement of the more than eight-year Syrian conflict, and will be followed by \u201cfree and fair elections under United Nations supervision.\u201d\n\nGuterres announced agreement between the government and opposition on formation of the 150-member constitutional committee on Monday.\n\nUnder the terms, the Syrian-led committee will amend the current 2012 constitution or draft a new constitution.\n\nIt will have a 150-member large body with 50 representatives each from the government, opposition and civil society, and a 45-member small body with 15 representatives from each of the three parties.\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nCuba is blasting the Trump administration for its \u201cbaseness and rot\u201d as it denounces the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban to the United States on former Cuban President Raul Castro.\n\n\u201cThis is an action that is devoid of any practical effect and is aimed at offending Cuba\u2019s dignity and the sentiments of our people,\u201d Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told a gathering of world leaders Saturday at the United Nations. \u201cIt is a vote-catching crumb being tossed to the Cuban-American extreme right.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a travel ban on Castro and his immediate family on grounds of human-rights abuses, saying they would not be allowed into the United States.\n\nPompeo said the ban was in response to \u201cgross human rights abuses\u201d in Cuba and supporting Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in his crackdown on the opposition.\n\nCastro is no longer president of Cuba but remains at the top of the Cuban Communist Party.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nSyria is demanding the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces, saying it reserves the right to take action if they remain.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Turkey maintain an illegal military presence in northern Syria.\u201d Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday. \u201cAny foreign forces operating in our territories without our authorization are occupying forces and should withdraw immediately.\u201d\n\nOver more than eight years, Syria\u2019s devastating civil war has drawn numerous foreign militaries and thousands of foreign fighters battling for power.\n\nMost of the country has returned to government control. But rebels and extremists still hold Idlib in the northwest, and the oil-rich northeast, held by U.S.-backed Kurdish groups.\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nThe Holy See is urging the international community to give special attention to the conflicts in Syria and Yemen to \u201cput an end to the suffering of so many people.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging speech that he, like many speakers, dedicated to the theme of multilateralism, Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin on also highlighted the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians as \u201can area of perennial concern.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to hear from Syria, which has been wracked by eight years of war, later Saturday.\n\nParolin also highlighted the dire political and economic situations in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and spoke up for the protection of the Amazon, which has been ravaged by a surge of fires.\n\nParolin also urged the world to do more to protect women and children who have been raped and victimized in wars. He did not mention the clergy sex-abuse scandal that has shaken the Catholic Church.\n\n___\n\n9:45 a.m.\n\nSyria, divided, devastated and now in its ninth year of war, is expected to plead its case before world leaders at the United Nations. Leaders from Cuba and Mexico also will address the General Assembly later Saturday.\n\nSyria\u2019s plight remains one of the world body\u2019s thorniest issues. But now that most of the country has returned to government control, Syrians worry the world has accepted the idea of President Bashar Assad ruling them.\n\nOnly the opposition-held bastion of Idlib in the northwest, and the oil-rich northeast, held by U.S.-backed Kurdish groups, elude Assad\u2019s grasp.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.N. secretary-general announced that a long-awaited committee that would draft a new Syrian constitution has been formed. The U.N. hopes that will put the war-ravaged country on track for a political solution.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the U.N.
