The US-based game developer and publisher is also withholding any prize money he would have earned from competing in the tournament.\n\nThe incident occurred on Sunday, when Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung was being interviewed after a Grandmasters match. At the end of the interview, InvenGlobal reports that Blitzchung pulled down his Hong Kong protester-style mask to yell, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d The stream then quickly cuts to a commercial break.\n\nSeemingly worried at the potential repercussions for its Chinese business interests, Blizzard responded to the incident by banning Blitzchung from competing in Hearthstone tournaments for one year, effective from October 5th. He will also no longer be able to take part in the Grandmasters tournament, and will lose any prize money earned during Grandmasters Season 2. In its statement, Blizzard cited a competition rule which states that players aren\u2019t allowed to do anything that \u201cbrings [them] into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages [Blizzard\u2019s] image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,\u201d Blizzard said in its statement.\n\nBlizzard is the latest US organization to have attempted to limit support of the Hong Kong protests, which recently entered their sixth month. Earlier this week, Houston Rockets general managed Daryl Morey deleted and issued an apology over a tweet that supported the protesters. The NBA later issued a statement describing the tweet, which read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d as \u201cregrettable.\u201d However, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver later appeared to backtrack from this position, saying in a statement that he did not want to put the NBA in a position where it has to regulate what its owners, players, or employees say about global issues.\n\nPrior to the ban being issued, Blitzchung issued a statement to InvenGlobal to explain his actions. \u201cAs you know there are serious protests in my country now,\u201d he explained, \u201cI put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn\u2019t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue,\u201d he added.\n\nAs well as punishing Blitzchung, Blizzard says it has also terminated its contract with the two casters who were interviewing the competitor. Although they appeared to hide their faces as he expressed his support, one Twitter user claimed that the two had egged Blitzchung on, encouraging him to \u201cSay the eight words, then we\u2019ll end the interview immediately.\u201d", "description": "Blizzard has issued a year-long ban to a Hearthstone player who expressed support for the Hong Kong protestors during a live stream.
