Mr. Orvos hasn\u2019t disclosed his next position, according to a Neiman Marcus spokesperson.\n\nMr. Orvos arrived at Neiman Marcus in April 2018, assuming the CFO role from Dale Stapleton, who served as interim finance chief from June 2017. The company has launched a search for Mr. Orvos\u2019s replacement.\n\nGeoffroy Van Raemdonck, Neiman Marcus Group\u2019s chief executive, praised Mr. Orvos for his efforts in restructuring the company\u2019s debt. According to a regulatory filing, Neiman Marcus Group holds nearly $5 billion in long-term debt net of issuance costs that has climbed during a decade of private-equity ownership. The latest deal was made in 2013 when Ares Management Corp. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board agreed to buy the company for $6 billion.\n\nNeiman on Tuesday also said Lana Todorovich would become president and chief merchandising officer. Ms. Todorovich will help lead the retailer\u2019s strategy of becoming a more customer-centric organization, the company said.\n\nMajor retail chains such as Macy\u2019s Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. have struggled to keep up with online merchants such as Amazon.com Inc. The growth of discount chains also has pressured high-end competitors.\n\nNet sales from U.S. online operations at Neiman Marcus have climbed steadily in recent years, making up 30% of total revenue in the latest reported quarter, which ended April 27.\n\nDuring the third quarter, executives at the company also ramped up promotions with lackluster results.\n\nNeiman Marcus, which owns its namesake stores as well as the Bergdorf Goodman and Last Call retail brands, among others, reported a 1.5% decline in same-store sales compared with a year earlier. The company reported total revenue dropped more than 9% to $1.05 billion during the quarter.\n\nNeiman\u2019s comparable sales, a closely watched sector metric, included sales from retail stores open for more than 52 weeks and online sales.\n\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at Ezequiel.Minaya@wsj.com", "description": "Adam Orvos, who has been chief financial officer of the Dallas-based company since April 2018, is scheduled to depart Oct. 11 to join another company, Neiman Marcus said this week.", "authors": ["Ezequiel Minaya", "Ezequiel.Minaya Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104076/social"}
