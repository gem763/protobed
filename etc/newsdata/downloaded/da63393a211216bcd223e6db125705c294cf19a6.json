In FY18, McKinsey had 8 female key management personnel in a total pool of 51, which makes its C-suite 16 per cent female. But the real market leader here is the Boston Consulting Group, where the equivalent metric is 24 per cent.\n\nNot that we'd imagine Bain appreciates the comparison. Asked about such figures in 2016, then-managing partner David Zehnder said focusing on the \"percentage of women\" in isolation \"can lead the wrong focus or behaviours\". Which isn't an argument you often hear from metrics-driven management consultants.\n\nIf we look outside the notoriously demanding management consulting industry, many corporations do far better. But it's hardly unusual to see the external sermonisers of the corporate world hailing from companies that don't match the lofty sentiments they sell to others.\n\nWe've previously picked on EY Fellow for Trust and Ethics Clare Payne over her firm's hiring of Christopher Pyne \u2013 an appointment, first floated while Pyne was still in parliament, that smacks more of cold mercenary logic rather than ethical public conduct.\n\nIn Payne's latest monthly Ask an Ethicist column for this newspaper, she covered the perversity of age discrimination in the workplace.\n\nAge discrimination, she wrote, \"remains a persistent issue for employers\", while \"complaints under the Age Discrimination Act are still one of the main types received by the Australian Human Rights Commission\". This is unfortunate, because \"the challenge is to recognise and eliminate all forms of discrimination\".\n\nOf course, at EY, the issue is seen rather differently. For succession planning purposes, the firm unlawfully makes partners retire at 60.\n\nTo butcher the Biblical edict: Consultant, heal thyself.", "description": "Internally, the gender-parity focus it preaches to others doesn't appear to be working too well.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8005%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_39%2C$y_18/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5c2cfb2aa1a84c07a82165a07d3a6ac6c6e1f277", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
