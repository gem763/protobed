Disney+ will launch on Nov. 12.\n\nDisney+ is ad free, but ads on other Disney properties, like ABC, wouldn't be allowed to broadcast commercials for Netflix which could potentially take customers away from Disney+.\n\nNetflix declined to comment.\n\n\"The direct-to-consumer business has evolved, with many more entrants looking to advertise in traditional television, and across our portfolio of networks,\" a Disney spokesperson told CNBC. \"While the initial decision was strictly advertising based, we reevaluated our strategy to reflect the comprehensive business relationships we have with many of these companies, as direct-to-consumer is one element.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said that Disney originally considered banning ads for all Disney+ competitors. That could have included services such as Amazon Prime Video. Disney will offer a bundle deal for Disney+ that includes access to ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney took over full control of Hulu in May.\n\nThe news follows a similar report from The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that said Amazon and Disney are also fighting over terms that would allow Amazon to buy \"a substantial percentage of the ad space\" on Disney apps. According to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon is not currently planning to offer support for Disney+ on the Amazon Fire TV platform, which is available from Amazon Fire TV sticks and through partners who build smart TVs with Amazon's software built-in.\n\nRead the full report from The Wall Street Journal.", "description": "Disney bans Netflix ads from all of its TV channels except ESPN.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106146905-1569357821589img_7084rr.jpg?v=1569357947", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
