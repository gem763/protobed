And missed opportunities seemed important in a tightly played game for six innings.\n\nThen it was time to go to the Nationals bullpen \u2014 not the Stephen-Strasburg-and-all-hands-on-deck-wild-card-game bullpen, but the real one, the hide-your-eyes one that was the worst in baseball all year.\n\nWhen their damage was done, it was a 6-0 Los Angeles win before a sold-out crowd of 53,095 at Dodger Stadium and a 1-0 lead in the series\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez will look to Strasburg, coming off his dramatic three-inning relief victory in Tuesday\u2019s wild card win over Milwaukee, to even the series Friday in Game 2.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no limitations,\u201d Martinez said of Strasburg\u2019s start on short rest. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go out there and pitch and hopefully give us seven, eight strong innings.\u201d\n\nThere will be limitations \u2014 severe ones \u2014 if Washington goes down 2-0 in a best-of-five series.\n\nStrasburg hopes to have a better beginning to his start than Corbin, who walked leadoff batter A.J. Pollock, then struck out David Frese and Justin Turner before walking three straight batters \u2014 Cody Bellinger, Chris Taylor and Max Muncy, with a passed ball by catcher Yan Gomes mixed in, to give Los Angeles a 1-0 lead without a hit.\n\nIt was the first time in Corbin\u2019s career he walked four batters in one inning.\n\nWhen your team only manages two hits \u2014 a second-inning single by Juan Soto and a ninth-inning double by Trea Turner \u2014 there is little room for personal highs in control issues.\n\nCorbin threw 30 pitches in the first inning, and seemed unable to find home plate umpire Will Little\u2019s strike zone.\n\nThen, as if Corbin realized this indeed was the opportunity he spoke of, he settled down to hold the Dodgers scoreless for the next three innings, which might have been good enough \u2014 if Los Angeles starter Walker Buehler hadn\u2019t held the Nationals scoreless for six innings.\n\nBuehler didn\u2019t have as much of a problem with Lee\u2019s strike zone.\n\nBut Anthony Rendon did, striking out on a pitch that he thought was ball four as he tried to make his way to first base. His body language spoke frustration early.\n\nThe day before, in his meeting with reporters, Rendon nearly predicted the friction when he was told he had a history of success hitting against Buehler (3 for 6 with two doubles and two RBI). He didn\u2019t match that success Thursday night, going 0 for 3 with two strikeouts and a walk.\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d he replied. \u201cI really don\u2019t know \u2026 that ball still has to go over the plate, depending upon which umpire is behind there.\u201d\n\nRendon was smiling at the time, but Howie Kendrick wasn\u2019t smiling when he was called out on strikes in the second inning. He had words with Lee, and showed him where he thought the ball was \u2014 not in any reasonable strike zone.\n\nBy the end of the night, any complaints about the strike zone seemed like a reach.\n\nKendrick wouldn\u2019t smile much all night. Washington went with the veteran at first base because of his hot, clutch bat. He came off the injured list on Aug. 12 and went 37 for 87 the rest of the season, a .425 average. But he is not the best option defensively at first.\n\nKendrick had one error on a ball hit by Buehler and let a fifth inning drive by Max Muncy go through his legs to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.\u2019\n\nBy the seventh inning, after 107 pitches by Corbin, Martinez made the call.\n\nWith one feared appearance each by Tanner Rainey and Fernando Rodney, the Dodgers extended their lead to 4-0 on a two-run single down the right field line by Muncy.\n\nIn the eighth inning, Hunter Strickland somehow found his way to the mound and gave up a pinch-hit home run to Gavin Lux and another solo shot to Joc Pederson for the 6-0 finale.\n\nWith that, the opportunity that Patrick Corbin spoke of had past. The Nationals hope he gets another one.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunay mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
