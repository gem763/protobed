They ignored major parts of the available evidence.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking after the Annals of Internal Medicine, a publication of the American College of Physicians, this week published a collection of five studies that contradicted decades of growing consensus about the health risks of red meat, including pork, and processed meats.\n\nThe studies didn\u2019t actually say that red meat was good for you \u2014 they just argued that the evidence they were bad for you was weak.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cLow- to very-low-certainty evidence suggests that diets restricted in red meat may have little or no effect on major cardiometabolic outcomes and cancer mortality and incidence.\u201d\n\nBut Willett said it made no sense to include red meat in good health recommendations. \u201cPeople [also] like to smoke,\u201d he said. \u201cThey like to drink sugared soft drinks, they like to have unsafe sex.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: A major new study suggests it\u2019s possible to avoid developing dementia \u2014 5 ways to reduce your risk\n\nWillett is professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He\u2019s chaired Harvard\u2019s department of nutrition for more than two decades and has published 1,700 academic articles in the field.\n\nHe said avoiding red meat can slash the risks of diabetes and the risk of dying young. A drug that did as much for your health, he said, \u201cwould be a blockbuster. It would make tens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s MCD, -1.50% and Burger King QSR, -1.45% have recently introduced alternative options to beef. McDonald\u2019s has a burger using Beyond Meat BYND, -2.03%, while Burger King has the Impossible Burger.\n\nThe Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit medical advocacy group, on Tuesday filed a petition with the Federal Trade Commission to rebut many of the claims made in the study. Neal Barnard, the PRCM president, slammed the study\u2019s authors for \u201cmisrepresentations,\u201d \u201can inaccurate statement of the findings,\u201d and \u201ca major disservice to public health.\u201d\n\nThe corresponding author of the study did not respond to request for comment.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a form of patriarchy if we just tell people they should eliminate or reduce their meat consumption.\u2019 \u2014Bradley Johnston, one of the authors of the latest study\n\nBradley Johnston, one of the study\u2019s authors, an associate professor of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, told USA Today: \u201cIt\u2019s a form of patriarchy if we just tell people they should eliminate or reduce their meat consumption. We don\u2019t believe that there should be broad public health recommendations, almost like scare tactics, for the population as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on these reviews, we cannot say with any certainty that reducing red meat or processed meat will prevent cancer, diabetes or heart disease,\u201d he added.\n\nThe American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and others also joined the backlash. The American College of Cardiology said it was \u201calarmed by the reckless dietary recommendations\u201d In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s Monograph panel, which is part of the World Health Organization, voted on the issue and concluded that red meat was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\nIn response to that landmark decision, the North American Meat Institute, a trade group for the industry, said that vote classifying red and processed meat as cancer hazards \u201cdefies both common sense and numerous studies showing no correlation between meat and cancer and many more studies showing the many health benefits of balanced diets that include meat.\u201d\n\nThe battle between the two sides of this debate, as this explainer at news site Vox shows, involves technical disputes about how to construct scientific studies in the real world, and which ones are more reliable, and why. The limitation of all these studies is that they\u2019re all flawed.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to control for all variables, unless the participants were confined to a laboratory for years, if not decades. That\u2019s why researchers frequently caution readers that their conclusions suggest correlation rather than causation.\n\nAll such studies naturally have theoretical flaws, says Jane Uzcategui, professor of nutrition and food studies at Syracuse Universities. But the observational studies about the risks of red meat are so many, and so big, that we should give them a lot of weight, she adds.\n\nAll findings that challenge a consensus generate a backlash. The latest study is the work of 14 researchers from seven countries.\n\nBut the researchers aren\u2019t without allies. Stanford University medical professor John Iannodis told Vox\u2019s Julia Belluz that the latest study was \u201cvery rigorous and unbiased.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThese papers provide a nice counterbalance to the current norm in nutritional epidemiology where scientists with strong advocacy tend to overstate their findings and ask for major public health overhauls even though the evidence is weak.\u201d", "description": "The Annals of Internal Medicine this week published a report contradicting decades of growing consensus about the health risks of red meat.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS462_RedMea_ZG_20191002085254.jpg"}
