The reality is this: Everyone\u2019s saying we\u2019re getting so rich. \u2026 We can\u2019t rent rooms to people who are in other governments \u2014 we voluntarily did that,\u201d he said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t maximize the assets. \u2026 We literally volunteered to not do any new international deals.\u201d\n\nAsked if they\u2019re leaning toward giving up the lease, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization said last week that it was exploring a sale.\n\nThe eldest son of the president went on to knock Hunter Biden, the son of Joseph R. Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president, for profiting off of his father\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cThe reality is this: Unlike Hunter Biden, who magically became an international businessman the second his father stepped on that world stage as VP, we\u2019ve been international businesspeople for decades,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t even do those kind of deals anymore. \u2026 We chose not to [because] we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Bidens are facing intense scrutiny over Hunter Biden\u2019s business ties in Ukraine and China in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s D.C. It\u2019s all international business, and we chose not to do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd then every time we do, we get another lawsuit about this and another lawsuit. \u2026 It\u2019s almost easier just to stay away from it.\u201d\n\nThe Trump International Hotel in D.C., which is several blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, is part of ongoing lawsuits where the president has been accused of improperly profiting off of his office.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
