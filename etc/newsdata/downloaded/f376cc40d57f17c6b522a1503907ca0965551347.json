He needs you,\u201d Legend, 40, answered Trump\u2019s criticism in part.\n\nAddressing her young daughter with Legend, Teigen tweeted, \u201cLuna, remember the night before your first day of school? When mommy was making your sign and the p\u2014- ass bitch president had his 9th meltdown of the day.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ire was evidently touched off by a Sunday night special on MSNBC: a town hall about criminal justice, with NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt and featuring Legend.\n\nBeginning at 11:11 p.m., Trump, 73, went on the attack.\n\nRELATED: John Legend Rips Donald Trump as \u2018Racist\u2019 \u2018Piece of S\u2014\u2018 After President\u2019s Baltimore Rant\n\n\u201cI got it [criminal justice reform] done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding, \u201c[P]eople that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\u201d\n\nTeigen, 33 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd as comfortable on Twitter as Trump and a ninja with the clapback \u2014 responded, \u201cThe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn\u2019t speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I\u2019m cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch.\u201d\n\nIn another rejoinder to Trump, who labeled her \u201cfilthy mouthed,\u201d Teigen told her followers, \u201cNo guys no please do not make this trend, for it is my fight with #PresidentP\u2014-AssBitch, not yours!!!!!!\u201d\n\nI love you guys https://t.co/oQIaeBdxF1 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nFrom left: Chrissy Teigen and President Donald Trump | Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty More\n\nFrom left: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend | Kristy Sparow/Getty More\n\nLegend also tweeted, \u201cImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody\u2013ANYBODY\u2013will praise you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour country needs you, Melania,\u201d he added in another tweet, referring to First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nBoth Legend and Teigen have been outspoken critics of the president. Earlier this year, Legend said Trump was a \u201cflaming racist\u201d for describing Baltimore as a \u201crodent infested mess\u201d and in other inflammatory terms \u2014 apparently because a Baltimore lawmaker, Rep. Elijah Cummings, is one of Trump\u2019s notable critics.", "description": "Donald Trump Targets Chrissy Teigen and John Legend", "authors": ["Adam Carlson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kXjM6QJbWsFBGAtLmSblCA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/05ebae57ad20ccc1a7013661b2c7ca9c", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
