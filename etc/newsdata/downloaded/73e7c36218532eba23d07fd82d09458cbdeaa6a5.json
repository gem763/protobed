Not as far as I\u2019m concerned. The start of the weekend was a joyless desert until, in 2009, Weekend magazine started sending two hapless (my words) strangers out for dinner in the hope that three courses, a bottle of house white and the terror of appearing in a national newspaper would be the accelerant a romantic spark needs to go full inferno.\n\nI have been obsessed with Blind date for most of its 10-year existence. Its simplicity is deceptive: what the daters say leaves plenty of room for interpretation. On the surface, the questions are formulaic \u2013 somewhere between inane smalltalk at a stranger\u2019s house party and the sexless interrogation of a dietary questionnaire from your GP. But in the context of the column, they are traps \u2013 and I love to see the participants fall right in, revealing themselves via the short aside that they shared a pudding with their date. And let\u2019s not forget that score out of 10. Brutal to have adults rate one another, you might say. Delicious, I say.\n\nThe key to its success? It\u2019s relatable. I used to write an anonymous dating blog as The Guyliner. I know what it\u2019s like out there. I have sat at deathly dull dinners with the king of halitosis talking about his loft conversion. I have taken sneaky glances at my watch as a partied-out zombie talked me through his negroni-inspired accumulator hangover. I have also dropped clangers, watched my date\u2019s face plummet and realised that my half of the bill is no longer an investment in a bright future, but a tax on my stupidity.\n\nThis is why I love Blind date so much. But its two slim columns in the middle of Weekend, barely 400 words a week, weren\u2019t enough for me. Every Saturday, I would dash to social media to debrief with other devotees. The disasters! The fairytale endings! Even the kind of \u201cmeh\u201d ones where two clean-shirts spent two hours saying, \u201cNo, after you\u201d over a dish of calamari \u2013 we discussed them all.\n\nIn July 2014, after years of writing about my own dates, I was coupled up and looking for something new to write about. It occurred to me that it might be fun to look deeper into Blind date, to read between the lines. In the same way that the Guardian\u2019s episode recaps of Line Of Duty or Game Of Thrones are must-reads for fans eager to dissect their favourite dramas, I wanted to put Blind date under the microscope.\n\nThus my blog, Impeccable Table Manners, was born, taking its name from the stock reply given by many daters to the \u201cGood table manners?\u201d question. The tone is light snark, with greater savagery deployed occasionally for some of the biggest shockers. I try not to get too personal; I\u2019m critiquing what people say, not who they are, and I invite dates to get in touch if they want to give their side of the story. To my surprise, the blog\u2019s popularity grew and grew. Soon, every Saturday morning, my Twitter mentions were full of people asking when the review was going up \u2013 sometimes as early as 7.30am. (Guys, it\u2019s Saturday.)\n\nThe idea was to take the daters\u2019 answers and run with them. Sometimes, quite far. Almost every column inspires me in some way, and if I get speechless, well, there is always an animated gif of Joan Collins rolling her eyes close at hand. And while this bit is fun, every week the date throws up a deeper topic for me to chew on. I have touched on loneliness, snobbery, racism, misogyny, masculinity, poverty and kindness. An awkward answer about who gets to pour the wine can get me going on just about anything.\n\nThe blog has developed running gags of its own \u2013 my readers and I react very strongly to lateness (no!), negronis (yuck!), daters worrying they talked too much (you are on a date, hun; talking is the point), chopsticks (always a disaster), sharing food (no, thank you), people who say, \u201cI think my friends would be too much for them\u201d about their crew of magnolia acolytes and, of course, the dreaded \u201cimpeccable\u201d: find a new word (except don\u2019t, because I love it).\n\nThere have been occupational hazards. One guy I reviewed is now my editor at GQ magazine (awkward). Another woman was halfway through doing my makeup for a photoshoot before mentioning she had had the Impeccable treatment (she still made me look good). And I have been stopped in the street on numerous occasions by daters and fans of both the Weekend column and Impeccable Table Manners. The cult of Blind date is bigger than you might think.\n\nThey say you should never meet your heroes, but the completist in me wanted to find out exactly what goes on behind the scenes. Despite my readers\u2019 frequent frustrations at the \u201calgorithm\u201d that puts daters together, it is not a supercomputer that does the matching. Nina Trickey, Weekend\u2019s resident cupid, has been hooking up readers since 2012, curating the entire process: sifting the romantic hopefuls\u2019 applications, matching them, booking the restaurant and compiling their answers. She has the perfect credentials for the job: as a favour to her friend Anna, her predecessor as cupid, Nina appeared in Blind date No 2.\n\nShe got on OK with Niall, 26. They scored each other an 8, but when asked if she would meet him again, Nina replied: \u201cNot romantically. Also, he didn\u2019t compliment me and I did him (on his shirt),\u201d thus setting the tone for the hundreds of daters who would follow.\n\nYou need the precision of a heart surgeon to play Blind date matchmaker. Nina admits it can be hard. \u201cI can\u2019t match someone 100% of the time on what they say in that first email,\u201d she says. \u201cSome give you loads of information, but with others it\u2019s just two lines. I have to get them in, see them for myself.\u201d Daters are invited to have their photograph taken before their date \u2013 individually, of course, or where\u2019s the surprise?\n\nSometimes applicants are too similar; the column is always running short of straight men, older couples and people outside the M25. While there may seem to be a Blind date \u201ctype\u201d, anyone is welcome to take part and the goal is to make the column as diverse as possible.\n\nIs there ever a risk of being set up with someone who is merely available, rather than a decent match? Nina shakes her head emphatically. \u201cNo, there has to be something there.\u201d Some daters wait quite a while \u2013 up to a year. \u201cI do feel bad for unmatched people still sitting in my inbox, but I never forget them,\u201d she says.\n\nThe meal is on the restaurant, in return for the honour of being featured; daters get three courses and one bottle of wine. Regular readers often bemoan dates that happen on a \u201cschool night\u201d, which often prevents anyone getting too hot under the collar, but this is partly dictated by daters\u2019 schedules and the restaurant\u2019s availability. Even once the date is under way, there are fires to fight. A restaurant once accidentally offered the daters a very expensive tasting menu that they then asked the couple to pay for; on occasion, couples have twisted the rules when it comes to the free wine.\n\nNo-shows are rare, although one poor guy seemed to have the worst luck. \u201cHis first date stood him up, so I set him up again,\u201d Nina says. \u201cThe second girl was a bit flakey and wouldn\u2019t commit to a date.\u201d So she took one for the team. Nina laughs: \u201cWell, I was single at the time\u2026 I asked him out myself.\u201d It didn\u2019t last, and Nina is now spoken for, but she has been asked out by potential matches more than a few times.\n\nOnce the date is done, Nina sends out a questionnaire. The answer she looks forward to seeing the most? \u201cThe kiss, obviously! Just to see if I was right to match them \u2013 we do want people to get on. But I also like \u2018Will you meet again?\u2019\u201d The editors have been known to cheer when news of a good date reaches the office.\n\nSince the column began in 2009, 542 couples have judged each other\u2019s table manners. The first \u201cImpeccable!\u201d came early, in the very first date, while the first score of 10 came two months later \u2013 although it was not reciprocated. In fact, we waited almost five years for the first double 10, from students Josh and Biko, who answered \u201cDid you go on somewhere?\u201d with a baffling trip to M&M\u2019s World in London. But to my mind, the first truly emphatic 10 \u2013 one of them even gave a bonus point for \u201ctaste in films\u201d \u2013 came from Lizzie and Tomas in May 2017, who are getting married later this year. And yes, Nina and I are invited and will be making sure they don\u2019t share their main course.\n\nPerhaps the biggest Blind date of all, published in January this year, belonged to Joanne and Morgan. This raucous duo really went for it \u2013 sinking endless bottles of wine, snogging ferociously, gatecrashing a party and, upon being ejected, discovering one of them had left their knickers behind. The encounter went viral; the next day, Joanne was on BBC Radio 5 Live explaining herself.\n\nBut before anyone loses their underwear, lovers must be matched. Nina\u2019s cupid powers come into play at the photoshoot, where participants are photographed before their night out. It\u2019s a tightly run production line, as I found when I joined her last month. Daters are escorted from the Guardian\u2019s reception to a small studio and given 15 to 20 minutes to make the magic happen. Nina attends all the shoots, asking questions as she watches, her mind a Rolodex of potential matches. \u201cYou\u2019ll see for yourself,\u201d she says, as we wait for the first person to arrive. \u201cSometimes, something just clicks. But yes, there\u2019s also a spreadsheet.\u201d\n\nWithout exception, each of tonight\u2019s six daters appears shellshocked. Suddenly, this becomes very real. Today\u2019s photographer is the Guardian staffer Linda Nylind, who tells me she loves guessing how people will get on. Our first dater, a guy in his early 20s, is a natural and keen on doing a James Bond pose. More nervous individuals have to be encouraged out of their shell, perhaps surprising in the age of endless selfies. I enthusiastically join in with the directions, shouting out \u201cdrop your hip\u201d far too many times than is appropriate.\n\nOnce a few shots are taken, the subjects get to see the results. While they can point out any definite nos, they are reminded they don\u2019t get to choose the final picture. After all, who knows what their match\u2019s best pose will be? One subject, Hannah, wears red shoes and a matching skirt and immediately sticks in my mind. We ask her preferred type. Quick as a flash: \u201cNo posh boys. I\u2019ve dated a few and\u2026 no.\u201d Another woman tells us she is looking for what her friends would call \u201can intellectual hunk\u201d. \u201cYeah, I get a lot of requests for those,\u201d deadpans Nina.\n\nTowards the end of the shoot, we meet Peter. We watch him pose \u2013 he is very enthusiastic and funny, but struggles when asked to touch his beard, going full Gunpowder Plot conspiratorial scratch. Then the cogs start to turn. Nina and I exchange a look. We glance through Peter\u2019s details again, then Hannah\u2019s. Is this happening live?\n\nOnce Peter is gone, Nina, Linda and I get our heads together. We consider for a moment whether each would be better with other people we photographed tonight. Nope, it\u2019s definitely Peter and Hannah. The feeling of matching someone up is euphoric. Guys, I\u2019m sorry if it goes badly\u2026 this one\u2019s on me.\n\nIt\u2019s a 10 from me: Justin Myers looks back on five favourite dates, and hears what happened next\n\nLizzie and Tomas, May 2017\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lizzie and Tomas: \u2018Every answer fizzed off the page.\u2019 Photographs: Sarah Lee, Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nTomas said \u201cShe looks extremely cool.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cThis is, basically, saying \u2018I fancied her\u2019 two questions in without coming across like someone who bought a top hat in 2011 just in case they got married some day.\u201d\n\nTomas said \u201cWe talked about vomit, urinal etiquette, nude cycling.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cI have this feeling that when Tomas proposes to Lizzie \u2013 next autumn, at a place that meant something to her as a child, using the engagement ring of a relative or an antique bought with a legacy from a favourite godmother \u2013 he\u2019ll hide the ring inside a pudding or a pebble or something. Please don\u2019t do that, Tomas.\u201d\n\nLizzie said \u201cIt was really hot in the restaurant, so I kept fanning myself like a delicate Dickensian woman.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cI don\u2019t think she was fanning herself because of the temperature in the restaurant, do you, readers?\u201d\n\nLizzie and Tomas\u2019s date was published in a dark week, just after the Manchester Arena attack. This pair melted my icy heart because they were so unapologetically into each other. Every answer fizzed off the page with bubbles of joy, and their date was an emphatic double 10. What happened next?\n\n\u201cWhen I saw he\u2019d scored me a 10, I felt all warm and fuzzy inside,\u201d Lizzie says now. On seeing his 10, Tomas claims he thought: \u201cShe is a great judge of character.\u201d\n\nLizzie had been inspired to apply after reading through all the past Blind date columns on a Megabus journey home from Bristol. \u201cI hoped I\u2019d meet my true love, but never for one second thought I actually would,\u201d she says. Both read my blog, so buckled in for a roasting there. \u201cWe were spared,\u201d Tomas says. \u201cIt made the Blind date experience even more joyous.\u201d\n\nLizzie adds: \u201cIt really summed up our feelings towards each other. By the third date, I wanted to be with Tom for ever. No messing about.\u201d Wow. There appears to be something in my eye. She wasn\u2019t wrong \u2013 the pair got engaged in April 2018, and the wedding is this winter.\n\nBut if we are searching for downsides, even this romantic bliss has a dark cloud. \u201cI wish I\u2019d done something with my hair,\u201d says Lizzie of the Guardian photoshoot. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise that, if the date goes really well and you end up getting married, that bad hair day will follow you through the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nSo, Lizzie\u2019s advice: get your hair done. And from Tomas? \u201cApply! It\u2019s great fun and you never know where it might lead.\u201d\n\nBeautiful.\n\nBenjamin and Mark, June 2015\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benjamin (on left) and Mark: \u2018They didn\u2019t opt for a second meeting.\u2019 Photographs: James Drew Turner, Frantzesco Kangaris/The Guardian\n\nBenjamin said \u201cWe talked about our shared desire for a Georgian terrace house by Highbury Fields.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cDid you go to the top of the page, as I did, and check their ages again? You turn up on a date with some smooth-skinned honey in their 20s and all you can talk about is wanting a house?\u201d\n\nMark said \u201cIntroduce him to my friends? I don\u2019t think the opportunity will arise.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cCan anyone smell roasting flesh? Because, baby, that burns.\u201d\n\nBenjamin said \u201cMark in three words? Smart, musical, cute.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cI am trying to imagine these two \u2018doing it\u2019, but all I can picture is two John Lewis gift cards sliding around on top of each other.\u201d\n\nBenjamin, a 27-year-old composer, and Mark, a 21-year-old editorial assistant, did everything they could to destroy my theory that Blind dates involving two men were always more raucous. Two old heads on young shoulders, they talked of Bj\u00f6rk, operettas and property. At least they shattered a few stereotypes along the way.\n\nLooking back on it now, Benjamin concedes: \u201cThe evening was spark-free and chemistry-light.\u201d He feels Mark may have been taking the date a lot more seriously than he had been expecting. \u201cNo one really goes on Blind date to find true love, right?\u201d Mark\u2019s take was more vinegary. \u201cI could tell fairly well how it had gone,\u201d Benjamin says, \u201cbut his first adjective to describe me was \u2018punctual\u2019 \u2013 brutal.\u201d\n\nMark confesses he regrets his words a little. \u201cI came across as cold and cruel, which was definitely not the intention,\u201d he insists. \u201cI had a good time, but clearly struggled to convey that.\u201d He concedes that the friends quip was \u201csavage\u201d.\n\nThe thing to remember about going on a Blind date is that people you know will see it. And so will your mother. Mark said that reading my review of his date out loud to his mother was quite the experience: \u201cI can hardly describe her face when you called me \u2018something young and malleable\u2019 and \u2018a smooth-skinned honey in their 20s\u2019.\u201d Sorry, Mark\u2019s mum.\n\nMark and Benjamin didn\u2019t opt for a second meeting, but Benjamin is now happily settled with his boyfriend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together four years,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful, although I\u2019m not sure what score he\u2019d have given me on our first date.\u201d\n\nBest not to ask, Benjamin.\n\nMartin and Almaz, June 2017\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin and Almaz: \u2018You could be forgiven for thinking there had been a mix-up.\u2019 Photographs: Alicia Canter, Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\nMartin said \u201cShe was elegant, with a natural brightness and upbeat aura.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cElegant is a man\u2019s way of saying a woman is tall and slim without wanting to sound like a judge on Miss World.\u201d\n\nAlmaz said \u201cI thought he was joking when he said he\u2019s a Cliff Richard fan.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cThat noise you can hear is Almaz\u2019s taxi outside. She called it before Martin even got to the second syllable of \u2018Richard\u2019.\u201d\n\nAlmaz said \u201cDid we go on somewhere? It was a Sunday night, so no.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cYes, I am positive the only thing holding you back from a wild pub crawl of the capital\u2019s low joints with Martin was the fact it was a Sunday night. You\u2019re 28!\u201d\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking there had been a mix-up, that Almaz and Martin were actually on two different dates. Martin was sweet and kind, perhaps too pure for this world, while Almaz was keen to make it clear he wasn\u2019t her bag \u2013 and all credit to her, really, because there is no time for messing on a Blind date.\n\nReflecting on it now, Almaz admits: \u201cThere was definitely no chemistry. Martin wasn\u2019t trying to flirt with me, which really shocked me, because that\u2019s what you want on a date, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Despite some of Almaz\u2019s beautifully withering answers, the date itself wasn\u2019t too bad, she says, and they found plenty to talk about; she admits to a pang of guilt when she realised how different their final scores were. Almaz rated the evening a 6. \u201cI thought he might score me a 7 or 8, so I did feel bad when I saw I got a 10.\u201d\n\nThe pair didn\u2019t swap numbers \u2013 although Almaz wishes she had given hers to the hot waiter after they \u201cshared some intense looks\u201d. The experience may not have found her a boyfriend, but it inspired Almaz creatively: in 2018, she launched her own website, Kayleigh Daniels Dated, writing raunchy dating stories as a fictional character. Now that is a plot twist I wasn\u2019t expecting. \u201cI just really love dating,\u201d she says. \u201cAny chance to go on one, I will take.\u201d\n\nTom and Emily, October 2016\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom and Emily: \u2018Their date was romcom perfect.\u2019 Photographs: Alicia Canter, James Drew Turner/The Guardian\n\nThey said \u201cWe talked about which supermarket makes the best hummus, the importance of lamps, and Lancaster University, where we both went.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cI\u2019m calling it right here and now that these two will end up together, for the origin story alone.\u201d\n\nTom said \u201cIn the panic of the hello I forgot Emily\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cI reckon you could take a look at Emily from across the aisle at your favourite Waitrose and guess she was called Emily, but we\u2019ll let you off, Tom.\u201d\n\nThey said \u201cWe got the number 52 bus (we live just down the road from one another).\u201d\n\nI said \u201cSee? This is a silver-wedding anniversary anecdote waiting to happen. I can practically hear the light thud of grandchildren plonking themselves down into an overstuffed armchair to hear this story.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when you know, you just know. Tom and Emily\u2019s date was romcom perfect: he accidentally shaved a patch out of his beard that morning and Emily turned up with paint all over her hands. Imagine those little disasters in a montage with Clean Bandit\u2019s Rather Be playing over it.\n\nTom had left his application email sitting in his drafts for days and says he was stuck in a rut until he hit send. \u201cI felt like this small act of recklessness might snap me out of it.\u201d\n\nAnd it certainly did. Tom and Emily are still a couple: they have moved in together and adopted \u201ca big ginger cat called Gordon\u201d. By the time their date was published, the pair had been on further dates, but Emily had refused to divulge her answers \u2013 or her score \u2013 which Tom admits was \u201cslightly worrying\u201d.\n\nEmily was pleased to discover that Tom awarded her an 8, but felt \u201csimultaneously terrible about the score she gave in return\u201d. Says Tom now: \u201cThat 7.5 cut deep.\u201d Emily struggled to answer the \u201cWhat do you think he made of you?\u201d question. \u201cI knew I was going to struggle to hit the middle ground between totally self-delusional and toe-curlingly falsely modest,\u201d she says.\n\nThat said, she would definitely recommend the Blind date experience. \u201cAt the very least, you\u2019ll have a good anecdote for your next Tinder date.\u201d Both Tom and Emily agree \u2013 as do I \u2013 that the column needs older couples to apply. \u201cI like the way they approach their answers,\u201d Tom says. \u201cI feel incredibly lucky to have met someone in this strange and slightly terrifying way.\u201d\n\nJoanne and Morgan, January 2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morgan (on left) and Joanne: \u2018They were certainly a hard act to follow.\u2019 Photographs: Graeme Roberston/The Guardian\n\nJoanne said \u201cWe got kicked out of the house party we crashed. And I left my knickers behind.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cThe LGBTQ crew deliver. They\u2019re taking life in both hands and squeezing it harder than your window cleaner wrings out his chamois.\u201d\n\nMorgan said \u201cShe is obscenely fun.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cWhere would these women be if one of them had said no thanks to that fourth negroni? Home, separately, knickers on. It\u2019s no kind of life.\u201d\n\nThey said \u201cShe\u2019s a 10.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens next. We will always have today \u2013 this one perfect, bawdy date, which ended in a fat round 20, with no knickers on. And nobody can take it away from us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no understatement to say that Joanne and Morgan\u2019s date became the stuff of legend. \u201cI was really quite surprised,\u201d Joanne says now, \u201cbecause it was just an honest account of a fun night.\u201d She has been reading the column this year and enjoys the \u201clittle nods we\u2019ve been getting here and there\u201d from people who have appeared since.\n\nThey were certainly a hard act to follow: you couldn\u2019t blame subsequent daters for feeling inferior if their own date didn\u2019t end as raucously. Joanne admits that, if she had known she was going to go viral, she might have rethought the outfit: \u201cMorgan was too kind. I was wearing a pink beret, Justin.\u201d\n\nJoanne, who is bi, despite being tagged a \u201chilarious millennial lesbian\u201d by fans of the date, enjoyed the positive reaction, but nothing further happened between her and Morgan.\n\nShe urges all Blind daters to make the most of their moment. \u201cI can\u2019t believe people still do the whole \u2018it\u2019s a school night\u2019 thing,\u201d she says. \u201cGuys! It\u2019s free! Free food! Free booze! But what do I know? I\u2019m still single.\u201d\n\nShe also warns that, if you get Blind-date famous, there is a chance it will follow you for ever. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of dates mention it,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope they\u2019re not too scared. I promise them I like to go to the park and just hang out as well. But then, just last night, my date said: \u2018Well, there\u2019s been no knickers left behind. Has it been a bad date?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer to that, of course, is yes.\n\n\u2022 Click here to find out how this week\u2019s Blind daters, Hannah and Peter, got on.
