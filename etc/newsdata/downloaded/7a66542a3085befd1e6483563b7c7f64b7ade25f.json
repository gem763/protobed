I think maybe because I'm a bit big headed I assumed they would love the house.\n\n'I don't do any cleaning, but my mam taught her best friend about the washing machine, she said you're just lazy you're letting the machines do all the work.\n\nScarlett said: 'It's such an amazing experience, with my family we haven't done anything all together since Gogglebox'\n\n'They found us very isolated and I know we would say oh we're very independent.\n\n'Candithico said to me and my little sister, \"Why do you let your nan sleep in a room on her own\"?'\n\n'I think we're like the Dounty Durham Von Trapps and spend a lot of time together, and being there has made me realise we don't.'\n\nThe British Tribe Next Door is in on C4 at 9.15pm on Tuesday.", "description": "In the Channel 4 programme, which aired on Tuesday, the former\u00a0Gogglebox star, 29, lives alongside the Himba community in a Namibian tribal village.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler", "Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20078272-0-image-a-29_1571826376247.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
