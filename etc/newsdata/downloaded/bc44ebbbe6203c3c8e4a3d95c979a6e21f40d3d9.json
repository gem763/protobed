And to definitely report time, location and any description she has for what has already happened via the many methods https://t.co/R5xCLhkhAW \u2014 Alison Hernandez (@AlisonHernandez) August 29, 2019 Report\n\nShe said as a result she no longer wore skirts while out, \"or if I do I wear shorts underneath\".\n\n\"It changes how I look, where I go and what time,\" Ms Broad said.\n\nResponding to Ms Hernandez advice to call 999 she said: \"Wow - didn't even think to do this. I guess that shows how ingrained it is in me to hear comments from cars and bow my head and accept that they're part of walking the streets alone.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Women are feeling \"ashamed and degraded\" by sexual harassment in public said charity Plan International UK\n\nThe catcalling \"took me back to a place a few months previously\" when a car pulled up alongside her.\n\n\"A man rolled the window down and described precisely how he was going to sexually assault me,\" she said.\n\n\"So having that playing on my mind every time a I see a car and someone shouting, it's very difficult not to feel very threatened.\"\n\nImage caption Alison Hernandez said she had experienced street harassment as a young woman\n\nChildren's charity Plan International UK said according to its research, 66% of girls and young women have been sexually harassed in public.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police said it treated \"sex or gender-based hate crimes or incidents seriously\".\n\nSuch offences included \"misogynistic acts such as wolf-whistling or catcalling\", the force said, and it encouraged people to report them.\n\nMs Hernandez said she would like to see an app on which women could record or report cases of sexual harassment.\n\nRebecca Hitchen, of End Violence Against Women, said sexual harassment forced women to pay for taxis, take longer routes home and avoid going home late on their own.\n\n\"It is part of wider violence against women and consequence of gender inequality,\" she said.\n\n\"It becomes part of the fabric of girls' experiences from an early age.\"\n\nInformation and help on dealing with sexual abuse or harassment can be found on this page.", "description": "A police commissioner says young women often felt they should deal with harassment by themselves.", "authors": ["Jonathan Morris", "Bbc News Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rv5f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
