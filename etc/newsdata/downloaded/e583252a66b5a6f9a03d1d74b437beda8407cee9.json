Here's a first look at Google's latest flagships. Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Google\u2019s latest phone and smart-home devices came packaged with a not-so-subtle message: Google cares about your privacy. Does it?\n\nThe tech company has had a complicated relationship with user information in the past. Google\u2019s latest steps offer consumers some additional protections, although it\u2019s unclear how much more secure users will feel.\n\nGoogle unveiled a new Pixel smartphone and other hardware devices on Tuesday, all aimed at getting people more hooked on services powered by the company\u2019s Google Assistant and other artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nBut privacy has emerged as a bigger issue with these products thanks to the growing popularity of always-listening \u201csmart speakers\u201d and similar devices. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have all recently acknowledged employing human contractors to listen to and transcribe some voice recordings captured by AI software.\n\nChinese people-tracking cameras: They're spreading to nations vulnerable to human rights abuse\n\nMost such AI work, from interpreting voice requests to answering questions to turning on your lights, takes place in the cloud, not on your device. Users have very little control over what happens to their data in the cloud.\n\nGoogle Senior Vice President of Hardware Rick Osterloh introduces Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds during a Google product launch event called \u2018Made by Google \u201919\u2019 in New York, New York, USA, 15 October 2019.

Its new facial recognition unlock feature won\u2019t transmit details to Google servers for processing, for instance, and its Assistant can also handle many queries directly on the phone. A new recording transcription feature and radar technology that recognizes gestures are also done on the device.\n\n\u201cYou need to know what your data is safe,\u201d Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president of hardware, said at the company\u2019s New York launch event Tuesday. \u201cWhen computing is always available, designing for computing and privacy becomes more important than ever.\u201d\n\nApple and Amazon have also emphasized their privacy commitments at recent product launches.\n\nThe goal is to give people more choice over privacy settings, Osterloh said. Nest speakers and cameras now come with physical switches to turn off cameras and mics, for example.\n\nStill, Google relies heavily on customer information to build user-specific profiles it uses to target digital advertising, which produces the vast majority of its income.\n\nThe Assistant, akin in basic function to Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, is emerging as Google\u2019s latest digital data collector. It can learn more about you from your queries and can direct you to other Google services such as maps and search, which also feed into Google\u2019s multi-billion dollar advertising business.\n\n\u201cTheir end game is trying to collect all this data and target you with advertising,\u201d said Victoria Petrock, principle analyst at eMarketer. \u201cThe voice is a whole new way to capture people\u2019s behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe more helpful the Assistant becomes, the more likely people are to use it.\n\nGoogle's Pixel 4: New color and tricks like transcribing in real time\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 unveiled\n\nOn the hardware front, Google\u2019s new Pixel 4 features a fancier camera that will recognize people who\u2019ve appeared previously in your photos in order to automatically focus on them in new shots.\n\nThe new phone also comes with motion-sensing technology that allows people to skip songs or switch apps by gesturing near the phone.\n\nThe Pixel 4 will carry a starting price tag of $799 \u2013 $100 more than the entry-level iPhone 11 \u2013 and will go on sale Oct. 24. The larger XL version will cost $899, or about $200 less than the similar-size iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nGoogle's new Pixel 4 (Photo: Josmar Taveras)\n\nGoogle\u2019s phones have been well reviewed, but have yet to make much of a splash in the market dominated by Apple, Huawei and Samsung. In fact, Google\u2019s hardware products have never been big moneymakers. Rather, they offer a way for Google to showcase its money-making services.\n\nThe company also unveiled true wireless earbuds, called Pixel Buds, Google\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s AirPods. The new model, which will go on sale early next year for $179, does away with the wire that connects the two buds.\n\nGoogle introduced Nest Mini, the smaller version of its smart speaker. It comes out next Tuesday for $49. Google\u2019s refreshed Wi-Fi router, Nest Wi-Fi, will be available in the coming weeks for $269. A new Pixelbook Go laptop goes on sale in January staring at $649.\n\nGoogle hardware team, including many former Google Glass engineers, work from a light-filled, architecturally impressive building near the company\u2019s main campus in Mountain View, California. The building is complete with a \u201ccolor lab\u201d for finding the perfect device hues, a materials library for all sorts of elemental inspiration and a small model shop to build device prototypes on site.\n\n\u201cWe started by defining what it feels like to hold Google in your hands,\u201d hardware design executive Ivy Ross said. \u201cThe good thing about coming a little bit late to the hardware arena is you get to stand back and look at everyone else.\u201d\n\nOne of the challenges this time around was finding a way to make the products more sustainable, a feat especially notable on the Nest Mini, which has a \u201cfabric\u201d casing made of yarn created from plastic water bottles.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/16/google-pixel-4-unveiled-touts-privacy-still-sells-your-data/3995929002/", "description": "Google, along with Apple and Amazon, have emphasized privacy commitments recently, but the \"end game\" still exists: they sell your data.", "authors": ["Rachel Lerman", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
