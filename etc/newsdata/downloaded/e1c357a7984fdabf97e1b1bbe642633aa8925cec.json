Facebook has been responsive in removing or down-ranking questionable posts, and its data-sharing practices have allowed researchers and reporters to see what\u2019s going on inside the platform for the first time.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive turn of events for a company that has faced a lot of warranted criticism, including in this publication.\n\nYou\u2019ll recall that in January, the federal government established a task force comprised of some of its most senior civil servants to monitor the election for substantial threats and alert party leaders, Elections Canada and the public if it detected any skulduggery.\n\nI asked several officials in Ottawa if they\u2019d detected any suspicious foreign influence in the campaign to date. Those who responded all answered with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we have seen a largely clean election, with much less of a kind of misrepresented advertiser [or] misinformation kinds of content that we have seen in the U.S. and the U.K.,\u201d Laura Edelson told The Canadian Press this week. Edelson is a researcher with New York University\u2019s Online Political Transparency Project, which has partnered with the Digital Democracy Project to monitor Facebook ads during the campaign. \u201cIf disinformation ads come out, my suspicion is they will come out [in] the last week.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that there hasn\u2019t been any fake news during the campaign. But when it has appeared\u2014for example, in a Buffalo Chronicle item earlier this week\u2014Facebook has taken measures to reduce its spread.\n\nMcGill University analyzed the fake Chronicle item and found that while it reached 24 million people across all social platforms, it was dramatically lower on Facebook. This suggests that the company\u2019s suppression protocols worked.\n\nIn The Logic\u2019s own tests during the campaign and in the weeks leading up to it, Facebook flagged and blocked all ads that violated its political advertising policies, often within minutes of the content being submitted for approval.\n\nFacebook\u2019s transparency and advertising disclosures have also helped educate voters about what\u2019s taking place on its platform. Countless column inches have been filled with reporting on disinformation, ad spending and awareness and researchers have been given unprecedented access to Facebook\u2019s \u201cfirehose\u201d\u2014the hundreds of terabytes tracking all the likes and shares on the platform.\n\nMuch remains out of sight for researchers\u2014all advertisements not labelled political, all private posts, all comments, messages and all private groups\u2014despite Facebook initially promising to provide much of that. But with what Facebook has made available, researchers have been able to provide detailed updates to voters.\n\nAll of this transparency has revealed that most of the misinformation on Facebook in this election has come not from foreign actors abusing the platform but from the campaigns and their surrogates. That\u2019s the sad truth underlying election manipulation in this campaign.\n\nTo quote the great philosopher Pogo, we have met the enemy and it is not Facebook; it is us.\n\nA brief scan of the official Liberal and Conservative Twitter feeds is enough to depress the most hardened among us.\n\nAs The Verge reporter Casey Newton wrote last week, \u201cPeople seem to be holding Facebook responsible for politicians\u2019 lies when we could be holding the politicians responsible instead.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not letting Facebook off the hook. It took market and regulatory pressure to force the company to work on a problem that it had long ignored. But its sincerity isn\u2019t really relevant if what it\u2019s doing appears to be working.\n\nWhen a politician starts a campaign with low expectations and exceeds them, they\u2019re declared a winner. On that premise, Facebook can take a victory lap.", "description": "The Canadian election has been largely free of foreign influence\u2014and we should thank Mark Zuckerberg", "authors": ["David Skok", "Ceo", "Editor-In-Chief Of The Logic."], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Voting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
