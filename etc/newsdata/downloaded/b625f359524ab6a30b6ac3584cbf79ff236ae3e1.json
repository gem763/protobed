The system under scrutiny was designed to prevent stalls by keeping the plane from ascending at too steep an angle, and authorities have found evidence that it disrupted takeoff before both crashes because of erroneous sensor data.\n\n\"Boeing is a great company with a commitment to safety I have seen firsthand working side-by-side with many thousands of tremendously talented and dedicated employees,\" McAllister said in a statement. \"It has been an honor to serve with such a professional team for the past three years.\"\n\nBoeing shares rose more than 2 percent in trading Tuesday.\n\nMcAllister's departure isn't the first time a commercial airlines chief has left during a period of turmoil for one of the planemaker's signature products. In 2009, Scott Carson relinquished the post after years of delays in development of the composite plastic 787 Dreamliner, which made its first flight at the end of that year. The twin-aisle jet was delivered to its first customer in 2011, three years behind schedule. Carson was succeeded by Jim Albaugh, who previously headed the defense business.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "As chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, McAllister oversaw the company\u2019s efforts to return the 737 Max to service.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Kevin-McAllister-GettyImages-1150364711.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
