And it reflects what is a clear decision by the White House \u2013 obstruct, deny, stonewall,\u201d Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said in an interview. \u201cI think it would be a basis for proceeding but that doesn\u2019t answer the question: Is it the time to proceed. Is the public there?\u201d\n\nSenior Democratic aides insisted lawmakers are still \u201cfinding the facts\u201d and not seriously talking about writing specific articles of impeachment at this time, in part because Democrats are continuing to gather evidence against Trump. But Democrats readily agree that Trump\u2019s blanket stonewalling of their investigations has veered into impeachable territory.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of evidence that is just staring us in the face,\u201d said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees who has argued since April that Democrats have enough evidence to impeach Trump.\n\nTrump has overseen efforts to defy House subpoenas for documents and testimony related to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Trump\u2019s Treasury Department has refused to turn over his tax returns, despite a law permitting some lawmakers to obtain them. And Trump has helped scuttle other committees\u2019 investigations of his alleged campaign finance violations, offers of pardons to immigration officials, administration officials\u2019 use of private email for government business and political interference in the U.S. census.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/0d/b3/08dda1db44dc8b035fc7a44ad869/impeachment-evolution2.png\"\n\nAnd just this week, Trump blocked a key witness in the House\u2019s expanding investigation into Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThis total obstruction is a stand-alone basis for impeachment,\u201d said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) on Twitter. \u201cThe House should proceed as soon as possible to impeach this lawless president and wannabe authoritarian.\u201d\n\nIn the White House letter, Cipollone took potshots at top Democrats running the impeachment probe and blasted them over the House procedures.\n\n\u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\u201c Cipollone wrote.\n\nIn response, Pelosi sent her strongest signal yet that she views Trump\u2019s resistance as an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nBut many top Democrats are also wary of building their entire case for impeachment around obstruction of Congress. Rather, they\u2019d prefer it to be the secondary issue in a larger set of articles that focus on alleged abuse of power by Trump, primarily by pressing Ukraine to probe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe still have to stay very focused and talk to fact witnesses who just seem to be lining up,\u201d Demings cautioned. \u201cWe have to continue to do a very methodical, a very thorough and complete investigation.\u201d\n\nIt was Trump\u2019s conduct toward Ukraine that united the Democratic Caucus behind formal impeachment proceedings and the issue that drew Pelosi \u2014 and an increasing share of voters across the country \u2014 to support taking that step.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

They\u2019ve already received documents and testimony from a central witness in the episode, former Ambassador Kurt Volker, and they\u2019ve obtained a whistleblower\u2019s complaint on the matter that was deemed by an intelligence community watchdog as \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats are confident that other information on Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine will reach Congress even if Trump attempts to thwart it.\n\nObstruction, on the other hand, is more complicated to explain \u2014 and Trump has spent months fending off allegations that he attempted to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s probe of his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nYet indications that the House is coalescing around an obstruction of Congress charge against Trump abound. The House\u2019s top lawyer, Doug Letter, told a federal judge Tuesday that an obstruction article is under serious consideration. And after the White House released its letter this week, other members of Pelosi\u2019s leadership team ramped up their attacks on Trump for flouting their subpoenas and information requests.\n\n\u201cThis President is not above the law,\u201d tweeted the House\u2019s No. 3 Democrat, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. \u201cHis refusal to comply with House subpoenas in our impeachment inquiry is another unlawful attempt to hide the facts.\u201d\n\nRep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said in an interview that Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate is fueling multiple potential obstruction charges.\n\n\u201cIf they keep stonewalling,\u201d Yarmuth said, \u201cthe committee\u2019s going to say we\u2019ve got enough for another obstruction case.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris and Andrew Desiderio contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/01/ff/e44a20cb48b6885ed462989b3580/191008-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
