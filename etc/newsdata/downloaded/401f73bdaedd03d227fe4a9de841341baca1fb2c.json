At that point, we felt we had to move forward,\" he told Smith.\n\nHe argued that Republicans undertook a \"very careful process\" with Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., acting as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, following rules and involving their Democratic counterparts.\n\n\"Thirty-seven Democrats voted to initiate the process of impeachment because they'd been convinced there was a serious problem and that the Starr Report represented some pretty serious charges,\" Gingrich said.\n\nTRUMP SEEKS TO TURN TABLES ON BIDEN AMID IMPEACHMENT PROBE\n\n\"So, Pelosi rushes out knowing better,\" he added. \"She rushes out, announces, 'We're moving forward on impeachment.' They have not yet met with the whistleblower. They have not yet received the transcript of the phone call. Nothing had changed except the sheer pressure of her left. And she couldn't get away from it!\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nGingrich concluded that Pelosi's announcement gave House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff the leeway to put \"two paragraphs in Trump's mouth that Trump never said that Schiff himself admits he wrote and is a total lie\" in regards to the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"And that sort of captures this whole process. That's where we are right now. This is not an impeachment; this is a coup d'etat,\" Gingrich said.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats' impeachment push is no more than a legislative \"coup d'etat,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/newt-gingrich-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
