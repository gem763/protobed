The world\u2019s second-biggest economy appears to be keeping its powder dry, at least for now.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOptimists took heart from the Chinese commerce ministry saying it is opposed to escalating the dispute and wants to resolve it. The word \u201ccalm\u201d was used, and couldn\u2019t we all use some of that right now.\n\nThis boosted hopes among investors that more talks \u2013 which Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said are expected to continue without saying when in an interview with Bloomberg \u2013 could finally lead to a resolution.\n\nReasons to be cheerful then? This is thin stuff.\n\nThe US market is still off by 2 per cent on the month, weighed down by concerns about the domestic economy, with recession warning lights starting to flash red. Against that backdrop, there was a sense of Wall Street casting around for something to cheer itself up at the end of a grim month.\n\nEarlier in the week Trump had said China \u201cwants a deal\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s me getting in the way\u201d. Sit down before you read this, but that was the President being completely honest.\n\nThe chance of him getting out of the way and a deal actually happening rests entirely upon his political calculus going into the forthcoming US election.\n\nHis polling numbers are currently bad. The strength the US economy has shown under him serves as his long suit with voters outside the nativist crowd that laps up his anti-immigration rhetoric and fist-waving.\n\nA deal would surely boost the economy, lifting sentiment and spurring the Dow to claw back more losses, which he would claim credit for as he has before.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
