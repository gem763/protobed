But the administration accelerated its plans to single out California after the state struck an agreement with Ford and three other car makers to continue to lower their vehicles' emissions, even if the federal rules are frozen. California's deal with the automakers recently drew a stern rebuke from EPA and the Transportation Department as well as an anti-trust investigation from the Justice Department.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom blasted the Trump administration for undermining its efforts to cut pollution and fight climate change.\n\n\u201cThe president could learn from California,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"Instead, reports today suggest that his administration will act on a political vendetta by announcing they intend to end aspects of our clean car waiver.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra vowed to fight any attack on the state's authority in court, while Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) said she is \"exploring all options, including legislation, to block the EPA\u2019s rule.\"\n\n\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

If California successfully defends its right to the waiver in court, automakers could be forced to reckon with two sets of standards \u2014 one for California and more than a dozen other states that choose to follow it, and a weaker one for the states that follow the federal rules expected to be finished in the coming months.\n\nEPA did not comment on the expected withdrawal.\n\nBut Administrator Andrew Wheeler previewed the withdrawal during a gathering of the National Automobile Dealers Association on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn the very near future, the Trump administration will begin taking the steps necessary to establish one set of national fuel-economy standards,\u201d Wheeler said, according to prepared remarks distributed by EPA.\n\nWheeler and California officials had sought to strike a compromise earlier this year to maintain a national standard on any new vehicle rules, but those talks collapsed in acrimony, with each side accusing the other of failing to seriously seek a solution.\n\n\u201cWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nConservative groups quickly cheered the upcoming waiver withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration deserves a lot of credit for correcting this constitutional and legal monstrosity,\u201d said Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \u201cNo state, not even California, has a right to set national fuel economy standards for all the other states.\u201d\n\nBut Janet McCabe, an Obama-era EPA air chief, told POLITICO that the withdrawal of California\u2019s waiver would be \u201cunfortunate\u201d and would again set back policies critical for addressing greenhouse gases.\n\nClimate change \u201cis a \u2018y\u2019all come\u2019 situation, where we need all the reasonable programs that we can get in place,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is one of the most reasonable and impactful across the board.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp said his group would fight the Trump EPA's move in court.\n\n\u201cThe unlawful approach the Trump administration is reportedly planning seeks to block states from choosing clean car standards that protect millions of people from tailpipe pollution,\u201d Krupp said.\n\nOther states have levied challenges to Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda, especially New York, and environmentalists and public health advocates regularly join those fights. But California holds a special place when it comes to the environment, as well as drawing the president\u2019s ire.\n\nThe Clean Air Act gives California unique powers to enforce stronger pollution standards than the federal level. But that power is contingent on EPA's waiver, which is what the agency plans to revoke on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition, the District of Columbia and 13 states have adopted California's stricter greenhouse gas rules: Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine. Together those states make up 36 percent of U.S. auto sales, and only one \u2014 Pennsylvania \u2014 supported Trump in 2016.\n\nThe Trump administration now argues that California\u2019s ability to set more stringent requirements applies only to pollutants like nitrogen oxides that can be controlled through technologies such as catalytic converters.\n\nConversely, controlling carbon dioxide emissions is primarily achieved via fuel efficiency increases. But that tramples on the 1975 law that created the DOT\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, program, according to the legal argument made by the Trump administration. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act says states \"may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards.\"\n\nCalifornia\u2019s greenhouse gas standards closely resemble the fuel economy standards, so they are prohibited, the Trump administration argues.\n\nBut two federal judges rejected similar arguments on EPCA preemption in 2007. Appeals in those cases were dropped as part of the Obama administration\u2019s negotiations with automakers to set one national standard, and the Trump administration says those opinions are not controlling and rely on out-of-date information.\n\nWheeler on Tuesday said that the greenhouse gas rollback would not affect other California efforts to limit vehicle emissions unrelated to climate change.\n\n\u201cCalifornia will be able to keep in place and enforce programs to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles,\u201d he said in his prepared remarks to the auto dealers group.\n\n", "description": "The Clean Air Act gives California special authority to set more stringent pollution standards than the federal level, but only if EPA grants a waiver.", "authors": ["Alex Guill\u00e9n"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/97/831dbf5341a0aee88d7af8041e0f/190917-andrew-wheeler-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
