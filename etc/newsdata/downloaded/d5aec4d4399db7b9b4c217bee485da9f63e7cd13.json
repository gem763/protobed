There are ambiguities. This idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re politically woke, and all that stuff \u2014 you should get over that quickly.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s the message former President Barack Obama delivered to a the crowd at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago on Tuesday, where No. 44 was joined by his wife Michelle, filmmaker Ava DuVernay and actor Billy Porter.\n\nObama also took a shot at how Twitter TWTR, +0.03%, one of the current president\u2019s chosen means of communication, is worsening the dialogue and not providing much-needed change.\n\n\u201cLike if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself because: \u2018Man, did you see how woke I was?
