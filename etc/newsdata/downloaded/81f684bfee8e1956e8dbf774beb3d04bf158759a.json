Photo: PA\n\nThe retailer Next (NXT.L) has said it will save \u00a325m in the first year of a no-deal Brexit, and will cut prices by around 2% in the UK.\n\nThe company\u2019s pro-Brexit chief executive Lord Wolfson said it would pass on the benefits of lower taxes on many imports to consumers.\n\nLord Wolfson said prices would be likely to drop in January if Britain left without a deal in October, but said he still hoped the government would strike an agreement.\n\nBut the retailer says there is a high risk of queues and delays at UK and EU ports because of increased customs procedures.\n\nREAD MORE: Property sales fall as \u2018never-ending Brexit saga\u2019 hits market\n\nThe analysis is set out in a \u2018Brexit preparation and impact analysis\u2019 published by Next on Thursday alongside its half-year results, which showed a 2.7% rise in profits to \u00a3316.9m.\n\nNext shares slumped by 3.9% as it warned autumn trading was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because of warmer weather, warning of a weaker third quarter.\n\nOnline sales growth of 12.6% in the six months to July offset a 4.6% decline on the high street.\n\nHow a no-deal Brexit could save Next money\n\nNext said it \u201cwelcomes the new temporary tariff regime which brings certainty and a significant reduction in duty on clothing.\u201d\n\nThe high street brand said the government\u2019s plans to axe tariffs on 87% of UK imports for up to 12 months would mean significant savings overall.\n\nBritain currently enjoys tariff-free trade with the EU, but certain goods imported from many other parts of the world face significant taxes.\n\nThe government\u2019s tariff plans announced under Theresa May would see new duties charged on some EU goods, but lower taxes on certain goods from much of the rest of the world.\n\nREAD MORE: JD Sports\u2019 takeover of Footasylum \u2018could be bad for shoppers\u2019\n\nThe fashion and home furnishings firm says it stands to benefit overall as it imports far more of its clothing products from outside the EU than from inside the bloc.\n\nThe retailer would see its taxes plummet from \u00a335m to \u00a313m on around a quarter of Next\u2019s products which are imported from countries Britain has no trade deal with.\n\nDuties would also drop from \u00a322m to \u00a312m from a group of developing nations that includes Cambodia, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. THese countries currently make up 57% of Next\u2019s stock.\n\nThe retailer would be forced to pay \u00a36m a year more in duties on imports from the EU, but said this was \u201cmore than offset by the overall duty saving.\u201d\n\nWhat Next fears about a no-deal Brexit\n\nChecks are carried out at in Calais.
