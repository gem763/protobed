Mail service, among other roles.\n\nAccording to court documents, Ruiz used the access to Yahoo!'s internal network that his job provided to crack users' passwords and gain access to their email accounts.\n\nIn total, he accessed about 6,000 accounts, most belonging to younger women, including personal friends and work colleagues.\n\nOnce in, he searched and downloaded images and videos, which he stored at home on a hard drive.\n\nRuiz also used access to the hacked Yahoo! email inboxes to compromise accounts at services like Apple iCloud, Facebook, Gmail, DropBox, and others, where the victims used the Yahoo! email address to register accounts.\n\nHe did this by requesting password resets on the third-party sites, which he received inside the victim's Yahoo! inboxes. Ruiz then continued his search of personal images and videos on these new accounts.\n\nUS investigators said Ruiz destroyed his home hard drive, where he was storing all the images and videos he downloaded, after Yahoo! noticed suspicious activity on some of the hacked accounts.\n\nRuiz actions were eventually discovered and reported to US law enforcement. The former engineer was formally charged in April 2019.\n\nHe pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of computer intrusion, under which he faces a maximum prison sentence of five years and a fine of up to $250,000. Ruiz's sentencing is scheduled for February 3, 2020. The former engineer has been released under a $200,000 bond.\n\nRuiz stopped working at Yahoo! in July 2018. He's currently employed at a Silicon Valley tech company specialized in SSO (single sign-on) solutions.", "description": "Former Yahoo engineer accessed about 6,000 email accounts, primarily belonging to young women.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/14/ed6b0a7f-c028-4774-8d06-9b77b855b806/thumbnail/770x578/5740140b7ee74e51d4029f0257f02953/yahoo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
