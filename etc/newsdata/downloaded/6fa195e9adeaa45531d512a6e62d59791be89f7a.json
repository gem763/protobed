He\u2019s right, of course, but which nation is? I\u2019d like to pay a visit.\n\nAlso true: Angels don\u2019t make great soldiers. And the Kurds, with American training, assistance, advice and combat air support, were enlisted to fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, a barbaric enemy of Americans, Kurds and other civilized nations.\n\nThis partnership stripped the self-declared caliphate of the territories it had conquered, in the process eliminating thousands of terrorists, mass murders, serial rapists and slave raiders.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) sustained more than 11,000 causalities. Eight American lives also have been lost since 2015 \u2014 each one a tragedy. Militarily, however, this has been an extraordinary achievement, a sustainable model for low-intensity, protracted conflicts.\n\nYou know what happened next \u2014 more or less. The dominant media narrative has been that President Trump, in a phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, \u201cgreen-lighted\u201d a Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria aimed at driving out the Kurds.\n\nOthers have suggested that Mr. Erdogan didn\u2019t ask for permission, but merely warned Mr. Trump to get out of the way. \u201cTurkey notified us of an imminent military operation,\u201d Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said at a press conference last week.\n\nWhat should have been Mr. Trump\u2019s response? How about: \u201cTayyip, my dear friend, our Kurdish partners have done you no harm. We wouldn\u2019t allow that! Nevertheless, you\u2019ve said you want a \u2018safe zone\u2019 on your border, and you will have one. Most important: I know you value our alliance and would never endanger American forces. Come visit me at the White House. Together, we\u2019ll work everything out!\u201d\n\nInstead, I fear, Mr. Trump said nothing much \u2014 as Mr. Erdogan anticipated. Aware how anxious the American president was to withdraw the small contingent of special operators remaining in northeastern Syria, how likely was it that he\u2019d incur any risk at all to keep them there?\n\nTurkish forces soon initiated hostilities against the now-abandoned and outgunned Kurds. A few days later, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed off to Turkey in an attempt to staunch the bleeding \u2014 literal and figurative.\n\nOur adversaries \u2014 not least those in North Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia and China \u2014 will have taken note. Expect unpleasant repercussions.\n\nAs for America\u2019s allies and those we might like to include in that category, they now doubt our reliability. That harms our interests. But America is a creedal nation which implies we have values, too. Not betraying comrades-in-arms \u2014 I think that\u2019s among them.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s only fair to recall that Mr. Trump was saddled with this situation thanks to the weakness, vacillation and bad judgment of the previous administration.\n\nThe Islamic State arose following President Obama\u2019s premature withdrawal of American forces from Iraq in 2011. At first, Mr. Obama dismissed these self-proclaimed jihadis as a \u201cJV team.\u201d That they were al Qaeda 2.0 soon became obvious.\n\nBelatedly and somewhat desperately, Mr. Obama decided to utilize Syrian Kurds to battle the Islamic State. There was no one else \u2014 certainly not Mr. Erdogan \u2014 who could be trusted to get the job done.\n\nBut it was a solution pregnant with problems because many of those Kurds were members of a group (the YPG) linked to a far-left Kurdish group in Turkey (the PKK) designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\nThat\u2019s probably what Mr. Trump had in mind when he said the Kurds are not angels. But the Kurds, like Americans, are diverse, a term which, properly understood, implies more than colorful clothes and adventurous cuisine.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire and caliphate collapsed after World War I, the lands on which the Kurds have lived for a millennium were divided among Turkey (where Kurds comprise roughly 20 percent of the population), Iraq (where they were targets of genocide under Saddam Hussein but now enjoy substantial autonomy), Iran (where they are sorely oppressed) and Syria.\n\nToday, the 30 million Kurds in the Middle East comprise the world\u2019s largest nation without a state of its own. I\u2019m convinced that most Kurds have no higher priority than to preserve their unique culture, speak their own language (they actually have more than one) and live free from foreign oppression.\n\nI\u2019m going to leave you with a story that may help convince you, too. A few years ago, while traveling in Iraqi Kurdistan, I was invited to dine with Hero Talabani, matriarch of a distinguished Kurdish family and a renowned Kurdish patriot. At the end of a sumptuous meal, I posed an impertinent question.\n\nI observed that Saladin, the great 12th century Muslim conqueror, has been memorialized throughout much of the Middle East. But Saladin was not an Arab or Turk. He was a Kurd. So why, I asked, was he not regarded as a great hero here?\n\nMrs. Talabani squinted at the floor and took several puffs on a cigarette before responding: \u201cKleeford, please tell me. Saladin: What did he do for the Kurds?\u201d\n\nAmong the many Muslim nations in the world, Americans have had no better friends than the Kurds. Like us, they have an aversion to empire builders, not least those who claim to be waging jihad against disbelievers, heretics and apostates.\n\n\u201cAmerica first should not mean America alone,\u201d Donald Trump has said. Yet today America is lonelier than it was a few days ago. That\u2019s due to an error the president made, one he should assiduously attempt to mitigate.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
