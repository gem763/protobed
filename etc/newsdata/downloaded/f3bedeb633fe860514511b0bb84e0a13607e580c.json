Japan\u2019s wins over Ireland and Scotland in Pool A went against pre-tournament predictions and saw the hosts emerge atop their pool, forcing second-place Ireland into a quarterfinal against Pool C winner New Zealand.\n\nIf there is an outside influence on the match it is the fact New Zealand\u2019s last scheduled pool match against Italy on Saturday was canceled because of Typhoon Hagibis, meaning they will go into the knockout round without a match since Oct. 6 when they beat Namibia 71-9 in a muddling performance.\n\nIreland go into the quarterfinal on the back of a much more emphatic 45-7 win over Samoa on Saturday, achieved with only 14 men. That gives Ireland the better preparation, leaving New Zealand to do the bulk of its lead-up work on the training field.\n\nThe match is one of two - the other is between Japan and South Africa - which will involve an evident contrast in styles.\n\nNew Zealand and Japan will both attempt to play an adventurous style, while Ireland and South Africa will attempt to slow down the game.\n\nThat may be an over-simplification but the evidence of the tournament to date is that Ireland may rely strongly on a pick-and-go style, on box kicking and on a swift defensive line.\n\nThe All Blacks showed a new ability to outflank rush defense in their pool win over South Africa but haven\u2019t been able to build on that in group matches against weaker opponents. New Zealand\u2019s high-tempo style often takes several matches each season to develop both in timing and accuracy. Their almost two-week layoff threatens a return of the rustiness they showed at the start of this season.\n\nAt the same time Ireland does not appear to be as strong as they were last year when it won 11 or 12 tests, beat the All Blacks, won the Six Nations title and was named World Rugby Team of the Year. It\u2019s tactical focus has narrowed and it has become more forward-oriented and one-dimensional.\n\nBecause both teams and coaches know each other well, there are likely to be subtle changes in tactics and systems on Saturday.\n\n\u201cRugby evolves quickly and the game moves on, stuff changes, systems change,\u201d Ireland prop Tadhg Furlong said. \u201cI suppose it gives us confidence that we have had results in the past but at the same time it doesn\u2019t guarantee anything.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to rock up and play with the same plan as before. (The All Blacks) are so dangerous, you can\u2019t switch off.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks captain Kieran Read said his team had not been adversely affected by their longer than expected break before the quarterfinals. Their systems are strongly bedded in, their fitness is beyond question and they had used their down time productively.\n\n\u201cFinal games are mental, as well as physical,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eight teams left are capable of winning the competition, physically and probably mentally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about who can step up to the pressure moment.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup ,and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The quarterfinal meeting between Ireland and New Zealand at the Rugby World Cup comes with a strong feeling of reckoning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
