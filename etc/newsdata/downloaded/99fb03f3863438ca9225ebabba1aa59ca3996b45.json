Dan Kildee. trade USMCA frustrations grow among House Democrats excluded from Trump talks\n\nTensions are rising in the House Democratic caucus as a number of members say they feel they are being kept in the dark while nine of their colleagues negotiate changes to the new North American trade pact with the Trump administration.\n\nMembers of the working group House Speaker Nancy Pelosi selected to secure changes to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement say they have begun to make progress in talks with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade chief. But because much of the information is privileged, and because both sides signed agreements pledging not to reveal details, there\u2019s little they say they can share with Democrats who were not chosen for the nine-member team.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s begun to frustrate some House Democrats who are outside the process and want to offer input, especially members of the Ways and Means Committee's trade panel. Some members are unsure how they would vote on the deal and, as pressure is mounting for them to hold a vote as soon as possible, they're having a particularly hard time knowing what to say when discussing the USMCA publicly.\n\nRising tensions boiled over at a meeting of Ways and Means Democrats this week, where some lawmakers pressed committee leaders and staff for more information but were repeatedly shut down, six people present at the meeting told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cObviously, for the folks who are not in the working group, there\u2019s a frustration not being in the room,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who sits on the trade subcommittee but not on the negotiating team.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Lighthizer has held dozens of meetings with all factions of the Democratic caucus to hear their concerns about the pact.\n\nBut in recent months, he has solely focused on negotiations with the working group, as he tries to find a way to move toward an agreement that Pelosi would put up for a vote.\n\nIt was Lighthizer's biggest move to date in the talks \u2014 and the most tangible sign of progress \u2014 that provided the latest source of irritation for the Democrats who feel like they are being left out of the process.\n\nLighthizer last week sent proposals to lawmakers detailing how the Trump administration would make changes to the USMCA to address Democrats' prevailing concerns on enforcement, labor and environmental standards and drug pricing provisions. Democrats had demanded a formal response from the administration for weeks.\n\nBut four Democrats on the trade subcommittee told POLITICO they have not seen the specifics of Lighthizer\u2019s counteroffer.\n\n\u201cThere are members on the committee, especially on the trade subcommittee, that take this job very serious. And in order to take it serious, you have to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), a Ways and Means trade subcommittee member who\u2019s not in the working group. \u201cSo I think there needs to be more of an appreciation for those types of members, including myself, that we want to be able to know things about the deal within certain confidentiality aspects of it.\u201d\n\nWays and Means members used Wednesday\u2019s meeting to \u201censure that we\u2019re able to do our job by getting the information \u2014 in the appropriate venue, with the appropriate security precautions that we have to take \u2014 and just to let leadership know that we\u2019re here to work, not just to follow,\u201d Panetta said.\n\nWays and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who also leads the USMCA working group, said when asked about the concerns within the caucus that he has tried to share as much information as possible with lawmakers, but certain materials exchanged with USTR are \"privileged information.\"\n\n\u201cPart of this you have to be careful with because it is privileged information, according to the law, but I don\u2019t see any reason why \u2014 and I\u2019ve encouraged the Ways and Means trade staff to brief the members of the subcommittee,\u201d Neal told POLITICO.\n\nOther Democrats said they understand why the negotiations are being handled the way they are. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), another member of the Ways and Means trade panel who is not one of the USMCA nine, said it was \u201ccompletely forgivable\u201d that trade subcommittee members have not been in the loop, as Pelosi opted to create a working group that included lawmakers from across the Democratic spectrum.\n\n\u201cIf Nancy wants to get to, say, a majority of the Democratic caucus members to move for it [USMCA ratification], it was really important they be part of the discussion,\u201d Beyer said. He noted how Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) \u2014 two members of the working group who have been against free trade deals in the past \u2014 were included in the negotiations.\n\nBeyer acknowledged the meeting got tense, but added: \u201cIn general, it\u2019s a family. We get through it.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris and Aaron Lorenzo contributed to this report.\n\nThis article tagged under: Trade", "description": "Some Democratic lawmakers who are not part of the USMCA negotiating committee feel in the dark about how talks with the administration are progressing.", "authors": ["Sabrina Rodriguez", "Megan Cassella"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9f/b5/637c1d6a41ccbd038fab7e7fc506/190920-dan-kildee-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
