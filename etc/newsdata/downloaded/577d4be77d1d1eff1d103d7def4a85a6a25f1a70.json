Last December, the Monterey Bay Aquarium eloquently noted that Apple\u2019s squid emoji has a \u201csiphon\u201d on the front \u2014 but apparently, the siphon is actually supposed to appear on the back of the squid:\n\n\uff0f\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uff3c \uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\n\n| \u30fc __ | Not even squidding\n\n| \u25c9 \u25c9 | the siphon should\n\n\\ \u25b1 /\u2220 be behind the head\n\n\uff3c | rn it just looks like\n\n\uff0f \uff3c a weirdo nose:\n\n/ | \uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\uffe3\n\npic.twitter.com/4RdkSIKurM \u2014 Monterey Bay Aquarium (@MontereyAq) December 5, 2018\n\nA squid\u2019s siphon helps it move, breathe, and discharge waste, so having the siphon in back makes more sense than having it in front. Now, the poor squid emoji will look like it should, without a siphon on its front:\n\nAnother important change? The mosquito, which apparently only had five legs, gains a sixth. I hate mosquitos as much as the next person, but no mosquito deserves to be missing a leg.\n\nAnd, also importantly, the abacus is now historically accurate \u2014 previously, it was drawn in a way that apparently wasn\u2019t accurate to any abacus ever used, as diligently reported by my colleague Chaim Gartenberg:\n\nOther changes are smaller, such as the octopus now having suckers on its front two tentacles, the jigsaw piece changing colors from blue to green, and a new look for the hearts in the emoji with hearts for eyes.\n\niOS 13.1 does not include the 230 new emoji coming as part of Emoji 12.0 \u2014 Apple previewed its designs for those emoji in July, but they haven\u2019t made their way to Apple devices yet. Apple says to expect them \u201cthis fall.\u201d (Full disclosure: I submitted the proposals to the Unicode Consortium to recommend making the yawning face and waffle emoji that are coming in Emoji 12.0, but I was not involved in their implementation or final designs for any platform.)", "description": "Today\u2019s release of iOS 13.1 doesn\u2019t just add new features like a new AirDrop interface and AirPods sharing \u2014 it also brings updates to 24 of Apple\u2019s emoji, according to Emojipedia, including changes to make a few of the animals anatomically accurate.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ooSkrXW9FDhY2sP3SpuNSo7sFFk=/34x0:792x397/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19229252/13.1_emoji_2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
