If she\u2019s going to get through this without losing her mind \u2014 as her grandmother Geraldine allegedly failed to do \u2014 she needs to figure out how to control it.\n\nFortunately, Alma has a guide \u2014 a weird, shady, possibly untrustworthy guide who happens to be her dead dad, but a guide nonetheless. Jacob spends much of the episode playing the Yoda to Alma\u2019s Luke Skywalker, guiding her into a measure of control over her time-jumping. He even gives Alma the psychic equivalent of a lightsaber: An electronic handheld blackjack game, which Jacob says is \u201ccomplex enough to keep you focused but simple enough not to overwhelm you.\u201d (If you\u2019ve ever half-watched a TV show while playing Words with Friends or Candy Crush, you know exactly how this would work.)\n\nAlma spends the rest of the episode wandering through life while tapping away at her little blackjack game, annoying Becca at her wedding dress fitting and raising yet another red flag with her boss at the daycare center. But the trick works: When Alma gets lost, focusing on the blackjack game brings her right back. Along the way, we also get the sense of how Alma\u2019s power could be both terrifying and deeply useful when \u2014 after several, possibly prophetic visions of her student Oliver drowning \u2014 she corners Oliver\u2019s mother and makes her promise to sign the boy up for swimming lessons.\n\nBut as the rest of Alma\u2019s current-day life passes uneasily, her relationship with her mysterious father is coming into sharper focus. Jacob was a theoretical physicist, and he had just secured funding for research on something related to time travel and quantum entanglement. We don\u2019t have all the details yet \u2014 and who knows if we can trust him? \u2014 but Jacob, at the very least, believes that someone wanted him dead before his research went any further.\n\nAll of this exposition might be a little dry or suffocating if not for Undone\u2019s expertly realized animation. One particularly inventive, harrowing sequence finds Alma and Jacob teleported into a toy car frozen in midair, in a funhouse-mirror version of the actual crash that led to Jacob\u2019s death. And as Jacob continues to pressure Alma to dig into his own past, she begins to lose her grip on her present-day reality \u2014 even missing several entire days because he forces her forward toward the next clue.\n\nThe most revealing scene takes Alma far into the past, back when Jacob was alive, to his classroom at San Antonio University. There, Jacob delivers a dense lecture on theoretical physics to a class that includes a particularly devoted student named Farnaz. Alma soon discovers that Farnaz also died in the car accident that claimed Jacob\u2019s life. Jacob dodges the question, and Alma\u2019s mother denies it outright, but the obvious implication is that Jacob and Farnaz were having an affair.\n\nBut whether or not we ever get a clear answer on the nature of Jacob and Farnaz\u2019s relationship, there are plenty of mysteries left to be solved about both Jacob\u2019s life and Jacob\u2019s death. By the end of the episode, Alma has swiped a roomful of cardboard boxes from her mother\u2019s attic, poring over the documents late into the night. And when Sam comes in and gently suggests that she get some sleep, Alma removes her cochlear implant \u2014 literally drowning out the rest of the world as she tunnels, ever deeper and obsessively, into the mystery her dead father has demanded she solve. Hopefully she can keep her feet planted on the ground in the present as well.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 We didn\u2019t have enough context to understand it at the time, but Farnaz is the person who frantically called Jacob when he was trick-or-treating with Alma, leaving him to hastily abandon Alma on the sidewalk on the night of his death. It\u2019s also worth noting that, at the time, Jacob specifically told Farnaz not to call 911 \u2014 so whatever happened, it was something pretty bad.\n\n\u2022 Alma has done some pretty selfish things so far, but Jacob orders that her \u201ccore\u201d is actually selflessness, recounting a memory of when she repeatedly got in trouble for \u201cforgetting\u201d her gym clothes because she was giving them to a bullied girl who kept wetting her pants.\n\n\u2022 Alma\u2019s fear that everyone, including Sam, is deliberately messing with her might seem like a side effect of her accident. But it\u2019s worth noting that she said something similar to Becca before the car crash in the series premiere: \u201c\u201dDo you ever feel like you\u2019re in a play, except you\u2019re the only one who knows you\u2019re in a play?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Alma talking about her dad in the present tense is understandable; after all, she spent much of the episode talking to him. But I wonder if it\u2019s also a sign that Alma, in all her time-jumping, is losing her grip on what \u201cthe present\u201d even is.\n\n\u2022 According to the newspaper Alma finds in the attic, Jacob\u2019s crashed car was spotted by \u201ca local cheesemonger\u201d named Al Calabrese.\n\n\u2022 Another ominous newspaper headline under the story about Jacob\u2019s death: \u201cSCIENTISTS CLAIM ENVIRONMENT WILL COLLAPSE BY 2030\u2014OTHERS SCOFF.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jacob says one of the blocks represents Julia Roberts, who happened to top-line Homecoming, a similarly pitched Amazon genre hit from last year.\n\n\u2022 The back of the cereal box in Alma\u2019s apartment bears a message that feels particularly resonant to Alma\u2019s journey: \u201cSOLVE THE MAZE.\u201d", "description": "While Alma\u2019s current-day life passes uneasily, her relationship with her mysterious father is coming into sharper focus.
