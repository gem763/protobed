He is probably in better condition that he was last week at this stage. Immeasurably better.\n\n\u2018Owen is a bit sore but he will be fine. We have got a few others carrying bumps and bruises because it was a tough old game.\u2019\n\nOn Heinz\u2019s injury, Jones added: \u2018It\u2019s tough for Willi, he\u2019s been a great contributor, a very well-liked member of the squad and he was in tears in the dressing room.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s tough for him but he\u2019s now collected himself, he now knows he\u2019s got another role to play for us and he\u2019ll fulfil that role really well this week.\n\n\u2018Ben has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He is a fit guy and just fits in quite readily. We always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready, and he is ready to go.\n\nSpencer has been called up in place of Heinz (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018We needed to make the decision fairly quickly so we decided to call on Ben, and it is just a great opportunity ahead of him.\n\n\u2018He has come into the squad and has got to learn a few new things.\n\n\u2018Willi will help him and Ben [Youngs] will help him with that too. The task ahead of him is no different to any other player.\n\n\u2018He has just got to learn a little bit more in the early part of the week and get himself physically and mentally ready.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mason Mount resisted father\u2019s push for him to quit Chelsea aged 14", "description": "Eddie Jones faces a nervous wait over Kyle Sinckler's fitness ahead of England's Rugby World Cup final against South Africa.
