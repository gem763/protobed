The time had come to investigate.\n\nJohnson allegedly went to four Subway locations, bought a total of 20 sandwiches (all with jalape\u00f1os, of course), and recorded how many subs had jalape\u00f1o stems on them, as well as how many stems were on each sandwich.\n\nWearing a sky-blue shirt that may actually be scrubs, gloved, and ready to unveil the truth, Johnson gets to work. He goes sub-by-sub, counting jalape\u00f1o stems before removing them with surgical precision. Each stem occurrence gets chalked up on the \"Instances of Bullshit\" board. Johnson started off the video avoiding curse words, but with frustration (and jalape\u00f1o stems) mounting, he mostly abandons any effort of self-censorship.\n\nIn the end, Johnson claimed to have found a total of 50 stems (the math on the board actually adds up to 53), with only one of the 20 sammies being totally stem-free. That's a stem-centage of 95 percent. Not a good ratio if you're somebody who likes a stem-less sub.", "description": "When YouTuber Gus Johnson found one too many jalape\u00f1o stems on his Subway sandwich, he decided to see if a pattern existed in the popular sub chain's jalape\u00f1o quality.In video uploaded Wednesday, Johnson briefs viewers with some background to his problem.\"I've been noticing for quite some", "authors": ["Andy Moser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O8VcNWQDVoscKgrwMchbnw--~B/aD00ODA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/news.mashable/cbfcbf26467777601a0a63f697b0151a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
