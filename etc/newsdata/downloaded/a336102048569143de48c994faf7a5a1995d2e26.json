The selloff trims the year-to-date net inflow to $3.7 billion.\n\nInvestors have been worried that earnings will slump as growth in gross domestic product slows to 5.05%, the weakest in two years. To make matters worse, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Jakarta last week as part of countrywide protests aimed at forcing the government to reconsider legislation rights that groups say will curtail civil liberties.\n\nThe trouble signals a tough path ahead for President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, before he starts his second term next month. He managed to lead with a wider margin during the re-election in April and is expected to name his new cabinet after the Oct. 20 inauguration.\n\n\u201cThe economic slowdown has been caused by a wait-and-see attitude among investors in the lead up to the cabinet formation,\u201d said Harry Su, head of equity capital markets at Samuel International. \u201cContinued demonstrations and skirmishes on the ground are adding to worries and contributed to the biggest net foreign outflow since June 2018.\u201d\n\nSu said he would advise clients to maintain their holdings of defensive stocks and wait for Widodo to decide on his new cabinet.\n\nWidodo also has to deal with new police and military clashes with separatist forces in the province of Papua in which at least 30 people were killed.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is undoubtedly not conducive to investment,\u201d Su said. \u201cI find the degree of flash point emergence to be highly unexpected.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Harry Suhartono in Jakarta at hsuhartono@bloomberg.net;Tassia Sipahutar in Jakarta at ssipahutar@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lianting Tu at ltu4@bloomberg.net, Naoto Hosoda, Kurt Schussler\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Foreign investors pared their holdings of Indonesian stocks as escalating political demonstrations added to worries of a slowdown in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy.Net foreign selling in the equity market reached $1.2 billion in the third quarter, set for the biggest outflow since the", "authors": ["Harry Suhartono", "Tassia Sipahutar"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lZj3iG27BteNwoJ_ClvBcw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/330f6fbba118f5a2b1b1f2bc444e9e4a", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
