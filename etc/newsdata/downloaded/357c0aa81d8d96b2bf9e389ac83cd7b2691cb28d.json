REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump denounced Iran\u2019s \u201cblood lust\u201d and called on other nations to join the United States to pressure Iran after attacks on Saudi oil facilities but said there is a path to peace.\n\n\u201cWe want partners, not adversaries,\u201d Trump said in an address before world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nTrump also had a stern message for China and its president, Xi Jinping, in what was his third annual appearance at the U.N. saying the world is watching how Beijing handles mass demonstrations in Hong Kong that has raised concerns about a potential Chinese crackdown.\n\n\u201cHow China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the word in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attacks in Saudi Arabia have rattled the Middle East and raised concerns about a broader war. Trump has shown restraint in the crisis, holding back from military retaliation, at least for now.\n\n\u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s blood lust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behaviour continues sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe urged Gulf allies to normalize relations with Israel to provide a regional counterweight to Iran.\n\nWith the president looking to improve his standing among Americans as he looks ahead to a tough re-election battle next year, Trump aimed to present a reassuring message to ease voters\u2019 concerns about his tendency toward inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nTehran has been widely blamed for the attacks in Saudi Arabia but it denies involvement. Over the past week, Trump has tightened economic sanctions on Iran and ordered more U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a show of support for those U.S. allies in the tense region.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump denounced Iran's \"blood lust\" and called on other nations to join the United States to pressure Iran after attacks on Saudi oil facilities but said there is a path to peace.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433371934&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1AU", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
