I declined and avoided seeing him one-on-one.\n\nNow I am going through a rocky divorce. He proposed an affair again. I am still not interested. I told him that, and he told me he and his wife have \"an understanding.\"\n\nI was initially just friends with him but did get to know his wife over the past few years, and I really like her. Do I have an obligation to tell her he repeatedly comes on to me? I have no interest in an affair with him and have no problem saying so, but I see them as a couple every six weeks or so in a group. I feel weird catching up with his wife about their new car or most recent vacation while knowing her husband is interested in an affair.\n\n\u2014 I Just Like You as a Friend\n\nI Just Like You as a Friend: In a just world, you\u2019d have an affair with the wife.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nIn this world, I am uncomfortably on the fence about what you tell or don\u2019t tell her about her husband. On the one hand, this guy sounds terrible, and my every impulse is to yell, \u201cShe needs to know how terrible he is!\u201d Because it sure sounds as if he\u2019s lying to you and deceiving his wife. And even if it\u2019s 100 percent true that their marriage is covered by a clear and mutual \u201cunderstanding,\u201d he still went after you when you were in a marriage that for all he knew was a faithful and trusting one, and he\u2019s still not taking your no for an answer. Which of course puts his whole \u201cunderstanding\u201d story under a cloud of suspicion, because in the best-case scenario he\u2019s still crossing lines and still okay with your cheating on your husband.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, their intimate life is not your business. Your business begins and ends at how you conduct your relationships.\n\nSo really the only answer is to keep a polite distance from the husband to the extent possible in your friend group and remain cordial and in unspoken solidarity with the wife.\n\nBleah.\n\nUnless, of course, you can tell him you\u2019d like to talk to his wife about this \u201cunderstanding,\u201d since he\u2019d be okay with that, right? Call it. If it\u2019s not a bluff, then his hitting on other women isn\u2019t a secret and you can keep pleasant company with the wife without that weighing you down.\n\nDear Carolyn: Is there any way to deal with someone who feels that politely excusing yourself from a conversation or social gathering \u2014 because the subject matter makes you uncomfortable, because you're tired, because you need to introvert \u2014 is unspeakably rude? I'm guessing nope?\n\n\u2014 Nope, You Have to Stay!\n\nNope, You Have to Stay!: Depends. The intimacy of the relationship makes a difference to how you manage.\n\nBut in general, my advice is to just do what you need to do \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m heading out. Good night, everyone.\u201d \u2014 and politely rebuff corrections that cross personal boundaries.
