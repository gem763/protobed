REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nSpot gold fell 0.5% to $1,545.00 per ounce as of 0603 GMT, set to snap a three-day gaining streak. Prices touched $1,557 on Wednesday, their highest since April 2013.\n\nU.S. gold futures dropped 0.4% to $1,553.80 per ounce.\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry said its trade team will hold talks with U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for high-level negotiations in early October.\n\nGold has jumped about 23% this year as the bruising trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has sparked fears of a global economic slowdown and encouraged monetary easing by major central banks around the world.\n\nThe news is \u201cdriving everything at the moment\u201d, said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\n\u201cGold will remain under pressure, because trade tensions have been the elephant in the room. Any sign there is a thawing in that situation is going to see a rotation out of gold and into growth-orientated assets.\u201d\n\nAlso encouraging risk sentiment was the withdrawal of an extradition bill that had triggered months of often violent protests in Hong Kong and an easing of Brexit-related uncertainties.\n\nBullion is seen as a safe-haven during times of political and economic uncertainty.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 1.1%. U.S. Treasury yields extended gains in Asia and the yield curve steepened, signs that investors were willing to take on riskier assets.\n\nGold may retrace to $1,524 per ounce, as it failed to break a resistance at $1,546, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nFocus now shifts to the U.S. central bank\u2019s meeting later this month, amid expectations of a 25 basis point interest rate cut according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\n\u201cU.S. services ISM and PMI numbers, the ADP employment report as well as factory and durable goods orders figures are now in focus... firm results might cool Fed rate cut bets and undermine gold\u2019s appeal,\u201d said Ilya Spivak, senior currency strategist with DailyFx, referring to crucial U.S. economic data expected later in the session, often seen as an indicator of economic health.\n\nGold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver eased 1% to $19.39 per ounce, but was near a three-year high of $19.64 it touched in the previous session.\n\nPlatinum dipped 0.4% to $981.00, having touched $997.16 earlier in the session, marking its highest since Feb. 2018. Meanwhile, palladium was up 0.3% to $1,556.76 per ounce.", "description": "Gold prices dropped on Thursday as risk-on sentiment got a boost after China and the United States agreed to hold talks to end their protracted trade dispute.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426439210&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8408G", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
