Rates in Europe just went to a record low, and this is the effect.", "language": "en", "text": "Europe just cut interest rates, and Donald Trump wants the US to follow suit.\n\nOn Thursday Trump took another swipe at the Fed, after earlier saying the Fed should cut rates below zero.\n\nWhile most economists don't think the US would even get close to that, Europe has had negative rates since 2016.\n\nThat's because Mario Draghi, the outgoing ECB president said he would take a \"whatever it takes\" approach to stabilizing Europe. On Thursday, Draghi cut rates a further 10 basis points to a record low of -0.5%, and announced bond buying at a monthly pace of \u20ac20 billion from November 1.\n\n\"The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon,\" the ECB said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nSince its first foray into negative rates, Europe's economy, which relies heavily on the US and China, has slowed.\n\nEurope's economy was dealt another blow earlier on Thursday \u2014 Europe's industrial production in July fell 0.1%, signalling a poor start for the third quarter.\n\nSee more: Trump has ramped up calls for negative interest rates. Here's what they are and why they matter.\n\nWhat have negative rates done to Europe and its banks?\n\nPrior to Draghi taking over the ECB, Europe's economy was stumbling, hence a wave of cuts that eventually turned negative in 2016. Since then, they haven't moved, and Europe's economy has recovered a bit since.\n\nThe euro stabilized and inflation rates are moving towards the target of 2%.\n\nHowever, despite the obvious positive effects of the lower rates, criticism has come from the likes of Deutsche Bank and UBS, as commercial banks are the ones who feel the heat when it comes to negative rates.\n\nCommercial banks in Europe are the main source of lending when it comes to households and small and medium-sized companies, and are therefore vital to the European economy.\n\nBecause \"commercial banks hold their deposits within central banks, if rates are positive they gain from it, but negative rates actually act as a charge\" for the likes of UBS and Deutsche, Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in an interview with Business Insider before the ECB announcement.\n\nThis charge is a \"burden,\" Volker Hofmann at the Association of German Banks said, according to the Financial Times, which cited Hofmann at a conference as saying that lenders pay \u20ac7.5 billion ($8.27 billion) a year in negative rates on the excess deposits they hold at the ECB.\n\n\"It is a remarkable burden for banks who find it more or less impossible to convey this cost to retail savers,\" the Financial Times cited Hofmann as saying.\n\nThe risk is that if rates go too low, then it could hit the \"reversal rate,\" where lenders like UBS and Deutsche then pass the charge on to consumers.\n\nSo far this hasn't happened and banks have shouldered the cost and lending rates have been very positive around 3% to 3.5% according to Allen-Reynolds.\n\nBut Europe's titans of banking are warning that this could change as it's hurting profits.\n\n\"Banks' interest margins are under pressure in this environment and that's not going to change,\" Martin Zielke, head Commerzbank, said at conference according to The Financial Times. \"I don't think it is a particularly sustainable or responsible policy,\" the newspaper cited him as saying.\n\nThe other issue is once rates go below zero there's nowhere to go from there.\n\nThe other problem for the ECB and incoming president Christine Lagarde is that once rates go below zero \"the ECB runs out of ammunition,\" says Allen-Reynolds.\n\n\"When interest rates are so low, there is not much further central banks can go. At that point, you're looking at fiscal policy to provide some stimulus and that's up to individual governments,\" said the economist.\n\nFor Jerome Powell, this isn't really an issue as there a number of cuts before interest rates hit zero, but for Europe monetary policy actually has become quite a weak tool and its something that Lagarde will be focusing upon when she takes over.\n\nLagarde said: \"While I do not believe that the ECB has hit the effective lower bound on policy rates, it is clear that low rates have implications for the banking sector and financial stability more generally,\" according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe FT cited Lagarde as saying that the ECB should \"closely monitor whether adverse side effects may emerge in the future, the longer low interest rates are in place.\"", "description": "The European Central Bank's base rate has been negative since 2016.
