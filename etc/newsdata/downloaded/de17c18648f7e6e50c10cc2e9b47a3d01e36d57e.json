And it made me wonder what it means if I\u2019m a black person that can have a blond-haired, blue-eyed, white-skinned daughter. What does blackness mean? What does whiteness mean, if she can be 20 percent sub-Saharan African? I wrote the book because my belief in the racial fiction kind of fell apart in that hospital room.\u201d\n\nImage Credit\n\nStephen Kinzer visits the podcast this week to discuss his new book, \u201cPoisoner in Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control,\u201d which details a range of mind-control experiments conducted during the Cold War. \u201cI think I stumbled on the most powerful unknown American of the 20th century,\u201d Kinzer says of Gottlieb. \u201cI really have not recovered from what I learned in writing this book. I\u2019m still shaken by it. I\u2019m still trying to come to grips with it. It is the most extreme story I\u2019ve ever come across in the United States.\u201d\n\nAlso on this week\u2019s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai talk about the books they\u2019ve recently reviewed.
