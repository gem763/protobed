Unlike value stocks, which often pay dividends, these high-potential growth stocks seek to reward their investors with capital appreciation from the rising price of their shares rather than from a stream of income payouts.\n\n\u201cPeople still think of today\u2019s big tech giants as hot start-ups with their whole lives ahead of them waiting to make early investors rich,\u201d said Hilary Kramer, who leads the GameChangers advisory service, which has booked 21 profitable trades among its last 25 transactions. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not where they are in their life cycle now. Their best days may not be behind them, but the easy fast money is definitely receding in the rear view.\u201d\n\nEight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now Omit Amazon and Alphabet\n\nFor example, Amazon just a decade ago reached $50 billion in market capitalization and since then has amassed an additional $800 billion in wealth, Kramer said. To repeat that growth, it would need to become an $18 trillion company before 2029, she added.\n\nTo accomplish that feat and maintain Amazon\u2019s \u201clofty 67 times earnings valuation,\u201d the company must book $250 billion a year in profit on $6 trillion a year in revenue, Kramer said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the entire U.S. retail economy right there, continued Kramer, whose 2-Day Trader advisory service has notched 15 out of 17 profitable trades with an average return of 13.76 percent and a hold time of less than a day since its launch. \u201cGranted, there are growth opportunities, but it\u2019s ambitious. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for companies that are worth $50 billion or less today and have the power to get to $850 billion in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nPaul Dykewicz interviews New York-based money manager Hilary Kramer.\n\nMicrosoft Left off List of Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nAs for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, Kramer said she is not extremely excited about its prospects at this stage either. A decade ago, revenue was ramping up 25-30 percent a year, but the company has not maintained anything better than 20 percent sales growth since 2012, she added.\n\n\u201cAs growth has slowed, margins are not reliably stepping up,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cManagement is still spending like an early-stage growth company. That\u2019s their right, but it takes four years and $80 billion in ad sales to double revenue now.\u201d\n\nInvestors need to use caution with such traditional growth stocks such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet, which compose 45 percent of the NASDAQ. Those stocks accounted for 90 percent of the NASDAQ\u2019s gain for the past five years but the \u201cgreat run\u201d seems to be ending, Kramer added.\n\n\u201cWhen they all drop together, the drag gets intense,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nEight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now Include Envestnet\n\nOne of the eight growth stocks to invest in now is Envestnet Inc. (NYSE:ENV), which Kramer said has the potential to become the Amazon of finance. Envestnet provides online wealth management and insurance solutions.\n\nThe company\u2019s aggressive merger and acquisition strategy fuels at least 10 percent growth even in slow years, Kramer said. Its returns literally have \u201crun rings around\u201d stocks such as Apple, she added.\n\nEnvestnet\u2019s valuation of 31 times earnings now will look \u201ccheap\u201d in the future, Kramer added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse Joins Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nAnother of the eight growth stocks to invest in now is Texas Roadhouse Inc. (NASDAQ:TXRH), which has fallen in price recently to offer a bargain entry point to buy shares in the restaurant chain. Texas Roadhouse is ramping up its revenue twice as fast as the S&P 500, she added.\n\nChances to buy the shares below a valuation of 26 times earnings are \u201cextremely rare\u201d but such an opportunity exists now, Kramer told me. She advised seizing upon the pullback to purchase shares.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nMedical Company Is Among Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nMerit Medical Systems (NASDAQ:MMSI), a medical device maker, is another addition to the list of eight growth stocks to invest in now. It specifically focuses on manufacturing and marketing disposable medical devices used in interventional, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, particularly in the areas of cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy.\n\nThe company seems to be adopting the Amazon approach of focusing on a niche, which in this case is catheters, dialysis equipment, diagnostic kits and scalpels, dominating it and using the cash to buy its way into the next medical products growth area, Kramer said. MMSI is on track to expand its earnings per share (EPS) 20 percent this year and still trades at less than half the valuation multiple of Amazon, she added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nCHEWY Gains Entry to Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nChewy Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), a Florida-based pet food supplier, earned entry among the eight growth stocks to invest in now not long after its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year. Its sales have soared to $4.5 billion this year from just $26 million in 2012.\n\nIn addition, Chewy\u2019s revenue has risen 43 percent this year alone and its 23 percent gross margin far exceeds what Amazon is producing, Kramer continued. For now, its management is still chasing market share, but the shares have fallen since its IPO to offer a better entry price, she added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nShopify Charges onto List of Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nShopify, Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), based in Ottawa, Ontario, is a fast-growing ecommerce platform that helps more than 800,000 sellers worldwide find customers online, through social media and in person. Shopify charged onto the list of eight growth stocks to invest in now by cultivating a customer base of small retailers and consumer brands alike.\n\nWith just $1.5 billion in sales, Shopify has only 1/200 the \u201cfootprint\u201d of Amazon, Kramer said. Shopify\u2019s revenue growth of 40 percent a year is turning into 50 percent profit growth, she added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nEight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now Include ROKU\n\nRoku Inc. (Nasdaq:ROKU), a provider of streaming television entertainment, ranked among the eight growth stocks to invest in now partly because of its 86 percent annual growth, said Kramer, who seeks underappreciated stocks in her Value Authority advisory service. Advertisements and other services compose 67 percent of its revenue and are driving growth of 86 percent a year.\n\nIn contrast, services account for 19 percent of Apple\u2019s business, which is growing at a comparatively modest 23 percent a year, Kramer said. The answer to whether Roku or Apple deserves the biggest premium seems clear, she added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nTwitter Rates as One of Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nTwitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR), a microblogging and social networking company, rates as one of the eight growth stocks to invest in now by virtue of its \u201cgreat\u201d financial metrics that feature 17 percent revenue growth that can scale into a 185 percent profit expansion, said Kramer, who also leads the Turbo Trader, High Octane Trader and Inner Circle advisory services. Nonetheless, Twitter is less expensive on an earnings basis than Facebook, at 18 times earnings vs. 28 times earnings, respectively, she added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nCannabis Company Climbs onto List of Eight Growth Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) is a British pharmaceutical company that seeks to become a global leader in prescription cannabinoid medicines. It gained a place on the list of eight growth stocks to invest in now by taking a cannabis-derived epilepsy drug all the way to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n\u201cThis stock has already made GameChangers investors happy and I see a lot more ahead,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nChart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com\n\nWith negative interest rates in Europe, rising government debt, trade wars, economic weakness, global conflicts and U.S. House action to impeach President Trump all affecting the markets, investors may opt to buy promising growth stocks that should find fertile fields ahead. The valuations of these top eight growth stocks to buy now also show that they compare favorably to established growth stock giants that are slowing their climb, as the much smaller newcomers are on the ascent.\n\nPaul Dykewicz, www.pauldykewicz.com, is an accomplished, award-winning journalist who has written for Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal, Investor\u2019s Business Daily, USA Today, the Journal of Commerce, Seeking Alpha, GuruFocus and other publications and websites.
