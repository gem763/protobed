He said Trump could only be charged with a crime when he was out of office or if he was impeached and removed from office.\n\nCarey Dunne, general counsel for the District Attorney, said there are times when a state should be able to conduct criminal investigations into a sitting president, including the extreme example of shooting someone in the street.\n\nDunne added that there\u2019s no presidential immunity for tax returns. \u201cHe may view them as embarrassing or sensitive but tax returns do in fact get subpoenaed all the time in financial investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re making this up, your honor.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Judge Victor Marrero tossed out Trump\u2019s suit to block the subpoena, explaining that his claim for immunity was not supported by the law.\n\nThe case is expected to end up in the Supreme Court.", "description": "President Trump famously said during the 2016 campaign that he could shoot somebody in the middle of 5th Avenue, New York, and he wouldn\u2019t lose any voters....", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY647_17trum_ZG_20171119173259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
