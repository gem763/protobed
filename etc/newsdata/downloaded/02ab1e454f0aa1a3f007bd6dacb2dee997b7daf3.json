Something has gone terribly wrong!\u201d\n\nGent Cakaj, Albania\u2019s acting foreign minister who is originally from Kosovo, also reacted angrily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by the decision to award Nobel Prize in literature to a genocide denier. What an ignoble & shameful act we are witnessing in 2019!\u201d he said.\n\nHandke was an opponent of NATO\u2019s airstrikes against Serbia in the Kosovo war of the late 1990s and spoke in 2006 at the funeral of autocratic Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nKosovo was part of Serbia until 1999 when NATO intervened to stop Milosevic.\n\n___\n\n4:10 p.m.\n\nSerbian media and officials are praising Peter Handke for winning the Nobel Prize in literature, describing him as a \u201cgreat friend\u201d of the Serbs.\n\nThe Austrian writer was an opponent of NATO\u2019s airstrikes against Serbia in the Kosovo war of the late 1990s and spoke in 2006 at the funeral of autocratic Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. In his support for Milosevic\u2019s regime, Handke came to Belgrade during the bombing.\n\nIn an interview with Serbia\u2019s state TV earlier this year Handke said: \u201cThose who bombed and killed thousands of people don\u2019t belong to Europe and the planet earth.\u201d\n\nHe has also denied that genocide was committed when Bosnian Serb troops massacred some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the enclave of Srebrenica during the Bosnian war in the 1990s - something ruled genocide by the U.N. war crimes court in several convictions of top Bosnian Serb wartime commanders and political leaders.\n\nHandke claimed that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in the besieged Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and blamed this on the Serbs.\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nPolish writer Olga Tokarczuk, who on Thursday won the Nobel Prize in literature, has hailed the role of the novel as a \u201cdeep way of communication across borders, across languages and across cultures.\u201d\n\nBut she said \u201cnot everyone needs to read\u201d her books, in reaction to the culture minister saying he has not finished any of them.\n\nTokarczuk, 57, said she had to pull over as she was driving on a highway in Germany, to \u201cabsorb\u201d a phone call telling her that she had won the Nobel Prize, and said it came as a \u201ctotal surprise\u201d to her. She is on a tour meeting readers in Germany.\n\nShe said she was \u201cterribly happy and proud\u201d that her novels, which describe events in small locations in Poland \u201ccan be read as universal and can be important for people around the world.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the TVN24 she said \u201cI believe in the novel\u201d as a \u201cdeep way of communication across borders, across languages, across cultures\u201d that teaches empathy.\n\nAsked about recent comment by Culture Minister Piotr Glinski that he had never finished any of her books, she said \u201cYes, I have heard. But there are readers for whom this can be boring or not fit their temperament.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone needs to read me,\u201d he said.\n\nGlinski congratulated her Thursday and said he will revisit Tokarczuk\u2019s books.\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nOlga Tokarczuk\u2019s Polish publishers say they are \u201coverjoyed\u201d by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in literature to a writer they have worked with for 18 years.\n\nSebastian Nowak of the Wydawnictwo Literackie said Thursday the award \u201cconfirms the great scope and power of her prose. She is our precious national asset.\u201d\n\nNowak said the publishers could not immediately reach Tokarczuk because she was \u201cdriving somewhere on a German highway\u201d from Dortmund, where she met with readers on Wednesday, to another location.\n\nShe has a meeting in Bielefeld later in the day, according to the German news agency dpa.\n\nNowak said her prose was \u201cuniversal and crossed all boundaries of age and politics.\u201d All her books are available in Polish under the Wydawnictwo Literackie label.\n\nLast year, Tokarczuk was the first ever Polish writer to win the International Booker award for her book \u201cFlights.\u201d The Polish title is \u201cBieguni.\u201d\n\nThe 57-year-old writer lives in Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland, and also spends time in the wilderness of nearby valleys.\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said this week he has not finished any of her books, tweeted congratulations after the award and said he will try again.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nPolish novelist Olga Tokarczuk is the first woman this year to be awarded a Nobel Prize - although strictly speaking her prize is for 2018. The nine winners of this year\u2019s science prizes were all men.\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century and the first since Belarusian journalist Svetlana Alexievich in 2015.\n\nLast year, three women received prizes - Donna Strickland in physics; Frances H. Arnold in chemistry; and Nadia Muras won the Nobel Peace Prize. With Tokarczuk, that number has been raised to four for 2018.\n\nAccording to the official website of the Nobel Prize, 53 women have been honored in all categories since 1901. The first woman to get the literature prize was Swedish author Selma Lagerlof in 1909.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nPoland\u2019s president and culture minister have congratulated writer Olga Tokarczuk for winning the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda called it a \u201cgreat day for Polish literature\u201d on Twitter and said: \u201cAnother Polish writer, after the poet Wislawa Szymborska, receives the literary Nobel Prize. Bravo!\u201d\n\nSzymborska received the prize in 1996.\n\nTokarczuk, 57, is one of Poland\u2019s best-known authors. But she has also been criticized by Polish conservatives - and received death threats - for criticizing aspects of the country\u2019s past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland\u2019s right-wing government.\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who only days ago confessed to having tried reading her works but not making it through any of them, also congratulated her. On Thursday he said he would try harder now and claimed her accomplishment for Poland. He said: \u201cA Nobel Prize is a clear sign that Polish culture is well appreciated in the world.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nPeter Handke is known as a provocative author who hasn\u2019t shied away from courting controversy or, as one of his works is titled, \u201cOffending the Audience,\u201d in a career spanning more than five decades.\n\nHandke\u2019s debut novel in 1966 was \u201cThe Hornets.\u201d Also that year, \u201cOffending the Audience\u201d made its debut in a Frankfurt theater, confronting elegantly dressed theatergoers as \u201cgood-for-nothings.\u201d\n\nHis 1970 novel \u201cThe Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,\u201d the story of a former sportsman, was filmed by Wim Wenders.\n\nHandke was an opponent of NATO\u2019s airstrikes against Serbia in the Kosovo war of the late 1990s and spoke in 2006 at the funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.\n\n___\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nAustria\u2019s president is congratulating Peter Handke on winning the Nobel Prize in literature, praising his \u201cfascinating\u201d works and declaring it a great day for literature.\n\nAlexander Van der Bellen wrote on Twitter that Handke\u2019s \u201cquiet and intense voice has for decades designed worlds, places and people who couldn\u2019t be more fascinating.\u201d\n\nHe described Handke\u2019s tone as \u201cunfussy and unique,\u201d and said that \u201cwe have a lot to thank Peter Handke for. I hope he knows that.\u201d\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nThe chair of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy says the 18-member Academy picked four members from own its ranks and five \u201cexternals\u201d to select the shortlist for the 2018 and 2019 literature prizes.\n\nThe academy has reformed itself after sex abuse allegations that led to a mass exodus of committee members and the ouster of then-Permanent Secretary Sara Danius, resulting in no prize being awarded last year for the first time since 1943 at the height of World War II.\n\nAnders Olsson, the chair, says the list of the candidates, whose names are secret, is boiled down by the group of nine to a shortlist of eight people to be considered by the Academy.\n\nHe added that in early October, the Academy chooses the laureates, and that a candidate must receive more than half of the votes cast.\n\nWhen asked whether the Swedish Academy really makes the decision, Olsson said \u201cWe are not ready yet to evaluate the process,\u201d and declined to elaborate on the internal line of work.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nThe announcement that the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk provides a morale boost to liberal-minded Poles only three days before a nationalist populist party taking the country down an illiberal path seems headed for re-election.\n\nTokarczuk was honored by the Swedish Academy on Thursday for what it said was \u201ca narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\u201d\n\nTokarczuk has celebrated the ethnic melting pot that Poland was in the past in her works. That has not made her universally admired by the nationalists in power in Poland.\n\nEven Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said in recent days that he has tried to read her works but never managed to finish any of them.\n\nThe last Pole to win the Nobel literature prize was poet Wislawa Szymborska in 1996.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nThe 2018 Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk \u201cfor a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life,\u201d while the 2019 prize went to Austrian author Peter Handke.\n\nMats Malm, the Swedish Academy\u2019s permanent secretary, says Handke was honored \u201cfor an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\u201d\n\nThe shortlist was made of eight names of which two were picked for the 2018 and 2019 awards, said Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy.\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award to be shared a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10 the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896 together with five other Nobel winners. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway on the same day.\n\n___\n\n8:15 a.m.\n\nTwo Nobel Prizes in literature - one for 2019 and one for last year - will be announced Thursday after the 2018 literature award was postponed following sex abuse allegations that had rocked the Swedish Academy.\n\nThe chemistry prize went Wednesday to three scientists for their work leading to the development of lithium-ion batteries. That was a day after the physics award was given to a Canadian-American and two Swiss, and on Monday the Physiology or Medicine award went to two Americans and one British scientist.\n\nSo far, nine Nobel prizes have been awarded this week and all the laureates are men.\n\nThe coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on the 2019 Nobel Prizes by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the awarding of the 2019 Nobel Prizes (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/nobel_prizes_99361_c0-233-5568-3479_s1770x1032.jpg?a5a0d838ef6c4cc1ed50475c9b5d454f6fdede4f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
