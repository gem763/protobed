Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has proposed a mandatory federal assault rifle buyback.\n\n\u201cThis is a ground-level issue for me,\u201d Ms. McCain said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a gun-grabber, you don\u2019t get my vote. Period.\n\n\u201cThe AR-15 is the most popular gun in America by far,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was just out in the middle of nowhere Wyoming, if you\u2019re talking about going and taking people\u2019s guns away from them, there\u2019s going to be a lot of violence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not living without guns,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nMs. McCain\u2019s husband, ABC News analyst Ben Domenech, on Wednesday defended his wife\u2019s argument on Twitter, writing, \u201cPeople tend to fight back when you disrespect the Bill of Rights and try to illegally take their guns. The Black Panthers did it in California when Reagan tried. We would do it too.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
