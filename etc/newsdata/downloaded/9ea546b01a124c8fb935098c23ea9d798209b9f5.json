Disputes between the regional powers over the composition of the civilian group, some still unresolved, held up the committee being announced until September.\n\nThe weakened opposition team is a coalition of at least five different platforms and has nominated Hadi Bahra as co-chair for the committee. Bahra said his side had already prepared a draft constitution, adding that he believed the negotiations need not last longer than two to six months.\n\nA smaller tripartite 45-strong committee is due to undertake the detailed drafting of the constitution.\n\nThe talks, the fourth attempt to end the war through negotiation, faces myriad obstacles and Pedersen has played down the prospect of a breakthrough. One difficulty is that the committee must adopt resolutions either by consensus or with a 75% majority, seen by some as a recipe for paralysis.\n\nAlthough seven Kurds are on the committee, the political wing of the mainly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces in north-east Syria has been excluded. The Kurdish Syrian autonomous administration objected to the exclusion on Monday.\n\nIstanbul regards the Kurdish YPD as the political wing of the \u201cterrorist\u201d PKK, and is currently driving their forces from the border with Turkey.\n\nDeserted by their former allies the US, the YPD has been forced to start Russian-brokered talks to form a military deal with Assad\u2019s forces. Assad in the past has opposed a federated Syria with an semi-autonomous Kurdish province.\n\nAssad\u2019s foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, has already warned \u201cthe hostile Turkish incursion into north-east Syria seriously threatens the work of the constitutional committee\u201d.\n\nThere is intense pressure on the Syrian opposition to recognise the weakness of their position and scale back their demands. They have already complained the committee\u2019s remit abandons previous vital commitments in UN resolutions to form a transitional governing body within six months, release detainees and provide information on missing persons.\n\nPederson, like his predecessor Staffan de Mistura, is searching for positives pointing out that the committee \u2013 with terms of reference and core rules of procedure \u2013 marks the first political agreement between the overnment of Syria and the opposition.\n\nThe committee also commits the government and the opposition and their nominees to sit together face-to-face in dialogue and negotiations.", "description": "150-strong committee meets to chart political settlement and negotiate end to civil war", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203c6bdaa8ce6a76114b63644b319f3f618c2dbf/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=890204f88138ec385433162dc2dbea18", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
