Unlike that film, in which a maniac inventor traps unwitting victims inside arcane instruments of torture, U-Neck (\u00a364.99, stressnomore.co.uk) aims to relax you. It is a massage device with an X-Men visor design and flexible arms that snap around your neck. I love a massage, so I am excited for this. It heats up! It vibrates at different intensities! It even deploys infrared to target nerve endings!\n\nFirst, though, the name. U-Neck is such a profoundly unattractive word, it almost warrants respect. Factual in a lumpen sort of way \u2013 this being a U-shape that fits around your neck \u2013 it also sounds like an obscure insult. It is as hard to wrap your head around U-Neck\u2019s name as it is easy to wrap U-Neck around your head.\n\nWhen the day comes to test it, I\u2019m lucky enough to wake with painful neck-ache. I charge it up and switch it on. Despite all the tech, it is not too heavy. It weighs 260g (which admittedly is hard to conceptualise. Think of it as weighing 0.004% of a midcentury sideboard). It is comfortable to wear and the remote control works well, allowing you to set a timer, change massage modes and control their intensity.\n\nThe device buzzes and pulses through two metal plates covered in raised dots, built into the section hugging the back of my neck. It is strong, like someone accelerating a remote-control car inside my skull, or ringing a phone I\u2019ve just swallowed. I\u2019ve experienced similar with other massage devices, though U-Neck does employ a greater variety of rhythms and intensities (up to 550 permutations are possible).\n\nHowever, the collar has another trick up its, er, sleeve. I become aware of it while playing with the remote. It starts with a shiver on the nape of my neck, like a devil licking me. An inexplicable prickling, and then the sensation grows broad and intense, like tattoo needles up the back of my skull and over my ears. Whereas the vibration massage was localised, this sensation spreads. When I reach to touch the plate to see what is going on back there, I find my hand shooting away. It is electricity: there is electricity on my skin. I\u2019m viscerally alarmed. I don\u2019t even like taking a jumper off after 6pm because I\u2019m scared of static. (That little shock of blue, leaping from the Pringle? No thank you.) I take another look at the box. \u201cLow-frequency electric therapy,\u201d it says.\n\nIs this where we are now? Are our pleasure centres so overstimulated that in search of relaxation we will knowingly give ourselves electric shocks to the head? I find the sensation painful, until I realise I am on maximum intensity, too much for me. I\u2019m not trying to tranquilise a rhino. I turn it down to half that, and am more able to appreciate one of the most unusual sensations I\u2019ve ever known. It really is like nothing else. Relaxtricity? It is reminiscent of that trick where a friend pretends to crack an egg over your head, and you feel it oozing down your scalp. But it is also sharper than that: a million-pin tingle, which some people may love.\n\nIt never feels dangerous, and U-Neck meets EU health and safety regulations. (Can\u2019t wait until we shred that, so copycats can sell live wires wrapped around a boxing glove.) In fact, electrotherapy has been around for years, claiming to help with neck and back pain, and headaches. Medical research suggests these claims are at best extremely limited. Is it relaxing? I\u2019m too weirded out to say. I don\u2019t like the slight but involuntary muscle contraction, together with the heat generated by the collar. When I take it off, my neck is numb and hot to touch.\n\nI guess if you don\u2019t have a friend, or an imaginary egg, this is a pretty good substitute for one of those things. But consumer electronics still can\u2019t match the torquing power, dexterity and sensitivity of a trained masseur\u2019s hands. This latest offering does bring exciting new tricks to the table \u2013 I just hope it\u2019s not a metal table. I\u2019m no U-Neckrophile, though sensation junkies will get a kick out of it.\n\nThe name, though.\n\nEven if U-Neck didn\u2019t sound similar to \u201ceunuch\u201d and \u201cU-bend\u201d it would still be weird.\n\nWellness or hellness?\n\nU-neckessary, but not bad. 3/5\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
