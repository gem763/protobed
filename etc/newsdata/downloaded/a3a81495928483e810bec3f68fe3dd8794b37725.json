Probably want to save the surprise, but in the meantime, the network is more than happy to offer a sneak peek at the musical\u2019s main characters, including Moana\u2019s Auli\u2019i Cravalho as the titular Ariel and Queen Latifah as sinister cephalopod sorceress Ursula.\n\nRounding out the cast is Shaggy as benevolent, anxiety-riddled crab Sebastian and John Stamos as would-be fish murderer Chef Louis, both of whom we\u2019d like to think wore their own clothes to set and refused to change. Meanwhile, where is our Flounder? Where are our Flotsam and Jetsam? Most importantly, where is our sea daddy King Triton? Fortunately, we won\u2019t have to tread water too much longer to find out. The Little Mermaid Live! airs on ABC Tuesday, November 5.", "description": "Auli\u2019i Cravalho, Queen Latifah, Shaggy, John Stamos and Graham Phillips star in ABC\u2019s The Little Mermaid Live!
