The NYPD is getting online and asking citizens about two key feelings: trust and safety.\n\nThe police department is using targeted ads to gauge not just how safe a New Yorker feels in their own neighborhood, but also how much they trust the police there.\n\nDevora Kaye, acting deputy commissioner of public information for the NYPD, told Fox News, \u201cAdvertisements are sent via social media and search engines to get New Yorkers to take a survey about trust and safety.\u201d\n\nEvery month, about 7,500 people take the survey. \u201cEnough people are reached to get a snapshot of trust/safety data down to precinct and sector level,\u201d Kaye added.\n\nNYPD'S LONGEST SERVICE OFFICE, RABBI ALVIN KASS, PROTECTS THOSE WHO SERVE TO PROTECT ALL\n\nThis innovative tool, often called the \u201csentiment meter,\u201d gives the NYPD information about how the community feels, which is valuable information, according to Kaye.\n\nSentiment-meter participants are asked to answer three questions with a ranking of one to 10:\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the threat of crime, how safe do you feel in your neighborhood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police in my neighborhood treat local residents with respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police in my neighborhood listen to and take into account the concerns of local residents,\u201d\n\nA fourth question is fill in the blank: \u201cWhat is the number one issue or problem on you block or in your neighborhood that you would like the police to deal with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety is a shared responsibility \u2013 the NYPD continues to deepen its Neighborhood Policing philosophy and understanding how safe people feel is central to that work,\u201d Kaye explained.\n\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT REPORTS THEFT OF SPEED ENFORCEMENT DEVICE WHILE BEING USED TO CATCH SPEEDERS\n\nFox News was able to view the citywide data for trust and safety, going back to September 2016. This summer, for example, New Yorkers\u2019 feeling of safety has gone down from 67 percent in June, to 63 percent in August. Conversely, the level of trust in police has increased over the same period from 63 percent in June, up to 66 percent in August.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we understand how we are doing with overall trust with the NYPD and that people feel safe,\u201d Police Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill wrote in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between being safe and feeling safe, and many times how people feel about the police is not just based on what is happening in their neighborhood \u2013 it might be something that\u2019s happening borough-wide, citywide or something that\u2019s happening nationally,\u201d wrote the commissioner.\n\nThis data doesn\u2019t simply help police headquarters, but also individual precincts at the hyper-local level.\n\n\u201cBut if it something that\u2019s happening locally, there are things that we can do to increase trust and make people feel safer,\u201d O\u2019Neill continued. \u201cI think this is an important tool for precinct commanders, borough commanders, and for us at police headquarters.\u201d\n\nUnderlining the crucial role police play in the lives of citizens, O\u2019Neill added, \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we have a police department that can work in partnership with all 8.6 million New Yorkers to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nThe software company tasked with gathering the data, Elucd, is local, too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Elucd website touts the software company\u2019s ability to help \u201cleaders improve trust and safety through data.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time, city leaders can track the real-time pulse of how every neighborhood feels about trust and safety, and develop strategies for their improvement,\u201d continues the statement on Elucd\u2019s site.\n\nMichael Simon, the co-founder and CEO of the Brooklyn-based startup, was unavailable for comment.", "description": "The New York City Police Department is using targeted ads to gauge not just how safe a New Yorker feels in their own neighborhood, but also how much they trust the police there.", "authors": ["Rebecca Kesten"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/iStock-NYPD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
