The Daily Telegraph cited security sources saying they were concentrating on a criminal gang based in south Armagh with links to dissident paramilitaries.\n\nTwo journeys into one: how lorry driver and Chinese nationals reached Essex Read more\n\nThe chief executive of Zeebrugge port, Joachim Coens, said the trailer would not have been interfered with after it arrived there at 2.49pm. \u201cA refrigerated container in the port zone is completely sealed,\u201d he told Belgian media. \u201cDuring the check, the seal is examined, as is the licence plate. The driver is checked by cameras.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Bruges, Dirk de Fauw, echoed this message in an interview on VRT, saying trailers were filmed until their arrival on the ferry. \u201c[To] break the seal, bring 39 people onboard and apply a new seal without being noticed, that chance is extremely small.\u201d\n\nThe comments, along with the news that the victims were Chinese, strengthened suspicions that it could be a case of trafficking rather than economic migrants or refugees. Experts said the majority of Chinese people brought to the UK illegally found themselves in a situation of debt bondage when they reached the country.\n\nNew details of the journeys taken by the trailer and cab emerged, raising further questions about when and where the victims were locked inside the trailer and by whom.\n\nThe refrigerated trailer compartment arrived unaccompanied in the UK from Zeebrugge early on Wednesday morning and was collected at the port of Purfleet at 1.05am by a lorry cab driven by Robinson, a self-employed haulier from Northern Ireland.\n\nPolice said Robinson\u2019s burgundy cab arrived at Holyhead by ferry from Dublin on Sunday. The trailer had been leased five days earlier in County Monaghan, just south of the Irish border, a spokesman for Global Trailer Rentals (GTR), the operating company, confirmed.\n\nLocal sources said Robinson\u2019s parents, who live in the village of Laurelvale, had travelled to England to visit their son at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\n\nThree properties in Northern Ireland \u2013 Robinson\u2019s home, a nearby property he used to share with his parents and a third site in Armagh \u2013 were raided overnight. Computers were taken away as part of the investigation, sources said.\n\nThe first bodies of the victims were removed by ambulance on Thursday night from the dockyard warehouse where the vehicle was being examined, and taken by ambulance to hospital in Chelmsford where they will undergo postmortems.\n\nEssex police indicated that the process of recovering the bodies could take longer than anticipated. BJ Harrington, the force\u2019s chief constable, said: \u201cThis is the largest investigation of its kind Essex police has ever had to conduct and it is likely to take some considerable time to come to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nLiu Xiaoming, Chinese ambassador to the UK, tweeted: \u201cThe Chinese embassy has sent a team led by the minister-counsellor in charge of consular affairs to Essex, England. They have met with the local police, who said that they are\n\nverifying the identity of the 39 deceased.\u201d\n\n\u2018It could have been me\u2019: refugees describe their journeys to the UK Read more\n\nGTR said it had leased the trailer on 15 October. It said in a statement: \u201cThe directors of Global Trailer Rentals Limited wish to express their deepest sympathies with the family and friends of the people who have so tragically lost their lives. The company was entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been.\u201d\n\nThe statement said GTR had supplied information to Essex police, including the identity of the client who rented the trailer, and it would supply data from the tracking device upon request.\n\nA company representative said GTR had no connection with or knowledge of Robinson or the cab that picked up the trailer in Essex.\n\nGTR is a medium-sized trailer rental company that straddles the border. It is based near Castleblayney, County Monaghan, and has administrative support in Newry, County Armagh, plus an office in Dublin.\n\nThe Guardian understands that a family-run haulage enterprise on the Irish border rented the trailer. It made no immediate comment.\n\nOn its website, GTR says all its trailers are fitted with GPS monitoring and it uses a company called Blue Tree Systems to track the vehicles\u2019 movements. Blue Tree Systems declined to comment.\n\nWhile British police officers continued to conduct fingertip searches of the Waterglade industrial estate in Thurrock where the bodies were discovered, the Belgian federal prosecutor announced he had opened an inquiry into the deaths, to focus on all parties involved in the transport.\n\nHe told local media: \u201cWe have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. We don\u2019t even know which road was followed by the truck in Belgium. We don\u2019t know how much time it stayed in Belgian territory. We don\u2019t know if it stopped or not. We don\u2019t know if the people got into the container or not. So we have a lot of questions that we are hoping to find [answers to].\u201d\n\nA senior British ports source told the Guardian that all cargo compartments coming into the UK underwent anti-terrorist screening, but this did not necessarily include measures to detect whether humans were inside a cargo \u2013 technology that is widely available at points of departure on the European mainland.\n\nAdditional reporting: Diane Taylor and Henry McDonald.", "description": "Chinese nationals would have been locked in refrigerated trailer for at least 10 hours", "authors": ["Esther Addley", "Simon Murphy", "Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1732921ea714eab4cccb8145e0db65aba652749/0_222_3204_1922/master/3204.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=83b8c29a685f9d74afd974daa29c2f33", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
