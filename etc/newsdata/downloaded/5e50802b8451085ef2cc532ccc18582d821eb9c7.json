Conor isn\u2019t the man anymore, so Khabib gets to sit back and call the shots.'\n\nMcGregor was understandably displeased with this statement.\n\n'Who\u2019s not the man? Your man had that marquee event did he? More like an event in a marquee,' tweeted an angry McGregor, who is currently on bail after allegedly punching a man at a Dublin pub in April.\n\n'A tent in the f****** sand it was. Keep spoofing to your self horse. Jock strap sniffer championships.'\n\nWhite is keen to get McGregor back in the octagon, but it will not be until next year\n\nKhabib got another submissing win at UFC 242, but McGregor also slammed the event\n\nAttendance for UFC 242 at the du Arena on Yas Island in the UAE was thought to be low, and actual figures were not released after the event.\n\nMcGregor wants a rematch fight against Khabib, but the Russian is likely to face Tony Ferguson next. A bout against George St. Pierre is also on the cards.\n\nThe Irishman has also called on White to book a December fight against Frankie Edgar, with McGregor saying he will donate his purse to charity.\n\nWhite has dismissed that particular fight as Edgar is two weight classes below The Notorious, but seems keen to get McGregor back in action in 2020.\n\nA potential fight could arise between McGregor and the winner of Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244.", "description": "Conor McGregor has fired back at UFC boss Dana White on social media after he claimed the Irishman 'isn't the man anymore.'", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/14/19924402-0-image-a-46_1571491802027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
