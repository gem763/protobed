Bernice King responded to Zuckerberg\u2019s comments in a tweet stating: \u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d\n\nI heard #MarkZuckerberg's \u2018free expression\u2019 speech, in which he referenced my father. I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination. pic.twitter.com/h97gvVmtSZ \u2014 Be A King (@BerniceKing) October 17, 2019\n\nDuring his speech, Zuckerberg stated: \u201cIn times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression. We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension. We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also referred to \u201cefforts to shut down campus protests against the Vietnam War\u201d and Americans\u2019 opinions during World War I. Zuckerberg\u2019s public appearance comes shortly after the platform decided to allow advertisements from politicians on its platform which may contain false or misleading information.\n\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d Zuckerberg said during the speech. \u201cWe can either stand for free expression \u2026 or we can decide the cost is simply too great. We must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
