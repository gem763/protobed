USA TODAY\n\nCHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears are not salvageable. Not this season, anyway.\n\nWhat else to think after the abysmal performance in the 36-25 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday? The Bears managed all of 252 yards, the bulk of which came in the fourth quarter when the game was out of hand. Of Chicago\u2019s seven running plays, two were fumbles. Mitchell Trubisky was only an interception away from filling up his bingo card \u2013 skipping the ball into the dirt, overthrowing his receivers and getting sacked after holding onto the ball too long.\n\nAnd to think, this was the Bears with an extra week to prepare.\n\nAfter the season-opening loss to the Green Bay Packers, coach Matt Nagy promised that the anemic offensive showing wasn\u2019t reflective of who his team is. Trubisky called the ineptitude uncharacteristic. Everyone in the locker room insisted the Bears would not take the step back many were predicting after last year\u2019s NFC North title.\n\nIt was a long Sunday for quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and the Bears.

He simply is overmatched, and the mistakes he\u2019s making are the same ones he was making last year. There has been no sign of growth, no indication he can be the franchise quarterback the Bears envisioned when they traded up to take him with the No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft.\n\nBut this is not all on Trubisky\u2019s shoulders. The offensive line is porous, and its shortcomings go far beyond the newly departed Kyle Long. While the Saints gave Teddy Bridgewater so much time to throw he could have run to the concession stand for a hot dog, Trubisky rarely has the luxury of having time to throw.\n\n(Granted, when he does, he squanders it. But still \u2026)\n\nMatt Nagy isn\u2019t doing his offense any favors with his game plan, either. This is the NFL, not the WAC, and a run game is a necessity.\n\nRunning the ball, especially on first down, keeps defenses honest and eventually opens things up for the passing game. It also would take some of the pressure off Trubisky. Nagy has acknowledged knowing all of this and has promised to find more of a balance.\n\nYet week after week, Tarik Cohen, Mike Davis and David Montgomery might as well be on milk cartons for as much as they\u2019re seen.\n\nThe Bears have one of the nastiest defenses in the NFL. But counting on Khalil Mack and Co. to bail the offense out, with either points or turnovers, is not a sustainable plan. Just how fragile it is was evident Sunday, when Chicago clearly felt the absence of Akiem Hicks.\n\nThe Saints were missing Drew Brees, Alvin Kamara and Jared Cook. Yet without Hicks, who is on injured reserve with an elbow injury, the Bears were pushed around and knocked over. At one point near the end of the third quarter, Latavius Murray had 86 yards rushing \u2013 three more than the entire Bears offense had mustered.\n\nNew Orleans\u2019 36 points were the most allowed by the Bears this season. The 11-point loss, which made the game seem much closer than it was, was the largest of the year, too.\n\nWorst of all, Chicago\u2019s schedule gets markedly harder from here. The Bears still have to play both Los Angeles teams and the Kansas City Chiefs, as well as four NFC North games \u2013 one each against Green Bay and Minnesota, and two against Detroit.\n\nLook at the remaining schedule, and the only \u201cgimme\u201d game left might be the New York Giants.\n\nThe Bears began the season full of hype and bluster. Turns out, they were off the mark on that, too.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
