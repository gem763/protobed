Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nAnd on Thursday, Yvie Jones addressed being snubbed by the network and told she could never appear on the program again after her stint in the jungle.\n\nSpeaking to Who magazine, the bubbly 46-year-old said comments reportedly made by Foxtel's Executive Director of Television Brian Walsh were uncalled for.\n\nNot happy! Yvie Jones (pictured) has addressed being snubbed by Foxtel and told she could never appear on Gogglebox again after her stint in the jungle\n\n'Such a stupid comment to make. It's not about you, it's about your viewers! No one cares what you think, or what is happening to your brand,' Yvie said.\n\nAccording to TV Tonight, Walsh apparently banned the pair from appearing on Gogglebox again, saying: 'You will not see a review of them on Gogglebox.\n\n'From a promotional point of view the issue that upsets Foxtel is the exploitation of the Gogglebox brand to market and sell another program,' Walsh said in February.\n\nYou're out! Yvie (right) and Angie Kent (left) were famously blacklisted by Foxtel after they signed up for Channel 10's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nNot fair! Yvie (pictured right with Angie on I'm A Celebrity) said comments reportedly made by Foxtel's Executive Director of Television Brian Walsh were not uncalled for\n\nYvie said the most important thing is to give viewers what they want, and that is to see the people who they love on Gogglebox and other shows.\n\n'When we were announced as being on I'm a Celebrity, we were in South Africa and we didn't have our phones so we missed all the hoo-ha!' she said.\n\n'It would have been just brilliant to have everyone on Gogglebox reacting to us going to I'm a celeb. It was such a waste.'\n\n'It's not about you!' Yvie (right with Angie Kent) said the most important thing is to give viewers what they want, and that is to see the people who they love on Gogglebox and other shows\n\nNew gig: In June, Yvie (centre) was named as Fifi Box's replacement on Fox FM while she is on maternity leave. Pictured with reality stars Keira Maguire (far left) and Jarrod Woodgate (far right)\n\nIn February, it was revealed that Foxtel prefers to keep Gogglebox contestants away from the showbusiness spotlight so they maintain 'authenticity' as pop culture critics.\n\nAt the time, Walsh said Foxtel management were also 'incredibly disappointed' when the two women publicly criticised their appearance fees.\n\nHe was referring to a 2018 interview, where Angie reportedly told WHO magazine 'everyone [in the Gogglebox cast] still has to work' because of their low salaries.\n\n'I was incredibly disappointed that they were critical of Foxtel and the appearance fee money we paid them to do Gogglebox. I thought that was unfair, unnecessary and unwarranted,' he said.", "description": "Yvie Jones addressed being snubbed by the network and told she could never appear on the program again after her stint in the jungle.", "authors": ["Mark Brook For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19812148-0-image-a-15_1571266645984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
