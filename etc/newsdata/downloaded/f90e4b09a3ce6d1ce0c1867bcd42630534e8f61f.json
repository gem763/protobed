Tulsi Gabbard by name and there are five Democratic women running for president this cycle: Gabbard, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Kloubuchar, California Sen. Kamala Harria and author Marianne Williamson. However, the comment appeared to be aimed at Gabbard.\n\nPHOTO: Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard speaks during the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season in Westerville, Ohio on Oct. 15, 2019.

You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.

The news outlet reported last week that some Democrats worry about Russian bot influence due to Gabbard's apparent popularity on and mentions in Russian news media and on such places as 4chan, an online message board popular with right-wing groups.\n\nClinton's spokesman Nick Merrill told CNN in response to a question about whether the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard: \"If the nesting doll fits.\"\n\n\"This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,\" Merrill told CNN. \"If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\"\n\nGabbard addressed speculation about being boosted by Russia on ABC's \"This Week\" in May, after being asked about an article published in The Daily Beast titled \"Tulsi Gabbard's Campaign Is Being Boosted by Putin Apologists.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast article said that Gabbard's campaign was being \"underwritten by some of the nation's leading Russophiles,\" and highlighted donations from supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The piece says that those donors' views are likely to align more closely with Gabbard's on subjects like Syria. As a member of Congress, she has met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and criticized a U.S. strike against the Syrian government, receiving backlash from other Democrats in Congress.\n\n\"You know, it's unfortunate that you're citing that article, George, because it's a whole lot of fake news,\" Gabbard said. \"What I am focused on is what is in the best interest of the American people. What is in the best interest of our national security. Keeping the American people safe.\"\n\nClinton's team has not responded to a request from ABC News for comment.\n\nABC News has also reached out to Gabbard's campaign for a response.\n\nGabbard has previously said on multiple occasions that she will not run as a third-party candidate should she fail to net the Democratic presidential nomination.", "description": "Former Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, without naming names -- and just ahead of the debate -- said that a female 2020 candidate is a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d--comments that picked up steam on Friday on social media.  \u201cThey\u2019re also going to do third-party again.
