Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent the summer and much of the autumn promising that Brexit would happen on October 31.\n\nMeanwhile British lawmakers are considering calls for a general election to try to break the impasse in parliament.\n\nHere is a guide to the latest decisions and the thinking behind them.\n\nJanuary 31: the new Brexit \u2018flextension\u2019\n\nEU leaders agreed on Monday to delay the UK\u2019s departure beyond the end of October. Brexit will now take place on February 1, 2020 \u2013 or earlier if the divorce deal is passed by the British and European parliaments. If the agreement is ratified, the UK will leave on the first day of the following month: either December 1 or January 1.\n\nThe \u201cflextension\u201d is seen as a compromise. Most EU leaders wanted to extend the UK's membership until January 31, as this met the UK\u2019s request for a three-month delay.\n\nFrance had reportedly argued for a shorter extension; senior officials and ministers had said the UK had to give a good reason for another delay and wanted to concentrate politicians\u2019 minds. However, although the decision needed unanimity among EU leaders, it was always thought highly unlikely that France would wield its veto.\n\nDespite Boris Johnson\u2019s repeated pledges that the UK would leave the EU at Halloween, he was obliged by law to seek a delay in the absence of parliamentary approval for the revised Brexit deal by October 19.\n\nRead more: EU leaders agree to Brexit 'flextension' until January 31, 2020\n\nDecember 12: Johnson\u2019s election call\n\nBritish MPs vote on Monday on the prime minister\u2019s proposal for a general election on December 12. It is his third attempt in five weeks to send the country to the polls.\n\nUnder the Fixed-term Parliament Act, the vote needs the support of two-thirds of lawmakers to be approved. It is an uphill challenge: the main Labour opposition is opposed to the idea, and the ruling Conservatives have no majority in parliament.\n\nIn exchange for backing the snap poll, Boris Johnson said he would allow MPs more time to approve his withdrawal deal.\n\nParliament is dissolved automatically 25 working days before a general election, so if a vote is held on December 12, MPs will have until November 6 to examine the EU withdrawal bill.\n\nThe advantage for the government is that this scenario would also provide another chance for parliament to approve the deal, paving the way for Brexit to happen. Johnson has repeatedly appealed to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and he could then hold an election having delivered on his promise to secure the UK's departure from the EU.\n\nThis is why he prefers this option to a Liberal Democrat-SNP proposal for a December 9 vote (see below). The earlier date would mean parliament being dissolved almost immediately, preventing MPs from having the necessary time to examine the legislation.\n\nRead more: Why does Boris Johnson want a December election?\n\nDecember 9: the date suggested by the Liberal Democrats and SNP\n\nAlthough the two dates are only three days apart, the difference with this proposal is that with a December 9 election, the EU withdrawal deal would not have been ratified. The country would thus be voting with the key issue of Brexit still unresolved.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party (SNP) \u2013 both anti-Brexit \u2013 have proposed the earlier date, which would be introduced as an amendment to the Fixed-term Parliament Act and would require only a simple majority.\n\nThe government \u2013 while arguing for its preferred option \u2013 has not ruled out backing the Lib Dem-SNP move, if its own plan for a December 12 election is rejected.\n\nThe advantage for the anti-Brexit parties of the earlier date is that unlike with Johnson's proposal, the UK\u2019s EU membership would definitely still be in play. They could contest an election offering the possibility that Brexit could be stopped.\n\nA vote on December 9 could also allow time for parliament to start up again this month. With a December 12 election the process may have to wait until January \u2013 by which time the new looming Brexit deadline would add to the pressure on MPs to pass the deal, or again face a possible no-deal exit.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have pointed out that the earlier election date gives students, registered to vote in their university towns, the chance to vote before they leave for the Christmas holidays.\n\nLabour has accused the Liberal Democrats and the SNP of \"giving up\" on a second referendum. Its policy is to seek an alternative Brexit deal which would be put to another public vote.\n\nGood or bad timing?\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour does not want an election until a no-deal Brexit is ruled out \u2013 although this was before the latest extension was agreed.\n\nCritics have argued, however, that this is impossible to achieve \u2013 as even if the UK leaves the EU with an agreement, another no-deal \u201ccliff-edge\u201d would loom next year during crucial negotiations on future trade.\n\nA further reason that has been suggested for both main parties' stances is that the ruling Conservatives have been consistently ahead of Labour in recent opinion polls.\n\nOpponents of a general election at this stage on either date argue that the crucial issue of Brexit should not be mixed up with other matters facing the country.\n\nA pre-Christmas election would be risky for all parties: a poll so close to the holiday period may be unpopular with voters. In previous snap elections \u2013 called earlier than the scheduled date \u2013 they have also shown a tendency to punish parties in power.\n\nRead more:\n\nProspect of Brexit felt by EU heavyweights Spain and Germany\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now \u2013 and how did we get here?", "description": "A quick guide to the new Brexit extension and a possible UK general election in December.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/26/86/1000x563_cmsv2_238e3900-0264-59d7-8212-dc1f0edb2281-4262686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
