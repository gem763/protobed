For that, I spent a few months learning enough phrases to make passable, if poorly pronounced, small talk. No, I\u2019m talking about the other language barrier: money.\n\nIn China, it seems that only foreigners use cash. Everyone else shops and does business much more efficiently with smartphone apps such as WeChat Pay, which are unavailable without a Chinese bank account. So when I attempted to order a latte at Luckin Coffee LK, +3.22% , the Chinese answer to Starbucks that went public in the U.S. this year, the barista explained, in a conversation mostly conducted via dueling translation apps, that I was unfortunately out of Luckin.\n\n\u201cYou have to know languages when you go to sell something,\u201d wrote Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. \u201cBut when you go to buy, everyone does what he must to understand you.\u201d It turns out he was wrong \u2014 though, in fairness, his Nobel Prize wasn\u2019t in economics.\n\nThere is no universal language of money. Our financial system is more a Tower of Babel, built in conflicting dialects that cause unnecessary friction and confusion. But, like languages, money evolves, continuously reshaped by a mixing of cultures and by new technologies and ideas.\n\nThat is one of the key themes that comes through this, our second annual Best New Ideas in Money, a series that explores the financial innovations changing the way we live, work, save and invest.\n\nSo what has this got to do with the price of coffee in China?\n\nThe use of better data and algorithms is streamlining transactions that long required professional intermediaries like brokers, lawyers and other translators.\n\nAndrea Riquier, for instance, looks at how new tech could make buying and selling a home, one of the most fraught financial transactions, as simple as buying and selling shares of company stock.\n\nWilliam Watts shows how the explosion of new alternative data sets is changing the way we invest.\n\nAnd Emily Bary examines how advances in language-translation technology could make money flow faster around the globe by enabling small businesses to deal internationally.\n\nThose are just a few examples of the fascinating pieces that will be published over the next few weeks. Please let me know what you think \u2014 and where I can get a decent cup of joe around here.\n\nHere are the first stories in the series:\n\nLeslie Albrecht: How a mix of psychotherapy and financial advice could solve your money issues once and for all\n\nIllustration by Glenn Harvey\n\nWilliam Watts: The explosion of \u2018alternative\u2019 data gives regular investors access to tools previously employed only by hedge funds", "description": "There is no universal language of money.
