The final episode of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History explores the last IRA campaign in England and the secret talks that brought about peace.\n\nThe IRA broke its 1994 ceasefire in February 1996 when it detonated a bomb in London\u2019s Docklands killing two people, injuring more than 100 and causing \u00a3150m of damage. The same year it detonated a bomb in Manchester city centre, injuring more than 200.\n\nThe attacks came as Sinn F\u00e9in argued with the British government over calls for the IRA to disarm before the Irish republican party could engage in formal peace talks.\n\nCrawley claims the attacks did not take place because he and other key IRA bombers were either caught or killed after surveillance operations by police and MI5. Crawley, caught smuggling guns from the US for the IRA, tells the programme the UK mainland bombing campaign left the IRA \u201coverstretched\u201d. He claims there was a shortage of volunteers to go to England to bomb targets.\n\nJohn Grieve, Scotland Yard\u2019s intelligence director, described Crawley and the other IRA bombers as \u201cthe A team\u201d. \u201cThey were excellent and one of them, John Crawley, ex-US Marine Corps demolition specialist, just epitomised the cunning, skills, experience, of the sort of people they were putting against us,\u201d he says.", "description": "Former gun runner claims republicans plotted to bomb London power supply in 1990s", "authors": ["Rebecca Black"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01fdae252a39a34dff072104fb99a2b273cfbea0/92_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b934452d4fa1263383726641b7e6abd2", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
