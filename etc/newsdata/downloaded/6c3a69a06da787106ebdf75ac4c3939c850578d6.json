They have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own. They have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield. As I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d\n\nThose words echoed with me throughout the week. It is easy to destroy an organization if you have no appreciation for what makes that organization great. We are not the most powerful nation in the world because of our aircraft carriers, our economy, or our seat at the United Nations Security Council. We are the most powerful nation in the world because we try to be the good guys. We are the most powerful nation in the world because our ideals of universal freedom and equality have been backed up by our belief that we were champions of justice, the protectors of the less fortunate.\n\nBut, if we don\u2019t care about our values, if we don\u2019t care about duty and honor, if we don\u2019t help the weak and stand up against oppression and injustice \u2014 what will happen to the Kurds, the Iraqis, the Afghans, the Syrians, the Rohingyas, the South Sudanese and the millions of people under the boot of tyranny or left abandoned by their failing states?", "description": "", "authors": ["William Mcraven", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Mcraven-Syria-Military.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
