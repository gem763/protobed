The symbols help the dozens of participating parties to differentiate themselves from one another, while making it easier for voters to make their choice in a country where around a quarter of the population is illiterate.\n\nBut although it's common for party symbols to represent values or ideologies, India's system differs in an important way: Rather than designing logos themselves, parties must instead choose from a pre-existing list controlled by election officials.\n\nAn attendee wearing clothing featuring the Indian National Congress (INC) party logo at an event in New Delhi, India, on March 11, 2019.

The images represent aspects of everyday life in India, from a stack of tires and a gramophone, to an auto rickshaw and even a cricket player.\n\nParties must choose three symbols, in order of preference, after which they are allocated one by the ECI. Once an image is \"reserved,\" it cannot be used by any other party, leaving new entrants to pick from a list of \"free\" symbols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 The Samajwadi Party's bicycle symbol pictured on a flag during a 2017 rally.

Among the logos still up for grabs are an air conditioning unit, a tube of toothpaste and a vacuum cleaner.\n\nAn electronic voting machine being used in the 2019 elections shows party symbols alongside candidates' names.

Sethi, who for decades served as a draftsman for the ECI.\n\nFirst hired in the 1950s, as India organized its first post-independence elections, Sethi would sit with officials as they discussed everyday objects that could be easily remembered and identified by voters. He reportedly sketched his early symbols in pencil.\n\nSethi retired from the commission in the 1990s, although many of his designs remain in -- or available for -- use. New images reflecting contemporary life have also been added to the list, including a phone charger and a USB pen drive.\n\nCampaign devices\n\nThese seemingly simple logos can be crucial campaigning tools. They are visible across India during election time -- on banners, billboards, pamphlets and other materials -- as political groups vie for voters' attention.\n\nBut although parties use designs allocated to them, many have, over the years, become synonymous with their symbols.\n\nA child holds a symbol of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) party at an election campaign rally on April 5, 2019.

Or the raised, open-palmed hand that serves as a visual calling card for the main opposition, the Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nIn both instances, party symbols have evolved to possess significant political capital -- as evidenced by the wrangling that has occurred during internal party divisions. (When a split occurs within a party, the ECI decides which faction can continue using its symbol, with breakaway parties forced to return to the list of available images).\n\nWorld's tallest statue unveiled in India\n\nBetween 1952 and 1969, the Congress was represented by a pair of bulls pulling a yoke. A series of internal ruptures mean that today, when voters who wish to vote for the INC enter the polling booth, they'll have to look for the raised palm.\n\nThe changes result from internal splits dating back to the late 1960s, and the current symbol did not come into common use until the late 1970s.\n\nSome of the symbols made available to parties by the Electoral Commission of India.

In 1977, the group merged with other parties to form the Janata Party, adopting a farmer and plough as its new symbol.\n\nThree years later, the Janata Party was dissolved and its members established what is today known as the BJP. It was allocated a lotus symbol, which the party continues to use to this day.", "description": "A ceiling fan, a bungalow, a broom and a mango -- these\u00a0are just some of unusual symbols Indian voters can expect to see on ballots as they head to the polls.", "authors": ["Manveena Suri", "Oscar Holland"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190412122541-india-political-party-symbol-11-new-super-tease.jpg"}
