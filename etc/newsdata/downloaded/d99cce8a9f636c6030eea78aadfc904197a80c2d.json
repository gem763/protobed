But last night at New York\u2019s Downtime Bar, which was hosting an event called Actors Hour, described as a \u201cpop-up speakeasy designed for artists to indulge in the joy of performance,\u201d Weinstein showed up and sat at a private table, surrounded by men and several women, in a space allegedly dedicated to \u201cendless networking\u201d for up-and-coming young comedians, artists, dancers, and actors.\n\nWeinstein at Downtime Bar. Photo: Zoe Stuckless\n\nAs several New-York based performers who were in attendance have since reported, comedian Kelly Bachman was the first person to publicly call out Weinstein, beginning her set by asking, \u201cAre we going to address the elephant in the room? I didn\u2019t know that we had to bring our own Mace and rape whistles to Actors Hour.\u201d She was roundly booed and, as comedian Amber Crollo tweeted, \u201ctold to shut up.\u201d (Bachman and Crollo have since spoken to The Cut about the incident.)\n\nKeep getting new followers today is it because my tweets are so fire? lol fuck Weinstein and thanks @ambercrollo ILY #mysecondtweet pic.twitter.com/hLjWn5VM8Y \u2014 Kelly Bachman (@bellykachman) October 24, 2019\n\nAfter intermission, according to Crollo, \u201ca young woman started yelling about him being there. She was shouting and crying and seemed to be the only sane person there. SHE was kicked out [by the event organizers]. What the actual fuck?\u201d Actor and audience member Zoe Stuckless (who uses they/them pronouns) is the person in question; you can see the full confrontation in the video below:\n\nThis morning, the organizers behind Actors Hour \u2014 including actor and producer Alexandra Laliberte \u2014 posted a statement on Instagram about the incident, explaining that Weinstein was \u201cNOT invited\u201d and that they \u201capologize wholeheartedly for the way the situation was handled.\u201d Nearly every commenter on the post called the statement \u201cbullshit,\u201d with one person claiming that they\u2019d seen Weinstein at previous Actors Hour events. Crollo had previously tweeted that the organizers explicitly invited Weinstein. The Actors Hour\u2019s Instagram post has since been deleted.\n\nWeinstein has since provided a statement to TMZ via his reps: \u201cHarvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down. This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u201d\n\nTo get more of the story behind Weinstein\u2019s appearance and the event organizers\u2019 role in the incident, Vulture reached out to Stuckless, who had yet to share their story outside of their Facebook account. We also reached out to Actors Hour and Laliberte for comment, but have not yet heard back.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about how you ended up at the Actors Hour?\n\nI\u2019m an actor in NYC. I moved here relatively recently, about a year and a half ago, and I was going to school and finished up and have been working professionally and going to a lot of actor events, which is what the thing last night was. I\u2019m trying to be active in my community and in theater and film.\n\nIt\u2019s a private event \u2014 you have to get a ticket, and they don\u2019t tell you the address until you\u2019ve already gotten your ticket and it\u2019s close to the time of the event. A friend of mine had gotten me a free ticket, so she invited me. it was sort of pitched to me as an event that was meant for emerging artists \u2014 to give specifically young artists a platform, to create an open space for artistic creatives to share their developing work. It was musicians, comics, dancers.\n\nHow many people perform, usually?\n\nIt was my first time going, but at least in the first act, I would say there were at least 6 or so acts. Some were duos. There were musicians, comics.\n\nAnd how many people are in the room, total?\n\nMaybe 50 people. It\u2019s really small. So there was no way Harvey could have gone unnoticed.\n\nWhen did you notice Harvey was there?\n\nI\u2019d gotten there an hour early and he\u2019d gotten there maybe 30-45 minutes early. I noticed him come in, but I didn\u2019t realize it was him. He was using a walker. He didn\u2019t have his glasses on. He was very much presenting an image of this meeker, older person. I noticed him but didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nWho was he with?\n\nThere were two women on either side of him. Later 20s, early 30s model women. There was a blond guy, in a nice suit \u2014 he looked like a business type. They were sort of laughing and talking shop. And there was a guy who was sort of a scout \u2014 he seemed like a bodyguard. And a couple people came and went.\n\nWere people staring at him?\n\nNot really at all. When people did, the organizers would sort of stand in between his table and the rest of the crowd.\n\nWhen did you realize it was him?\n\nI was at the table right next to him, maybe five feet away. After awhile, my friend leaned over and was like, \u201cHey, I think that\u2019s Harvey Weinstein.\u201d And I looked over and I was like, \u201cShit, that looks a lot like him, but surely there\u2019s no way. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d be here, at this event specifically for the community that he terrorized for so long. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d be allowed to be here.\u201d So I pulled up pictures and was comparing them to him, but the people around us were like, \u201cOh no, there\u2019s no way, it\u2019s totally not him.\u201d\n\nSo I put it out of my mind a little bit. But as the show started and acts started going up, I kept looking back and being like, Is that him? I wasn\u2019t certain until the first comic [Kelly Bachman] came up and called him out.\n\nWhat did she say, exactly?\n\nShe opened up her set and said, \u201cCan we talk about the elephant in the room?\u201d The second she even said that, all the bartenders and a large portion of the crowd and the event organizers all started booing her.\n\nThe event organizers booed her?\n\nYes. They booed her \u2014 and she never actually said his name! I looked over at him and could see him put his head down and cover his face a little bit. After that, she said onstage that she was a survivor of rape, and she went on with her set as this whole crowd booed her. It was so strange. I started second guessing myself. I was like, The crowd must have been booing at him. Because clearly they would never boo at her for pointing him out.\n\nWhen her set finished, I was sure that the event organizers would come up and say something and remove him. Or that the event staff would quietly kick him out or something, or somebody would say something. Instead they just rushed into the next act.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nThe next few performers went up. And at that point, I was looking around, trying to see what everybody else was doing, trying to figure out what to do. I was waiting for somebody to say something, somebody who I felt would have had more authority than I did. I felt like I was just a nobody, an audience member; I had no reason to speak up.\n\nAnother comic went up, a man from out of town. He mentioned he was from Florida. And he started his set in the exact same way, by saying, \u201cWe gotta talk about the elephant in the room.\u201d I looked over at Weinstein and I was like, Now\u2019s the time, he\u2019ll say something. And the comic said, \u201cYeah, who\u2019s the elephant that produced Good Will Hunting? Cause that shit was amazing!\u201d\n\nWow. Do you know who that was?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know his name. He did his set and walked off the stage, and walked through this tiny bar, and goes past Weinstein\u2019s table. He stops, they exchange a couple of joking words, and they\u2019re like laughing and smiling.\n\nAt that point, there was some little part of me that was still sure that somebody else would say something. And they didn\u2019t. They went into the next thing. I knew the show was going toward the intermission, and so I said to myself that if nobody else said anything, by the time we got to the intermission, I would say something. And the intermission hit; nobody said anything. Nobody did anything.\n\nI stood up and I walked over to Weinstein\u2019s table and I said something to the effect of, \u201cHey guy. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Because I wanted him to say it. And he didn\u2019t say anything. And I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d And I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Zoe. What\u2019s your name?\u201d His posse, his group of men and a bunch of women \u2014 which was so gross \u2014 they all started being like, \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business, you don\u2019t have a right to ask that question. Go away.\u201d That\u2019s when the video starts.\n\nThen they kicked me out, which I completely expected. They sort of gradually herded me up the stairs. But a bunch of the performers had come out with me, and left with me. So there were a lot of people that were like, \u201cThank you for speaking up. I felt the same way and didn\u2019t think that I could, or I had enough power to.\u201d [Bachman], who had been booed into submission, thanked me, which was so strange. Because I wouldn\u2019t have said anything if she hadn\u2019t.\n\nHave you heard from anyone today from the event\u2019s side?\n\nNobody has talked to me directly. I went on the [Actors Hour] Instagram page and saw they\u2019d released a statement. They \u201chadn\u2019t invited him and were so sorry and they totally would\u2019ve intervened if they noticed.\u201d But the fact is, the team prioritized his comfort over the comfort of the people that they were supposedly creating the event for.\n\nAnd you saw that they noticed he was there?\n\nThey absolutely noticed. I was reading through comments from others and they were like, \u201cHe was there the last time I performed. He reserved a table last time.\u201d\n\nOh my God.\n\nSomebody I know who\u2019s friends with the creator [Laliberte] told me that she made a personal post saying that she was upset somebody had spoken out. It was so surreal. I was so certain that, especially in this community, of course somebody with power has got to stand up. Somebody must. And then nobody did. It\u2019s stunning that it\u2019s so easy and so quick to slip back into that same culture of silence that allowed him to do all of those horrendous things.", "description": "Harvey Weinstein was confronted by an actor at Downtime Bar in New York City on OCtober 23, 2019.
