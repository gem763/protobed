And both Speier and Lynch have publicly stated they are running.\n\nConnolly has not officially declared, saying he wanted to delay his decision out of respect for Cummings. But he privately began informing colleagues this week he intends to jump into the race very soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking soundings,\u201d Connolly told The Hill on Tuesday. \u201cWhat I mean by that is I\u2019m talking to leadership, talking to Steering Committee members, talking to colleagues on the committee and off the committee.\u201d\n\nWhen told that Democratic colleagues believe he will run, Connolly replied: \u201cThey are certainly not wrong about my passion for the race and my desire to make my contribution at a time that is very critical for the country.\u201d\n\nOversight is one of three committees leading the impeachment investigation into Trump \u2013 along with Intelligence and Foreign Affairs \u2013 and some Democrats have suggested that a more polished communicator like Speier or Connolly, who are both a frequent presence on cable news shows, would be a stronger chair for a high-stakes moment in politics.\n\nRaskin, too, is a respected communicator and frequent guest on MSNBC. The former American University constitutional law professor has also been a sherpa of sorts for House Democrats navigating constitutional issues, including impeachment and the Emoluments Clause.\n\nBut Maloney appears to have the backing of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus. While the 53-member CBC has not formally endorsed Maloney, many of its members have said they are backing the 14-term New York congresswoman because she is the most senior member.\n\n\u201cI always value seniority and I\u2019m going to continue to support seniority,\u201d said Rep.

Lacy Clay William (Lacy) Lacy ClaySpeier to run for Oversight gavel Maloney to serve as acting Oversight chairwoman after Cummings's death The Hill's Morning Report - Trump grapples with Turkey controversy MORE (D-Mo.), neither of whom are running this time around.\n\nHowever, some Democrats pointed out that it was Cummings who beat out a more senior Maloney in the race to lead the Oversight panel back in 2010. The CBC backed Cummings in that contest.\n\nThe Oversight vacancy created by Cummings\u2019s death will be filled permanently during the second week of November after a two-week congressional recess, said Rep. Katherine Clark Katherine Marlea ClarkHouse passes third bill aimed at preventing foreign election interference Massachusetts Democrats call for 100 percent fentanyl screening of international mail from 'high-risk' nations Ten notable Democrats who do not favor impeachment MORE (D-Mass.), the Democratic caucus vice chair.\n\nThe Speaker-aligned Steering Committee, which includes members of leadership and regional representatives, will hear from the candidates first and make a recommendation to the full Democratic caucus. Those 234 Democrats will then vote on whether or not to accept the recommendation.\n\nLynch, who chairs Oversight\u2019s National Security subcommittee, touted his background as a former attorney in his pitch for the gavel.\n\n\"I'm an attorney, so I'm familiar with multi-party and complex litigation. That's sort of what we've got going on between us and the White House and State Department and the courts,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cSo I think I can help a great deal in that respect.\u201d\n\nWhile some Democrats are emphasizing seniority, others are arguing that diversity should be a factor. If Lynch or Connolly are selected, these Democrats said, that will mean there will be four white male committee chairmen leading the impeachment probe of Trump. The others are Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' House votes to recognize Armenian genocide MORE (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid House approves Turkey sanctions in rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump House votes to recognize Armenian genocide MORE (D-N.Y.) and Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerDemocrats unveil impeachment procedures Officials say foreign governments should not investigate presidential political opponents Dem committee chairs blast Trump G-7 announcement MORE (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cI think Jackie would be stronger for this moment because she is a good communicator and sits on the Intelligence Committee too,\u201d said one House Democrat, \u201cbut Maloney may be better for the long haul because of her experience.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Cristina Marcos contributed", "description": "Two key members of \u201cThe Squad\u201d \u2014 progressive freshman Reps.
