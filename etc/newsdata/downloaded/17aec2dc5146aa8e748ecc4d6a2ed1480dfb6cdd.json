Why would you ... ? No, no,\u201d he stammered before abruptly getting up and leaving the room.\n\nAn hour later, after negotiating with a Warner Bros agent, Phoenix returned to finish the interview, explaining that he panicked because he hadn\u2019t yet considered the question. Throughout the rest of the article, Phoenix does not provide an answer.\n\nIn \u201cJoker,\u201d Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a loner with an unsuccessful comedy career who lives with his ailing mother, telling the backstory of the man who would one day become Batman\u2019s arch nemesis. As Collin writes, \u201che could easily be the latest online message-board extremist to take his grievances murderously viral.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Hollywood Reporter review, two scenes are particularly hair-raising: one in which Fleck suddenly guns down a colleague point-blank, and another in which riots erupt among his supporters.\n\nCollin\u2019s question about the power of fictional violence to influence real-world crime is a matter that hit home for the Batman franchise with the 2012 release of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d A dozen movie goers were killed and 70 were injured during a showing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, when a gunman with orange-dyed hair opened fire in the theater. According to police, he called himself \u201cthe Joker.\u201d The shooter has since been sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nIn a recent interview with SFX magazine, Phoenix acknowledged that while the violence in \u201cJoker\u201d is \u201ca little more visceral and raw\u201d than films such as the Avengers series, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitation about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always want it to feel real, and you want the little violence that we have to have an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens in a lot of movies is that you get numb to it, you\u2019re killing 40,000 people, you don\u2019t feel it. While being a fictional story in a fictional world, you always want it to feel real. Everything that happens in this movie as far as violence goes, you feel it.\u201d", "description": "The actor's latest film has prompted questions about targeted violence on screen.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d87b27b2300002905d4ade2.jpeg?cache=3khtehodhv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
