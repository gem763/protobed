In addition, the family will be forced to give up another $1.5 billion through the sale of their ownership stake in another of its pharmaceutical companies, Mundipharma.\n\nA handful of attorney generals said the agreement will ensure the compensation will come from Purdue and the Sackler family rather than through bankruptcy, should the pharmaceutical company choose to file.\n\nA bottle of prescription painkiller OxyContin, 40mg pills, made by Purdue Pharma L.D. sit on a counter at a local pharmacy, in Provo, Utah, U.S., April 25, 2017.

The company has been received considerable blame for the widespread use of opioid painkillers throughout the country following an aggressive OxyContin marketing campaign that downplayed the drug\u2019s addictive qualities and ultimately led to extensive opiate overprescribing.\n\n\u201cPurdue Pharma continues to work with all plaintiffs on reaching a comprehensive resolution to its opioid litigation that will deliver billions of dollars and vital opioid overdose rescue medicines to communities across the country impacted by the opioid crisis,\u201d a spokesperson for Purdue Pharma said in a recent statement.\n\nWednesday\u2019s development may possibly indicate the end of tense negotiations in an effort to reach a nationwide settlement with Purdue, with one source claiming over 20 states have already agreed to the tentative settlement.\n\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina were not among the states to participate in Wednesday\u2019s agreement, vowing instead to continue their lawsuits against Purdue and the Sackler family in bankruptcy court.\n\nPurdue and the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement in March with Oklahoma in a move to avoid a trial on the effects of Purdue Pharma on the opioid epidemic in that state.\n\nMeanwhile, most state attorneys continue to oppose the settlement, with more than 20 suing the Sackler family separately in state court.\n\nOpioid addiction has caused the deaths of upwards of 400,000 Americans throughout the past two decades.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Purdue Pharma, the makers of notorious opioid painkiller OxyContin, have reached a tentative settlement on Wednesday with attorney's representing over 2,000 local governments and organizations for their role in creating the nation's widespread opioid epidemic.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/OxyContin20pills20Purdue20Pharma20RTR20FBN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
