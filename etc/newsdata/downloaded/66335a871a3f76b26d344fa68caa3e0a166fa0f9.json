Three others\u2014Baker, Jackson and Okaloosa\u2014wouldn\u2019t say whether they have authorized the move.\n\nNone of the state\u2019s largest 25 districts, including Miami-Dade, Broward and Orange, have approved the program. With the exception of Bay County, home to Panama City, they all are small, mostly rural counties.\n\nGuns in Schools In 2019, so far 18 states have considered legislation related to arming school employees. Much of it concerns allowing firearms for designated security personnel, but some bills address arming teachers and staff more broadly.

It allowed for the arming of certain school personnel, but not teachers, who volunteered and underwent training and background checks.\n\nThis year, lawmakers passed a school-security bill that expanded the guardian program to allow teachers to participate if a county school board approves, despite opposition from many educators, parents and students. A state commission created in the wake of the Parkland shooting recommended it, along with other safety measures.\n\nRelated Video Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims.\n\nAt least eight other states, including Kansas and Texas, allow some teachers or other school employees to have guns, according to the Education Commission of the States, which tracks legislation.\n\nThere are now 3,156 law-enforcement officers and 1,062 guardians assigned to Florida\u2019s public schools, according to a presentation last month by the state\u2019s Department of Education. The agency didn\u2019t break out how many of the guardians are teachers, but based on school district responses to the Journal, it likely is a tiny fraction.\n\nIn Bay County, school board members approved the arming of teachers as an added layer of security, said Bill Husfelt, the schools superintendent. He was involved in a 2010 incident that he said left the school district scarred. A disgruntled man entered the school board\u2019s meeting room and shot at Mr. Husfelt and other members, missing them all before getting shot by a security guard and committing suicide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet these fears and challenges head on,\u201d Mr. Husfelt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to give the teachers another way when possible.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What benefits or drawbacks do you see to arming schoolteachers? Join the conversation below.\n\nFlorida Senate President Bill Galvano said he and other supporters of the measure sought to fulfill the recommendations of the state commission. They wanted to give school districts a variety of options, from traditional school resource officers to newly trained guardians.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that they have adequate security,\u201d Mr. Galvano said. \u201cWe wanted to give them an additional tool.\u201d\n\nFedrick Ingram, president of the Florida Education Association, the state teachers union, said the policy burdens instructors with an enormous responsibility for which they have little expertise. It also could endanger students if any were to get hold of a firearm inadvertently left unguarded, he said.\n\nSheriff Bob Gualtieri spoke at a news conference on school safety initiatives in Sunrise, Fla., on Aug. 14.

The incidents included a teacher unintentionally firing a gun in class during a safety demonstration and a loaded gun falling from a teacher\u2019s waistband on a school playground.\n\nPrograms to arm teachers are \u201ca potential liability waiting to happen,\u201d said Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, a consulting firm that provides violence-prevention training. \u201cThe vast majority of superintendents and principals and school boards have absolutely no desire to arm their staff.\u201d\n\nWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com", "description": "As a new school year starts in Florida, the state\u2019s plan to allow armed teachers as a defense against shootings has fallen flat.", "authors": ["Arian Campo-Flores", "Arian.Campo-Flores Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104255/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
