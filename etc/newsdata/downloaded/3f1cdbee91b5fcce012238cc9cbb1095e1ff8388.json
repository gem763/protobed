Usually a political party puts its manifesto in the Queen\u2019s Speech. The PM is putting his manifesto into the Queen\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nRemainer MP Anna Soubry added: \u201cIf Johnson does somehow secure a withdrawal agreement with the EU, then he will struggle to get it through Parliament.\n\n\u201cHis best bet would be to make any agreement conditional on a people\u2019s vote.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson said: \u201cGetting Brexit done by 31st October is absolutely crucial. We are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nUK and EU negotiators are having \u201cintense technical \u00addiscussions\u201d on the proposed deal throughout this weekend.\n\nBut yesterday the DUP cast a shadow over the compromise.\n\nAny deal is likely to involve the UK enforcing the EU\u2019s rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nIn a classic fudge, the province would be in both the EU and UK customs unions.\n\nThat would allow it to benefit from UK trade deals with the rest of the world.\n\nBut DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \u201cNorthern Ireland must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop.\u201d\n\nOf the \u00a3220,000 the State Opening costs the taxpayer, \u00a3171,000 is for temporarily clearing Westminster of anti-terror barriers and reinstalling them afterwards.\n\nPolice overtime runs to \u00a310,000 and 1,100 troops will line the route of the royal trip from \u00adBuckingham Palace to the Lords while 200 mounted Household Cavalry escort the Queen\u2019s carriage.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Boris Johnson has asked Queen to read Tory election manifesto at tomorrow's State Opening of Parliament - before he plans to dissolve it just a week later", "authors": ["Nigel Nelson", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567417.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_School-funding.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
