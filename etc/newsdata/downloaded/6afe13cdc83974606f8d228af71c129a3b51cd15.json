Lindsey Graham Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe rules of the Sunday political talk-show format hold that members of both parties send out representatives to recite their talking points on the controversy of the week. To qualify as \u201ctalking points,\u201d you do not need either correct facts or a coherent argument in which to order them. You just need words, ideally ones that at least sound like they\u2019re related to the subject, to fulfill the basic function of allowing you to fill your allotted time with something other than silence.\n\nLindsey Graham\u2019s appearance on Face the Nation to defend President Trump\u2019s conduct in the Ukraine scandal managed to satisfy the criteria of the genre, though perhaps just barely.\n\nGraham\u2019s major talking point was the the accusations against Trump amount to \u201chearsay.\u201d He repeated the phrase 11 times, as though it were an incantation that, by magic, would cause the pile of evidence against Trump to disappear. For instance, he declared: \u201cIt\u2019s all hearsay. You can\u2019t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistle-blower didn\u2019t hear the phone call.\u201d\n\nBut of course the evidence against Trump is not hearsay. All the basic facts of the plot have been confessed openly by the principles. The main charge is that Trump sent his personal lawyer to convince another country to investigate his political rival. Both the lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Trump have openly boasted about this for months. Trump has also admitted publicly that he ordered a halt to aid for Ukraine to increase leverage for his demand, and that he did so in order to force Ukraine to investigate \u201ccorruption,\u201d a word he helpfully translated as code for \u201cBiden.\u201d\n\nIn addition to all that evidence, there is plenty of additional supporting evidence, some of which was reported by a CIA agent whistle-blower. The agent followed protocol by reporting their findings to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, who found them to be serious and credible. The journalist interviewing Graham, Margaret Brennan, noted that many allegations in the whistle-blower report have been independently verified in the time since \u2014 including the account of one of the phone calls between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAt this point in the interview, as Brennan began listing ways in which the whistle-blower report has been corroborated, Graham tried to interrupt her repeatedly, then announced, \u201cYou\u2019ve got an opinion, I\u2019ve got an opinion.\u201d\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: The whistleblower complaint is just hearsay.\n\n\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the whistleblower complaint is matched by the call record in numerous ways.\n\n\n\nGRAHAM: Well, you\u2019ve got an opinion, I've got an opinion. pic.twitter.com/2L5sweS64L \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 29, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no question of opinion! If the facts have been confirmed, they\u2019re definitely not hearsay. Graham just continued using the word \u201chearsay,\u201d even after Brennan had indisputably shown that the whistle-blower\u2019s account contained confirmed facts. If somebody hears about a crime, and then authorities check it out and discover the crime occurred, the perp doesn\u2019t get to walk because there was originally \u201chearsay.\u201d That is not how the law works.", "description": "Lindsey Graham\u2019s appearance on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d to defend President Trump\u2019s conduct in the Ukraine scandal relied on calling the massive amount of evidence of wrongdoing \u201chearsay,\u201d even though the facts have been corroborated.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/29/29-lindsey-graham-closeup.w1200.h630.jpg"}
