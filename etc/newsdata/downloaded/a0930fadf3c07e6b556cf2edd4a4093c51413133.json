Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRockets\u2019 general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for the tweet, which he swiftly deleted over the weekend, but his support for protests in the Chinese-ruled city angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team\u2019s business partners in a key NBA market.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey tweeted on Monday.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d he said, adding that he had since heard and considered other perspectives.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for Houston and helped build the NBA\u2019s following in China.\n\nMorey\u2019s initial tweet included an image captioned: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIt prompted sportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center to suspend work with the Rockets, while the team\u2019s games were dropped by China\u2019s state broadcaster.\n\nThe post was later deleted and Morey said his views did not represent the team or NBA.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said it recognised Morey\u2019s views have \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d it said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers said the NBA response was shameful and showed how China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the United States.\n\n\u201cAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong,\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said on Twitter. \u201cNow, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.\u201d\n\nOther legislators accused the NBA, no stranger to American politics, of a double standard when it comes to China.\n\nNBA stars and some coaches have been outspoken in their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has encouraged players to speak out on issues of concern, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.\n\n\u201cAnd the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our gov\u2019t, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov\u2019t. This is shameful and cannot stand,\u201d New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.\n\nThe Rockets are in Japan for a preseason exhibition against the Toronto Raptors. Star player James Harden said after a practice on Monday the controversy had not affected the players.\n\n\u2018LONG TIME TO REPAIR\u2019\n\nThe furore is another example of an overseas business caught in the politics of the Hong Kong protests, which have plunged the city into its worst political crisis in decades and pose a major challenge to Beijing.\n\nAmazon.com faced a backlash in August after Chinese social media users found T-shirts on its website with slogans supporting the protests.\n\nChinese internet users also blacklisted bubble tea brands from Taiwan after a Hong Kong franchise urged solidarity with protesters.\n\nJoseph Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, said the damage from Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cwill take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning also condemned Morey\u2019s initial tweet. \u201cWe have already stopped our cooperation with the Houston Rockets, and continue to urge them to give a clear answer on this matter,\u201d it said on the Weibo platform.\n\nChina\u2019s SPD Bank suspended marketing activities and publicity with the NBA team, and state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s sports channel said it would halt any further broadcasts of Rockets\u2019 games.\n\nChina\u2019s consulate in Houston also issued a statement saying it \u201cmade stern representations to the Rockets and requested them to clarify, to immediately correct any mistakes, and to eliminate any negative influences.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by former Rockets star Yao, said it was suspending \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the team.\n\nFans in China expressed their anger on social media, with some calling for a boycott of the Rockets.\n\n\u201cI watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I\u2019m still a Chinese person first and foremost,\u201d one user said.", "description": "The National Basketball Association came under fire on Monday for its response to a tweet by a Houston Rockets official in support of Hong Kong protests for democracy, the latest overseas business to run afoul of political issues in China.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437911665&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950FK", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
