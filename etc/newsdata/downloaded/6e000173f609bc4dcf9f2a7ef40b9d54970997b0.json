In 2018, actual resettlement numbers were less than half that fiscal year\u2019s ceiling of 45,000.\n\nIn his first year in office, Trump slashed the Obama administration\u2019s fiscal year 2017 cap on refugee admissions from 110,000 to 50,000.\n\nWhile the Trump administration is required to consult Congress before imposing the new lower limit on refugee admissions, it is unlikely to result in an increase in the number of refugees beyond the 18,000 sought by the president.\n\nAt the same time as the administration announced plans to cut admissions of refugees, Trump issued his executive order that allows states and municipalities to not accept any refugees being resettled.\n\nWhile President Trump frequently characterizes large numbers of immigrants as dangerous criminals, it\u2019s important to note that refugees are the most heavily vetted of all people who arrive in the U.S.\n\nThe result: communities and states led by elected officials with ulterior motives will lose one of their few sources of much-needed population growth. And what little refugee resettlement remains will be slowed down by additional layers of consent from state and local authorities for each refugee waiting to be resettled.\n\nThis harms us as a country, for multiple reasons.\n\nThe cap alone undermines our security, as top military officials past and present have argued. A year ago, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis wrote a memo in which he argued against scaling back refugee admissions from the cap then set at 45,000.\n\nMattis said that Iraqis who \u201chave risked their own lives and their families\u2019 lives\u201d by helping the U.S. in wartime should be able to gain admission to the U.S. as refugees.\n\nWhat will happen next time America needs citizens of another country to help us in wartime? If they know they will be denied admission to the U.S. even if facing threats of death as a result of working with our armed forces, why will they help us?\n\nJust weeks ago, Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to half a dozen countries in the Middle East and Asia, talked about the importance of U.S. leadership regarding refugees.\n\n\u201cHow we lead, the example we set, is extremely important globally,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cIf we are seen as stepping up to the challenge, others are likely to do the same. If we don\u2019t, an already desperate humanitarian crisis will get worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo shut down refugee admissions frankly would be a repudiation of what America is all about. Refugees are us,\u201d Crocker added. \u201cThey always have been in this country. This is about American values and this is about American security.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not all it\u2019s about.\n\nThe lower limit on refugee admissions, combined with the executive order, puts American workers and their families at risk in places where refugees are a workforce and economic boon.\n\nAs CityLab reported in January, refugees have helped save Rust Belt cities and others from population loss, or at least have lessened the blow. These are cities such as Clarkston, Ga.; Lancaster, Pa.; and Southfield, Mich.\n\n\u201cNot only do [refugees] fill jobs in a tight labor market, they are some of the most dedicated and motivated workers in the U.S. workforce,\u201d says Gideon Maltz, executive director of the Tent Partnership for Refugees, an organization that works with businesses to support refugees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cFundamentally, refugees return more to the economy than they take \u2013 and the United States stands to lose greatly by continuing to cut their numbers,\u201d Maltz added.\n\nIdaho is a great example of how refugees help conservative America thrive. The state is home to the third-largest dairy industry in the country. And Idaho\u2019s unemployment rate is only 2.9 percent, which is practically full employment.\n\nThe dwindling number of refugees resettled in Idaho since the 2016 election already had the dairy industry worried. The administration\u2019s desire to further slash refugee resettlement will send shockwaves through an Idaho industry already buffeted by the trade war.\n\nWhile President Trump frequently characterizes large numbers of immigrants as dangerous criminals, it\u2019s important to note that refugees are the most heavily vetted of all people who arrive in the U.S. The process already takes years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe know what\u2019s going to come next: In some of the same towns where refugees have contributed the most, certain politicians may choose to deny the infusion of population, fresh ideas and belief in the American Dream. They will be following the lead of President Trump, who is clearly ready to sacrifice America\u2019s future in pursuit of a political agenda to close us off from the world.\n\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Our country is hurtling down a shameful path \u2013 one in which we undermine our security, our economy, and our own moral leadership in the world.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ALI NOORANI", "description": "The lower limit on refugee admissions, combined with the executive order, puts American workers and their families at risk in places where refugees are a workforce and economic boon.", "authors": ["Ali Noorani", "Ali Noorani Is The Executive Director Of The National Immigration Forum", "Author Of", "There Goes The Neighborhood", "Host Of The Podcast", "Only In America.", "He Can Be Found On Twitter At"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/10/694940094001_6084883980001_6084877190001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
