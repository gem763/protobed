The board was set to fire the fallen manager, the Mail understands, and Woodford decided to jump before he was pushed.\n\nShares in Patient Capital fell 8.6pc, or 3.25p, to 34.4p, taking losses since its peak to 71pc.\n\nThe departure from all three funds has triggered the collapse of his Woodford Investment Management firm after just five years.\n\nIncome Focus was Woodford's third offering, launched in March 2017. It initially pulled in \u00a3553m from savers. At its peak in October 2017, it was worth \u00a3747m. Last night it was valued at just \u00a3253m.\n\nMany of the companies held by the Income Focus fund were also held by the Equity Income fund.\n\nTraders now know that Blackrock, which is winding down the Equity Income fund, will sell its holdings as quickly as possible.\n\nMany of the companies held by Woodford's Income Focus fund were also held by the Equity Income fund\n\nSo as Blackrock begins its fire sale, this will likely drag down the value of the Income Focus fund further. Both funds are overseen by Link Fund Solutions.\n\nThe demise of his firm, which at one stage employed 85 staff, puts 30 jobs at risk.\n\nChristopher Brown, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove, said: \u2018This debacle has destroyed Neil Woodford\u2019s reputation,\u2019\n\nAdrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, said: \u2018This is truly shocking. We have seen the complete demise of the most famous fund manager the UK has seen for years.\u2019\n\nWoodford said: \u2018I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.\u2019\n\nThe collapse follows a period of dire performance for all three of his funds. Woodford Patient Capital Trust shares have fallen nearly 66pc since they floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2015.\n\nAnyone who invested \u00a31,000 at the launch would now be sitting on just \u00a3344. Investors can still buy or sell the trust\u2019s shares, but if they sold right now they would crystallise a heavy loss.\n\nWoodford has never taken a fee for managing the Patient Capital Trust, as its performance was too poor. The trust\u2019s board said last night: \u2018In light of recent events, Woodford Investment Management Limited has today served notice of termination in relation to its role as portfolio manager.\u2019\n\nIt said the board was \u2018in advanced discussions\u2019 with prospective new managers, but did not say whether the new team would keep the trust running or sell its assets to return cash to investors.\n\nWoodford had been trying to cling on to his business since his main fund was frozen in June but has been unable to turn it around\n\nWoodford must now serve his six-month notice period at the Income Focus fund, and three - month spell at the Patient Capital Trust, before closing down his entire fund management empire, Woodford Investment Management.\n\nHe had been trying to cling on to his business since June, when Link suspended his Equity Income fund after he ran out of cash to repay savers fleeing for the exit.\n\nHe had hoped to reopen the fund in December, after selling some of its holdings, but Link decided yesterday that this would not be possible.\n\nAJ Bell\u2019s Ryan Hughes said: \u2018The closure of Woodford Investment Management had a feeling of inevitability about it. It was difficult to see how the business could survive.\u2019 JP Morgan\u2019s Brown said the best outcome for investors in the trust would be to put it into an \u2018orderly run-off\u2019, as is happening with the Equity Income fund.", "description": "Just hours after being sacked from his flagship Equity Income fund, the 59-year-old quit as manager of Patient Capital Trust and his third vehicle, Income Focus.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
