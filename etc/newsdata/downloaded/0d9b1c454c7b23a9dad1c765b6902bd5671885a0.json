I was a bit of a nerd so I skipped a few grades to finish school at 15.\n\n'I came to Australia with my parents to study aviation at 16 and had my pilot licence by the age of 18.'\n\nNeel founded Soar Aviation as a 22-year-old, which is now Australia's biggest flying school\n\nWithin four years, the young instructor was questioning his boss about the planes he had after hearing about smaller, cheaper and more efficient aircraft being built in Europe.\n\n'Every Friday night, we would catch up for a beer and one night, I decided to give him a few ideas about how to run his business,' Khokhani recalled.\n\n'He took it quite personally and said \"If you think you can run a flying school better than me, then go and start your own\".'\n\n'Being 22 and with $5000 in savings, I was shocked, scared and nervous about having to support myself. But it turned out to be a good thing and never looked back.'\n\nSoar Aviation's success began to take off as one-time customers came back for repeat lessons.\n\nNeel Khokhani's (pictured with wife Marianna) rise as an entrepreneur as been a bumpy ride\n\nIn 2016, the company joined forces with Box Hill Institute to offer evening theory lessons and weekend practical lessons in an effort to address a worldwide shortage of pilots.\n\nSince then, flying school's growth has sky-rocketed by almost 600 per cent as it nears a turnover of $20 million.\n\nKhokhani admits keeping up with the overwhelming success of his aviation school on top of dealing with his industry's red tape has been a struggle.\n\n'The biggest lesson I've learned over the last eight years is to never to give up,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'There have been so many instances where I felt down and out and had countless discussions with my wife of it being too hard. But I've learned with every difficult period faced, success follows.'\n\nNeel started up his own flying school after he was sacked by his boss for suggesting ideas\n\nHe told Smart Company earlier this year: 'Going from $3 million to $12 million \u2014 300 per cent growth \u2014 that's nearly a per cent a day. If you go for a three week holiday, you come back and the business has completely changed.\n\n'You pick new processes to implement, but they're outdated by the time you finish implementing them. It's really posed a lot of challenges.'\n\nKhokhani is seeing his hard work and persistence pay off.\n\n'Coming to Australia as an immigrant and building a something from nothing in such a short space of time has been a huge accomplishment,' he said.\n\n'But what I'm most proud of is that in the last two years, the majority of our 65 graduates are now working as pilots for commercial charters or an airline.'\n\n'I don't think too much about being on Australia's Young Rich List or how much I'm worth.'\n\nAviation school entrepreneur Neel Khokhani, 30, (pictured) has built a $66million fortune\n\nHe sold 50 per cent of the company to private equity investor The Growth Fund last year and remains heavily involved as chief executive.\n\n'My focus is on building the school so it can continue to grow and be successful in helping the aviation industry,' he said.\n\nThe growth of his company has meant Khokhani hadn't been behind the controls in the cockpit in four-and-a-half years until recently.\n\n'It was a bit windy and bumpy, but it's like riding a bike \u2013 it all comes back to you when you're up there,' he told Australian Financial Review Magazine.\n\nHe had this advice for budding entrepreneurs.\n\n'You need patience,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'When I speak to my generation, so many don't have the patience and all want success 30 seconds into future.\n\n'It takes two to five years of hard work to see success in the long term.'", "description": "An high-flying aviation school entrepreneur has soared into Australia's Young Rich List for the first time.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/03/19973626-0-image-a-2_1571626506718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
