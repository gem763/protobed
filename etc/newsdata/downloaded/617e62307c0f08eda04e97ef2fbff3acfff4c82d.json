In wins over Holy Cross and East Carolina, Navy (2-0, 1-0 AAC) allowed a total of 17 points. Opponents are averaging 226.5 yards against the Midshipmen, which ranks No. 3 nationally just behind Memphis.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been completely dominant,\u201d Memphis coach Mike Norvell said.\n\nHistorically, Navy\u2019s strength is on offense, and the Midshipmen are averaging a smidge under 500 yards a game so far with 372 rushing - tops in the country. Quarterback Malcolm Perry leads the attack averaging 92 yards rushing a game.\n\nPerry has completed 11 of 16 passes all season. But one pass to CJ Williams went 80 yards for a touchdown against East Carolina, and Perry finished 5 of 7 for 151 yards passing in a 42-10 victory.\n\nLike Navy, Memphis (3-0) had almost two weeks to prepare for its conference opener since a 42-6 win over South Alabama on Sept. 14.\n\nNew defensive coordinator Adam Fuller used the extra days to put together a strategy to offset Navy\u2019s triple option, which has been troublesome for Memphis\u2018 defense in recent years.\n\nThe Tigers have greatly improved on defense from last season when they ranked 94th in points allowed and 89th in total defense. So far, they\u2019re giving up 226.3 yards this season.\n\nSome other things to know about Navy and Memphis before kickoff:\n\nNAVY DOMINANCE\n\nIn the four games in this series since 2015, the Midshipmen are 3-1, including last year\u2019s 22-21 win at Annapolis in rainy conditions. Memphis turned it over four times that day. The Tigers\u2019 only win came in 2011 in the last game between the teams in Memphis.\n\nDEFENSIVE DOMINANCE\n\nThe Midshipmen allowed only 64 yards rushing to Holy Cross and limited East Carolina to 86 yards on the ground. It\u2019s the first time Navy\u2019s defense has held the opposition under 100 yards rushing in successive games since 2008. The pass defense has been sharp as well. East Carolina managed 222 yards in total offense, the fewest Navy has ever allowed against an AAC opponent.\n\nNavy also is allowing just 8.5 points a game, good for No. 2 in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly doing some good things, but we\u2019ve got a long, long way to go to be a good defense and our players know that,\u201d Navy defensive coordinator Brian Newberry said.\n\nQUITE THE COMPARISON\n\nNiumatalolo gave quite the nod to the Tigers because it\u2019s not often that Memphis is mentioned in same breath as Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing the best team, probably them and Notre Dame, two of the better teams athletically and size-wise that we\u2019ll play all year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really tough game for us.\u201d\n\nEXPERIENCE HELPS\n\nSeveral of Memphis\u2018 key defensive starters have at least played against the triple option. Even though it is difficult to replicate the speed of Navy\u2019s offense, there is some familiarity for players like defensive end Bryce Huff and linebacker Austin Hall. Hall had seven tackles last year, including three for losses.\n\nFuller also has experience against the triple option from coaching at Chattanooga going against Wofford, The Citadel and Georgia Southern.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the experience going against opponent is that guys have seen the speed of it,\u201d Norvell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t simulate the speed we are going to face.\n\nEARLY SUCCESS\n\nThis year marks the third time in four years under Norvell that Memphis has started 3-0. The Tigers lost their fourth game in both 2016 and 2017. Norvell can win his 30th game with the Tigers on Thursday night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Navy and Memphis are two of the three undefeated teams in the American Athletic Conference.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Clay Bailey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/ECU_Navy_Football_98237.jpg-f2657_c0-113-2700-1687_s1770x1032.jpg?ada1a753e771e954e17b2f4ff5a15033f24a0dea", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
