Stranger Things fans claimed on Monday that they have discovered a clue about the identity of 'The American' as Russian translation sheds light on Jim Hopper's fate\n\nAccording to the Reddit users, the Russian soldiers who spoke of their prisoner used the male version of the term 'American' when they whispered.\n\nThis could mean that Hopper has actually been taken captive following the dramatic end of the season that saw him disappear.\n\nThe police chief had broken into a secret Russian base to close the gate to the Upside Down alongside Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), and is unable to leave the room where the portal is based.\n\nDespite his potential demise, the police chief encourages Joyce to go through with their plan to activate the gate machine shutdown, and when she looks back into the room Hopper has disappeared.\n\nPotential clue: According to Reddit users, the Russian soldiers used the male version of the term 'American' when they whispered about their prisoner, which could refer to Hopper\n\nThis comes after David called the Duffer Brothers in the middle of an interview to demand answers about his character's 'death' in season three.\n\nSpeaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers earlier this month, the actor said: 'Well, here\u2019s the thing. I always knew that Hopper had to make a sacrifice.\n\n'Like, he\u2019s a jerk, and he also needs to pay for that in some way\u2026 so I thought he\u2019d make the sacrifice.'\n\nThe star then began to worry about his future on the show, telling the host 'I haven\u2019t gotten many phone calls', before making the decision to call Matt and Ross Duffer live on air.\n\nDetermined to get some answers about his fate, he asked: \u201cAm I dead? Is Hopper dead?\u2019\n\nTo which the TV producer Ross responded: 'I mean, we\u2019re still figuring it out, David.'\n\nThe show has been renewed for season four, but no release date has been set.", "description": "On Monday, Russian fans claimed they've discovered a clue about the identity of 'The American' that was spoken of in the final scene of the third season.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20050800-0-image-a-48_1571773093030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
