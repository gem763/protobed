But in recent years the company has developed into a smaller NGS player, where a wider range or all genes are sequenced.\n\nAs part of a 15-year collaboration deal with NGS pioneer Illumina (O: ), Qiagen will rely on its genetic diagnostic products running on its new partner's hardware.\n\nSchatz, who will become a special adviser to the supervisory board, had been with the company for 27 years. Since he started as finance chief in 1993, Qiagen has grown from $2 million in annual revenues to $1.5 billion in 2018.", "description": "Qiagen CEO quits amid genetic sequencing U-turn, shares tumble", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970NH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
