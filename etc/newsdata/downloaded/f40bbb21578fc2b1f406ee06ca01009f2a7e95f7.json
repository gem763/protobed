The win \u2014 which took just 44 minutes, the shortest so far in this year\u2019s tournament \u2014marked her 100th career singles victory at the US Open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unbelievable, literally, because from when I first started here \u2014 I think I was 16 \u2014 I never thought that I would get to 100. It didn\u2019t even cross my mind or [that] I would still be out here,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut I love what I do. I love coming out with you guys. It\u2019s so special. I never want to let it go.\u201d\n\nShe is now just one match win behind Chris Evert\u2019s record of 101 wins, and is 100-12 all-time in the tournament.\n\nWilliams held Qiang to just 15 total points won in the match, too, barely letting her gain any momentum whatsoever.\n\nWith the win, Williams will now take on Ukraine\u2019s Elina Svitolina in the semifinals \u2014 her 10th straight appearance in the round. Svitolina, the No. 5 seed, beat the United Kingdom\u2019s Johanna Konta in straight sets in her quarterfinals match.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Serena Williams had no issue reaching the semifinals on Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EMSL2KzTSvcCHwKayX.JCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o44whxT5ff4Jk4FIc8cB6w--~B/aD0yMTUzO3c9MzIzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/18756d80-cea7-11e9-8fdf-f654f29051fd"}
