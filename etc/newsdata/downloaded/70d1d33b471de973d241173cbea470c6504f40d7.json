The device is sleek, modern, and ultra powerful, making it a great choice for those who want a tablet that can replace their laptop or graphic designers who like the idea of using the Apple Pencil. And now, the 11-inch iPad Pro is available at a massive discount straight from Amazon.\n\nThe 1TB model is getting the biggest discount, but it's also the most expensive model, so you'll still pay a lot. However, getting $399 off an iPad is really rare, and $1,149.99 is a solid sale price for that particular version of the Pro.\n\nIf you don't want so much storage, you can get the 64GB base model for $125 off, which brings the price down to $674. The 512GB model is $150 off, too, if you want something more in between. You'll pay $999.99 for that version.\n\nThe 256GB version has the lowest discount of $50, but the price is decent at $899. In the end, it depends on how much you want to spend and how much storage you're willing to pay for to meet your needs.\n\nThere are a number of things that make the 11-inch iPad Pro such an awesome device. Notably, the device boasts a beautiful edge-to-edge screen with super-thin bezels, which helps make it much more modern. It also uses Apple's Face ID for facial recognition, which makes unlocking the device easy.\n\nOf course, it's perhaps what's under the hood that's even more impressive. The device is powered by Apple's A12X Bionic chip, which is the most powerful chip Apple has ever developed. It easily makes the device a laptop replacement in terms of raw performance.\n\nOn the bottom of the device, you'll find a USB-C port, and you can use it to connect hard drives and other devices. The tablet will last 10 hours on a charge.\n\nFor this deal, you'll get pretty massive discounts. The device is available in four storage amounts, from 64GB to 1TB \u2014 and depending on which amount of storage you want, you could get up to $399.01 off. That's pretty huge. Even the base model is getting $125 off, which makes the tablet cheaper than ever.", "description": "Apple's 11-inch iPad Pro is $50 to $399 off on Amazon right now, depending on which amount of storage you choose.", "authors": ["Christian De Looper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d027f3d6fc920018035e032-1920-960.jpg"}
