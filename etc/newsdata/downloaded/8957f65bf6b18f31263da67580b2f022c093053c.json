We have got to get him out of picture very soon darling.'\n\nIn May last year, Cannon wrote to Taylor: 'I'm gonna give that c*** a heart attack. Man I could go the whole way with him!!!!!\n\n'Best way is to cut their ligaments so they never walk again. Then cut fingers off.\n\n'Might just fill his house with petrol and toast the c***. While in his bed.'\n\nTaylor replied: 'You read my mind.'\n\nIt's claimed that Mr Cannon recruited work colleague Mr Griffiths from Folkestone to help him.\n\nGiving evidence Mrs Taylor said she was born in Sunderland and moved south in 1985.\n\nMr Taylor was last seen at his home of Harkness Hall, in Gosmore, Hertfordshire, on June 3 last year - several days before his 70th birthday\n\nThe court was told she married Bill Taylor in 1997 at Stevenage Register Office and they had three children together - two sons now aged 19 and 23 and daughter now aged 22.\n\nShe said she had a son by a previous relationship who is now 28.\n\nMrs Taylor describes her marriage to the farmer as 'very difficult' and she said a lot of their problems were to do with his son Richard from his previous marriage.\n\nQuestioned by her barrister a Jennifer Dempster QC, Mrs Taylor said her husband and his son had fallen out and it was a stressful situation that prompted her to move out of Harkness Hall in November 2015 to nearby Mill Farm.\n\nShe said there was a post nuptial agreement put in place and she told the jury 'I didn't want a divorce, he didn't want a divorce.'\n\nShe said the agreement was for the ownership a number of properties including Mill Farm and Dog Kennel Farm to be transferred to her and \u00a310,000 was made available for renovation work to Mill Farm.\n\nShe said Bill Taylor's son Richard was not happy as a result. After leaving Harkness Hall she said she continued to have contact with her husband and would take meals to Harkness Hall.\n\nMrs Taylor said she even tried to persuade her husband to move in with her and the children, but he wouldn't leave Harkness Hall.\n\nMr Taylor had been missing for eight months before a member of the public found his body in a river in February (pictured, the river where his body was found)\n\nShe said throughout 2016 she was still in a sexual relationship with her husband.\n\nThe court heard that she met Mr Cannon at the end of 2017 when he came to do some work on Dog Kennel Farm.\n\nShe said he became a regular visitor and eventually asked her out an an affair began.\n\n'It just seemed to happen- we clicked. I wasn't looking for a relationship and it sort of happened.'\n\nShe said she understood Mr Cannon and his wife 'were splitting up.'\n\nShe said she kept her relationship with Mr Cannon a secret from her children because she 'didn't want to hurt anyone.'\n\nMrs Taylor added 'I was still married to him and I was still trying to work it out with him.'\n\nShe told the jury she never had any plans that she would marry Mr Cannon and went on 'I was still with Bill and I had promised my children I would never marry again.'\n\nMrs Taylor said about three weeks before Bill Taylor disappeared she had received a 'love letter' from him asking that they get back together.\n\n'I had a chat with my children and left it up to them about what they wanted me to do,' she told the court.\n\nMars Taylor was then about a WhatsApp message sent to her from Paul Cannon in which he had spoken about her husband saying 'Man I could go the whole way with him,' prompting her to reply 'Do it.'\n\nHer barrister asked: 'Did you intend Paul Cannon to do anything with regards to Bill?'\n\nShe replied: 'No' She was also asked about messages between them that spoke of committing violence to Mr Taylor and others, she said it was just their way of letting out their frustrations.\n\nMrs Taylor said she first learned her husband was missing on the evening of Monday June 4 last year.\n\n'I thought maybe he was in the fields and was late coming back in, she said.\n\nHer barrister then asked her: 'It's suggested June 3 was the culmination of a plot to murder Bill.\n\nWere you involved in a plot to murder Bill at this time?' She replied: 'No' Miss Dempsey QC then asked her 'Did you ever indicate to Paul Cannon you wanted Bill murdered that night?' The wife replied: 'Not at all.'\n\nTaylor and Cannon, both of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, deny murder, arson and an alternative charge of conspiracy to murder.\n\nGwyn Griffiths, 60, of Folkestone, Kent, denies conspiracy to murder.\n\nEarlier in the trial, prosecutors dropped a charge of murder against Griffiths.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Angela Taylor, 53, is accused of working with Paul Cannon, 54, both of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, to kill her husband William 'Bill' Taylor after nearly 25 years of marriage.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19794008-0-image-a-2_1571239079729.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
