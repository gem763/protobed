But his numbers are unchewable.\n\nWhether the topic is Chinese job losses, foreign investment or trade, Trump has a habit of misleading audiences on the state of Asia\u2019s largest economy. He also routinely exaggerates the effect of U.S. tariffs on China\u2019s economy.\n\nWe rounded up some of the statistics Trump dishes out at campaign rallies, on Twitter and to reporters. The claims we\u2019re fact-checking are all drawn from the president\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Monday. But he has been repeating the same or similar figures for months. This is a roundup, so we won\u2019t be rewarding Pinocchios \u2014 but his claims are certainly misleading.\n\n\u201cChina wants to talk. They want to talk. China\u2019s lost 3 million jobs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery where Trump gets this number, which seems to grow or shrink with each telling.\n\nAt the end of July, Trump tweeted, \u201cChina has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the Trump Tariffs.\u201d In August, he said, \u201cChina has lost 2 million jobs in the last month and a half.\u201d Later that month, the number was \u201c2\u00bd million.\u201d Now it\u2019s 3 million.\n\nAs the BBC reported, \u201cthere is no official Chinese data specifically on job losses as a result of the US-China trade war, but economic surveys carried out by two Chinese banks suggest a range of 1.2 [million] to 1.9 million jobs were impacted by the trade war in the industrial sector.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to our questions, but it previously sent the BBC an article from the South China Morning Post with some figures. Here\u2019s what the BBC reported Aug. 30:\n\nThis article quoted a report from a Chinese investment bank, China International Capital Corp (CICC), with an estimate of trade war-related job losses in the manufacturing sector of up to 1.9 million between July 2018 and May 2019. When pressed further, Mr Trump's spokesperson said the CICC survey had not included data after May, when there had been a significant increase in tariffs on goods from China. However, no explanation was offered as to where the figure of three million \u2014 or the 2.5 million a week earlier \u2014 had been sourced.\n\nWhen we asked Trump\u2019s campaign about the 3 million figure, a spokesman sent the same article in the South China Morning Post and its estimate of almost 2 million job losses stemming from the trade war.\n\n\u201cI know of no reliable evidence that indicates that China has lost 3 million jobs because of the trade war,\u201d Robert Daly, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center\u2019s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, wrote in an email. \u201cChina had embarked on a historic restructuring of its economy before the trade war began. Before Trump\u2019s election, Beijing had committed to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption, stronger service industries, and moving up the manufacturing value chain from assembly work to high tech. A reduction in the manufacturing labor force (let\u2019s say it is 3 million jobs) must therefore be measured against job growth in China\u2019s tech and service sectors.\u201d\n\nNicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Trump\u2019s claim of millions of Chinese job losses is \u201cdelusional.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployment in broad manufacturing has been falling over the past year, but at a slower pace than in 2014-17, before the tariffs were imposed,\u201d Lardy wrote in a blog post Aug. 29. \u201cChina\u2019s exports to the rest of the world are growing enough to more than offset the lost sales to the United States, so employment losses due directly to the trade war seem to be de minimis.\u201d\n\nDerek Scissors, an expert on the Chinese economy at the American Enterprise Institute, said \u201c300,000 jobs, not 3 million, could be a reasonable estimate for the U.S. tariff effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cChinese exports to the U.S. have begun falling,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cThrough July, they\u2019ve done about $25 billion \u2014 goods and services \u2014 compared to 2018 through July. That is a concrete loss to China. It\u2019s also a reversal of trend, so Chinese losses are larger as compared to what their exports could be without tariffs. But there is no way to get millions of jobs lost \u2014 the export decline is far too small for that given the size of China\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nDavid Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the Chinese economy and served as an Obama administration economic official based in Beijing, said: \u201cChina\u2019s overall exports so far this year are flat compared to 2018, so it seems unlikely that there are large employment changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of companies are leaving China. The supply chain is crumbling because they can\u2019t pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would have never thought.\u201d\n\nTrump claims \u201cthousands of companies\u201d have been leaving China since his tariffs took effect, but neither his administration nor his campaign has offered proof.\n\nThe Trump campaign spokesman pointed to a July 14 article in the Wall Street Journal, which said the U.S. manufacturers behind \u201cCrocs shoes, Yeti beer coolers, Roomba vacuums and GoPro cameras are producing goods in other countries to avoid U.S. tariffs of as much as 25% on some $250 billion of imports from China,\u201d among others.\n\nBut China has more than half a million foreign-invested firms, according to the Peterson Institute. Multinational companies with Chinese operations in some cases say they\u2019re leaving, or planning to leave, because of rising labor costs or lower costs in neighboring countries such as Vietnam. Those dynamics predated Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nLardy, the Peterson Institute expert, wrote in a blog post Sept. 10 that \u201ca handful of firms leaving China do not confirm a broad trend.\u201d Many foreign companies are in China to access the sizable Chinese market, Lardy wrote, while some of the biggest exporters with Chinese operations, such as Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple, are too entrenched in China to be able to relocate easily.\n\n\u201cNonfinancial foreign direct investment (FDI) in China is currently running at an annual rate of almost $140 billion, meaning that thousands of new foreign firms are established in China every month,\u201d Lardy wrote. \u201cSince the tariff war broke out in mid-2018 FDI has expanded about 3 percent annually, roughly the same pace as in the previous five years. And the recent data do not reflect massive new investments in chemical plants. China recently approved wholly foreign-owned investments by both ExxonMobil and BASF, each at a record setting $10 billion. Since ground has not yet been broken, these two projects are not yet included in FDI data.\u201d\n\nA survey published in August by the U.S.-China Business Council found that 81 percent of members\u2019 businesses had been affected by the trade tensions, up from 73 percent a year earlier.\n\n\n\n(U.S.-China Business Council, August 2019)\n\nBut the same survey showed that 87 percent of members had no plans to leave China, while 95 percent said they were in the country to serve the Chinese market. \u201cIf you are there to serve the Chinese market, then the trade war provides more, not less, incentive to invest there,\u201d said Dollar, the Brookings Institution researcher.\n\nAEI\u2019s Scissors said: \u201cTariffs are applied much more quickly than companies decide to exit a large market, so we don\u2019t have useful data on this yet. We know thousands of companies are considering leaving China. It\u2019s also possible that thousands of companies have left, as small East Asian companies may be relocating within the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cHundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China\u2019s eating the cost, which the fake news doesn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese imports, and the Chinese have retaliated with their own levies on U.S. goods.\n\nIn the last year, U.S. tariffs on imports worldwide produced $63 billion, nearly half of which, or $27 billion, came from Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports and other products. (It\u2019s important to note that China has retaliated in part by shunning U.S. agricultural products such as soybeans. Trump said at his North Carolina rally that his administration, as a result, has subsidized U.S. farmers to the tune of $28 billion. \u201cWe\u2019ve given them $28 billion so that they\u2019re whole,\u201d he said.)\n\nEconomists widely agree that the cost of tariffs ultimately falls on manufacturers and consumers, as Trump recently acknowledged.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Aug. 2 that \u201cTrump\u2019s latest import tax would cost a typical family of four $350 a year in addition to $850 from existing China tariffs, according to the Tax Foundation.\u201d\n\nAn analysis in May by Goldman Sachs found that \u201cthe costs of U.S. tariffs have fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and households, with no clear reduction in the prices charged by Chinese exporters\u201d and that prices for nine categories of taxed goods \u2014 such as auto parts, furniture and floor coverings \u2014 were rising faster than inflation.\n\nA paper published on March 2 by three prominent U.S. economists found \u201cthat the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\u201d Another paper, published March 3 by a different set of economists, found similar results. \u201cTradable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties are the most negatively affected by the trade war,\u201d the paper said.\n\n\u201cI want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they\u2019ve had now the worst year in 57 years.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s second-quarter growth rate was the slowest in 27 years \u2014 not 57, as Trump repeatedly claims.\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Anna Fifield reported in July: \u201cOfficial figures from the National Bureau of Statistics \u2014 which economists tend to take with a grain of salt, viewing them as likely too rosy \u2014 showed that the annual growth rate slowed to 6.2 percent in the three months to the end of June, down from 6.4 percent the previous quarter.\n\n\u201cThis is within the 6 to 6.5 percent band the government has set for this year and was in line with market expectations of a gradual slowdown. Still, it is China\u2019s lowest growth rate since records began in March 1992.\u201d\n\nTo jolt the slowing economy, the Chinese central bank said last week it is lowering the reserve requirement ratio for lenders by 0.5 percentage points on Monday, which essentially translates to injecting $126 billion into the country\u2019s financial system, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cMany businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to stay open, unemployment is creeping up, and families are shouldering higher daily costs,\u201d the Times reported.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "President Trump's numbers are overblown, unsupported or illogical, experts say.", "authors": ["Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DtIcK_U-KisBbPSkOByVVIpkXFc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PF4JZVGTQMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
