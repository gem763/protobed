I couldn't be more proud of my body for giving me my son,' Tiffiny said.\n\n'It was day one back at work (I'd been working from home, but this was my first commitment that required leaving the house - any new mum knows this is a big deal) and Arnold was with me in the studio.'\n\nWhat makes the snap memorable was it marked the first day Tiffiny was able to return to exercise, something she could only manage for a few minutes at a time.\n\n'I could only manage five minutes, with low-impact modifications, but my smile says it all! I got it in,' she said.\n\nTiffiny said she took the pressure off feeling as if she had to return to her pre-pregnancy size by being 'proud of my body for giving me my son'\n\nBut soon those five minutes turned into 20 - which is how long her new Hyper workouts last - and she was nailing push ups, jabs and high kicks in the dojo.\n\nWithin four months she had lost 21 kilos and was on her way to building a stronger and leaner body than ever before.\n\nTo target her abdominals Tiffiny likes 'around the world sit ups' and 'plank butt kicks'.\n\nThe kicks involve 30 seconds of planking, before lifting one leg at a time, curling up your heel and kicking your bottom.\n\nAround-the-world sit-ups are little more complicated.\n\nHow to tone your back with Tiffiny 'My best advice would be to start with boxing. Because you can't spot reduce fat you need to decrease your body fat percentage first,' the 33-year-old told FEMAIL. 'Boxing is a great way to build lean muscle mass and tone your entire body. You can do drills like jab-cross-punch and see how many you get done in a minute. Then try to beat that score each time. Tiffiny Hall (pictured) hits the gym during the winter months 'You could also have a partner hold a pillow above your head and punch directly upwards for a minute at full intensity. If you're on your knees while doing the exercise it will really work into your shoulders.' Also just holding a regular push up position without doing the push up works your back, obliques, arms and core all in one go. To make it harder Tiffiny encourages those daring enough to try it to pick up one palm and touch your underarm, put it down, and repeat.\n\nDespite the fact Tiffiny could only manage five minutes of exercise at a time when she first started working out after giving birth, she soon built this up to 20 minutes a day\n\nStarting on your hands and knees you need to swing out one leg at a time from your body, meeting it with your other hand.\n\nMeanwhile to engage her back and arms she'll do a round of boxing or just hold a regular push up position without actually moving.\n\nTo make it harder Tiffiny encourages those daring enough to try it to pick up one palm and touch your underarm, put it down, and repeat.\n\nShe follows her own nutrition-based program as often as she can while incorporating bursts of yoga, martial arts and strength-based weightlifting.", "description": "Former Biggest Loser trainer Tiffiny Hall doesn't sway on her martial arts-inspired workouts but she does trade heavy carbs for greener produce when spring hits.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19764194-0-image-a-137_1571181456266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
