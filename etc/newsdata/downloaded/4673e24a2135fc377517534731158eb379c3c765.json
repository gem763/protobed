But he dropped out of the race after being unable to win any subsequent primaries, except in his home state.\n\nDuring the 2016 race, Kasich and Trump frequently locked horns -- so much so that Kasich boycotted that year's Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump officially accepted the GOP nomination for president, even though the event was held in Kasich's home state.\n\nIn defending his support for Trump's impeachment Friday, Kasich said the preceding 24 hours had been \"very difficult.\" He cited a news conference at which acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appeared to have contradicted Trump's claim that there was \"no quid pro quo\" when Trump spoke with the president of Ukraine in July.\n\nMulvaney later walked back his comments, but Kasich claimed Mulvaney's initial remarks had \"pushed him really across the Rubicon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithholding military aid, vital military aid to a nation like Ukraine... so that a political operation can take place, investigate this thing around the server,\" Kasich explained. \"And 'We\u2019re going to withhold the aid until do you that.\u2019 To me, it\u2019s totally inappropriate. It\u2019s an abuse of power.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've fought with people on the air about, 'Is there a quid pro quo?' and 'Does this rise to the level of impeachment?''\n\n\"I now believe that it does,\" Kasich concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe ex-governor recently clashed with CNN anchor Don Lemon over whether the Trump-Ukraine phone call included a quid pro quo.\n\nThe clash got so heated, Lemon suggested that Kasich was sounding like a \"Trump apologist.\"\n\n\"You are doing exactly what the apologists are doing,\" Lemon said. \"Then you are not helping people understand the real problem, then you are part of the problem.\"", "description": "CNN sounded the \"breaking news\" alarm Friday after Republican John Kasich -- a CNN contributor and frequent critic of President Trump -- bucked the GOP and expressed his support for impeachment.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
