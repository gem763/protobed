Biden Jr., the former vice president and current presidential candidate, as well as his son Hunter Biden. \u201cKeep them coming!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, framed the news of the new whistle-blower on Sunday as a political hit on the president. \u201cSURPRISE Democrat lawyer has other secret sources,\u201d Mr. Giuliani wrote on Twitter. He added that the bottom line was that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d attached to Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rivals, and called the story an \u201cORCHESTRATED DEM CAMPAIGN LIKE KAVANAUGH,\u201d referring to the sexual misconduct allegations against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.\n\nMr. Zaid works for Compass Rose Legal Group, a law firm that specializes in representing whistle-blowers. He is part of the legal team that is now representing both individuals who have come forward. The team also includes Andrew P. Bakaj, the lead lawyer, and I. Charles McCullough III.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General,\u201d Mr. Bakaj said on Twitter. \u201cNo further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who are building the impeachment case against Mr. Trump sought to paint the accumulation of evidence against him as inevitable on Sunday. Meanwhile, the White House had few allies on the Sunday show circuit who strongly defended the president\u2019s actions.\n\nRepresentative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel had not yet heard from a second whistle-blower as of Sunday morning. But he hastened to argue that the speed with which details of the case were becoming public was itself a strong sign of wrongdoing.", "description": "The new whistle-blower, who is said to have firsthand knowledge of the president\u2019s dealings, has been interviewed by the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office.", "authors": ["Annie Karni", "Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/us/politics/06dc-trump/06dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
