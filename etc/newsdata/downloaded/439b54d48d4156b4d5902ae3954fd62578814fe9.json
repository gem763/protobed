A relationship doesn\u2019t end in a day and the process of disintegration happens over months and years, as you weigh the pros and cons, take help from friends and counsellors, and even meet lawyers before coming to a decision. And when you do, it\u2019s usually final. However, there is still the part, the most difficult one, where you have to break it to your spouse that you want out.Before you have the chat, be absolutely sure that divorce is what you want. Do not use it as a threat or to raise a reaction out of him. Bandying about the word when you don\u2019t fully mean it is not just manipulative, it reduces your standing in the relationship considerably.The worst thing you can do is to suddenly break the news to your spouse without preamble; especially, if he is least prepared for it. Put yourself in his shoes and imagine your hurt in a similar situation. If you know that nothing but divorce will do it for you, start having leading conversatins about your relationship with him a few weeks in advance and schedule a visit to a counsellor if necessary so that he has an idea about how you feel.The \u201cdivorce conversation\u201d is not when you bring up old hurts and resentments and start bombarding him with them. While you may consider yourself the aggrieved party, and while he may have done his bit to hasten the end of the relationship, have the grace to walk away with dignity. Staying calm and kind will help smoothen the divorce processWhen you decide to divorce someone who you may still be fond of, you may be tempted to show some physical affection to soothe his grief. Isn\u2019t that what you have been doing all along, anyway? However, we suggest you control yourself and refrain from sending him mixed signals that will make it harder for him to deal with the new situation.You might imagine that your declaration will result in him dissolving in grief, pleading with you to stay, and promises of better behaviour. However, be warned that many men manifest their grief as anger and your declaration may make him direct it at you. Also, he may hate the that fact he has no control over you or the relationship any longer and that may result in abusive behaviour if he is prone to violence. Be prepared for any such eventuality and stay safe.Your first conversation about divorce is not when you should broach the topic about who\u2019ll get the pet cat and the blue pottery collection. You can spar over the spoils later. Be sensitive to his feelings and avoid bringing up legalities and custody issues at this juncture. Also, remember, that it\u2019s better to tread gently now if you want less of a battle at the divorce courts later.", "description": "Are you completely convinced that you want to end your marriage?
