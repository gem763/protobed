The ban, which also affects some flavored tobacco products, adds to restrictions that the city put in place on flavored e-cigarettes last year \u2014 already considered to be the strictest in the country according to The New York Times. Cigarettes remain legal.\n\nOnce it goes into effect in early 2020, the new San Francisco ordinance will forbid tobacco shops in the city from selling e-cigarettes that haven\u2019t been approved by the FDA. It also bans \u201cthe sale and distribution to any person in San Francisco of flavored tobacco products and electronic cigarettes that require, but have not received, an FDA order approving their marketing.\u201d\n\nThere are no authorized e-cigarettes currently on the market\n\nAt the moment, this ordinance essentially bans all e-cigarettes from being sold in or shipped to people in the city, because, as acting FDA commissioner Ned Sharpless noted earlier this month: \u201cThere are no authorized e-cigarettes currently on the market.\u201d E-cigarette companies, including the San Francisco-based Juul, currently have until 2022 to submit applications for FDA approval. And until they get that approval, they can\u2019t be sold in the city. Unsurprisingly, Juul is not happy about the ban, protesting that it still allows cigarettes to be sold in the city. Bloomberg reports that the company has been behind a push to put the issue on the ballot in November, potentially allowing voters to decide if e-cigarettes should be sold in the city to people over the age of 21.\n\nOf course, the FDA could potentially approve some e-cigarettes at some point in the future. The agency sent out guidelines to e-cigarette companies earlier this month detailing what the companies should put in their applications to the FDA. Among other factors, the FDA will consider an e-cigarette\u2019s marketing, ingredients, and how it could potentially change people\u2019s behavior as it makes the decision of whether to approve e-cigarettes.\n\nSan Francisco is among the first cities to ban the sale of these items in the United States \u2014 it joins Beverley Hills, California, which passed a similar law earlier this month. While the Beverly Hills ban will be enacted in 2021, the San Francisco legislation could go into effect as early as next year. California as a whole has a history of leading the way on tobacco-related bans. In 1998, it became the first state in the country to severely restrict indoor smoking in public places, though the law was initially met with resistance from smokers.\n\nThe current San Francisco ban was proposed back in March by six San Francisco supervisors, who were concerned by the spike in underage vaping reported by the FDA and CDC last year. Soon after the CDC\u2019s findings were announced, the surgeon general declared youth vaping an epidemic.\n\n\u201cWe have people addicted to nicotine who would have never smoked a cigarette had it not been for the attractive products that target our young people,\u201d San Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton told the Associated Press when he proposed the ban.\n\nThe legislation now goes before San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who has 10 days to decide whether to sign it, though early reports from KQED indicate that she does plan to sign. If she does, the law would go into effect seven months later, sometime early next year.", "description": "San Francisco officials just banned the sale or distribution of e-cigarettes in the city unless they have FDA approval.
