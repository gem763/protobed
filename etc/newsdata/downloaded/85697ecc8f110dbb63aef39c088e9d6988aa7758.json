Sophos, whose customers include Under Armour Inc, Ford Motor Co and Toshiba Corp, listed in 2015 at 225 pence per share and has seen its market value double since then, although its recent results have been weak. [nL3N1ZI2RQ]\n\nThoma Bravo\u2019s move for Sophos trails several other buyout deals by U.S. funds in Britain recently amid a weaker sterling. Advent recently bought engineering firm Cobham while an investment consortium led by Blackstone won control of Madame Tussaud\u2019s owner Merlin Entertainments over the summer.\n\nSophos Group shareholders will get $7.40 per share in cash, which is 583 pence per share.\n\nSophos shares jumped nearly 38% in early trade, touching 586.8 pence in early dealing before settling at around 583 pence.\n\nPrivate equity funds are increasingly targeting listed companies in Europe, as they rush to use capital ahead of a possible market downturn.\n\nThe news also sent shares of Sophos\u2019s larger rival Avast 3.5% higher to 383.4 pence.\n\n\u201cThe global cybersecurity market is evolving rapidly, driven by significant technological innovation, as cyber threats to business increase in scope and complexity,\u201d Seth Boro, managing partner, at Thoma Bravo said in a statement.\n\nThoma Bravo, which raised billions for its latest private equity fund this year, had been targeting the cyber security sector. Late last year, it bought Imperva and another cyber security firm called Veracode from Broadcom Inc.\n\nIt was also reportedly in talks last year with multiple cybersecurity firms including McAfee and Symantec.\n\nThe deal also comes on the heels of dismal results from Sophos as it saw waning demand for cybersecurity tools and it shed a third of its value in 2018.\n\nJ.P.
