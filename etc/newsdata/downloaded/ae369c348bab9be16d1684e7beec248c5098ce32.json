REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said vast areas had been struck by the storm and called for urgent support to the affected.\n\nAt least 40 people were killed in the typhoon that left large sections of towns in central and eastern Japan under water, with another 16 missing and 189 injured, public broadcaster NHK said.\n\nTens of thousands of rescue workers and a fleet of helicopters have fanned out in the affected areas, officials said.\n\n\u201cThere still are many residents who have yet to be accounted for. Our people in uniform are working day and night in search and rescue operations,\u201d Abe told an emergency meeting of ministers.\n\n\u201cDamage has been made in an extremely wide range of areas, and more than 30,000 people are still being forced to remain in the state of evacuation. It is our urgent task to offer meticulous support to those who have been affected.\u201d\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday and headed out to sea early on Sunday.\n\nGroups of rescuers wearing goggles and snorkels searched for survivors while making their way in waist-high water in Nagano, central Japan, where the Chikuma River inundated swaths of land.\n\nA middle-aged man in Nagano, asked about the situation around his house, told NHK: \u201cIt\u2019s just like a lake.\u201d\n\nYoshinobu Tsuchiya, 69, returned on Monday morning to his home in Nagano City, near where the Chikuma Rover had breached its banks, to find that his first floor had been flooded and that the garden he tended had turned to brown mud.\n\n\u201cSo this is what it\u2019s come to,\u201d Tsuchiya sighed to the Nikkei newspaper. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine when we\u2019ll finish cleaning up. I\u2019m sick of this flood.\u201d\n\nA neighbor in his 60s told the newspaper, \u201cThis is just like a tsunami. This is hopeless.\u201d\n\nMore than 110,000 police officers, fire fighters, soldiers and coastguard personnel, as well as some 100 helicopters were mobilised for Monday\u2019s rescue operations, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.\n\nLater in the day, strong rain is forecast in some parts of central and eastern Japan, where soil is already loosened by record-breaking rain from the typhoon, prompting Suga to urge residents to be on guard.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\n\u201cRain is expected in affected areas today. Because of the rain we have seen so far, levels of water are high in some rivers and soil is loose in some areas,\u201d Suga said.\n\n\u201cPlease remain on your guard for landslides and river overflows.\u201d\n\nMore than 92,000 households were still without power early on Monday, a national holiday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said.
