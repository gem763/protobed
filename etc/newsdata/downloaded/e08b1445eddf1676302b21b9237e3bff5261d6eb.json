The 21-year-old still has roughly two years to do it, and she said she\u2019s trying to carefully plot every step.\n\nThat said, if Barber, who meets Gillian Robertson (7-3 MMA, 4-1 UFC) on Friday at UFC on ESPN 6, were to be offered a title shot against women\u2019s flyweight champ Valentina Shevchenko (18-3 MMA, 7-2 UFC) right now, she would readily accept \u2013 and thinks she would win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to rush anything,\u201d Barber told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at Wednesday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 media day. \u201cTechnically, I believe if I was offered the fight with Valentina tomorrow I\u2019d go in there and I truly believe I could win that fight and I could do everything to go out there and to win that fight and I believe it would be a fight and I believe that I would win that title, but why do it right now? Why not take the next couple years and not just go out there and fight her, but go out there and dominate her.\u201d\n\nShevchenko is the dominant 125-pound queen who had yet to meet an equal in the weight class. It\u2019s Barber\u2019s division for now, but not the one she sees as a permanent home. Barber has fought at strawweight several times in her career, however, some struggles with her weight caused a move up.\n\nBarber said she doesn\u2019t rule out a future return to 115 pounds, and it\u2019s there where she feels her talents shine brightest. She thinks a fight with Shevchenko is competitive, but when it comes to strawweight champ Weili Zhang (20-1 MMA, 4-0 UFC), she envisions a blowout.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one I believe I could take right now I could go in and just dominate that fight,\u201d Barber said. \u201cValentina could be back-and-forth and I believe I could take that title still, but I would rather have it be a beatdown than a back-and-forth brawl.\u201d\n\nBarber is steadfast in in her goal of winning a UFC title before her timeline to break Jones\u2019 record expires. Beating Robertson at Friday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 event, which takes place at TD Garden in Boston and airs on ESPN2, is the next obstacle. After that, she said it will be time to reevaluate how far she is from a belt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a hard question to answer because I don\u2019t know (how many more fights until a title shot),\u201d Barber said. \u201cI\u2019m fighting again and then I\u2019m fighting Gillian and I\u2019m taking this fight then I\u2019m taking the next one. If it happens to be two fights from now or three fights from now I really don\u2019t care. As long as it\u2019s within my dates.\u201d", "description": "Maycee Barber, 21, is confident in her chances of dethroning UFC champs Valentina Shevchenko and Weili Zhang.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/maycee-barber-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
