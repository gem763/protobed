We predicted temperatures would rise, but we didn\u2019t foresee these sorts of extreme events we\u2019re getting so soon.\u201d\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five things the world needs to invest in to be \"climate change resilient\".\n\nHe said the world had changed faster than generally predicted in the fifth assessment report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014.\n\nHe referred especially to the loss of land ice and sea ice, and to the weather extremes in which he said warming probably played a role.\n\nSeveral other scientists contacted by the BBC supported his emotive language.\n\nThe physicist Prof Jo Haigh from Imperial College London said: \u201cDavid King is right to be scared \u2013 I\u2019m scared too.\"\n\n\u201cWe do the analysis, we think what\u2019s going to happen, then publish in a very scientific way.\n\n\"Then we have a human response to that\u2026 and it is scary.\u201d\n\nPetteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised UN agency, said he fully supported United Nations climate goals, but he criticised radical green campaigners for forecasting the end of the world.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in the long debate over how to communicate climate science to the public.\n\nImage copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption Greta Thunberg thinks that action comes from people feeling a sense of panic\n\nWill emotive language leave young people depressed?\n\nDr Taalas agrees polar ice is melting faster than expected, but he\u2019s concerned that public fear could lead to paralysis \u2013 and also to mental health problems amongst the young.\n\n\u201cWe are fully behind climate science and fully behind the (upcoming) New York climate summit\", he said.\n\n\u201cBut I want to stick to the facts, which are quite convincing and dramatic enough. We should avoid interpreting them too much.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young we were afraid of nuclear war. We seriously thought it\u2019s better not to have children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling the same sentiment among young people at the moment. So we have to be a bit careful with our communication style.\u201d\n\nHe said most of the changes were within the IPCC forecast range - although some - like polar ice - were at the top end of the range.\n\nThe polar scientist Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University, agreed with that assessment.\n\nHe also said scientists should normally avoid emotional terms: \"I would not use the term (scary) in general, but it is certainly surprising to see record (or near record) losses of ice. 2019 has been a bad year for Earth's ice.\"\n\nIt seems though, that some scientists believe their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that psychologists working with the University of Bath are counselling growing numbers of young people suffering from eco-anxiety.\n\nHowever, some scientists appear to believe that their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act.\n\nDo scientists agree climate change is scary?\n\nWe tested Prof King's views with the main authors of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014.\n\nThe consensus among those who replied was that climate models had accurately forecast the rise in global mean temperature.\n\nImage copyright NASA\n\nBut the models hadn\u2019t been sufficiently sophisticated to foresee events like this year\u2019s extreme European heatwave or the slow-moving Hurricane Dorian \u2013 described by Nasa as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201ca nightmare scenario\u201d.\n\nOthers mentioned severe ice melting at the poles; Tasmania suffering record droughts and floods in consecutive years; record wildfires in the Arctic and an unprecedented two large cyclones in Mozambique in one year.\n\nChanges 'anticipated for decades'\n\nGerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, told us he\u2019d been anticipating changes like these for four decades, although he hadn't been certain when they would arrive.\n\n\u201cI have a sense of the numbing inevitability of it all,\u201d he said.\n\nFew of the scientists we contacted had faith that governments would do what was needed to rescue the climate in time.\n\nThey\u2019re alarmed that global warming of just over 1C so far has already created a new normal in which historic temperature records will inevitably be broken more often. This is the predictable side of climate change.\n\nProf King argues that some changes were not well forecast.\n\nWhat is the science behind extreme weather events?\n\nThe loss of land ice in Antarctica, for instance, is at the upper range of predictions in the IPCC AR5. And there are record ice losses in Greenland\n\nThen there\u2019s this year\u2019s French heatwave.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Extreme and sustained temperatures in France in July led to droughts in some areas\n\nDr Friederike Otto from Oxford University is an expert in the attribution of extreme events to climate change.\n\nShe told us that in a pre-climate change world, a heatwave like this might strike once in 1,000 years.\n\nIn a post-warming world, the heatwave was a one-in-a-100 year phenomenon.\n\nIn other words, natural variability is amplifying human-induced climate heating.\n\n\u201cWith European heatwaves, we have realised that climate change is a total game-changer,\u201d she said. \"It has increased the likelihood (of events) by orders of magnitude.\"\n\nResearchers had not yet had time to investigate the links between all of the major extreme weather events and climate change, she said.\n\nWith some phenomena such as droughts and floods there was no clear evidence yet of any involvement from climate change.\n\nAnd it was impossible to be sure that the slow progress of Dorian was caused by climate change.\n\n'We can\u2019t wait for scientific certainty'\n\nProf King said the world could not wait for scientific certainty on events like Hurricane Dorian. \u201cScientists like to be certain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut these events are all about probabilities. What is the likelihood that (Dorian) is a climate change event? I\u2019m going to say \u2018very high\u2019.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that with 100% certainty, but what I can say is that the energy from the hurricane comes from the warm ocean and if that ocean gets warmer we must expect more energy in hurricanes.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf you got in a plane with a one in 100 chance of crashing you would be appropriately scared.\n\n\u201cBut we are experimenting with the climate in a way that throws up probabilities of very severe consequences of much more than that.\u201d\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hurricane Dorian was packing sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) when it made landfall\n\nShould the UK bring climate targets earlier?\n\nPierre Friedlingstein from Exeter University said he'd been surprised by the onslaught of extreme weather. He said he expected extremes to happen as forecast by the IPCC - but had not expected them so quickly.\n\nProf King said the situation was so grave that the UK should bring forward its date for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to almost zero from 2050 to 2040.\n\nSome of the IPCC scientists we contacted didn\u2019t share his urge to engage with the public on an emotional level.\n\nOthers agreed with him.\n\nProf John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia told us: \"Some things appear to be happening faster than projected. This may be partially related to the interaction of climate change and natural variability as well as the uncertainty in our understanding and projections.\n\n\u201cIn my own area of sea level change, things are happening near the upper end of the projections.\n\n\u201cWhat is scary is our lack of appropriate response. Our continued lack of action is committing the world to major and essentially irreversible change.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter.", "description": "The UK should advance its climate targets by 10 years, says the UK\u2019s former chief scientist.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F6E2/production/_108820236_gettyimages-1152334237.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
