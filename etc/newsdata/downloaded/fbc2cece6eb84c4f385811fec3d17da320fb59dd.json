She feared he would leave her if he obtained leave to remain in the country.\n\nBefore they became estranged in 2001, he allegedly told her: 'If you don't correct my visa and you don't make me legal to stay in this country then I will kill you and kill your whole family.'\n\nShe claimed he told her that he wanted sons instead of daughters and told Ms Begum he only married her to live in London and send money to Bangladesh. He was paid cash at his restaurant job in Frimley, Surrey, and sent the money back to Bangladesh, while Ms Begum received child benefits.\n\nProsecutor David Spens QC said Ms Begum 'never had visitors' and lived an insular 'friendless' life. She had split from the husband after he had beaten her.\n\nMum of four Mary Banweyana said Ms Begum visited her house twice and her daughter's would play with her's.\n\nMother-of-four Mary Banweyana saw the children (Anika and Thanha Khanum, aged five and six, are pictured) and Ms Begum visit her home a couple of times. She said the family were 'always smiling and happy' - and had seen Ms Begum on December 28, just four days before they were murdered\n\nBanweyana described her as 'always smiling and happy' and would stop to talk to her, the court heard.\n\nShe said: 'The last time I saw Juli\u2019s children was when they finished school for the Christmas holidays. The children seemed fine and very happy.'\n\nShe last saw Ms Begum when she was washing her husband's car, on December 28, and they would talk unlike Shakur who 'never spoke' or would say hello.\n\nMr Spens said during the trial on October 17: 'The marriage between Ms Begum and the defendant was not a happy one.\n\n'It was beset by arguments about the defendant's immigration status and his financial contribution towards the family outgoings.'\n\nShakur, who sat with an interpreter in the dock, has denied three counts of murder. But he He was seen on CCTV footage walking with Ms Begum and his daughters from and to the Nelson Street area on January 1 (pictured, the Old Bailey where he is on trial)\n\nIt was only after Ms Begum's sister Sheli tried ringing the door and there was no answer that Banweyana that she knew something was wrong.\n\nPolice then found the bodies of Ms Begum and her children, with sheets draped over them.\n\nHe was seen on CCTV footage walking with Ms Begum and his daughters from and to the Nelson Street area on January 1.\n\nThe following day, Shakur went to the Bangladesh High Commission for an emergency passport and took a one-way flight to Bangladesh on January 5.\n\nHe used excuses about his mother being sick and father being ill and then dying.\n\nWitness Mohammed Choudry, who worked at KMC Travel Agency in London at the time, said: \u2018He said his mother was unwell so he was in a hurry.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t unusual. We would see people, especially Bangladeshis, purchasing one-way tickets.\u2019\n\nThere were no flights available that evening so Shakur booked an air India flight, the cheapest one available, for 9pm the next day. He paid \u00a3340.\n\nShakur has denied three counts of murder and his phone has been pinpointed to the vicinity of Heathrow Airport.
