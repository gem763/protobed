Now, they're holding a second wedding ceremony on September 30, 2019, in South Carolina, reported Amanda Arnold and Marie Lodi for Vulture. Ahead of their \"I do\" redo, Bieber even took to Instagram to share a throwback photo with his wife and her parents, thanking his in-laws for allowing their daughter to \"marry a savage like [him].\"\n\nThey're just one of many millennial couples throwing multiple wedding ceremonies. It's a rising trend among couples tying the knot, reported Jessica Schiffer for The New York Times.\n\n\"Multiceremony wedding experiences are becoming more common among couples looking to accommodate different cultural and religious backgrounds, not to mention guests who may not be able to afford pricey destination weddings,\" Schiffer wrote.\n\nMore than half of couples today are marrying someone with a different background, which has reduced the perception that multiple ceremonies are \"over the top,\" Schiffer said, citing stats from WeddingWire. New York wedding planner Jove Meyer told Schiffer that 15% of his clients in the past year have had at least two ceremonies.\n\nAccording to WeddingWire, the national average cost for weddings is around $38,700, but that hikes up to an average cost of $50,000 when multiple ceremonies are involved \u2014 with some exceeding $100,000, Schiffer wrote. Costs can get high, she said, because cultural celebrations can be elaborate and have lengthy guest lists.\n\nFor example, Indian wedding celebrations last for days and Japanese brides have several costume changes, according to Business Insider's Abby Rogers.\n\nRead more: Millennials' preferences are leading to major changes in the wedding industry\n\nBut some couples keep things more low-key, which lowers costs \u2014 one couple Schiffer spoke to had an unofficial wedding ceremony in France and a backyard and beach celebration in California, all for $11,000.\n\nCouples are also implementing a few boundaries, like not overlapping guest lists across celebrations and not throwing any ceremonies past the one-year mark, Schiffer said.\n\nBut that's not the only way couples, millennials in particular, are changing love and marriage. They're waiting longer in their relationships to get married \u2014 4.9 years on average, reported Kristin Salaky for INSIDER, citing a Bridebook study. They're also getting married at a later age, according to INSIDER's Kim Renfro.\n\nA delay in marriage has given couples more time to acquire their own assets \u2014 as a result, more couples are signing prenups before marriage to protect these assets in the event of a divorce.\n\nAnd when they do get married, they tend to ditch traditional weddings, opting for unconventional venues such as barns and farms over banquet halls and hotel reception rooms, reported Business Insider's Mary Hanbury.", "description": "More couples are having multiple wedding ceremonies and are spending anywhere from $11,000 to $100,000 on them, reported The New York Times.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9225a92e22af486d611a5e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
