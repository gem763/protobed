Jesse Jackson arriving approximately an hour before the final negotiations to offer help, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nThe union and the CPS were \u201ctalking with each other, not at each other,\" Jackson, a civil rights activist and former presidential candidate, said afterward. \"Each side has some validity. There must be some common ground.\u201d\n\nNot enough was found, however, to reopen schools on Friday. The sides are at odds over how much money the union\u2019s proposals \u2014 which also include adding more social workers and counselors \u2014 would cost, with Lightfoot putting that figure at $2.5 billion she says the city doesn\u2019t have, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some movement, but it\u2019s still not enough,\u201d union bargaining team member Lori Torres said, according to the Sun-Times. The strike began when the union rejected an offer on Wednesday night, causing 25,000 teachers and support staff to walk off their jobs.\n\nOn Thursday morning, teachers picketed schools, and in the afternoon, they joined a protest march downtown. The educators are joined by 7,000 school support staff who haven't been able to reach a contract either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting for paychecks and health care -- it\u2019s the kids,\u201d art teacher John Houlihan said outside Smyth Elementary, a predominantly low-income school on the city\u2019s near South Side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to say that you can put these kids who are dealing with profound poverty and profound homelessness in classes of 30 to 40 kids,\u201d said Houlihan, who picketed with about 20 other teachers and staff as drivers passed by, honking their horns. \u201cThat\u2019s not manageable, and it is not an environment for learning.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just want a fast deal,\u201d Jesse Sharkey, president of the Chicago Teachers' Union, said before leading the teachers on the march downtown. \u201cWe are going to hold fast to a just deal.\u201d\n\nOscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon tweeted her support for the Chicago Teachers Union strike, writing: \"The future is in the hands of our teachers as they shape the minds of our kids & grandkids, yet so many don't earn a living wage, forcing them to work 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet.\"\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot expressed hope that a deal with the union is possible.\n\n\"What we need is for the union to come back to the table to bargain in good faith, spend the time actually getting a deal done, face to face with us, and not off to the side in a caucus,\" she said. \"If there is a seriousness of purpose and a willingness on the other side, we could get a deal done today.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "'Each side has some validity, the Rev.
