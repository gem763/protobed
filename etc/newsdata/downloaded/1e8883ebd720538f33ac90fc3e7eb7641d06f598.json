We see other people hitting people in the helmet, and they're going to play this Sunday. And Vontaze Burfict won't play the rest of the year? I think that's a little excessive, if you ask me. I don't think it's fair, if we really got to know the guy. If the people making the decision really knew the guy that we know, inside our building ... he's a great person, his heart is broken because he's not playing football. The guy just wants to play football. We don't get a lot of time to play this game in our lives.\u201d\n\nBurfict was suspended without pay as a result of the hit. Burfict has a history of brutal helmet-to-helmet hits as well as multiple suspensions and fines.

For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.\n\n\u201cFollowing each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me, and each of the jointly appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk.\n\n\u201cYour extensive history of rules violations is factored into this decision regarding accountability measures.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nRaiders linebacker Tahir Whitehead will become the new defensive play-caller for the Raiders as the team gets set to take on the Chicago Bears in London.
