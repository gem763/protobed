They have turned out in their millions. It\u2019s hard to focus on millions of people \u2014 how about one? And a prominent person, at that? She is Tanya Chan, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council, and a democracy leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September, she was in Geneva, testifying before the U.N. Human Rights Council. She had been invited to do so by UN Watch, a non-governmental organization accredited to the U.N. The Chinese government tried to stop her appearance. They told the U.N. that Chan was a \u201cconvicted criminal\u201d \u2014 which she is. She was found guilty of participating in democratic protests, essentially. More on this in due course.\n\nBefore the Human Rights Council, Chan testified about police brutality in Hong Kong: myriad physical abuses, including sexual abuses. The police call protesters \u201ccockroaches,\u201d she said, meaning that \u201cviolence is regarded as acceptable pest control.\u201d She further said that police brutality is \u201ca direct result of the lack of democracy in Hong Kong,\u201d as \u201cthe government is not held accountable for its endorsement\u201d of the brutality.\n\nWhat did she want from the Human Rights Council? An intervention, so to speak: an urgent session on human-rights violations in Hong Kong, and a commission of inquiry. She also had a question, as she testified: \u201cWhy is China sitting here, as a member of this human-rights council?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA very good question.\n\nTanya Chan is a Hong Konger, born and bred. In a conversation with her, I ask a personal question \u2014 one having to do with identity: \u201cDo you feel like a Hong Konger? Like a Chinese person? Or some blend?\u201d She answers, firmly, \u201cI am definitely a Hong Konger.\u201d She was educated at Sacred Heart Canossian College and then at the University of Hong Kong, where she earned a law degree.\n\nIn 1997, she was in her mid 20s. Why is that relevant? Because 1997, as you recall, is the year that the \u201chandover\u201d occurred: the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from Great Britain to the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 a.k.a. Communist China, or Red China, or, simply, China. I have another personal question for Chan: \u201cHow did you feel? Excited, hopeful, nervous \u2014 or some blend?\u201d This time, the answer is \u201cblend.\u201d\n\nShe liked the concept of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d That was the promise, remember. Hong Kong would be part of China, but it would maintain its own, democratic system. The city would be governed by \u201cour small constitution,\u201d as Chan says: the Basic Law. While she looked forward to this, she was nervous about how it would pan out: The concept of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d had never been implemented anywhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2006, she was a founding member of the Civic party, which is a liberal-democratic party \u2014 aiming at free elections, the rule of law, civil liberties, and all the rest. The father of democracy in Hong Kong is widely acknowledged to be Martin Lee, whom many of us have esteemed for decades. He is now in his early 80s. When I mention him, Tanya Chan says, with delight, that she has just seen him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was in 2008 that Chan was first elected to the Legislative Council. She represents Hong Kong Island. She is sometimes known as \u201cthe Zhou Xun of the Civic party\u201d \u2014 Zhou Xun being a very famous Chinese actress and singer, about the same age as Chan.\n\nBefore the massive demonstrations of 2019, which have attracted worldwide attention, there was the Umbrella Movement of 2014. This, too, was a democratic movement. Its aim was to stop the erosion of electoral rights in Hong Kong. It got its name because people used umbrellas as shields, to ward off pepper spray and tear gas, coming from the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTanya Chan was a leader in this movement. She was one of the Umbrella Nine, charged, convicted, and sentenced for their involvement. The general charge was \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d Chan, with the other eight, was to be sentenced in April 2019, but her sentencing was delayed until June.\n\nAs she explains, she went for a physical exam, \u201cbecause I thought I would be put into prison for quite some time, and I hoped that I could at least comfort my mum that I would be fine in prison,\u201d which is to say, in good enough health. It was discovered that she had a brain tumor, the size of a golf ball. She said to the public, \u201cI will try my best to treat my condition and walk with everybody along what could be a very long journey to democracy.\u201d\n\nChan underwent five hours of surgery, followed by 30 sessions of radiotherapy. Today, she says, she is fully recovered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen June came around, she was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. The Hong Kong branch of Amnesty International said \u2014 about the treatment of the Umbrella Nine altogether \u2014 \u201cThis is the latest dark chapter in the curtailing of the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIf Tanya Chan is again charged and convicted, she will have to serve the original eight months and then whatever the new sentence is. Therefore, \u201cI need to be more careful,\u201d she says. She wants to participate in all the activities of the democracy movement, but she will have to be \u201cselective,\u201d as she says.\n\nWhen she speaks on the streets, she is something to behold, as you can see in videos \u2014 on YouTube, for example. Pretty and feminine, she is also feisty and fearless, hollering for her rights, and those of her fellow citizens.\n\nThe protests of 2019 were sparked by an extradition bill, which would have sent Hong Kongers, and foreigners arrested in Hong Kong, to the mainland for justice \u2014 which is no kind of justice. According to reports, there have been as many as 2 million people in the streets of Hong Kong at the same time, protesting. Is that true? There has been skepticism about this outside Hong Kong. The population of the city is only 7.4 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is absolutely true, says Tanya Chan \u2014 and there have probably been more than 2 million. No one had ever witnessed anything like it.\n\nThe police brutality has shocked and distressed many Hong Kongers. Before the 1980s, says Chan, the police in Hong Kong were corrupt, and a great amount of work was done to correct that. \u201cIn the past few decades,\u201d she says, \u201cpeople have actually had a lot of respect for the police\u201d \u2014 but no longer.\n\nIn early September, the chief executive of Hong Kong \u2014 who is like a governor, as Chan explains \u2014 withdrew the extradition bill. The official in question is Carrie Lam (or \u201cMrs. Carrie Lam,\u201d as Chan refers to her). Does she act on her own? Or is she merely a puppet for Beijing? Who calls the shots \u2014 the important shots \u2014 in Hong Kong?\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d says Chan. \u201cVery interesting question.\u201d She believes that Mrs. Lam called this shot, in order to \u201ctest the waters\u201d \u2014 in order to see what the reaction of the public would be. Would the withdrawal of the extradition bill quell the protests?\n\nIt did not \u2014 which leads to the question, What do the protesters want now? Four things, Chan says.\n\nFirst, protesters want an independent commission, to investigate \u201cthe whole extradition-bill saga,\u201d as Chan puts it, \u201cincluding police brutality.\u201d Second, they want the government to stop using the word \u201criots\u201d to describe the demonstrations.\n\nRioting is a very serious charge in Hong Kong, subjecting a person to as much as ten years in prison. The U.S. president was not helpful in this regard. In August, a reporter asked Donald Trump, \u201cAre you concerned by reports that the Chinese army may be preparing to intervene in Hong Kong against the demonstrators?\u201d Trump answered as follows:\n\nWell, something is probably happening with Hong Kong, because, when you look at, you know, what\u2019s going on, they\u2019ve had riots for a long period of time. And I don\u2019t know what China\u2019s attitude is. Somebody said that at some point they\u2019re going to want to stop that. But that\u2019s between Hong Kong and that\u2019s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China. They\u2019ll have to deal with that themselves. They don\u2019t need advice.\n\nThird, Hong Kong\u2019s democracy protesters want amnesty for all those who have been arrested while peacefully demonstrating. And fourth, they want \u201cuniversal suffrage,\u201d as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cUniversal suffrage,\u201d to most of us, means voting rights for women, minorities, and so on. In the context of Hong Kong, it means the right to elect the chief executive and the Legislative Council directly. As it stands, the chief executive is elected by a committee. And half the Legislative Council is elected through \u201cfunctional constituencies,\u201d i.e., interest groups, such as trades or professions. The other half is elected in a familiar democratic way: through \u201cgeographical constituencies\u201d (of which Tanya Chan\u2019s Hong Kong Island is an example).\n\nSuffice it to say, the present structure has a pro-Beijing effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI ask Chan, \u201cWill the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] ever accept that fourth demand?\u201d She gives a laugh and says, \u201cWell, it\u2019s promised, and it is written clearly in our Basic Law.\u201d\n\nTo many of us looking on from abroad, I tell Chan, Hong Kong looks like \u201can independent-minded, stubborn child, whom a dictatorial parent\u201d \u2014 namely, Beijing \u2014 \u201cwants to bring to heel.\u201d My phrase \u201cindependent-minded\u201d sets off a little alarm in her.\n\nThe word \u201cindependence,\u201d Chan says, is \u201cvery, very sensitive\u201d in Hong Kong at the moment. The same with the adjective \u201cindependent.\u201d Nevertheless, she continues, \u201cwe\u2019re like a very stubborn child, as you have said. We enjoyed a lot of good things before the handover \u2014 for example, judicial independence and freedom of expression \u2014 and we have appreciated and treasured these core values.\u201d\n\n(It is not always possible to avoid the word \u201cindependence,\u201d or \u201cindependent\u201d \u2014 as in \u201cjudicial independence\u201d and \u201cindependent commission.\u201d)\n\nChan further notes that some of her fellow Hong Kongers care most about financial advantage. What would be best for business? What would most benefit the economic bottom line? To these Hong Kongers, says Chan, the \u201ccore values\u201d \u2014 including freedom of speech \u2014 would be a secondary concern.\n\nI ask her to play psychologist, if she could \u2014 a Hong Kong\u2013wide psychologist, gauging the city\u2019s mood. (I almost say \u201cnational mood,\u201d as the phrase comes readily to one\u2019s lips.) With a laugh, she says she will attempt a diagnosis. Then she turns dead-serious, of course. \u201cThe people are very tense \u2014 under stress \u2014 as they have been for several months, and that includes the government, as well as ordinary citizens. Dramatic things are happening each and every week, and no one knows how it will end.\u201d\n\nWill it end in \u201ca very drastic way\u201d? That\u2019s what Chan wonders, and what many wonder. And it is not hard to imagine what she means by \u201cvery drastic way.\u201d\n\nThirty years ago, the CCP committed the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. \u201cHong Kong people don\u2019t want our democratic movement to end like June 4th,\u201d Chan says. (This was the date of the massacre in 1989.) \u201cWe, of course, hope that the Chinese government \u2014 thanks to attention from the international community \u2014 will not send the People\u2019s Liberation Army into Hong Kong to clear up this mess for the Hong Kong government. This is what the older generation, like me, is trying to avoid.\u201d\n\n(We have a bit of a laugh over \u201colder generation\u201d: Chan is not yet 50, and plenty youthful. And yet, the Hong Kong movement is stocked with twentysomethings.)\n\nVery interested in events in Hong Kong are the people in Taiwan. \u201cWe\u2019re like sisters,\u201d Chan observes. Hong Kong was supposed to be a model for Taiwan. The Hong Kong example was supposed to reassure Taiwanese about life within China, as Chan points out. See how \u201cone country, two systems\u201d can work? Come on in, Taiwan, the water\u2019s fine. Needless to say, the water has not turned out to be fine.\n\nToward the end of our conversation, I ask Tanya Chan what she, and other democrats in Hong Kong, would like from the outside world, especially the United States. Beijing huffs that others must keep out of China\u2019s \u201cinternal affairs,\u201d and not a few in the West agree with them. Chan says, \u201cAt least put pressure on the Chinese government to keep their promises\u201d \u2014 the promises they made at the time of the handover. \u201cI think that\u2019s fair and legitimate.\u201d\n\nMoreover, if China is to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council, shouldn\u2019t they respect human rights, and abide by the international covenants they have signed, concerning human rights? Again: fair and legitimate.\n\nThere are many, many other things to say, but we have time for one more word. What will it be? Tanya Chan says this: \u201cHong Kong is a lovely place and is my homeland\u201d \u2014 interesting word in the context of Hong Kong: homeland \u2014 \u201cbut, unfortunately, because of developments in recent years, some of my friends are moving away. I hope that people who support freedom, democracy, and human rights will pay more attention to what is happening in Hong Kong and support us.\u201d", "description": "Let's focus on one person protesting for democratic rights in the streets of Hong Kong -- Tanya Chan, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council and a democracy leader.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Matthew Continetti", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Rich Lowry", "Ben Shapiro", "Dan Mclaughlin", "Kevin D.
