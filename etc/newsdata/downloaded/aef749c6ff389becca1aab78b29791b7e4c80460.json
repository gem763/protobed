Negotiations last year between Kurdish authorities and the Syrian regime broke down, as Assad was unwilling to recognize Kurdish autonomy across any Syrian territory.\n\nLavrov\u2019s comments come after the White House this week announced that the U.S would be relocating troops from northern Syria, a decision which Kurdish militia leaders described as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d while vowing to defend their positions against Turkey \u201cat all costs.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Turkish military launched a broad offensive against the Kurdish-controlled regions. After launching their assault with shelling and airstrikes, Turkish forces and their Syrian proxies crossed the border into Kurdish-controlled areas. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the autonomous Kurds\u2019 de facto army, successfully held off two incursion attempts.\n\nThis week, Kurdish officials hinted at possible dialogue with the Assad regime. Senior adviser to the Autonomous Administration of North and South Syria (NES) Badran Jia Kur told Reuters that the group would be forced to \u201cstudy all available options.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that time we may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack, so this may develop and there could be meetings and contacts in case of a vacuum,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe invasion, which Erdogan dubbed \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d drew international condemnation, including from the United States. Syria\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs showed little sympathy, declaring that Kurdish authorities are to blame for their current misfortune for relying on American support.\n\n\u201cThey have been warned more than once before through the meetings held with them of the dangers of the project, and not to be tools in the service of American policies against their homeland. However, these organizations were bent on being tools in the hands of foreigners,\u201d the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Russia will urge Kurdish authorities in northern Syria to open talks with Bashar al-Assad's regime in Damascus.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-967851280-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
