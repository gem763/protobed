Twenty-eight percent of employees have leveraged that intel to ask for a pay raise, according to the survey, while 17% have used it during job-offer negotiations.\n\nSome 46% of workers feel they\u2019re underpaid, the survey added, including 50% of women and 41% of men. (Women make an average of 80 cents on a man\u2019s dollar; women of color often make even less.) Another 47% think they receive fair pay, while 7% feel overpaid. A potential factor in some workers\u2019 dissatisfaction: More employees are doing the legwork to see if they\u2019re being paid their worth.\n\nWhile about eight in 10 workers feel they know what they\u2019re worth, 73% (80% of men and 65% of women) report having compared their salaries to market rates over the past year, a nearly 20-point increase from respondents surveyed two years earlier.\n\nUsing an outside research firm, Robert Half surveyed more than 1,000 office workers across the U.S. and 2,800 office workers in 28 major American cities.\n\nThe U.S. median household income in 2017 was $61,372, the Census Bureau announced last September, a 1.8% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, millennials\u2019 (aged 22 to 37) median household income in 2017 was $69,000, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. The unemployment rate currently sits at 3.7%, a nearly 50-year low.\n\n\u201cWorkers have more access to information about their salaries, roles and career options than ever before, arming them for conversations with current and potential employers,\u201d Robert Half senior executive director Paul McDonald said in a statement. \u201cIn a stronger economy, top performers have options, but they\u2019re more likely to stay put if they feel they\u2019re getting paid fairly.\u201d", "description": "This survey by staffing firm Robert Half found that nearly half of employees believe they are underpaid.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ308_salary_ZG_20190828114154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
