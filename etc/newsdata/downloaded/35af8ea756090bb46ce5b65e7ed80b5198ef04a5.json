To try to compensate for every contingency is irrational. We can \u201cwhat if\u201d ourselves right into a straitjacket! You retired early \u2026 you won!\u201d\n\nAs a lifelong football fan, this comment reminded me of Super Bowl LI. At the 8:31 mark of the third quarter, Tevin Coleman hauled in a six-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matt Ryan, putting the Atlanta Falcons ahead of the New England Patriots 28-3.\n\nGame over.\n\nEven with future Hall of Fame coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady on the other sideline, there was no chance of New England overcoming a 25-point deficit in a game in which they were being dominated by a formidable foe.\n\nExcept they did.\n\nNew England scored the last 25 points in regulation to force overtime. Four minutes into overtime, James White ended the game with a two-yard touchdown run. Final score: New England 34, Atlanta 28.\n\nAtlanta took its foot off the gas pedal. It tried to run out the clock. And it lost.\n\nThere\u2019s a valuable lesson there that we can all apply to retirement planning. . . It ain\u2019t over \u2018til it\u2019s over.\n\nIf you\u2019re retiring at the traditional retirement age, you may only be in the third quarter of life. If you leave your career early, like I did at age 41, it may not even be half-time. You haven\u2019t won yet.\n\nTraditional retirement planning, assuming earning no more income and focusing on safe withdrawal rates, is akin to trying to run out the clock. It\u2019s playing not to lose.\n\nLet\u2019s look at why you should continue to play offense in retirement, especially if you\u2019re planning to retire early.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s exactly where you should retire \u2014 based on what\u2019s important to you\n\nPreparing for white swans\n\nAuthor Nassim Taleb popularized the term \u201cblack swan events.\u201d Wikipedia summarizes black swan theory as follows:\n\n1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.\n\n2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).\n\n3. The psychological biases that blind people, both individually and collectively, to uncertainty and to a rare event\u2019s massive role in historical affairs.\n\nMany people talk about planning for black-swan events, which by their very definition can\u2019t be predicted and thus planned for. Conversely, my blogging friend Doc G writes on his blog about the idea of planning for white-swan events.\n\nHe writes: \u201cWhite-swan events are much more common but can be no less devastating to a financial plan. So why do we spend so little time thinking about them?\u201d\n\nA few examples of what he calls white-swan events are changes to your health or tax laws. This idea that life and thus spending is dynamic is firmly rooted in reality, in contrast to modeling based on the assumption that retirement spending remains fixed over time, adjusted only for inflation.\n\nI would add another \u201cwhite swan\u201d that few people like to talk about to his list. Divorce.\n\nDivorce rates are generally decreasing. But for those age 50 and older, the trend is strongly moving in the opposite direction. Researchers have termed this Gray Divorce.\n\nFor those who think early retirees are different and early retirement is some panacea, I refer you to Mr. Money Mustache\u2019s eloquently written post about his recent divorce.\n\nIn my own case, my wife and I didn\u2019t go down the road to divorce. But the massive life transitions during the first year of my early retirement contributed to the most tumultuous period in our otherwise happy 18 years of marriage.\n\nPrior to going through the experience, I would have never predicted this happening. Which leads perfectly to my next point.\n\nWe\u2019re horrible with predictions\n\nRetirement planning requires making many assumptions. We have to predict the unknown. The longer our retirement horizon, the greater our errors become magnified as they are compounded over many years.\n\nBefore you try to forecast decades into the future, it is wise to start with a healthy dose of humility. This Freakonomics podcast reminds us of \u201cThe Folly of Prediction.\u201d\n\nYou need to predict life expectancy. The Atlanta Falcons couldn\u2019t hold on to their 25 point lead for 22 minutes! How much harder is it to develop a plan when you don\u2019t know how long the game will last?\n\nWe need to predict economic factors which include future stock market returns, sequence of returns, interest rates and inflation rates. Few of us are economics experts.\n\nEven the \u201cexperts\u201d are generally terrible at predicting these things. Studies have shown it is very difficult to predict recessions, interest rates or financial markets.\n\nWe need to predict future political conditions that will affect tax rates, the health-insurance marketplace and Social Security.\n\nMost political \u201cexperts\u201d couldn\u2019t accurately predict the outcome of our last presidential election the day before it occurred.\n\nWe also need to predict ourselves. What will make us happy? What do we really want for our lives?\n\nThis intuitively seems much easier than making economic or political predictions. But science tells us otherwise. Harvard psychologists\u2019 studies have shown that \u201cwhen people try to estimate how much they will enjoy a future experience, they are dependably wrong.\u201d\n\nAs I approach two years of early retirement, the only thing I feel comfortable predicting with confidence is that my future will end up differently than I would have predicted.\n\nErrors in our first two years\n\n1. Semiretirement plan\n\nMy wife and I spent several years researching and planning for early retirement. Despite that, in just nine months between telling my employers I would be leaving my job on Feb. 28 and before actually leaving my job on Dec. 1, 2017, our plans changed dramatically.\n\nMy initial plan was to ease into retirement by finding casual part-time work or possibly working a couple of weeks a year doing a travel rotation as a physical therapist. Doing so would allow me to test the waters of early retirement for a few years. easing financial strain, avoiding sequence of returns risk and providing a more gradual psychological transition.\n\nIn spring 2017 I pitched an idea for a book I\u2019d been wanting to write to the guys who created the Choose FI podcast, and they agreed to partner with me.\n\nA few months later, I read one of Darrow Kirkpatrick\u2019s posts on the \u201cCan I Retire Yet\u201d blog and sensed he might be burning out on writing and managing a blog of substantial size. So I proposed a scenario for partnering on the blog. He agreed to do it.\n\nI decided to completely leave my career as a physical therapist to focus on these passion projects. I\u2019ve spent my first two years of early retirement working much more and earning much less (at least in the short term) than I anticipated in our original planning.\n\n2. Housing budget\n\nWe closely tracked our expenses for five years leading up to starting our transition. Our goal for the first few years of our transition was to stop saving, but not draw down investments (plus or minus a few thousand dollars in either direction).\n\nDespite our detailed planning, our projections have been off significantly.\n\nIn 2018, the biggest miscalculation was a positive one. We were able to sell our home without having to use a real-estate agent. This saved us about $15,000 we expected to spend and gave us a significantly positive savings rate for the year.\n\n2019 has been a far different story. We downsized with our new home, thinking it would give us the lifestyle we desired. We love our location and like having less space to maintain, but we hated how inefficiently that space was used in the dated floor plan.\n\nSo we\u2019ve spent this summer working through a major home renovation. When it\u2019s done, we\u2019ll have spent over $30,000 we didn\u2019t anticipate spending on renovations in the first year living in our \u201cmove-in-ready\u201d house. This means taking more from our portfolio than we anticipated.\n\n3. New hobbies and interests\n\nWe moved from Pennsylvania to Utah to be in the mountains and pursue a lifestyle of outdoor adventure. While we get out into the mountains with regularity as planned, we are not doing what we would have predicted in the mountains.\n\nMy wife and I envisioned doing a lot of rock climbing with abundant opportunities surrounding us. But the combination of having a young child and my wife\u2019s struggles with repetitive hand injuries make climbing regularly a challenge.\n\nSo I\u2019ve become an avid mountain biker, riding two to three days every week. My wife also has started riding a bit, and she has also found a love of trail running.\n\nWe also decided to try growing our own food this year. This was something we have talked about for years, but never seriously considered until my daughter got interested after planting a garden at her school. It has turned out to be an incredibly fun and rewarding experience for our family.\n\nNew hobbies, even when pursued with a frugal mind-set, come with costs.\n\nWe bought a mountain bike for my wife. She also got running spikes for the months when the trails are icy. My \u201cfree\u201d bike from a friend still has cost me close to a thousand dollars in upgrades and maintenance. We also bought a bike rack for our car, helmets and other accessories related to our new hobbies costing thousands of dollars.\n\nWe bought lumber to build garden boxes and had a couple tons of dirt hauled in before buying plants and seeds and then spending the summer watering them. Our \u201cfree\u201d vegetables cost us well over $1,000.\n\nBe humble, live large\n\nAs I approach two years since leaving my career, I would advise others contemplating the retirement decision to be humble. Retirement planning comes with a lot of uncertainty.\n\nYou have to embrace the fact that there is a lot you don\u2019t know and can\u2019t predict. The alternative is to spend your life trapped in fear.\n\nThat fear can prevent you from leaving your career, or it can manifest as constant anxiety around spending in retirement. Neither is desirable.\n\nI would also advise that you live large. It doesn\u2019t make sense to do everything it takes to escape mandatory work if you are going to trap yourself in a life constrained by a tight budget with no room to grow, explore and pursue new opportunities as they present themselves.\n\nThese seemingly contradictory pieces of advice have the same solution. Don\u2019t limit your view of retirement.\n\nContinue to play some offense. Never stop growing and learning. Consider fun and interesting ways to earn some ongoing income. Give yourself options.\n\nLife is more fun when you\u2019re playing to win, rather than trying not to lose.\n\nChris Mamula used principles of traditional retirement planning, combined with creative lifestyle design, to retire from a career as a physical therapist at age 41.
