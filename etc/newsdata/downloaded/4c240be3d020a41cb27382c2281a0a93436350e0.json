(YusufJP_/ Twitter)\n\nA 38-year-old woman has been given a three-month suspended sentence and told to take anger management classes after committing a homophobic hate crime at Walthamstow Pride.\n\nFootage posted on Twitter on 28 July showed Jamila Choudhury of East London wearing a black niqab and pelting verbal abuse at a Pride-goer draped in a rainbow flag.\n\nShe called Pride-goers \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cshameless\u201d and repeatedly screamed: \u201cShame on you. God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\u201d\n\nAt the sentencing on October 3, Judge Diana Pigot called Choudhary\u2019s actions \u201can attack on [the LGBT+] community\u201d.\n\nShe was given a three-month suspended sentence, which will not be enforced unless she commits a further offence in the next 12 months.\n\nIn addition, she was given a 40-day anger management activity and ordered to pay \u00a3100 compensation to nine of the people she abused in the incident, in installments of \u00a310 a week.\n\nChoudhury was already under a one-year community order for a racially aggravated public order offence against a London Underground employee who she called a \u201cblack piece of trash\u201d.\n\nAbuse left Pride parade organisers \u201cshaken\u201d.\n\nA passerby, Yusuf Patel, filmed Choudhary\u2019s homophobic rant and posted the footage on Twitter, where her actions were widely condemned.\n\nOn Hoe Street, part of the parade route, a warden can be seen escorting a participant away while the woman continues to harangue people.\n\nDisgusting homophobic abuse at those on Waltham Forest Pride today. No matter what form hate comes in, we must stamp it out and say no to all forms of hate! Also, very importantly we cannot call out one form of hate but be silent/complicit on others. @GalopUK @stonewalluk pic.twitter.com/kDAFoAb8Vw \u2014 Yusuf Patel (@YusufJP_) July 27, 2019\n\nWhile Choudhary shouted abuse, people could be seen ducking in and out of shops behind her as the parade continued toward Town Square Gardens.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police were alerted and Choudhary was arrested on 29 July, later being charged with a hate crime public order offence.\n\nIn an impact statement read in court, one of the parade\u2019s organisers said: \u201cI was shaken, she because she came out aggressively shouting and pointing abuse to the marchers, which included children, including my grandson.\u201d\n\nChoudhary\u2019s defender, Shaun Esprit, claimed she was \u201cdevastated\u201d when she watched the footage. \u201cShe didn\u2019t recognise who she saw,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat she did recognise is extremely angry behaviour. She felt ashamed.\u201d\n\nHe said that the publicity made her \u201cashamed\u201d to look some of the customers in the salon she worked at in the eye.\n\nThe court also heard Choudhury has suffered from health problems including auto-immune disease.\n\n\u201cWe condemn outright and unequivocally all forms of hatred and abuse.\u201d\n\nPride organisers published a statement on its Facebook page shortly after news of the hate crime broke.\n\nWe Are Walthamstow Pride denounced the incident, but emphasised that Islamophobia directed at the suspect is not tolerable either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2026 condemn outright and unequivocally all forms of hatred and abuse, including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and want to make it absolutely clear that this was one, lone individual.\n\n\u201cIn no way do that person\u2019s views represent the views of any section of the local community,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cWe utterly condemn this, and any attempts to use this incident to fan the flames of discord between communities in our great borough. Hear this \u2013 it hasn\u2019t worked in the past, it won\u2019t work now, and it never will.\u201d", "description": "Jamila Choudhury has been sentenced to anger management classes following a homophobic incident at Waltham Forest Pride where she verbally harassed people.", "authors": ["Reiss Smith", "Emma Powys Maurice", "Lily Wakefield", "Patrick Kelleher"], "top_image": "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/waltham-e1564388117538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
