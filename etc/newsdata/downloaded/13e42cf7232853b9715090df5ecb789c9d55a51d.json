Big Tone),\u201d first released in 2008 and available on YouTube. But a representative of Rogi\u00e9rs from his record label Fibby Music Group told Gizmodo via email that the song\u2019s \u201cusage is unauthorised.\u201d The ad can be viewed here.\n\nAs you can hear in the second half of the ad, the music is good, which is an immediate giveaway that something was amiss. Trump\u2019s political ads typically use stock music that sounds like shit.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson assured Gizmodo in a statement that it employs tools to ensure users and advertisers adhere to copyright. \u201cWe have put in place a variety of measures to help rights holders protect their intellectual property rights on Facebook and they can report misuse in our tool here,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe ad remained active on Facebook as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRogi\u00e9rs did not comment about his personal feelings on Trump, but his Twitter feed is filled with retweets about President Trump\u2019s racism, the Trump regime\u2019s crimes against children, and the many criminals in Trump\u2019s orbit. Needless to say, it\u2019s very weird that the Trump regime would choose music from someone who calls out the president\u2019s obviously illegal acts.\n\nThe internet is awash in unauthorised uses of copyrighted material, whether it\u2019s photos, movies, or music. But there\u2019s a big difference between individual internet users stretching the definition of Fair Use under copyright law, and a political campaign using a song without permission for TV or Facebook ads.\n\nBrad Parscale, the campaign manager for Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign, did not return Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOne of the Facebook ads the Trump campaign ran over the weekend featuring stolen music (Screenshot: Facebook Ad Library)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump campaign has gotten into trouble over unlicensed music. In April of 2019, Trump\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted a video that used music from the 2012 Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. That video was removed based on a copyright complaint, but it appears to have been originally made by a Trump fan rather than the Trump campaign. This most recent ad featuring Cory Booker appears to have been made by the Trump campaign and features the president at a rally shouting, \u201cI\u2019m president and they\u2019re not,\u201d before the beat really kicks in.\n\nTrump escalated his rhetoric over the weekend, tweeting about the possibility of a \u201ccivil war\u201d if he\u2019s removed from office. It was just one of many unhinged tweets over the past few days as the Democrats promised to finally open an impeachment inquiry into the U.S. president\u2019s various crimes against the United States.\n\nTrump also tweeted yesterday about how Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff should be arrested for treason. Trump, employing a strategy of plausible deniability that\u2019s a hallmark of his presidency, included a question mark after the call for Schiff to be arrested.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nObviously, calling for your political opponents to be arrested is highly unusual in functional democracies. And it\u2019s equally concerning when the president suggests that whistleblowers are actually spies and should be executed, as he did recently in a closed-door meeting in New York.\n\nAll of that bizarre and extremist language is in line with the new Trump Facebook ad, versions of which accuse the Democrats of lying, and even invokes George Soros.\n\nThere\u2019s no read roadmap for how things go from here, but needless to say, impeachment is a good start. And barring that, maybe a DMCA takedown or civil lawsuit for using music without permission in paid political ads. We\u2019ll take what we can get at this point.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is using copyrighted music in its latest Facebook ads \u2014 music that it didn\u2019t pay for, according to the artist\u2019s record label, which told Gizmodo the Trump campaign never obtained permission to use the song....", "authors": ["Alex Cranz", "David Tracy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wgimr9odod4o1wioh4nu.jpg"}
