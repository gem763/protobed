The stain is actually here,\u201d he said, circling his whole head. \u201cRight on top of his neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cA camouflage shirt covered in grease stains,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cYou have to admit, they know their customers!\u201d\n\nFrom there, Kimmel went on to examine some other items from the new line, including a camouflage keychain, \u201cbecause who doesn\u2019t want to make their keys harder to find?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also \u201cRustic Dog Leash\u201d for $40 and a \u201cRustic Dog Collar\u201d for $38. \u201cThat seems like a lot for a dog collar, but as you can see, it fits any sized dog,\u201d Kimmel said, revealing a photo of President Trump with Mike Pence on a leash. \u201cAnd if you give him a good belly rub, he\u2019ll be your best friend forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best part of this big merchandise announcement is the Trump family still isn\u2019t making their crap in America!\u201d the host added. \u201cThey still can\u2019t spend the extra two dollars to have their garbage made here.\u201d Kimmel did, however, find one jacket on the site that says it\u2019s \u201cdecorated in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cDoes that mean someone in Florida ironed the patch on?
