(AP) - Bengals first-year coach Zac Taylor isn\u2019t going to let an 0-3 start - and two close calls - tear his team apart.\n\nThough disappointed following a 21-17 loss at the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, the 36-year-old Taylor remains confident there are signs of growth.\n\n\u201cWe believe in each other and the message was the wolves are coming,\u201d Taylor said, referring to an animated postgame speech he delivered which could be heard through the locker room door.\n\nBy wolves, Taylor meant critics of a team that counts two losses by four or fewer points, including a season-opening 21-21 loss at Seattle.\n\n\u201cThis group is too strong to allow that to happen,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just so disappointing because we were right there at the end.\u201d\n\nCincinnati overcame a dreadful start and a 14-point deficit by scoring 17 points on three consecutive drives to take the lead on Randy Bullock\u2019s 43-year field goal with 4:54 remaining.\n\nThe trouble was the Bengals couldn\u2019t hold it, allowing Buffalo\u2019s Frank Gore to score on a 1-yard plunge with 1:50 left before falling short on their final drive.\n\nThe game ended when quarterback Andy Dalton, facing third-and-5 at Buffalo\u2019s 28 and with 20 seconds left, had his pass intended for Auden Tate deflected by safety Micah Hyde and intercepted by Tre\u2019Davious White.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s frustrating at times the offense isn\u2019t playing well, the defense is playing well,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve got to put it all together. \u2026 Zac\u2019s animated, he should have been. But the biggest thing is we\u2019ve got to stay together.\u201d\n\nHistory stands against the Bengals, who have previously never enjoyed a winning record the 17 times they opened a season 0-2. Now Taylor, who took over after Marvin Lewis was fired this offseason, becomes the fifth of 10 coaches in team history to start 0-3.\n\nThe Bengals found themselves in a hole for the second consecutive week following a blowout 41-17 home-opening loss to the San Francisco 49ers in which their defense surrendered 572 yards - fifth most in team history.\n\nThe bright side was their defense holding the Bills to just 14 points, rather than the 24 Cincinnati surrendered to the 49ers through halftime.\n\nThe downside, was the Bengals\u2019 offense managed just two first downs and 77 yards offense in the first half, 33 of those coming on Dalton\u2019s completion to Tate on the final play.\n\nThe turnaround didn\u2019t come until cornerback Darius Phillips intercepted a pass by Bills quarterback Josh Allen and returned it to Buffalo\u2019s 22. Three plays later, Dalton scored on a 1-yard run to cut Buffalo\u2019s lead to 14-7.\n\nJoe Mixon then tied the game on a 1-yard reception on Cincinnati\u2019s next drive.\n\nDalton went 20 of 36 for 249 yards and two interceptions. Mixon finally found his legs by finishing with 61 yards rushing, more than doubling the 27 yards he managed in his first two games. He also topped the Bengals\u2019 two-game total of 59 yards entering the game.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves in a bind and playing from behind; you can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mixon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one. Just can\u2019t do it, can\u2019t play from behind. One thing I am proud of is these boys, they fought all four quarters, especially the defense, they played their (behinds) off for us tonight.\u201d\n\nTaylor can only look ahead, noting the Bengals prepare to face AFC North rival Pittsburgh in a prime-time matchup on Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 0-3. It sucks, it feels terrible,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident that the guys in this room, we\u2019re going to get some wins out of this thing, and it\u2019s only a matter of time and we believe in each other. That\u2019s all we can ask for right now. We\u2019ve got a big one coming up next week and we\u2019ll be fired up and ready to roll.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bengals first-year coach Zac Taylor isn't going to let an 0-3 start - and two close calls - tear his team apart.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Ludwiczak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/bengals_bills_football_92734_c0-355-4174-2788_s1770x1032.jpg?130eef5c6fcfa320c520a3a21d946063cabf4129", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
