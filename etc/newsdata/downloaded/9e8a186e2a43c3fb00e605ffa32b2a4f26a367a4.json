The taps ran dry on Wednesday night, following low pressure in the area.\n\nActivist Yusuf Abramjee took to social media to highlight the situation in the Pretoria community. He told News24 that around 20 000 people are currently affected in Laudium and surrounding areas such as Atteridgeville, Claudius and Itireleng.\n\n\"There is not one drop of water in the taps,\" he added.\n\nSchools were forced to close on Friday due to the lack of water, Abramjee says.\n\nAccording to ward councillor Farouk Essop, there has been no communication from the municipality to warn residents that the water would be cut off. He says he was informed that the water shortage was due to restrictions by Rand Water, but that the water utility has instead shifted the blame.\n\nDiwali celebrations hampered\n\nThe community is preparing to celebrate the religious holiday of Diwali over the next few days, and these preparations have been hampered by the lack of water.\n\nIn a statement compiled by numerous community organisations in the area, it was stated: \"We \u2026 and residents of Laudium wish to express our utter disgust at the way in which the authorities have treated this community over the last few days. We believe that our basic human rights have been violated with large sections of our community not having received any water in the past three days.\"\n\nEssop also arranged water tankers to the affected communities, the statement said.\n\n\"Community members have assisted further to take the matter up with the Gauteng Premier, [Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu] and other senior government officials, and still we have no water \u2026 This is a humanitarian crisis that requires urgent and decisive action and we appeal to the relevant authorities to treat the matter as such.\"\n\nBoth Essop and Abramjee stated that they had contacted Gauteng Premier David Makhura to request that he intervene in the situation. However, Makhura's spokesperson, Vugo Mhaga, could not confirm this.\n\nEssop added: \"There has been no indication of when the water will be restored. The community is really fed up. I can\u2019t get answers from anyone.\"\n\nSeveral attempts to elicit comment from Rand Water were unsuccessful on Saturday.\n\nAt the time of publication, News24 had also not been able to reach the City of Tshwane for comment.", "description": "The Pretoria community has been without water since late on Wednesday, with no indication of when the taps will run again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9038/a76d3eb17e2641c7b98c554efbcff69c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
