There too, the place is lit with lamps and people celebrate the triumph of light over darkness. In Nepalese Hinduism, the second day of the five-day festival is known as Kukar Tihar, and it is dedicated to worshipping dogs.\n\nOn this day, the role of dogs in human life throughout history, is celebrated. In Hindu mythology, a dog is considered to guard the gates of afterlife. Even if you keep the tradition aside, we know from experience that having dogs as pets and companions is one of the most fulfilling things ever.\n\nThey are loyal, sensitive to our emotions and only expect affection and love in return. For all this and much more, they deserve a day in the year especially dedicated to them.", "description": "Everyday we read incidents of rape and murders in newspapers, which makes us think that people around us are evil.
