I\u2019ve loved being part of the show, and am so grateful for the phenomenal support we have received.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: bbc)\n\n\"I want to say a special thank you to Janette for believing in me, and giving me the confidence to believe in myself.\n\n\"The things we achieved, from our couple\u2019s choice dance, through to the lifts in our salsa, will stay with me forever. I\u2019ve had the time of my life.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday Will, 31, was allowed to go through on a bye to this weekend, because his injury had been sustained on the day of the live show. But no contestant is allowed to miss two weeks, and scans have since shown that his injury may take up to six months to heal.\n\nIt happened during rehearsals for the jive, during which he jumped off the raised stage at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire and twisted his right knee awkwardly.\n\nAt the time he was rushed to hospital and has since been resting at home and icing his knee in the hope of making it back this week to perform a waltz with his partner Janette Manrara.\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nShe said that the Kent-born sportsman would remain a pal forever, explaining: \u201cAbsolutely devastated that Will and I will not be able to continue dancing.\n\n\"We made some incredible memories that I will never forget, and I am pleased to have shared them with such an inspirational person whom I can now call a friend for life.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of Will\u2019s time on the show came the week before his injury, when he and Janette performed a contemporary dance which told the story of his astonishing life.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nWill expressed how he endured many operations on his legs as a young child at Great Ormond Street hospital and then nearly lost his life to unrelated blood cancer aged seven.\n\nFollowing their powerful performance, many of the audience were in tears and judge Motsi Mabuse was so emotional she was unable to speak.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing \u2019s executive producer Sarah James said: \u201cWe are so sad that Will is unable to continue on the show. He is an incredible and talented person who has brought us some unforgettable moments this series - in particular his powerful and moving couples choice routine.\n\n\"He will be greatly missed and we wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nBayley is hoping that the injury has no lasting repercussions on his table tennis career ahead of the Paralympics next year.\n\nThis Strictly series has been beset with injuries and problems with the pro dancers and their celebs.\n\nPoor Jamie Laing was forced to pull out before the competition even started after landing awkwardly during the red carpet launch and hurting his leg.\n\nHe was replaced by Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher, who was paired with Oti Mabuse and looks set to make it through to the latest stages of the contest.\n\nAnd this weekend saw last-minute changes to the programme as another pro was forced to miss the show after sustaining injuries.\n\nKatya Jones, who is partnered with Mike Bushell, had to pull out of training yesterday after injuring her neck , while her estranged husband Neil Jones missed Saturday night's show because of a calf injury.\n\nInstead, his celebrity partner danced with Kevin Clifton, who had just one hour to learn their street dance routine.\n\nNeil also skipped rehearsal yesterday, leaving Kevin to stand in once again, after tweeting that he could barely walk.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: TV Grab)\n\nHe took one moaning fan to task after they said he should have got on with it.\n\n\"@Mr_NJones disappointing to learn that it was just a tight calf muscle which stopped you dancing. With physio, being a pro I would have expected you to keep with tradition, the show must go on,\" they tweeted.\n\nNeil replied: \"I wish it was just a tight muscle and I've performed with a ripped muscle and a hernia but last night I physically couldn't even walk.\"\n\nStrict rules governing the show mean the partners get one injury card per series - but cannot miss any more than one weekend of filming without risking their place in the competition.\n\nJust yesterday, sources close to the show said it was unlikely Will would be well enough to return to the gruelling rehearsals.\n\n\"Will is devastated as he's put everything into the series and a freak injury looks like it may well be the end of the road for him. He's got a final consultation today and that could be it,\" one insider told the Sun.\n\n\"He's already had a number of appointments with doctors and physios to see if there is any way he can get through, but with each day of training he misses the less likely it is.\"\n\nWill also had to weigh up his Strictly stint next to the 2020 Paralympic Games, where he is supposed to be competing in the table tennis championship.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing returns this Saturday at 7pm on BBC1", "description": "Will Bayley has crashed out of Strictly after suffering an agonising knee injury while training with partner Janette Manrara last week", "authors": ["Nicola Methven", "Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Bbc", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Tv Grab"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734033.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-EROTEME_191026UT11_SCD_095JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
