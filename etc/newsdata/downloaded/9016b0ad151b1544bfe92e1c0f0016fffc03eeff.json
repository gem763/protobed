His frown turned upside down when Richie Mo\u2019unga put his right hand on Crotty\u2019s neck and started massaging it.\n\nIn front of about 50 media at New Zealand\u2019s Rugby World Cup news conference.\n\nAsked if he was showing off their tight combination, Mo\u2019unga laughed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s other things we do,\u201d he said, teasingly and to much mirth, \u201clike coffees, catchups \u2026 not just neck rubs.\u201d\n\nThis was Mo\u2019unga taking charge, just as his backline mate Crotty and the rest of the All Blacks expect him to against South Africa in their blockbuster opening pool game on Saturday when New Zealand begins its World Cup title defense in Yokohama.\n\nMo\u2019unga was picked at flyhalf - or first five-eighths in New Zealand\u2019s rugby vocab - while Beauden Barrett, the incumbent who was world player of the year as the flyhalf in 2016 and \u201817, was kept at fullback. Meanwhile, Ben Smith, regarded as New Zealand\u2019s best fullback, was selected among the reserves.\n\nThe selections on Thursday confirmed the dual playmaker model the All Blacks unveiled in July in the Rugby Championship test against South Africa, and against Australia twice, was no longer an experiment. It hasn\u2019t been an outright success, either. The All Blacks have a win, loss, and draw in those matches.\n\n\u201cRight now he\u2019s the person leading our team,\u201d All Blacks captain Kieran Read said of Mo\u2019unga\u2019s selection at No. 10.\n\n\u201cWe want to see him keep continually pushing us. First five, they\u2019re the ones that drive it, doing most of the talking and the direction on the field. He\u2019s really grown into that part of his game and I can\u2019t wait to see him on the field on Saturday.\u201d\n\nRead has been playing with Mo\u2019unga for six years, starting with Canterbury, then the Crusaders for three years, and the All Blacks for the last 15 months. They have a cupboard full of trophies together.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t appear to be nervous,\u201d Read said. \u201cHe\u2019s always happy to have a joke, to joke around, and a smile on his face. For him, the more relaxed he is, the better performance he puts out.\u201d\n\nMo\u2019unga wasn\u2019t nervous on Thursday. He says he can\u2019t wait for his World Cup debut along with 11 others in the All Blacks\u2019 23, and will take a moment for himself in front of the sellout crowd of 72,000 in Yokohama Stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll soak it up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in the middle of the field just looking around and thinking, \u2018Wow, what an amazing time to be here,\u2019 but knowing in the back of my head I have a job to do and the team needs me to do my role well. It\u2019s being clear about our game plan and what we\u2019re trying to achieve so I can boss the boys around.\u201d\n\nTwo more Crusaders are on the wings: Sevu Reece and George Bridge, who have eight caps and nine tries between them. With Smith in the reserves, there was no room for wing Rieko Ioane, who has 23 tries in 26 tests.\n\n\u201cThese two young fellas have hit the track running and are playing extremely well,\u201d coach Steve Hansen said. \u201cRieko had a bit of a flat patch, which happens in everyone\u2019s career, and his job now is to wait for an opportunity. He was going to get one against Tonga (in the last warmup) but unfortunately he had a calf niggle and we didn\u2019t play him.\u201d\n\nCrotty and Anton-Lienert Brown were in midfield, with Sonny Bill Williams in the reserves. The All Blacks had to deny this week that Williams had a tournament-ending knee injury; he\u2019s not starting because he hasn\u2019t played much in six weeks, and Jack Goodhue was sore and not to be risked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about how we\u2019ve never settled on a combination,\u201d Hansen said, \u201cbut I think the versatility of this group allows us to play whoever we want and the combination clicks. People are used to seeing a Ma\u2019a Nonu and Conrad Smith-type combination but if you reflect back, we used people to change that up. The (2015) final is a great example. We swapped Conrad out at halftime and Sonny came on. The combination now has got to be more than just two people, they\u2019ve got to be your whole team.\u201d\n\nScott Barrett returns from suspension and will combine with Sam Whitelock in the second row. Brodie Retallick, their main lock who dislocated his shoulder against the Springboks, was \u201cgoing pretty good at training,\u201d Hansen said, without elaborating.\n\nThe match will likely decide the winner of Pool B. The top-placed team then has a good chance of avoiding a quarterfinal against No. 1-ranked Ireland.\n\nHansen said the last two weeks feel like they have dragged, and he\u2019s glad the match was almost here.\n\n\u201cTo play this opponent first, we couldn\u2019t ask for anything more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. Whilst it doesn\u2019t look on my face, it is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece, Anton Lienert-Brown, Ryan Crotty, George Bridge, Richie Mo\u2019unga, Aaron Smith; Kieran Read (captain), Sam Cane, Ardie Savea, Scott Barrett, Sam Whitelock, Nepo Laulala, Dane Coles, Joe Moody.
