Henson, Zoe Kazan, Susan Kelechi Watson, Mandy Moore and Marisa Tomei all showed up to the Emmys in two-tone looks of pink and red that stood out on the awards\u2019 purple carpet.\n\nThe dual tones were the strongest trend among the women on Sunday, where outfits from Gwendoline Christie and current red carpet darling Billy Porter also turned heads. Corsets, too, had a wow moment, with Indya Moore\u2019s white Louis Vuitton. There were some classic Hollywood metallic moments as well, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus in sequined gold and Rachel Brosnahan in navy blue. Laura Linney and Niecy Nash embraced heavily sequined looks.\n\nKerry Washington, Angela Bassett and Amy Poehler all opted for pants, while Porter, who has made headlines with his red-carpet gowns, chose sparkling stripe trousers from Michael Kors and a huge statement hat with a towering brim on one side by Stephen Jones.\n\nThere were plenty of black tuxedos, but some of the men took bolder approaches. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star Sterling K. Brown chose a red jacket and bow tie, while his co-star Justin Hartley opted for a bright blue tux.\n\nClick through the images in this photo gallery by The Associated Press to see many of the evening\u2019s head-turning looks.\n\n___\n\nFor complete coverage of the Emmy Awards, visit: www.apnews.com/EmmyAwards\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There was no shortage of color on the carpet at Sunday's Emmy Awards, with television's biggest stars donning everything from eye-popping pinks to gold tones that matched the hardware hand out onstage.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/emmys_fashion_22312_c162-0-2837-1560_s1770x1032.jpg?729949f94315829235843e657f426ae07a0b64de", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
