In the U.S. case, the result is not a consequence of decline per se, but of radically altered U.S. domestic political circumstances (e.g., \u201cAmerica First\u201d) and deepened multi-layered conflict in the region. For better or worse, President Trump\u2019s determination to reduce troops deployed overseas, from Afghanistan to Syria, is part of an effort to make good on campaign pledges. Explaining his troop reductions in northeast Syria, Trump reiterated this imperative: \"I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s latest pull-back decision in Syria \u2013 in effect, leaving U.S. Kurdish allies who led the charge against the Islamic State (ISIS) to the tender mercies of the Turks \u2013 followed a December 2018 troop reduction in Syria and two unanswered Iranian attacks on Saudi Arabia. One result: The desperate Kurds shifting alignments to Syria\u2019s Bashar Al-Assad and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinFunding for Radio Free Europe to return to Hungary will send a strong message Juan Williams: Trump, the conspiracy theory president Putin: Trump not to blame for lack of improved relations with Russia MORE.\n\nThe current mess is occurring against the backdrop of U.S.-Turkish relations strained by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s suspicions of American complicity in the 2016 failed military coup, his courting of Putin and his decision to purchase Russian S-400 missiles, the U.S. decision to expel Turkey from the F-35 project in retaliation, and the fight against ISIS in Syria.\n\nThese developments are but the latest in a calamitous, tragic pattern of U.S. self-inflicted wounds helping to catalyze widespread disorder in the region, starting with the 2003 Iraq war and the chain of disastrous events it set in motion. Those include the Sunni-Shia (aka Saudi-Iranian) internecine conflict; the deceptive, short-lived 2011 \u201cArab Spring\u201d that quickly became the Arab Winter; the blundered intervention in Libya, and then Syria\u2019s deadly morass.\n\nIn case there was any doubt, the dismal results illuminate the stark reality that U.S. ability to shape outcomes has disappeared \u2013 even after $6 trillion spent trying. Two U.S. aircraft carriers and a ring of bases in Bahrein, Qatar and Kuwait have had little impact on the region\u2019s wars, from Libya to Yemen and Saudi Arabia. A militarized policy has fostered a mindset where, since we have a big hammer, every problem is a nail.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see our own parallels with countries we view retrospectively as \u201cobviously\u201d having overreached in earlier eras, such as Russia in Afghanistan, Britain and France at the Suez Canal in 1956, or Hitler\u2019s 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow we are beginning to see the cost of Trump\u2019s mostly successful efforts to keep his campaign promises. The simplistic \u201cbring the boys home\u201d \u2013 a legitimate impulse \u2013 shows that in foreign policy how and when you do things matter as much as what you do.\n\nTrump\u2019s instincts reflect a current national exhaustion and doubt, the psychological impact of the 2008 financial crisis and endless Middle East wars. Optimists may portray current shifts as just a midcourse correction, while pessimists see it as a long-term trend. But the public appears to have lost any appetite for mission adventures.\n\nCould it be that the proverbial man on the street has more common sense than the political elite? They seem to be saying, in effect, \u201cAfter $6 trillion and 18 years of bombing Muslims, what do we have to show for it? The Middle East is a bigger disaster than ever. Has terrorism been reduced or just recycled? We have plenty of our own problems.\u201d\n\nThe parallels today with Britain\u2019s retreats are inexact. But a generation of unwinnable Mideast wars shows us the idiocy and expense of social engineering in alien cultures and societies. Behind it lies, exactly as it once did in Britain, a sense of mission civilisatrice and inflated national exceptionalism. No exceptions to the cycles of history: All empires have succumbed to such narcissistic conceits.\n\nHowever overly simplistic, there is an underlying logic to Trump\u2019s impulses. The shale revolution, which has led to the U.S.\u2019s new status as the world\u2019s top producer of oil and gas, has fundamentally altered the geopolitics of energy. The center of gravity of global hydrocarbon production has already shifted from the Persian Gulf to the Western Hemisphere. Canadian oil sands, a reforming Mexico and Brazil\u2019s ultra-deep water reserves all point to a new post-OPEC reality.\n\nOf course, it is still a global oil market. But 75 percent of Mideast oil is exported to Asia; China, Japan, South Korea and India have a growing stake in the Middle East. Yet, a disruption and price spike anywhere is still a price spike everywhere. A fair question that Trump asks is, why don\u2019t those who buy Gulf oil play more of a security-guarantor role?\n\nPolling data suggest that Americans generally favor a more participatory world in which governments, reflecting popular will, also treat their people well. But they want other nations to share the burdens of responsibility for world order, too. The penchant for throwing good money after bad has breathtaking pedigree, from the Vietnam war to Afghanistan.\n\nWe cannot and should not, as then-Secretary of State John Quincy Adams put it in his 1821 Fourth of July speech, \u201cgo abroad seeking monsters to destroy.\u201d The U.S. has always done best when leading by example, being the \u201cshining city on the hill\u201d rather than trying to export it.\n\nThe problem this time around, however, is that, unlike Britain\u2019s \u201cEast of Suez\u201d retreat, there is no obvious replacement, no nation with the economic and military power and comparable values to which to pass the baton.\n\nRobert A.
