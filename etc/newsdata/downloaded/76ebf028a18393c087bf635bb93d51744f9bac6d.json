E*Trade Financial Corp. dropped 20%, the most in more than a decade. Shares of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and Schwab both slid about 10% at 11:30 a.m. in New York.\n\nThe move escalates a long-simmering price war as investors gravitate toward the cheapest products. Last week, Interactive Brokers said it would offer free trades. That follows Fidelity Investments\u2019s announcement in June that it was expanding its lineup of commission-free ETFs. Last year, Vanguard Group said it would offer almost 1,800 ETFs commission-free, and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, introduced You Invest, a zero-commission trading platform for millions of retail customers.\n\nSee also: JPMorgan offers free trades in escalating fight for retail\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to follow suit,\u201d Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said of Schwab\u2019s competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s a commoditized business. When there\u2019s an announcement by one firm, others play catch-up or take a more aggressive strategy.\u201d\n\nSchwab\u2019s online clients will qualify for zero commissions, down from $4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7, the firm said in a statement. It will continue to charge a fee of 65 cents per contract for options trades.\n\nAmeritrade is more exposed than its closest rivals because the company gets more than a third of its revenue from commissions in fees, said David Ritter, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-whammy for them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the biggest of the big like Schwab, they\u2019re best able to absorb and monetize in other ways.\u201d\n\nWhile Schwab, with about $3.75 trillion of client assets, gets a majority of its revenue from net interest income, its decision to eliminate commissions comes at a perilous time because of historically low interest rates. Last month, the San Francisco-based company said it was cutting 600 jobs, or about 3% of its workforce, citing \u201can increasingly challenging economic environment.\u201d\n\nRead more: Schwab to cut 600 jobs as falling rates crimp interest income\n\nSchwab\u2019s move also may prompt Ameritrade and E*Trade to reconsider a merger, Ritter said.\n\nSchwab previously doubled its suite of no-commission ETFs in March, bringing its total to more than 500 at the time. BlackRock Inc. iShares products were added to its platform, Schwab ETF OneSource, with 90 funds. Several fund issuers including State Street Global Advisors, Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree Investments Inc., J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. also planned to add to their commission-free offerings already on the platform.\n\nFor Schwab, offering free trades is the ultimate extension of its roots in the 1970s as a discount broker.\n\n\u201cEliminating commissions ensures my ultimate vision is realized -- making investing accessible to all,\u201d Schwab\u2019s billionaire founder and Chairman Charles Schwab said in the statement.\n\n--With assistance from Emma Vickers.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.net;Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, ;Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Peter Eichenbaum, Vincent Bielski\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Shares of the biggest online brokerages plummeted Tuesday after market leader Charles Schwab Corp. announced plans to eliminate commissions for U.S. stocks, exchange traded funds and options.TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. took the biggest hit, tumbling as much as 23%, the most since 2006.", "authors": ["John Gittelsohn", "Annie Massa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
