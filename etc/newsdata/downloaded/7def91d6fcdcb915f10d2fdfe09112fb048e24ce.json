USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 For one day at least, President Donald Trump is getting along great the U.S. intelligence community \u2013 most of them anyway.\n\nIn announcing the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Trump praised the work of intelligence officials, a marked departure from his repeated criticism of the intelligence community over the Russia investigation.\n\n\"We had some incredible intelligence officials that did a great job,\" Trump said during remarks Sunday at the White House.\n\nYet while proclaiming \"it's really a deserving name \u2013 intelligence,\" Trump also seemed to take a shot at certain unnamed leaders in what Washington refers to as the \"intelligence community.\"\n\n\"I've dealt with some people that aren't very intelligent having to do with intel,\" Trump said.\n\nMore: Trump withheld details of raid from Pelosi, other congressional Democrats\n\nAaron David Miller, a former State Department official and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it's \"ironic that several of the things Trump has castigated likely helped secure this victory\" \u2013 including CIA intelligence, Kurdish cooperation, and the U.S. counterterrorism troop presence in Syria.\n\nMiller said he found Trump's praise of the intelligence community, in particular, to be quite ironic: \"It\u2019s the very professional intelligence community that he constantly derides that\u2019s helped him claim credit for killing Baghdadi.\"\n\nTrump has clashed repeatedly with intelligence officials throughout his presidency, mostly over two high-profile investigations.\n\nOne is Russian interference in the 2016 election to benefit the Trump; the other is the ongoing impeachment inquiry that centers on Trump's own dealings with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\"When we use our intelligence correctly, what we can do is incredible,\" Trump told reporters Sunday. \"When we waste our time with intelligence that hurts our country, because we had poor leadership at the top, that's not good.\"\n\nA video posted on a militant website July 5, 2014, purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Thank you for your courage, skill, & dedication. Your continued success dismantling terrorist organizations saves countless innocent lives. \u2014 John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) October 27, 2019\n\nIn February of 2017, less than a month after his inauguration, Trump tweeted that \"the real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence\u2019 like candy. Very un-American!\u201d\n\nIn May of 2018, Trump claimed on Twitter that \"Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump.\"Trump and aides have said they suspect Ukraine interfered in the election \u2013 one of the topics of the call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that is central to the impeachment drive.\n\nThe White House released photos of President Donald Trump watching from the Situation Room as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid. (Photo: The White House)\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating whether Trump held up military aid to Ukraine until it agreed to investigate the 2016 election and U.S. Democratic opponent Joe Biden. The probe began after a whistleblower's complaint.\n\nThroughout the process, Trump and his allies have accused the whistleblower of having links to the intelligence community. Democrats have accused Trump of seeking to \"out\" the whistleblower for political reasons.\n\nOn Sunday, both Trump and his critics praised the U.S. intelligence community \u2013 the latter group saying it performed well despite past attacks from the commander in chief.\n\nChris Whipple, author of \"The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,\" called Trump\u2019s praise \u201cgrudging at best.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Trump never used the term \u201cCIA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no coincidence,\u201d Whipple said.\n\nTrump did not mention CIA Director Gina Haspel or acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire in his initial remarks praising the intelligence community but later thanked both in response to a question about who was involved.\n\nAnti-Trump Republican strategist Rick Tyler said the al-Baghdadi operation \"eviscerates his systematic undermining of American intelligence capabilities.\"\n\nThe announcement of al-Baghdadi's death came three weeks after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria, a move that sparked bipartisan criticism that he had abandoned the Syrian Kurdish forces who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-donald-trump-now-loves-us-intelligence-community/2478309001/", "description": "In announcing the death of ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Trump praised the work of intelligence officials, a marked departure from his repeated criticism of\u00a0the intelligence community.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Courtney Subramanian", "Published P.M.
