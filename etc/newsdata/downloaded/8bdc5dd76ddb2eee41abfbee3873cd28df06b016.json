PiS, which remains unchallenged in the polls, hopes to sweep the vote to ensure a second term in office.\n\nIn September 2018, private broadcaster TVN24 reported that Poland\u2019s state audit body, NIK, was questioning an outlay of over 33 million zloty (\u20ac7.6 million euro) by the Justice Fund, a government fund to help victims of crime.\n\nAccording to TVN, the money went toward the purchase of a \u201cnew system to spy on telephones and computers, the most expensive system in the history of Polish secret services.\u201d Reports that the covertly purchased system could be Pegasus \u2014 a top-performing spyware that is impossible to track \u2014 surfaced last week.\n\nTVN24 also alleged that the CBA anti-corruption body had received money to buy spyware from the Justice Fund, as indicated by the state auditor. That would be illegal because CBA can only be financed directly from the state\u2019s budget.\n\nDespite scandals, PiS remains well ahead of the opposition in the polls\n\nPiS and the CBA deny the claims.\n\n\u201cCBA did not buy any \u2018system of mass surveillance of the Polish people\u2019. Opinions and comments regarding this matter are insinuations and are not supported by facts,\u201d CBA said in statement Wednesday.\n\nBut Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was less clear: \u201cEverything [about the alleged Pegasus purchase] that requires explanation will be explained in due time,\u201d Morawiecki told a press conference on his campaign trail in the western town of \u015awiecko.\n\nPoland\u2019s opposition parties quickly united in criticism of the government, accusing it of breaking the law to buy a spyware system that would be used by secret police under the radar of the courts.\n\n\"I think there are pretty strong premises to say that the purchased system was indeed Pegasus. Foreign experts suspect it was already used in Poland, the cost appears realistic as for this type of system, and there was no real denial from the government,\" said Tomasz Siemoniak, deputy chairman of the largest opposition party, Civic Platform (PO) and former Polish defense minister.\n\nDespite scandals, PiS remains well ahead of the opposition in the polls, standing a good chance to win a straight majority in the next parliament.\n\n\"Why was the system allegedly purchased by anti-corruption police CBA that doesn't need it? In their statement, they said that they didn't buy any system of mass surveillance \u2014 but Pegasus isn't mass surveillance, it's targeted surveillance,\" Siemoniak said.\n\n\"There's no place for such systems in democratic countries respecting rule of law. We are taking the matter to the Ombudsman on Monday,\u201d he added.\n\nPiS has a well-documented history of tinkering with state institutions that are formally independent, in what critics see as creeping installations of a Hungary-like authoritarian state. The party is at loggerheads with the EU over its reforms of the judicial system that aim at subjugating courts to the government.\n\nLast month, the Onet news portal published a report alleging that Deputy Justice Minister \u0141ukasz Piebiak \u201carranged and controlled\u201d an online campaign against judges critical of the government\u2019s judicial reforms.\n\nDespite scandals, PiS remains well ahead of the opposition in the polls, standing a good chance to win a straight majority in the next parliament.\n\nIn a recent poll by pollster IBRiS, PiS enjoyed 43.4 percent of support, which would give it 259 MPs in 460-seat parliament. The centrist Civic Coalition \u2014 led by the largest opposition party Civic Platform (PO) \u2014 was second with just 21.2 percent, giving it 119 MPs.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "It\u2019s the latest scandal to plague the ruling party ahead of elections.", "authors": ["Wojciech Ko\u015b\u0107", "Jan Cienski"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-918977508-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
