There are really more important things than women. And the Labour party. There is Brexit, the Queen\u2019s speech, voter suppression, almost every other issue \u2013 and the unfettered egos of Boris Johnson and the posh bouncer Dominic Cummings. And there is the Brexit party on the sidelines, with its Stepford Wives view of femininity.\n\nThis is not the time to think about that \u201csingle issue\u201d of female representation, because everything else is more urgent. Except, actually, there is no policy that doesn\u2019t affect the majority of the population \u2013 women. And there is no future for Labour unless it attracts women voters. When John McDonnell spoke of shortening the working week, which is great, I wondered how this plays out in the double shift of paid work and domestic work that is most women\u2019s lives. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s power is leaking away. No simple chant can bring it back \u2013 and if you want to call me a Tory for saying so, more fool you. Polls, schmolls.\n\nThe process of putting him out of his misery has already started. McDonnell is taking control. \u201cI\u2019m still of the view now that whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman,\u201d he says. But how much Labour wants to elect a female leader is debatable. It feels more like it is being embarrassed into it because the Tories have had two and even the very male-dominated Lib Dems have managed one.\n\nThis is not an argument about women being better, or even helping other women. It is an argument about basic representation. The sudden argument from some pundits that representative democracy is in crisis? Well, hello: for some of us it has been in crisis for decades. Its institutions are not fit for purpose. The Labour party does not stand outside this.\n\nMisogyny, openly weaponised by Johnson with his contemptible reply of \u201chumbug\u201d to the female politicians who live daily with death threats and panic buttons, is not in question on the right. On the left, though, particularly that part of the left Corbyn represents, it is rife. Once you take a position of moral superiority and declare yourself anti-racist, ant-sexist and most of all, anti-capitalist, you don\u2019t actually have to give up your own power or do anything about it: you know the tune; just hum the words. Just as antisemitism has been repeatedly ignored, so too has sexism, because loyalty is valued over self-reflection.\n\nOf course there are some brilliant women in the Labour party, but few remain in the inner circle and some of these are finally breaking rank. I never expected much from the type of guys who visit Cuba without noticing it\u2019s a police state, where prostitution is rife and ordinary people cannot buy ibuprofen. Or the people who denied the corruption in Venezuela. I have known such revolutionaries all my life.\n\nWhat has been shocking, though, is that even for the sake of \u201coptics\u201d they will not address the clear and present anti-women bias in their midst: from the all-male shortlists for their elected mayors \u2013 Sion Simon, Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram \u2013 to the dreadful online abuse directed at any woman who challenges Corbyn. (Think of a woman who has given her life to the Labour party, such as Angela Eagle.) The leadership position on rape allegations and sexual harassment is that no outside body needs to be involved; this can be done with an internal inquiry. All this while the Corbyn outriders call any woman who disagrees with them a centrist melt. Or things I can\u2019t say here. Then there is the list of women MPs now facing deselection. How do they think this looks?\n\nIt\u2019s amusing to see Alastair Campbell spar with McDonnell over having a female leader. I really thought there could be no more monotonously laddish leadership than New Labour and its football schtick. I was wrong. But the retro machismo of Labour conference this year was abhorrent.\n\nA female leader is only part of the answer, though. There is something rotten at the core of this administration that comes out of a political formation that has never prioritised women. Like many other failing political institutions where no one cares about gender, everyone just wants the best person for the job \u2013 and it always happens to be a bloke. Labour knows it has to change.
