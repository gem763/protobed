Despite the fact that the Saudis and their allies are the ones that have been attacking Yemen and violating its sovereignty by bombing and shelling the country, Hadi presents his Yemeni enemies as if they were foreign aggressors that need to be repelled. While he lives in exile in Riyadh and serves as little more than a Saudi prop at this point, he accuses his opponents of being the agents of a foreign government. The Yemenis that are being bombed are portrayed as \u201cagents of chaos,\u201d while the governments that are bombing them are \u201ccoming to the aid of Yemen.\u201d The dishonesty of Hadi\u2019s argument is fairly obvious to anyone paying close attention to the story, but for many people in the West these misrepresentations will sound plausible.\n\nThe trouble is that the false portrayal of the Houthis as \u201cpuppets of the Iranian government\u201d is already a widespread one, and Hadi is counting on Western audiences to know just enough about the region to be alarmed by his warnings of \u201cthe next Hezbollah\u201d without understanding how far-fetched the claim really is. It might be worth noting that if one wanted to create a new Hizbullah, the fastest way to do that would be to have foreign governments attack this group\u2019s country, thus providing it with the perfect opportunity to present itself as defending the country against the invader. The campaign that Hadi and the U.S. support is making this outcome more likely rather than less.\n\nWhat Hadi predictably fails to mention is the humanitarian disaster that this war is causing for the entire country. This is what \u201ccoming to the aid of Yemen\u201d looks like in reality:\n\nThe strengthening Saudi Arabian-led air campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis now in control is systematically destroying much of the country\u2019s infrastructure. Anything that had been left of basic services, including health care, is all but gone, the U.N. said.\n\nHadi has to ignore the fact that all of Yemen is suffering from lack of food, water, medicine, and fuel because of the cruel and unnecessary war that his allies are waging in his name. Whatever support he may have had before he fled the country has all but vanished, so it\u2019s absurd to think that he will be able to return to the capital as president. He says that Yemen has been pulled back \u201cfrom the edge\u201d of an abyss by the Saudi-led war, but the reality is that this war threatens to push the entire country into the abyss. If it falls in, there should be no confusion about who was responsible.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/desertshield.jpg", "published_at": "2015-04-13"}
