A lot.\n\nAnd awkward situations, conflicts with coworkers and productivity drains are common occurrences.\n\nHow you navigate these situations can play a role in your career advancement and satisfaction.\n\nBut don't worry, we're here to help.\n\nYou have a potty mouth. Is that OK?\n\nSometimes bad things happen in the office, your emotions run high and a curse word accidentally slips out of your mouth.\n\nWhile an occasional swear word is usually accepted at work, it shouldn't become a pervasive part of an office's culture.\n\nConstant cursing can tarnish your own brand and limit your career opportunities.\n\nSomeone else is getting credit for your work\n\nBeing a team player at work is important. But so is getting recognition for your contributions.\n\nGetting credit for your work is an important part of establishing your worth and climbing the career ladder, but constantly seeking out recognition can backfire and end up making you look like a credit hog.\n\nHere's how to balance that fine line between looking like you're not a team player and getting the acknowledgment you deserve.\n\nYou got fired, is your career over?\n\nNope.\n\nGetting fired can be devastating, but it's not the end of your career.\n\nHow you bring up a termination in a job interview is important though: You don't want to lie, but you also should avoid dwelling on it.\n\nYou haven't been promoted in forever\n\nYou've been working long hours, going above and beyond your job duties and exceeding expectations.\n\nBut yet, you still haven't been able to move up the career ladder.\n\nEmployees shouldn't linger too long at a company if they aren't climbing the career ladder fast enough.\n\nIs it OK to text with your boss?\n\nTexting can be a fast and easy way to communicate when we're out of the office.\n\nBut texts can carry a heavier sense of urgency than an email or instant message -- whether that's the intent or not.\n\nManagers and their employees should set expectations of how they prefer to communicate in and out of the office. Some workers might find texting easier than a traditional email or phone call, while others might find it too invasive.\n\nWe tend to fire off texts a little more haphazardly than an email, which can lead to some unfortunate blunders.\n\nI got a job offer, how can I leverage it with my current employer?\n\nCongrats, you got a job offer! It's for more money, but you really aren't ready to move on from your current employer.\n\nWhat do you do?", "description": "Awkward situations, conflicts with coworkers and productivity drains are common occurrences in the workplace.
