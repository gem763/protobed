That complaint could be followed by a lawsuit.\n\nBrewer claimed in the lawsuit that a vote to replace him with Dawn Stough, a black woman, had no other motivation besides racial animus. Stough has since resigned.\n\nThe lawsuit says the white city attorney, police chief and deputy city clerk were also replaced at the same meeting.\n\nThe changes came after an African American majority was elected to the city board and Mayor Quordiniah Lockley, also black, succeeded a white man.\n\nLambert was replaced by a black woman who had been public works director in the nearby town of Magnolia.\n\nHowever, the new majority did retain some white department heads, including the fire chief and the recreation director. A black woman was demoted when her title as finance director was eliminated.\n\nBrewer declined comment, while Lambert said he\u2019s waiting on the conclusion of the EEOC inquiry.\n\nCity board members Tuesday night were told that they had received no communication about the filing from the EEOC.\n\nLockley said he could not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two former employees of a southwest Mississippi city are pursuing legal action, claiming black officials fired them because they were white.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/AP_983612733024_c0-908-2496-2363_s1770x1032.jpg?08ee686c020f309a0fa0b3a279bf32fce50f88bb", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
