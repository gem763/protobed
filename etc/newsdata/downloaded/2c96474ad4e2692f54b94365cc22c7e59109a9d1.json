Based in Chicago, she acts as a steward and advocate for the firm\u2019s \u201cResponsible Business Leadership\u201d commitment, which acknowledges \u201cdoing something good for the world can also be good for business.\u201d Her work includes leading a team to teach financial and tech literacy to girls and underrepresented communities.\n\nAlong with PwC\u2019s U.S. Chair and Senior Partner Tim Ryan, Schuyler also leads CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. The group was launched in June 2017 and now includes more than 800 CEOs, university officials, and nonprofit leaders who have pledged to advance diversity and inclusion in their workplaces. Schuyler drives the group\u2019s strategy for engaging hundreds of CEOs, academic institutions, and nonprofit associations around the country who have pledged to take \u201cmeasurable action\u201d to improve diversity and inclusion within their organizations.\n\nSchuyler spoke with Penta about CEO Action\u2019s origin story, how being the mother of a biracial son shapes her perspective on her work advancing diversity and inclusion, and her advice for new CEOs.\n\nPenta : Before CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion grew into a national organization, it started as an internal effort by PwC Chairman Tim Ryan to simply start conversations among the firm\u2019s thousands of employees. He wanted to talk about important yet deeply personal issues that are often avoided at the office\u2014race, religion, politics, discrimination, violence. What were those early conversations like at the company?\n\nShannon Schuyler: Racially charged violence around the country was reaching a peak in 2016, when Tim took over as chairman of PwC. He was amazed at how horrible things were and that we were not talking about it in the workplace. He said, \u201cHere's all these things happening in our own communities and yet we get to work on Monday and it's not a part of the discussion; it has to be on the minds of our people. Why aren't we talking about that?\u201d So he started a day where we'd talk about it\u2014no script, nothing off limits.\n\nEven though there was some trepidation, it was really the first time in my more than 20 years at the firm that people just openly shared and cried and respectfully disagreed with each other. There were a lot of different concerns. We learned, for example, that some black employees who were late coming to work had been stopped [by the police] while driving in white neighborhoods. There were individuals who were Muslim in the country who were afraid for themselves; there were individuals whose family members were police officers who were concerned; there were some employees who were part of the LGBTQ+ community who were concerned about where they could safely use the bathroom.\n\nWe had a good dialogue and debate and started to create a safe space to say, \u201cWe need to talk about this at work.\u201d In order to be a truly inclusive culture we have to understand what people are thinking and feeling and be able to share that \u2026 and really have a chance to understand each other because it will give us a sense of belonging.\n\nYou\u2019re raising a biracial 6-year-old son with your husband, who is African American. How do your personal experiences as a mom and as part of an interracial marriage inform your perspective on the work you do to increase diversity and inclusion in corporate America?\n\nBeing able to have [a partner] who has a different perspective has made me such a better person and allows me to have a better idea of [when] people get things wrong, [including myself]. When we hear things that aren't right, if we can be a part of saying, \"No, that's wrong,\" I think that's a role that we can play.\n\nMy son started first grade this year. He has the best, big, curly hair and he's teased about it. Kids can be not nice. And those are different experiences that I didn't have and so I now see through his eyes, even at that age, being someone who is biracial and having people who are not always as kind as I would want. It\u2019s just hard to believe that that happens in this day and age. When I think of him, I think of the privilege that I have and the responsibility to change his experience.\n\nWhat\u2019s your advice for new corporate executives who are trying to advance diversity and inclusion in their companies?\n\nMany CEOs, when they've stepped into their roles, didn\u2019t realize that such a significant part of their job would be the social element of having to actually raise your hand, having your employees or your customers say, \"What are you going to do about this?\" and actually taking a stand on issues such as same-sex marriage, immigration, gun control, and climate change.\n\nCEOs need to embrace the fact that what is important today goes far beyond share value. And if they're not looking at these things, it will be a detractor for people coming to their organization. It will not enable them to look at innovation in the same way, to create new products, to get new business, and ultimately their boards will be challenged by their stakeholders to make change.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming up on the agenda that you\u2019re excited about?\n\nI'm very proud of our Check Your Blindspots tour bus that we\u2019ve been using this year to open up a dialogue around the country about unconscious bias and how to mitigate it in our everyday lives. The bus is available for any of our CEO Action signatories to use as well as for colleges and universities. You walk through the bus and you go through several different interactive, technology-based experiences to check your blind spots. One of them is a virtual reality tool that allows you to immerse yourself in real-life scenarios designed to help you understand the perspective of somebody who might not be yourself, and show how unconscious biases are revealed in everyday life.\n\nOur commitment was to get the bus to 100 different locations in 2019. We are at 80, and so we are closing in on that goal. We're very excited about that and certainly thinking about what's coming next after we get to those 100 stops.\n\nAlso, on Nov. 14, over 200 CEOs will get together for our third annual CEO Action Closed Door Session in New York City. They'll gather to share best practices, share moments of courage with one another, and gain insight from speakers. Our speakers this year include Bryan Stevenson, the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, and W. Kamau Bell, a sociopolitical comedian and host and executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning CNN docu-series \u201cUnited Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell.\u201d\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.", "description": "The executive, who also runs CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, says social responsibility needs to be a focus for top execs in order to do business well", "authors": ["Mareesa Nicosia"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-121344/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
