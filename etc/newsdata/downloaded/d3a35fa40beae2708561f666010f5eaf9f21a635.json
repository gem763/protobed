They have been the subject of vilification following the the publication of author Michael Lewis' Flash Boys. The bestselling book portrayed the industry as scalpers that used technology to game markets for their own gain.\n\nMr Cifu said the angst had died down and pointed out that high-frequency trading firms are a factor behind the zero cost trading revolution that has swept through Wall Street.\n\nThe large US stockbroking firms such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity this month announced that they will cut trading commissions on equities and exchange traded funds to zero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move was made possible, in part, by high-frequency market makers such as Virtu and Citadel that buy the order flow from the brokerage firms, providing them with the revenue that allows them to offer free trading.\n\n\"What we have done through building a scaled efficient infrastructure, and our competitors, is provide sub-penny pricing in the US at a commission rate that is effectively zero,\" Mr Cifu said.\n\nThe combination of falling brokerage costs and fees to gain access to exposure to the stock market is \"pretty powerful\", Mr Cifu said.\n\n\"If you're a retail investor in the US and you want to buy an index fund right now, you pay nothing to your ETF provider and you pay nothing in trading commissions.\"\n\nMr Cifu says Virtu has 200 retail brokers and clients such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade. The firm pays a rebate to some brokers to buy their orders, which he said provides the best price in the vast majority of instances.\n\n\"They do it because they get a better price for their end users and we do it because we think we can make money off those orders. But we are taking risk.\"\n\nIn 2018 he said Virtu was responsible for $US430 million of price improvements for retail customers based on orders directed to them by their brokers. Based on the market share of Virtu, he said market makers have delivered about $US 1.5 billion of price improvement.\n\nBut critics remain concerned about the presence of high-frequency trading and the true extent to which they provide liquidity and price improvement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Cifu maintains that these firms are simply an automated version of what has occurred in trading pits for decades.\n\n\"We're buying from sellers and selling to buyers and using technology and automation to make that process of transferring risk at low cost and as seamlessly and fully automated as possible.\"\n\nVolatility play\n\nVirtu listed on the exchange in 2015 when the \"hoopla around HFT\" was at its peak. But Mr Cifu said the decision to go public has been vindicated. That's because it provided the firm with access to capital to acquire other businesses and build scale.\n\nIn March, Virtu acquired agency brokerage firm ITG in a $US1 billion transaction as it expanded its operations from market making to brokerage.\n\nMr Cifu said the business is now 60 to 65 per cent market making and about 35 to 40 per cent client-facing broking.\n\nVirtu shares, however, are a favoured way for investors to hedge against market volatility, as bid-to-offer spreads widen during times of market turmoil.\n\nThat in turn boosts the trading profits of market makers such as Virtu.\n\n\"What people are willing to pay for is immediacy,\" Mr Cifu said.\n\n\"We're offering prices and when there's more volatility there's more customers wanting to buy your apples or oranges. So we were able to charge more for our apples and oranges.\"", "description": "Once vilified, high-frequency trader Virtu Financial said it is helping to drive down trading costs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6815%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1233%2C$y_561/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ba3d59c1c71afbe99fb7a042653b0fe207be569d", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
