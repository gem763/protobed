Has it really been just four years since you left? Feels like ages. A lot has happened since then. Britain wasn\u2019t bickering over Boris and Brexit when you arrived in 2010 (or even when you called it a day in 2015). And America was not yet locked in its forever spitball war between pro-Trump and anti-Trump forces. Maybe it was an illusion \u2014 of course it was an illusion \u2014 but the planet seemed more gentle when Downton was king.\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve become nostalgic for its nostalgia. Misty-eyed too, for a simpler time free of cold brew coffee, electric scooters and Twitter. An arms-wide-open welcome, then, for \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d the movie, which hits theaters Friday and not a moment too soon. Escapism, sweet escapism, may just be what the world needs now.\n\nHugh Bonneville, who plays the family patriarch Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham in the series and the new movie, said he experienced the healing powers of Downton when he sat down to watch the movie a few weeks ago at an early screening.\n\n\u201cAs the music started, I just could feel my shoulders relax and I thought, \u2018We\u2019re going somewhere that is a kinder place than we are in now,\u2019 \u201d Bonneville, wearing a smashing three-piece suit, said in an interview last week at the Ritz-Carlton Georgetown. (You thought an earl would stay at Red Roof Inn?) \u201cI think that was probably one of the great tones of the show throughout. There was, underneath it all, a sense of a community, a microcosm of the world, just trying to get on with each other in some way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nAwful things happened on Downton, of course. There was war and death and crime and tragedy. No social ill went unexplored. But there was also hope and laughter and light.\n\n\u201cSo many people come up and say they watched it as a family or through a period of great pain and suffering or, you know, \u2018It reminds me of my late mum or granny,\u2019 or whatever it was,\u201d Bonneville said. \u201cAnd they just want to talk about how it affected their lives in such a good way.\u201d\n\nJoining Lord Grantham in Georgetown for a day of Downton-on-the-Potomac prerelease publicity interviews were castmates Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary), Laura Carmichael (Lady Edith), Lesley Nicol (Mrs. Patmore) and executive producer and writer Julian Fellowes.\n\nCarmichael, as cheerful and friendly in person as her character Lady Edith is perpetually put upon and pouty, recalled the great feeling of unity that existed in the United Kingdom during the London Olympics in 2012. Like Bonneville, she feels the series and the movie captured a spirit of togetherness that has since become strained beyond anyone\u2019s imagination.\n\n\n\nLesley Nicol and Hugh Bonneville. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI just remember how joyful 2012 was,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cWhat a happy time. The U.K. was completely different. And I do think audiences will have that feeling again that not only is it two hours in that world, but it\u2019s very optimistic and uncynical and taking at the heart of it that people are good and trying to do right. And I think there is something that will remind you of how you felt.\u201d\n\nSet in 1927, the movie catches up with Downton\u2019s denizens two years on from when the series concluded. The movie\u2019s glorious opening sequence follows the journey of a letter sent from Buckingham Palace through verdant countryside, past quaint churchyards and up the crunchy gravel driveway to Highclere Castle, the magnificent real home that doubled as the show\u2019s fictional centerpiece.\n\n\u201cThe house, which is an extraordinary house, has never shown as well as on the big screen,\u201d Fellowes said. \u201cThat first shot swoops down and I felt that was really the house deciding to be a movie star instead of just the television star.\u201d\n\nThe letter \u2014 a message from the king! \u2014 informs the Crawleys that King George V and Queen Mary will visit Downton as part of a royal tour. From there, all subplots spin and the whirlwind launches the familiar cast of aristocrats and their essential downstairs help through two hours of mini-dramas, turbulent twists and silly asides that are all tied together in a lovely bow by movie\u2019s end.\n\nWriting for a Downton film rather than the series meant that Fellowes, who won a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award for \u201cGosford Park\u201d in 2002, had to make sure that all the plots connected and were resolved by the closing credits.\n\n\u201cYou have to alter the structure to have a narrative that has a central unity,\u201d Fellowes said. \u201cIn a series you don\u2019t. One story is Mary trying out a new boyfriend and another is Daisy going for a walk in the village and buying an apple. They don\u2019t have to have any interconnection at all. They don\u2019t have to finish in one episode, they can just dribble on through the whole season.\u201d\n\nIn the movie, there\u2019s no dribbling allowed. All plots needed to be resolved. Oh, and there had to be all the fancy stuff, too. Building the movie around the royal visit, Fellowes added, \u201cgave us the parades and balls and banquets and spectacular clothes and all that kind of movie value.\u201d\n\nFor Dockery, who played Lady Mary over six seasons as she evolved from an icy, self-involved daughter and sibling to a more generous and perspicacious young woman determined to keep Downton afloat, the return to Highclere to film the movie prompted a revelation that perhaps she had taken the success of working on the show for granted.\n\n\u201cIt took my breath away when I walked up to the castle for the first time in three years and I was like, \u2018Wow, this is where I was every day.\u2019 And then you begin to feel like you want to savor every single minute,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nDockery also appreciated playing a complex character who has long both charmed and infuriated the show\u2019s loyal viewers.\n\n\n\nJulian Fellowes. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cJulian writes such brilliant characters and real people. And I love to hear that Mary was loved and hated,\u201d Dockery said, laughing. \u201cI felt like that about characters that I\u2019ve watched. I felt that way about Tony Soprano. One minute I was in love with him, the next minute I hated him for the way he treated Carmela. And that\u2019s what makes good television, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIt is, indeed.\n\nReprising her role as Mrs. Patmore, Downton Abbey\u2019s harried cook, Nicol said she was as excited as the fans were to have a movie follow in the show\u2019s successful wake. And she admitted that she often made a suggestion to Fellowes about her character, but to no avail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been banging on about getting a boyfriend, relentlessly,\u201d Nicol said. \u201cShe had one dalliance which didn\u2019t last very long and that was a disaster.\u201d\n\nNicol also revealed that she didn\u2019t find out her character\u2019s first name \u2014 on the show, she\u2019s only ever Mrs. Patmore \u2014 until well into the series.\n\n\u201cLiterally, I was in a scene and I got a letter from my sister and it said, \u2018Dear Beryl,\u2019 and I went, \u201cWhoa, hang on, has this been decided?\u2019 \u201d Nicol recalled. \u201cAnd they went, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re called Beryl.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMaggie Smith, who plays Violet Crawley, the tart-tongued Dowager Countess of Grantham, wasn\u2019t with her castmates in Georgetown, but they all sung her praises, particularly Dockery, who has shared many Downton scenes over the years with Smith, one of England\u2019s most-beloved and accomplished actresses.\n\n\n\nJim Carter in the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d movie. (Jaap Buitendijk/Focus Features)\n\nIn one of the film\u2019s final scenes \u2014 spoiler alert here if you\u2019re still reading! \u2014 Violet shares a bit of crucial information with her granddaughter, and everything that has happened in the series and movie feels as if it has led to that moment.\n\n\u201cIt was really special. It did feel kind of frozen in time for me,\u201d Dockery said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a little bit of magic doing something with Maggie, but that scene particularly, because of the content of it.\u201d\n\nDockery said she watched the film with her family and they were all moved as the magic unfolded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt with Downton that what comes across is this great closeness that we all have. And I do think it comes across on the screen,\u201d Dockery said. \u201cI was watching it and for a second I thought I was watching me and not Mary because it felt so real.\u201d\n\nThe best escapes all feel that way.", "description": "Forget 1920s England.
