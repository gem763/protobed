Its 600km of beautifully groomed piste are home to some of the best-known resorts in the world \u2013 Courchevel, M\u00e9ribel and Val Thorens to name three \u2013 and a dream for mileage-hungry skiers and snowboarders.\n\nAcres of off-piste terrain, steep couloirs and tree runs provide for adventurers, while a variety of lesser-known resort bases provide quieter, cheaper alternatives for families and beginners.\n\nSuch an all-encompassing reputation could lead to the Three Valleys relying snootily on size and fame to attract customers, but it does not rest on its ample laurels waiting for us to come. No, it is continuously upgrading, refining and innovating, and this season is no exception.\n\nBritish favourite M\u00e9ribel is opening two new red runs in the Roc de Fer sector, for example, where previously there were mainly beginner-friendly blues. However, it\u2019s Courchevel, with six separate base villages, that is leading the charge on new lifts. The gondola from good-value Le Praz at 1,300m to famously upmarket Courchevel 1850 has been updated at a cost of \u20ac15 million, cutting journey time to under six minutes, thanks to cabins that seat 10 rather than four. What\u2019s more, it departs from a new \u20ac27m lift station built above a new underground car park with 500 spaces.\n\nFor those in search of challenge, there is now a dedicated freeride area in Courchevel\u2019s Creux Noirs sector. Courchevel Moriond will also have better links towards Courchevel 1850, thanks to a new chairlift and blue run near the Aquamotion watersports centre.\n\nThere's big changes in Courchevel Credit: DAVID ANDRE\n\nThere is a new hotel near Aquamotion too \u2013 the startlingly white four-star L\u2019Ecrin Blanc. It vies with Le Coucou in M\u00e9ribel, a ski-in/ski-out five-star from the founders of fashion brand Naf Naf, and the environmentally focused Refuge de la Traye, set in the forest near the hamlet of Les Allues, as the Three Valleys\u2019 most alluring new hotel.\n\nAt the other end of the ski area from Courchevel, Val Thorens, Europe\u2019s highest ski resort village at 2,300m, becomes the first resort in the world with a self-driving electric bus, providing free transport around the village. Family-friendly Les Menuires is getting with the electric programme too - its new experiences include electric scooter tours.\n\nThe quieter base of St Martin de Belleville \u2013 served by a gondola with 30 per cent more capacity this winter - has the new outdoor Lys Spa with hot tubs and sauna, while down in the valley, a 30-minute gondola ride from M\u00e9ribel, the town of Brides les Bains has spent \u20ac15m refurbishing its Grand Thermal Spa.\n\nEven the quiet backwater of Orelle beyond Val Thorens has news to report - the highest cross-country track in the ski area no less, a 1km tour at 2,350m.\n\nMany more reasons to head to the Trois Vall\u00e9es this winter - but perhaps the prize for novelty goes to Wild & Savage in Val Thorens, a new bar/tattoo parlour/clothing shop that also serves brunch.\n\nThe best deals to book now\n\nWith hotels, chalets, apartments and even igloos to choose from the accommodation on offer in Les Trois Vall\u00e9es is just as varied as the skiing and snowboarding on offer. Here's our pick of some of the best deals, in all corners of the giant ski area, to book this winter.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, prices are per person, based on two sharing a double or twin room, half-board for seven nights, including flights and transfers.\n\nCourchevel\n\nChalet specialist Le Ski has three new properties in Courchevel Moriond, including the contemporary Chalet Mistral.
