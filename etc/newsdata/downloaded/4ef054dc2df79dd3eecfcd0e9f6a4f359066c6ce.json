The launch would come after rivals like Amazon and Microsoft have recently debuted new wireless earbuds.\n\nThe new model would be referred to as the AirPods Pro, according to the report, to distinguish it from previous generations of Apple's truly wireless earbuds. The main new feature will be noise reduction, as previous reports have indicated, and the report suggests they may cost around $260.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the report.\n\nRead more: Apple's next iPhone could spark a new era for the company as it shifts beyond smartphones\n\nIt's not unusual for Apple to reveal new products later in the fall around October. Last year, for example, it debuted a new iPad Pro on October 30.\n\nThe report comes after a leaked image discovered in the iOS 13.2 beta showed what appeared to be a new pair of AirPods with a different design, as 9to5Mac reported. The beta also suggested that there will be a noise-cancelling listening mode.\n\nIt's yet another indication that Apple could be working on new AirPods following the launch of its second-generation AirPods this past spring \u2014 which offer hands-free Siri functionality and an optional wireless charging case. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple is planning to launch a new, more expensive pair of AirPods with noise-cancellation and water-resistance by next year. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said new AirPods could be coming in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020, according to 9to5Mac.\n\nThe addition of noise-cancellation would bring a feature to Apple's wireless earbuds that it's lacked compared to rivals. Earbuds from both Samsung and Amazon, for example, are capable of reducing background noise.\n\nThe launch would also come as the competition has become more intense than ever, with new offerings from Amazon, Microsoft, and soon Google entering the market. Google teased its new Pixel Buds at an event earlier this week, highlighting a new feature that makes it possible for the earbuds to work even when they're far away from your phone.\n\nEven without noise-cancellation, Apple's AirPods have been a major success for the company. Apple revealed in its earnings report from July that its wearables, home, and accessories division \u2014 which includes the AirPods and Apple Watch among other products \u2014 outpaced its iPad business and is gradually closing in on the Mac. Apple also claimed 60% of the global market for truly wireless earbuds in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to Counterpoint Research.", "description": "Apple could launch new third-generation AirPods by the end of the month, according to a new report, which aligns with previous rumors.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9ac49cc4a0a36520e74d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
