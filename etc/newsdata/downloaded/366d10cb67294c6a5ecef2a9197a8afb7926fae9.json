How High Will It Go?", "language": "en", "text": "Source: iStock/Jacob Wackerhausen\n\nDr. Bruce Ng is an educator in the field of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and has been a lead crypto-tech analyst for Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings since shortly after their launch.\n\n__________\n\nHow do you estimate the \u201ctrue\u201d value of Bitcoin? Or better yet, how do you predict what it will be worth at its next major peak?\n\nUnlike stock valuation models, there\u2019s no company, no profit-and-loss statement and no price-to-earnings ratio. There\u2019s also no balance sheet. Ergo, no asset-valuation model.\n\nStill, some folks have come up with valuation formulas. All are hotly debated.\n\nChris Burniske, for example, bases his evaluation on an \u201cequation-of-exchange\u201d model.\n\nKyle Samani seeks to do it based on a \u201cmarket-share-capture\u201d model.\n\nValiant attempts! Trouble is, both rely on some slippery assumptions, like the velocity of money.\n\nIn the midst of this controversy-laden polemic, I\u2019m particularly intrigued by the \u201cStock-to-Flow (S2F)\u201d valuation model proposed by \u201cPlanB,\u201d a quant crypto analyst.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most specific \u2014 and accurate \u2014 crypto valuation models I\u2019ve seen so far. All based on actual measurable factors that reflect scarcity.\n\nWhat exactly is Stock-to-Flow?\n\nVery simply, it\u2019s the current circulating supply divided by the annual amount produced. And it can work for virtually any commodity.\n\nTake gold, for instance. In the chart above, gold has a Stock-to-Flow (S2F) value of 62.\n\nMeaning at today\u2019s rate of production, it would take 62 years to reproduce the current supply of mined gold in the world.\n\nThat\u2019s relatively scarce. In fact, based on this metric, gold is nearly three times scarcer than silver, which has a current S2F of just 22.\n\nNow, care to guess what Bitcoin\u2019s Stock-to-Flow ratio is right now?\n\nAnswer: Nearly 27.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Based strictly on this measure and holding constant all other factors, it would take 27 years to reproduce the current Bitcoin supply.\n\nIs that scarcity metric similar to silver\u2019s? Yes \u2026 for now. But \u2026\n\nApproximately every four years, the Bitcoin protocol mandates a major change called \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a 50% reduction in the block reward that miners receive for creating new Bitcoin. And the next halving event is expected in or around May 2020.\n\nAt present, BTC is produced at a rate of 12.5 BTC (i.e., the block reward) every 10 minutes. Come May 2020, this block reward will be halved to 6.25 BTC.\n\nAnd I repeat: That halving is mandated by the Bitcoin protocol. It must happen approximately every four years.\n\nHow does the Bitcoin halving fit into the Stock-to-Flow model?\n\nThe chart above provides some answers. It tracks and predicts the price of Bitcoin based on the Stock-to-Flow model and the periodic halving of Bitcoin.\n\nIn essence, here\u2019s how it works \u2026\n\nFirst, the blue line shows the price of Bitcoin as predicted by the Stock-to-Flow model.\n\nSecond, the red dotted line shows the actual Bitcoin prices to date.\n\nThird, we ask the critical question: How well does it work? The answer \u2026\n\nModel Matches Real-World Prices to the Tune of 95%\n\nNaturally, in the real world, there are periodic spikes followed by sharp pullbacks. But overall, Bitcoin prices follow the staircase-shaped Stock-to-Flow prediction remarkably well.\n\nOne way of evaluating its accuracy is with a statistical metric called R2, which measures how closely the data fits the model. And in this case, the R2 stat is at 95%. A very good fit.\n\nAnother clue to the model\u2019s accuracy: The staircase forecast of the model (blue line) can be converted into a smooth curve (the gray line). Over time, that curve has proven to be a support line for the price of Bitcoin.\n\nIn other words, when the Bitcoin market falls, it tends to bottom near or at that line!\n\nA third argument for the validity of the model is the actual impact of past halvings on the price of Bitcoin, as shown in the table below \u2026\n\nWhen will bitcoin reach its next high? And how much will it be worth?\n\nUnfortunately, Bitcoin is too young to answer either question with certainty. We barely have a decade of trading history. And data from the early part of that decade, when Bitcoin trading was illiquid, is not very reliable.\n\nWith that caveat, however, it\u2019s not unreasonable to set some expectations, as follows:\n\nFirst, we know that the next halving will occur around May of next year. So, based on the 2012 and 2016 halvings, the timing of next Bitcoin high should be about one to two years later \u2014 as early as May 2021 or as late as May 2022.\n\nThen, we\u2019ll come to the most important number of all: Bitcoin\u2019s most likely price at that next high.\n\nNo one can foretell what surprises the future may deliver. But after the 2020 halving, the model predicts a Bitcoin value between USD 50,000 to USD 100,000.\n\nMoreover, we know that in all past all-time highs, the actual peak has surpassed the model\u2019s predicted high for a brief time.\n\nWhat happens if Bitcoin hits those predicted prices? The corresponding market capitalizations for Bitcoin at USD 50,000 and USD 100,000 would be approximately USD 920 billion and USD 1.8 trillion, respectively.\n\nSound like a pipe dream? Well, then consider that USD 1.8 trillion is actually small compared to the total market capitalization of gold at USD 7 trillion.\n\nJust bear one thing in mind: The next halving won\u2019t happen until May 2020. So, there is still some time to accumulate Bitcoin and other high-rated cryptos before the powerful forces behind this model begin kick in.", "description": "How do you estimate the \u201ctrue\u201d value of Bitcoin?
