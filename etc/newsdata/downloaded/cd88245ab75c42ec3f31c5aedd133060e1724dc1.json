And there's an element of personal development about it, too.\n\n\"I captained the England Lions last winter and my county for the last two years. Eoin gave me a call a couple of weeks ago and said he'd love me to do it. I suppose he must see something in me. I'm looking forward to learning form him and implanting what I've done at Kent.\n\n\"But I'm in the side as a batsman first and foremost and then as a keeper. You have to be able to perform at that top level consistently in those roles firstly. The captaincy is an added bonus and one I really enjoy. It makes you take responsibility for yourself and other guys.\"\n\nBillings and Morgan will both play in England's first warm-up game against a strong New Zealand XI on Sunday.\n\nThe team named also includes new faces in the form of flamboyant opening batsman Tom Banton and fast-bowling duo Saqib Mahmood and Pat Brown.", "description": "New Zealand\u00a0captain Kane Williamson has been ruled out of the five-match T20\u00a0International series against England.
