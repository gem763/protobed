The gun battle broke out after security forces located one of Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons, who is wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges.\n\nMexican security secretary Alfonso Durazo said 30 members of the National Guard and army were patrolling in Culiacan when they were fired on from a house. They repelled the attack and inside the house found Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez.\n\nThe house was then surrounded by heavily armed gunmen who had \"a greater force\" and authorities decided to suspend the operation, Durazo said. He did not say if Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was arrested or went free.\n\n\"With the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquility of Culiacan society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,\" said Durazo.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, a lawyer for \"El Chapo's\" family, told The Associated Press that Guzm\u00e1n's family had told him \"Ovidio is alive and free\" but that he had no more details about what had happened.\n\nA look at law enforcement carrying out an operation in the streets of the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state on Thursday, October 17, 2019. TV Azteca\n\nOvidio was not one of the jailed Mexican drug lord's best-known sons - Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n are known as \"los Chapitos,\" or \"the little Chapos,\" and are believed to currently run their father's Sinaloa Cartel together with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada.\n\nBut Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was indicted in 2018 by a grand jury in Washington, along with a fourth brother, for the alleged trafficking of cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\n\nFollowing Thursday's localization of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, Culiacan exploded in violence with armed civilians in trucks roaring through the city's center shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns.\n\nVideos published on social media showed a scene resembling a war zone, with gunmen, some wearing black ski masks over their faces, riding in the back of trucks firing mounted machine guns as vehicles burned. People could be seen running for cover as machinegun fire rattled around them. Drivers drove in reverse frantically to get away from the clashes.\n\n\"Nothing is working,\" said Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez, a worker in the state's congress who shut himself up in his house after picking up his 15-year-old son from school. \"There is a psychosis. No one knows what is going on but everyone is afraid and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow.\"\n\nSinaloa public safety director Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda told Milenio television that there were people wounded but did not provide a casualty figure. He did not rule out that there were deaths.\n\nCasta\u00f1eda said gunmen blocked streets with burning vehicles, a common tactic to make it difficult for security forces to maneuver. Simultaneously, some 20 to 30 prisoners escaped though some were quickly recaptured, he said.\n\nState officials asked residents to avoid going out in parts of city.\n\nSinaloa's soccer club Dorados announced that it had cancelled its game Thursday due to security concerns.\n\nGov. Quirino Ordaz confirmed that school classes had been suspended but that businesses would open on Friday.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez, however, doubted this.\n\n\"There is no public transportation, no taxis, people outside the city remain blocked outside and tomorrow will be the same,\" he said, adding that Culiacan had not seen such a scene for almost a decade, when the Sinaloa Cartel was experiencing an internal war.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n's lawyers motion for a retrial\n\nBattle for succession\n\nAfter Guzm\u00e1n's third arrest in 2016, an internal battle for succession began playing out. The battle was resolved with the arrest of Damaso L\u00f3pez Nunez and his son D\u00e1maso L\u00f3pez Serrano, who led a rival faction.\n\nThe cartel is currently led by Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada and Guzman's sons, Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo and Jes\u00fas Alfredo, known \"los Chapitos,\" or \"the little Chapos.\"\n\nTwo other sons of \"El Chapo\" have also on the radar of U.S. authorities, including Ovidio and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, who are accused of distributing cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.", "description": "It wasn't immediately clear if Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was taken into custody", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/d2be4d2a-2ce6-42bd-8281-260ea3e2621d/thumbnail/1200x630/9411f6c88f74cf2fcc37e2d08cfe364c/mexico-sinaloa-state-violence-01.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
