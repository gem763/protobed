Swanson (25-11 MMA, 10-7 UFC), on the other hand will be entering his 18th UFC fight, and understands the position he\u2019s being set up in.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s how the game works,\u201d Swanson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at Wednesday\u2019s UFC on ESPN+ 19 open workouts. \u201cI\u2019m the veteran, I\u2019m the older fighter. If I\u2019m not in title contention then I\u2019m possibly someone\u2019s stepping stone, that\u2019s how the game works, and I have to go in there and show them otherwise. I understand that and that\u2019s all good because at the end of the day, if I want to keep my job, I got to earn it so bring them on and the fact that it\u2019s a Gracie, it\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nAnd Swanson has never had an issue with fighting young up and comers. He\u2019s fought the likes of Doo Ho Choi in 2016, which ended up being the \u201cFight of the Year\u201d at UFC 206, as well as the likes of Artem Lobov, and Shane Burgos in his most recent contest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind it at all,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cI constantly keep young fighters around me. I used to let them stay at my house, I do sometimes but now I got a family, so it\u2019s not quite the same.\n\n\u201cIt keeps me hungry, it keeps me sharp, it keeps me in the loop of what\u2019s new and it lets me know if I\u2019m slacking it or slipping.\u201d\n\nSwanson is currently facing the worst skid of his career, dropping his past four in a row. But he has alleviated the pressure on himself, and will just relish the moment of competing against a Gracie, looking to put on a show.\n\n\u201cI think the last two fights had more pressure as far as winning and losing,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThis one I just want to go out there and perform. I know I\u2019m capable of beating the crap out of him. I know he\u2019s dangerous but I\u2019m just excited for the opportunity and I am an older fighter, I never know when my last fight is going to be, so I\u2019m just trying to enjoy it and put on the best performances I can.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena.
