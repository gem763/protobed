Drone fighter jets, hypersonic attack planes, artificial intelligence, lasers, electronic warfare and sensors woven into the fuselage of an aircraft - are all areas of current technological exploration for the Air Force as it begins early prototyping for a new, 6th-Generation fighter jet to emerge in the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nWhile the initiative, called Next Generation Air Dominance(NGAD), has been largely conceptual for years, Air Force officials say current \u201cprototyping\u201d and \u201cdemonstrations\u201d are informing which technologies the service will invest in for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have completed an analysis of alternatives and our acquisition team is working on the requirements. We are pretty deep into experimenting with hardware and software technologies that will help us control and exploit air power into the future,\u201d Gen. James Holmes, Commander, Air Combat Command, told reporters at the Association of the Air Force Air, Space and Cyber Conference.\n\nPart of the progress with the program, according to Air Force Acquisition Executive William Roper, is due to new methods of digital engineering.\n\n\u201cI have spent six months with our industry leaders and NGAD team looking at examples of applied digital engineering. I\u2019m impressed with what they have done,\u201d Roper.\n\nDigital engineering, as Roper explains it, brings what could be called a two-fold advantage. It enables weapons developers to assess technologies, material configurations and aircraft models without needing to build all of them -- all while paradoxically enabling builders to \u201cbend metal\u201d and start building prototypes earlier than would otherwise be possible.\n\n\u201cThe reward is more than the risk,\u201d Roper said, speaking of the need to \u201ctry something different\u201d and pursue newer acquisition methods which at times results in prototyping earlier in the process than the traditional process typically involves.\n\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory has been working with the acquisition community on digital engineering techniques, often explored through modeling and simulation, for many years.\n\n\u201cDigital engineering is another exciting area and we see the opportunity to accelerate the pace of moving things from the bench level of science and technology into a system, integrating concepts into an operational campaign model,\u201d Tim Sakulich, Executive Lead for Implementing the Air Force S&T Strategy and Air Force Research Laboratory Lead for Materials and Manufacturing, told Warrior in an interview.\n\nCurrent work on a futuristic 6th-gen fighter - to come after and fly alongside upgraded F-35s -- includes development of stealthy drone fighters, hypersonic flight, lasers, new precision weaponry and advanced AI able organize targeting data in milliseconds.\n\nWhile all of these things are of course key parts of the equation, the Air Force Penetrating Counter Air/NGAD program is equally focused on information exchange itself as a defining element of future war. Such an approach, looking beyond isolated systems and weapons themselves, envisions expansive \u201cnetworked\u201d combat with war platforms operating as \u201cnodes\u201d in a larger warfare system of weapons and sensors working together in real time.\n\n\u201cThis approach is one that views military operations in terms of wholistic elements of an information-shooter-effector complex. That will require a lot more going into the design of the next generation of combat aircraft than how fast and far it can fly - or what the numbers of weapons it can carry,\u201d Ret. Lt. Gen. David Deptula, former planner of the US air attacks in Operation Desert Storm and current Dean of the The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies , told Warrior Maven in an interview.\n\nThe NGAD program, which traces its history to the Air Force\u2019s \u201cAir Superiority 2030 Flight Plan,\u201d envisions the possibility of a \u201cfamily of capabilities.\u201d\n\nHolmes explained that this study began by examining more than 650 different ideas for 6th-Gen combat, which were then narrowed down to merely a few.\n\nDirected by the Air Force Chief of Staff, service weapons developers who worked on the study have been working in Enterprise Capability Collaboration (ECCT) teams designed to pursue next-generation air superiority.", "description": "And it could be revolutionary.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K5zDLJub8AKT2mMZY3PW2Q--~B/aD04MTA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/33d07e80762b4e40592189a4c708b759", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
