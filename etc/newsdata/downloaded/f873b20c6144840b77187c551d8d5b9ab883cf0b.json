With an unprecedented amount of holdings, the Fed was able to push down long-interest interest rates.\n\nThe central bank generally maintains the size of its portfolio by reinvesting the proceeds from its assets; in order to shrink it, they began to gradually taper that process. They believed it could shrink the portfolio to anywhere between $1.5 trillion and $3 trillion and indicated the process could take several years.\n\nBut in January, policymakers decided to end the runoff, though it was a decision more driven by a technical debate about reserve in the banking system, not about whether officials wanted to provide more or less stimulus to the economy.\n\nPowell stressed again on Tuesday the decision to increase the balance sheet was not quantitative easing, which previously took the balance sheet to $4.5 trillion.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered rates and not through frequent market interventions,\" he said.\n\nThe decision is likely to placate President Trump, who frequently urges the Fed to stop what he refers to as \"quantitative tightening.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Powell made the comments during a speech in Denver on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/jerome-powell-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
