But with Kim Tate (Claire King) back where she belongs at Home Farm, the producer has revealed that it would be remiss of the show not to have her in the midst of the drama.\n\nThis autumn will see a new storyline unfold for Kim as she finds herself massively betrayed \u2013 but will the Tate family be ripped apart by revelations? It certainly seems like there are ructions ahead!\n\nKate told Inside Soap: \u2018We have a few tricks up our sleeves with some twists and turns. On Christmas Day, a lot of secrets will be unpacked and families thrown into disarray. People think they get the Christmas they wanted \u2013 but it might not turn out that way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very family-centric, big on drama with explosive revelations, relationships unraveling, and people getting together. There is a lot going on!\u2019\n\nDropping further hints on the characters involved, she teased: \u2018We have a lot going on with the Dingles \u2013 and Home Farm is one that you should keep your eye on. You can\u2019t have Kim Tate as the mother of that big house without drama!\u2019\n\nTo be honest, we are living for the prospect of some festive Tate drama. Kate also recently revealed that there would be some special episodes to kick off the New Year so with an autumn spectacular and now all of this to look forward to, it\u2019s going to be a busy time in the Dales.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "It's going to be a dramatic Christmas down Emmerdale way.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/emmerdale-christmas-snow-2f7e_1571148219.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
