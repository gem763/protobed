Ask literally any fat person, we are reminded of it all the time,\u201d Corden said in his eight-minute monologue. \u201cThere\u2019s a common and insulting misconception that fat people are stupid and lazy and we\u2019re not. We get it, we know. We know that being overweight isn\u2019t good for us and I\u2019ve struggled my entire life trying to manage my weight and I suck at it. Let\u2019s be honest, fat-shaming is just bullying. And bullying just makes the problem worse.\u201d\n\nCorden added that while he\u2019s been on diets for as long as he \u201ccan remember,\u201d he\u2019s never been ashamed of his overweight body, and never will be. \u201cWe\u2019re not all as lucky as Bill Maher. We don\u2019t all have a sense of superiority that burns 35,000 calories a day,\u201d Corden concluded. \u201cWhile you\u2019re encouraging people to think about what goes into their mouths, just think a little harder about what comes out of yours.\u201d Maher, for what it\u2019s worth, didn\u2019t address Corden\u2019s comments on Friday evening\u2019s Real Time.", "description": "James Corden took time out of his late-night show to push back against Bill Maher\u2019s fat-shaming comments.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/24/14-james.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
