Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\nBut that was a different New Zealand. More pertinently, this was a different England.\n\nThis was a move went against everything you typically associate with the All Blacks \u2013 the greatest rugby team in the world were worrying about the opposition. In knockout rugby, the adage goes that you control the controlables, focus on executing your gameplan rather than look to combat your opponents\u2019. New Zealand had focused on exactly the opposite.\n\nAnd it cost them. England were utterly dominant in the first half, jumping into a ten-point first half lead as New Zealand struggled to adjust. By the time the selection error was rectified, with Sam Cane introduced at half-time, it was too late.\n\nBarrett\u2019s introduction in the back-row was a move to give New Zealand ascendancy at the set-piece, but the change actually proved detrimental, particularly at the lineout.\n\nAdding a third specialist lock to your pack can complicate your lineout processes. Defensively, where you would typically be definite in who you are lifting with two second rows, you can sometimes obsess with mixing it up, and thus you lose your timing an accuracy. Similarly, on your throw, having too many options can be a curse. Your structures and lifting combinations change.\n\nIt is not as if Barrett was replacing someone without lineout skills, either. Sam Cane is a more than capable jumper. Indeed, in Kieran Read New Zealand possess a fine back-row lineout operator, and Ardie Savea can be hoisted, too. Sometimes having two genuine first options and three alternatives is better than three and two.\n\nEngland showed this. Some had suggested shifting one of Itoje and Lawes to the flank and introduce George Kruis to combat New Zealand\u2019s aerial threat, but this would have been unwise. England had great clarity over their lineout calls and competing jumpers, and in Itoje and Lawes two long-levered athletes to steal the All Blacks ball.\n\nNew Zealand hooker began to panic, forcing throws, one low, one thrown too early. Lawes and Itoje repeatedly got their paws to the ball in defence, denying the All Blacks stable set-piece ball. Jamie George hit his jumpers, and England were able to build from settled structure.\n\nThey also struggled desperately to slow England\u2019s ball down at the breakdown. Savea is one of the finer pilferers in world rugby, but he was fighting a lone hand without running mate Cane. While there are other players in the New Zealand side capable of muddying the ruck waters, England were able to focus on Savea\u2019s threat.\n\nThe openside got through a mountain of first half work, seemingly attacking almost every ruck as either tackler or jackaler, but there is little you can do when the opposition are so focused on you. England resourced and over-resourced to deny Savea clear chances at stealing, and with referee Nigel Owens typically unwilling to go to his whistle, they were allowed to pile bodies in and shift Savea from the ball on the rare occasions he did manage to get his hands to it.\n\nThat meant England were able to generate quick ball throughout the first half. That is when England are at their most devastating. Eddie Jones and attack coach Scott Wisemantel have worked incredibly hard to increase the speed of England\u2019s phase play since Wisemantel was hired in 2018, to their great benefit. The return of Manu Tuilagi allows them to have guaranteed front foot ball from first phase if they desire, and the outside centre is so effective as a decoy, too.\n\nEngland should have scored more than ten points in the first half. New Zealand were incapable of slowing ball, allowing England to go through their attacking movements at pace and open gaps. They worked the ball to width, attacked Richie Mo\u2019unga wherever the fly-half stood (he was often shifted away from the threat of Manu Tuilagi) and win the collisions. Tuilagi scored inside two minutes; the excellent Sam Underhill had one chalked off.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s change also allowed England\u2019s new dynamic duo, Tom Curry and Underhill, free rein. The pair were utterly magnificent. If this game was to be decided by match-ups, Curry/Underhill vs Savea/Cane looked to be a key one \u2013 New Zealand had conceded defeat before the game had even begun.\n\nNew Zealand were forced to change things at half-time. It is relatively rare that they are forced to adjust in terms of personnel \u2013 they are usually a side that looks to solve things with the existing players on the field before going to the bench. But the Scott Barrett gamble had completely failed. England were so far in the ascendancy that Steve Hansen had to alter things.\n\nOn came Cane. He helped stabilise things for New Zealand, adding an extra forager and helping slow things down in defence. England remained the better side, but New Zealand were now able to stall their attack somewhat.\n\nThe lineout functioned better, too. The combinations that had worked so well throughout the tournament were back together, and they allowed Savea to score.\n\nWith Brodie Retallick putting pressure on Maro Itoje at the front of the lineout, George hurried his throw, trying to get it over Retalick\u2019s leap and force it into his jumper\u2019s hands. Itoje was not at the apex of his jump when George\u2019s throw hit the top of its arc \u2013 into the hands of Savea at the back it sailed, and New Zealand had the try.\n\nBut by then the damage had been done. England\u2019s first half had won them the game. New Zealand had been beaten at a World Cup for the first time in 12 years.", "description": "It always looked a gamble.
