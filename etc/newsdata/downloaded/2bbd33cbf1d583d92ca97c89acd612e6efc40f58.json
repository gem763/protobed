Does he travel the world looking for corrupt prosecutors to fire? Why didnt he look in his own country first, plenty in the USA. Did he withhold aid from any OTHER country for having corrupt prosecutors? Or just the one where conveniently his son works?\n\nlolololol For the millionth time, why does DONALD TRUMP care about a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine? This all happened 5 years ago. Trump's been in office 2.5/3 years ago. I'm sure its just a coincide this all happened the day after the Mueller report was released? I'm sure its just a coincidence that he asked Ukraine to investigate the Democrat front runner. Totally a coincidence. ;)\n\nTo answer your question: Because we're talking about our tax dollars.
