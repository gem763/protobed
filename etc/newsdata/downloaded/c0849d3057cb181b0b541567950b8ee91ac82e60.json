He has been a member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela since its inception in 2007. The party was founded by Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, a self-described Marxist who aligned Venezuela with Castro\u2019s Cuba, in addition to the socialist regimes in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua under Evo Morales, Rafael Correa and Daniel Ortega, respectively.\n\nThe party Mr. Maduro would soon lead clearly spelled out its principles in an extensive document published at the \u201cExtraordinary Congress\u201d in April 2010. The document described the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (USPV) as the \u201cpolitical vanguard of the revolutionary process\u201d to achieve its \u201cgeneral principles,\u201d which, it said, included socialism, Marxism, and Bolivarianism.\n\nThe fact that Venezuela and its leaders were socialist was not even a point of contention until recently. After all, the USPV, when it was formed in 2007, had dispensed with the \u201cdemocratic\u201d part of \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d Chavez had used in his previous political party, the Fifth Republic Movement. Indeed, as recently as 2013, many were still gushing about the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d Chavez\u2019s brand of socialism had produced.\n\n\u201cChavez became the bugaboo of American politics because his full-throated advocacy of socialism and redistributionism,\u201d the writer David Sirota explained in Salon, but Venezuela\u2019s economic success showed it was clearly \u201ca threat to the corporate capitalism.\u201d (Mr. Sirota today is a senior adviser and speechwriter to presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders.)\n\nIn 2013, following Chavez\u2019s death, British Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn explained that Chavez had \u201cshowed us that there is a different, and a better way of doing things. It\u2019s called socialism \u2026 In his death, we will march on, to that better, just, peaceful and hopeful world.\u201d\n\nAlas, the story did not end in 2013. As one writer has noted, in his lust for power, Chavez, the godfather of \u201c21st-century socialism,\u201d forgot that the resources he promised to shower on the masses after nationalizing the nation\u2019s oil production actually had to be produced.\n\nThe tragic results of Venezuela\u2019s redistributive policies and central planning are well chronicled.\n\nRoughly 90 percent of Venezuelans today live below the poverty line and more than 4 million have fled the country. Inflation in 2019 is expected to hit 200,000 percent, and the median monthly income is about $8. Women who once held professional jobs are selling their bodies to feed their families. This in a nation with the highest oil reserves in the world, which as recently as 1959 had a per capita GDP 10 percent higher than the United States.\n\nTo declare that \u201cMaduro is not a socialist\u201d takes an extraordinary cognitive dissonance or a blatant disregard for truth. Yet such claims fit a familiar pattern.\n\nIn his compelling 2019 book \u201cSocialism: The Failed Idea That Never Dies,\u201d Kristian Niemietz, the Head of Political Economy at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London, explains the cycle of socialism.\n\nPhase 1: It begins with \u201cthe honeymoon period\u201d and initial success. During this time period, few dispute the socialist character of the experiment.\n\nPhase 2: Honeymoons, by definition, never last. This second phase is defined by hardship. The initial success peters out or the economic pains are simply revealed to the larger world. The experiment is no longer an example to demonstrate the socialist idea to political opponents.\n\nPhase 3: The final phase is the \u201cnot-real-socialism stage.\u201d The economic experiment, now recognized as a failure by the general public, is shunned and derided by the intellectuals who had supported it. Now a liability and embarrassment, its supporters contend it was not truly socialism.\n\nThis, Mr. Niemietz explains, is how socialism persists despite 100 years of chronicled failures in more than two dozen nations, including the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Albania, Algeria, Poland, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Hungary, East Germany, Cuba, Tanzania, Romania, Benin, Laos, Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, the Congo, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, Nicaragua, China and, now, Venezuela.\n\nPerhaps Ms. Navarro was unaware that Nicolas Maduro was literally elected under the banner of socialism when she angrily claimed that \u201cMaduro is not a socialist.\u201d\n\nMore likely, she simply doesn\u2019t care. After all, that\u2019s not real socialism.\n\n\u2022 Jon Miltimore is the managing editor of FEE.org.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
