Picture taken September 27, 2019. REUTERS/David Mercado\n\nMorales has been reluctant to make the designation as he campaigns for a fourth presidential term ahead of Oct. 20 elections, despite growing calls that he acknowledge the fires - which have already burned an area bigger than Costa Rica - were beyond his government\u2019s control.\n\nSome 200 protesters - most indigenous Chiquitano people from Bolivia\u2019s east - have joined the caravan since it departed earlier this month from San Ignacio de Velasco, a ranching hub where fires have forced villagers from their homes and threatened pastures that sustain half a million head of cattle.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t declared a national disaster despite all this misfortune we\u2019ve suffered,\u201d Joaquin Orellana, the organizer of the march, said of Morales as he walked along an unpaved road alongside protesters playing flutes and drums.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s burned where I\u2019m from. We don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Orellana said of his village of San Miguel.\n\nProtesters, including women with young children and elders, have camped out in empty lots and relied on donations of food, water and clothes from villages along the march\u2019s 500-kilometer (311-mile) route.\n\nThey aim to reach regional capital Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where Orellana expects the demonstration to expand into a show of force of indigenous people from the lowlands whom he says feel abandoned by Morales\u2019 government.\n\nMorales, South America\u2019s longest-serving leftist leader, is Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, hailing from Bolivia\u2019s largest indigenous group, the Aymara. His government has said declaring a national disaster would turn a sovereign issue over to foreigners, echoing concerns voiced by neighboring Brazil\u2019s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has sparked a global outcry over his handling of fires in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nMorales is also fighting for his political survival in an increasingly tight presidential race. Recent polls show he might be forced to go to a run-off race with his chief rival, Carlos Mesa, a business-friendly former president.\n\nThe wildfires - the biggest in at least two decades - have thrown Morales\u2019 re-election campaign into disarray, drawing waves of criticism of his push to ramp up soy and beef production to tap demand from China.\n\nFIGHTING FOR THE PLANET\n\nProtesters want Morales to repeal a law his government passed this year expanding slash-and-burn farming in drought-stricken regions now alight with blazes. Some blame Aymara and other highland settlers, soy farmers and cattle ranchers.\n\nThey say the government\u2019s response has fallen short as fires have swept over some 15,000 square miles in the region of Santa Cruz alone, according to recent figures from Bolivian environmental group Friends of Nature Foundation (FAN).\n\nSanta Cruz is home to large swaths of Bolivia\u2019s biodiverse Chiquitano dry forests, named for the indigenous people who have lived in them for hundreds of years. Protesters say a declaration of national disaster would remove bureaucratic barriers to help from abroad to contain fires.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing all we have,\u201d protester Tomas Candia told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for the planet, against global warming. ..We can\u2019t permit this.\u201d\n\nThe fires are part of a double whammy to hit the lowlands this year, coming on the back of a severe droughts that have forced towns like San Ignacio to impose water rationing.\n\nEnvironmentalists say increasingly severe droughts are driven by a surge in forest clearings that limit the climate\u2019s ability to recycle precipitation, increasing the risk of wildfires.\n\nAt the United Nations in the last week, Morales tried to steer the narrative back to his government\u2019s efforts to put out the fires, which he says has cost Bolivia $15 million so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re winning the battle against the fire,\u201d Morales told a panel on the Amazon. \u201cOur response has been rapid and effective.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nBut in the Chiquitano dry forests, in the heart of South America, villagers disagree. Poorly equipped firefighters with Bolivia\u2019s volunteer-based units have given up on controlling some infernos, with an early start to the rainy season the best hope for overwhelmed local governments.\n\nIn Santa Elena, a Chiquitano village of three dozen families, fires have destroyed crops of papaya, manioc and rice, and charred forests where they hunted game. Only small groups of men remain.\n\n\u201cThis is our life,\u201d said Eduardo Roca, one of the men who have stayed behind. \u201cHow can we abandon our homes?\u201d", "description": "In Bolivia's fire-ravaged lowlands, a caravan of indigenous protesters is marching hundreds of miles to demand President Evo Morales declare a surge in wildfires a national disaster, a move they hope will unleash international aid.", "authors": ["Santiago Limachi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435210951&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0J9", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
