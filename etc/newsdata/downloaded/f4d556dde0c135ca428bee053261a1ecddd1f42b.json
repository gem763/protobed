The e-commerce giant held their annual hardware event on Wednesday in Seattle a day after they announced they would be taking their biggest step yet into healthcare by launching its Amazon Care service for its Seattle employees. Amazon has given prior hints into its interest into diving into the $3.7 trillion market. It is using its Seattle employees as a trial run for their latest healthcare initiative. The firm unveiled new products and features to eager consumers at their annual event.\n\n\n\nAmazon Care\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, Amazon\u2019s latest move into healthcare comes as no surprise, as the firm has been making strategic moves over the past few years. Amazon acquired the online pharmacy company Pillpack last June for $1 billion and formed a joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) called Haven, which aims to shake up the healthcare industry. The company has given its AI product, Alexa, some healthcare skills like notifying users when subscriptions need to be filled and provides information on users\u2019 blood sugar levels.\n\n\n\nAmazon Care attempts to give consumers the best of both worlds by combining traditional in-person and virtual healthcare. The firm\u2019s new healthcare service provides urgent care for things like colds and infections. They also offer preventative wellness consultations and lab tests, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and answers to general health questions.\n\n\n\nThe company then gives these traditional healthcare services a modern twist. Amazon Care offers an in-app chatroom that would connect users seeking medical advice to certified nurses within minutes. The service would also provide clients with video-based appointments with doctors who can provide a diagnosis and recommended treatments for patients. In addition, in-home or in-office visits with medical professionals would also be offered and prescription drug orders would be delivered in as little as two hours.\n\n\n\nAlexa Ecosystem Grows\n\n\n\nShortly after announcing its healthcare debut, Amazon unveiled more than a dozen new Alexa-enabled products at its annual hardware event in Seattle. Amazon revealed its new competitor to Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ: ) Air Pods, called Echo Buds. The headphones are expected to be retailed at $129, have built in Alexa capabilities, five-hour battery life, and have noise reducing technology engineered by Bose. It also introduced the $199 Echo Studio, which is larger than previous models and sports high-quality speakers that enable 3D sound.\n\n\n\nA new Echo device that Amazon showcased was the Echo Glow. The new Echo product is marketed towards young kids, changing colors when kids tap the top of the device. The product is also Alexa-enabled, allowing consumers to set timers, play music, and turn on \u201ccampfire\u201d mode, which sets a warm soothing vibe.\n\n\n\nSimilar to last year\u2019s event, Amazon revealed a new Alexa-enabled smart kitchen item. The tech giant is launching a $249 smart oven that\u2019s equipped with convention cooking and an air fryer. Users can also scan an item from the Alexa app to get the oven to start cooking. Amazon stated that users who purchase the new smart oven will receive a complimentary Echo Dot. The e-commerce company also revealed new Alexa features like \u201cdoor concierge\u201d that adds a voice assistant to the Ring smart doorbell system. Another Alexa feature that was introduced was the ability to mimic celebrity voices. Right now, users can pay $0.99 to have Samuel. L Jackson speak and perform all of the Alexa capabilities.\n\n\n\nTakeaway\n\n\n\nWith its own online pharmacy, unmatched delivery speed, and solid reputation for customer satisfaction, Amazon has a chance to shake up the healthcare industry that Americans have been diligently trying to reform.\n\n\n\nThe products the company unveiled expands its tech presence and its Alexa-enabled features entices consumers to buy more Amazon products so that they may expand their Alexa ecosystem within their homes. The new products should help Amazon keep its 70% market share in the speaker space while the new Alexa features keep users entertained.\n\n\n\nWe are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.
