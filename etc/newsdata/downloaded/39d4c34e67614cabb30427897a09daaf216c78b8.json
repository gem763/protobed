Organizers have told of alleged foreign spies posing as documentary crews and trying to blend in with the DEF CON crowd.\n\nBut this year\u2019s event saw an increased presence of DC lawmakers, most of whom were extending obvious olive branches, if not pleading for hackers' help. And they seemed to be mostly well-received.\n\n\"White-hat hackers are absolutely irreplaceable in the technological age,\" Senator Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, told an audience of hundreds, which erupted into thunderous applause at that and many other moments during his remarks.\n\nUS EYES RANSOMWARE THREAT TO VOTER DATABASES PRIOR TO 2020 ELECTION\n\nnext Image 1 of 20\n\nprev next Image 2 of 20\n\nprev next Image 3 of 20\n\nprev next Image 4 of 20\n\nprev next Image 5 of 20\n\nprev next Image 6 of 20\n\nprev next Image 7 of 20\n\nprev next Image 8 of 20\n\nprev next Image 9 of 20\n\nprev next Image 10 of 20\n\nprev next Image 11 of 20\n\nprev next Image 12 of 20\n\nprev next Image 13 of 20\n\nprev next Image 14 of 20\n\nprev next Image 15 of 20\n\nprev next Image 16 of 20\n\nprev next Image 17 of 20\n\nprev next Image 18 of 20\n\nprev next Image 19 of 20\n\nprev Image 20 of 20\n\n\"If we don't work now to translate between the traditional silos of our two communities, then we will miss opportunities,\" declared former Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif. Harman advertised herself in the DEF CON schedule with an apparent internet alias, \"Surfer Jane.\" Her panel discussion included two current members of Congress, one of them a \u201cDEF CON repeater\u201d (Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I.) and the other a computer science degree holder (Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif.).\n\nNext to the current and former lawmakers were two hackers-turned-security experts, one of whom testified before Congress in the late \u201890s using his alias, \u201cSpace Rogue.\u201d\n\nWyden conceded that hackers \"don't hear people with election certificates say 'thank you' often, if at all.\" But the growth of DEF CON, now in its 27th year, and the collaborations it has inspired are readily apparent outside the convention halls.\n\nELECTION MACHINE KEYS ARE ON THE INTERNET, HACKERS SAY\n\nI previously reported that DEF CON\u2019s \u201cVoting Village,\u201d a corner of the conference where election hacking is the name of the game, was attended this year by U.S. lawmakers, more than a dozen Congressional aides from both sides of the aisle, state and local election officials, and some companies that are already working on technology for DARPA, the DoD\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency. The relationship between Washington and so-called \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers has addressed concerns that go well beyond more than just election security, though.\n\nRepresentatives from the FDA, also in attendance at this year's DEF CON, have been working for years with the grassroots hacktivist group \"I Am The Cavalry\" that helped organize the \u201cBiohacking Village,\u201d an area that focuses on the vulnerabilities of medical devices, among other DEF CON attractions. The agency helped the group exponentially grow the number of devices on-hand for experimentation this year, and it seems to be a two-way street.\n\n\u201cForums like DEF CON, because of the presence of researchers, hackers, manufacturers, clinicians, patients\u2026 really fosters the kind of dialogue, and that sense of collaboration, of needing to work together towards a common goal, that is hard to find in other places,\u201d one FDA representative told Fox News.\n\nTURN OFF YOUR BLUETOOTH, WARN SECURITY EXPERTS\n\nAnother popular corner of the DEF CON experience is called \"r00tz Asylum,\" where children can learn everything from lock-picking (an essential skill for modern-day security consultants) to digital hacking of simulated government websites. And this is yet another area where the U.S. government appears to be playing a big role behind the scenes.\n\nNico Sell, co-chair of Workforce Acceleration for the Trump administration's CSI Cyberpolicy Committee, is a r00tz Asylum organizer. She admits the key to convincing children to get into the field of cybersecurity, and thus boost the U.S. cyber workforce (which is her primary goal), is to make the curriculum seem more \"cool.\"\n\nnext Image 1 of 6\n\nprev next Image 2 of 6\n\nprev next Image 3 of 6\n\nprev next Image 4 of 6\n\nprev next Image 5 of 6\n\nprev Image 6 of 6\n\nSell tells Fox that instead of spreading the gospel of \"security\" among young students, she told the administration that \"we need to teach kids hacking. That's how we're going to solve the workforce acceleration problem.\"\n\nRANSOMWARE IS A 'BEST SELLER' ON UNDERGROUND HACKER FORUMS\n\nAside from the lawmakers seated onstage next to world-famous hackers, another obvious sign of the growing effort to increase the symbiosis between the two communities was the last-minute arrangement of a 9 a.m. panel talk on the first full day of DEF CON this year.\n\n\u201c#DEFCON Wants to Help Hackers Anonymously Submit Bugs to the Government: Let\u2019s Discuss\u201d featured the likes of Moss and Krebs.\n\n\"White-hat hackers are absolutely irreplaceable in the technological age.\" \u2014 Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, at the DEF CON 27 Hacking Convention\n\n\"Thanks for getting up, we've never done one of these this early before,\" Moss said to a bedraggled but surprisingly large early-morning crowd. \"Those of you in the audience with the Twitters and the Facebook, can you maybe announce that this thing is starting so we can get more people here? We are really hoping to have a community question and answer session later on,\" he added.\n\nThe crowd eventually filled out to at least a few hundred people, and Krebs seemed eager to sell the benefits of working with his agency to a crowd that could clearly help his efforts, while trying to figure out why there is still some reluctance among hackers to do so. There were even some DHS folks at the conference with a full table set up for recruitment.\n\n\"We are the advocate within the government for the researcher community, the private sector, kind of 'team internet,'\" Krebs said. \"There are still clearly... some that still have reluctance to engage with the government,\" he admitted. \"So what are the impediments or challenges that the community sees?\" he asked.\n\nTo be sure, an annual gathering of hackers this large has caught the eye of law enforcement once or twice. And the FBI has reportedly bristled in the past at descriptions of the fabled DEF CON \u201cSpot The Fed\u201d contest, in which attendees could win a t-shirt if they spot someone in the crowd that is decided to be a member of a federal agency.\n\nNot everyone at DEF CON has been supportive of the increasing government involvement at their beloved conference. In 2012, Moss (the founder) even asked the feds to take a \"time out\" on attending DEF CON that year due to the unfolding controversy over Edward Snowden. Intelligence & law enforcement agencies have generally been welcomed at DEF CON throughout its history, and even during the 2012 \"time out' from DEF CON, they were still welcomed at other related security events like Blackhat.\n\nAnd what becomes clear to anyone who has ever attended DEF CON, civilian or otherwise, is the idea that fixing problems together is truly the driving force.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"DEF CON is about building community,\u201d Moss told this year's crowd. \u201cAnd I'm always looking for another opportunity to either build bridges, build relationships, or solve problems,\u201d he added.\n\nGot a tip for me, DEF CON-related or otherwise?
