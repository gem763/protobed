It\u2019s been years since she\u2019s seen her daughter, Anna Tshabalala, and she\u2019s losing hope she\u2019ll ever see her child again. It\u2019s not that Anna lives far away or doesn\u2019t want to see her mother.\n\nIn fact, Betty (69) and Anna (51) live only a few streets apart in Tsakane, east of Johannesburg, but they might as well be living on different continents. Both women are trapped in their homes, imprisoned by cruel twists of fate and genetics that have made them prisoners in their own bodies.\n\n\u201cI really miss my baby girl. I only see pictures on the phone because I am stuck in this house,\u201d Betty tells DRUM. It\u2019s been nearly 20 years since the gogo has been able to move around on her own. Her weight and leg injuries make it nearly impossible for her to get out of bed, much less leave her house. She doesn\u2019t know how much she weighs but the last time she was weighed, \u201ca few years ago\u201d, she was \u201caround the 400kg mark\u201d, Betty tells us.\n\nThe battle to lose weight has been a big part of both of their lives for many years. Betty has been following a low-carb eating programme since last October and, although she\u2019s been unable to weigh herself, she thinks it\u2019s helping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve cut fat, carbs and starch. I eat only veggies, fruit and boiled meat,\u201d she says. Anna\u2019s weight, as well as the after-effects of surviving two car crashes, have trapped her in her bedroom too.\n\nShe has no idea what she weighs as her scale only goes up to 180kg. She looks bigger than her mom and, like Betty, she\u2019s desperate to get out of her house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying everything, from injections to the Banting diet, but the skin between my legs is hardening,\u201d she says, tears running down her face.\n\nBetty heard a cracking noise when she stood up from her couch to go to bed one night in 2001.\n\n\u201cI was watching TV in the lounge and when I stood up to go to the bedroom, I heard the sound of something breaking. I fell back on the sofa. Suddenly I couldn\u2019t move my legs,\u201d she tells us.\n\nHer late husband William was in the lounge with her. At first he thought she was joking but soon realised his wife really couldn\u2019t stand up. The pain in her legs was \u201cexcruciating\u201d, she recalls, and William took her to hospital, the first of many trips to the emergency room.\n\nInitially, doctors didn\u2019t know what had caused her to collapse and she was simply prescribed painkillers and given a pair of crutches. When things worsened she went to a different hospital, where doctors were again unable to diagnose what was wrong.\n\nA gruelling six months later doctors at the Clinix Botshelong Empilweni Hospital in Vosloorus discovered Betty had broken both her legs.\n\n\u201cWhen my left leg broke my entire weight was transferred to my right side causing my right leg to break as well,\u201d Betty says. She was transferred to Life The Glynnwood hospital in Benoni for knee replacement surgery but after the operation she still couldn\u2019t walk.\n\n\u201cI went for physiotherapy but I quit because it wasn\u2019t working. I was also scared my legs were going to break again,\u201d\n\nBetty says. Her granddaughter, Thando (20), takes care of her gogo. She was six years old when she moved in with Betty and keeps the house clean and prepares meals every day. Thando finished school last year and hopes to study nursing. Obesity runs in their family, Betty says.\n\nHer grandmother, Elizabeth Mabena, was housebound for 12 years before she died at age 103 in 1996.\n\n\u201cHer heart was strong but her bones couldn\u2019t carry her body,\u201d Betty says.\n\nAnna\u2019s nightmare began a few months before her mom broke her legs when she was involved in a car crash on her way home from work with her husband, Mandla Tshabalala, who died in 2017 at age 55.\n\n\u201cI was in pain for a long time but I didn\u2019t know where I was injured,\u201d she says.\n\nShe says it took Pholosong Hospital in Tsakane seven years to give her a diagnosis, and she had hip replacement surgery on her left hip in 2007.\n\n\u201cI was not as flexible as I had been before but life was back to normal,\u201d she tell us. \u201cI was able to walk and drive myself to work\u201d.\n\nShe soon started having difficulty walking again and doctors told her her right hip needed to be replaced too.\n\nThen, 10 years later, she was in another crash when an armoured truck crashed into her parked car at a shopping mall.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle knocked my car and dragged it with me inside.\u201d\n\nThe damage was severe. \u201cI went to Tambo Memorial Hospital. I had fractured my right hip, which caused the replacement to shift.\u201d\n\nDoctors said they couldn\u2019t operate because Anna was too heavy and needed to lose weight.\n\n\u201cI cry every day looking at what my life has become. I have to sit like this every day staring at this mirror,\u201d she says, pointing to the dressing table opposite her bed.\n\n\u201cThrough this mirror I see my life becoming useless every day. I want to get up and go but I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnna used to work at a laundromat in Boksburg as a tailor and should be eligible for compensation from the Road Accident Fund (RAF).\n\nWhen DRUM contacted the RAF to ask why she has not been able to get an RAF certificate, RAF acting chief marketing officer Adriaan Taljaard says the RAF has considered the fault element and issatisfied with that aspect of the claim but it is still in the process of considering its liability before dealing with the quantum of the claim (the total amount paid out by the RAF based on assessment of the claim).\n\nThat\u2019s no comfort for Anna. Her life, she says, has become a curse \u2013 for her and for others: \u201cI have to call my family to come lock me inside because I am scared. They come and open during the day. I feel like a prisoner in my own house.\u201d\n\nOn the day we meet Anna, her sister, Lydia Mahlangu (53) is there. \u201cI come here to help her and my mother but I also have a house in Mpumalanga and I have to go back,\u201d Lydia tells us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for a helper but no one wants to work for free.\u201d\n\nWhen Anna needs to go to hospital, three ambulances and a fire truck have to come to her tiny house to help her.\n\n\u201cI think the paramedics will soon refuse to come here because it\u2019s a mission to even get the stretcher out. I feel like I am a burden to everyone,\u201d she says.\n\nAnna is desperate to lose weight. Like her mom, she is following a low-carb diet and a dietician regularly administers apetite-suppressant injections.\n\n\u201cI pay R800 a month for the injections. I had to change my diet to veggies and no starch. If I can get rid of this extra fat I think they\u2019d be able to fix the hip replacement.\u201d\n\nThe tears start streaming down Anna\u2019s face again.\n\n\u201cI am always depressed. I\u2019m too young to be living like this.\u201d", "description": "This mom and daughter are stuck in their homes because they are too heavy to move around.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/bd50bc2f339f4befba963562c30087cd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
