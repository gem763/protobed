I think we got that,\u201d she said, adding that Trump\u2019s query revolved around the corruption of a public official, something that \u201cmost Americans\u201d are on board with.\n\n\u201cThere is actually a crime for a public official to use the benefits of his office to benefit his family members or himself. That\u2019s what it certainly looks like with Biden,\u201d Coulter said, reminding the audience of the former vice president\u2019s threat to withhold $1 billion in aid \u201cuntil the president of Ukraine fired a prosecutor investigating a company that was paying Biden\u2019s son multiple millions of dollars for mysterious reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian prosecutor was looking at this before Trump said anything about it. It was Biden who got that prosecutor called off. So there was some reason to look into it,\u201d Coulter pointed out.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight host and Senior-Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour noted that Hunter Biden was in charge of \u201ctransparency and good governance\u201d at Burisma Holdings, according to the press release announcing his addition to the board.\n\nEventually, Coulter said, Democrats are going to have to provide an actual explanation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t that\u2019s going to fly with Americans because eventually, Democrats are going to have to say something other than, \u2018He\u2019s using the White Hosue as an ATM. He\u2019s tearing up the Constitution. He may as well be in the mob,'\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be disturbed that Trump thought this is something to be looked into. I think most Americans would like it looked into,\u201d she continued, praising author and Breitbart News senior contributor Peter Schweizer\u2019s extensive reporting on the corruption and ties of not just the Bidens but other politicians.\n\n\u201cI hope Republicans are rocked on their heels too. I mean this reporting by Peter Schweizer \u2013 it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going after only the Democrats. He\u2019s been going after Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao for some time,\u201d the \u00a1Adios, America! author said.\n\n\u201cIt really does stink to high heaven. These guys show up penniless to the United States Senate and leave multi-millionaires. Look you got the cush job. You got the fame. You have the nice office and all the staff. You\u2019re not supposed to also be making money off of \u2018public service,'\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cPeter Schweizer is doing a fantastic job reporting this stuff, and any of your listers who haven\u2019t looked this up, he has a book that goes through all of it,\u201d she said, referencing Secret Empires.", "description": "Ann Coulter spoke to Breitbart News Tonight and said she believes\u00a0\"most Americans\" want the Bidens' alleged corruption to be investigated.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hunter-joe-biden-sunglasses-AP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
