That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls.\n\nWHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL\n\nBut among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a \"Medicare-for-all\" plan that replaces private insurance.\n\nThe poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing a Medicare buy-in for those under 65 years old. That\u2019s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older.\n\nThe latest Fox News national poll also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.\n\nAmong all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a \"Medicare-for-all\" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers.\n\nHealth care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.\n\nREAD THE FULL RESULTS OF THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Sept. 13-16, with 900 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators.
