And (I'm) looking forward to the future,\" said 19-year-old Jonathan David, who joined forces with the 18-year-old Davies to terrorize U.S defenders.\n\n\"This is unbelievable. Unbelievable ... We showed that we have a young team who's going to bring new football to Canada,\" added veteran goalkeeper Milan Borjan.\n\n\"There's been a lot of us in this [Canada Soccer] Association that have been grinding away, waiting for a night like this on the men's side,\" said Herdman.\n\n\"But it's only one step, it's only one little drop in the ocean I'm hoping for this team. There's more to come,\" he added.\n\nWATCH | Davies nets winner as Canada tops U.S. in Nations League:\n\nTeenage sensation Alphonso Davies scored in Canada's 2-0 win over the United States in Toronto. 1:17\n\nHard-charging Canada was a bundle of energy all night, harrying the Americans when they had the ball and using the pace and guile of Davies and David to cause havoc up front.\n\nHerdman said before the game that desire not tactics would win the day. Nevertheless he had his tactics right, suffocating the U.S. in midfield, and his players showed their heart. They ran and ran and ran.\n\n\"I think the first thing that stands out to me was desire, [the] desire of Canada,\" said U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter. \"Give them credit. But having said that, the minimum we expect is to match that.\"\n\nWATCH: Lucas Cavallini secures the win after bringing down a beautiful ball over the top from Jonathan Osorio. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CANMNT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CANMNT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LMansjvXMP\">pic.twitter.com/LMansjvXMP</a> \u2014@CanadaSoccerEN \"I wasn't happy with the desire that we displayed tonight to win the soccer game,\" he added. \"Too many 50-50 balls we lost and that hurt us.\"\n\nSamuel Piette sucked up balls in the midfield all night long for Canada with captain Scott Arfield and Jonathan Osorio playing provider on the goals.\n\nDavies opened the scoring in the 63rd minute after U.S. midfielder Michael Bradley, who normally calls BMO Field home as Toronto FC captain, lost the ball. The Americans cleared it but it came right back and Arfield raked a low cross across the penalty box that a sliding Davies knocked in at the far post.\n\nYou love to see it! Alphonso Davies gets onto a ball sent across the box from Scott Arfield.

He exited three minutes later to a standing ovation from the announced crowd of 17,126.\n\nIt was his fifth goal for Canada and, he acknowledged, the biggest of his young career. \"[I had] millions of emotions running through me on that goal,\" Davies said.\n\nThe elegant teenager showed why Bayern Munich wanted him so badly, slashing past defenders and generally causing havoc. With such expectations comes pressure. Herdman is doing his best to ease the load off Davies' shoulders.\n\n\"He just needs to be a kid and enjoy it ... Just let Phonzie play his football. We don't need to put him up in lights,\" said Herdman.\n\nDavies may be a world soccer starlet but he is just 18.\n\nScenes.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CANMNT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CANMNT</a> \ud83c\udf41 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnGuardTogether?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OnGuardTogether</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vfohAfA6O9\">pic.twitter.com/vfohAfA6O9</a> \u2014@CanadaSoccerEN \"He was telling us he just bought a BMX [bike] recently,\" said Herdman. \"He's always wanted one.\"\n\nCavallini, taking a looping ball from childhood friend Osorio, hammered home a right-footed shot in stoppage time to rub salt in the U.S. wound. The burly striker kissed the Canadian crest as he celebrated the goal.\n\nIt was a high-tempo, occasionally ill-tempered game with spectators perhaps wondering early which team was the higher ranked.\n\nCanada came out flying and kept its foot on the throttle, frustrating the Americans.\n\n\"They put a lot into the game,\" said Bradley. \"They treated it like it was a cup final. They stepped up harder, they reacted quicker to every loose ball. In all the little ways in a game like that, they were on top of things.\"\n\n\"It felt like they were winning every second ball,\" added midfielder Christian Pulisic.\n\nThe two teams will face off again Nov. 15 in Orlando. The U.S. will play Cuba four days later in the Cayman Islands capital of George Town.", "description": "Alphonso Davies scored in the 63rd minute and substitute Lucas Cavallini added a stoppage-time goal to help Canada end a 34-year winless run against the U.S. with a 2-0 victory in CONCACAF Nations League play on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322278.1571191913!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/soc-usa-canada-20191015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
