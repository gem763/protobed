In comments earlier this week on a visit to Arizona, he said: One of the main reasons we were elected in Washington DC, was to drain the swamp.\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration. That\u2019s about looking backwards and understanding what really happened.\u201d\n\nThe request for Mr Pence to hand over documents, which followed subpoenas to Rudy Giuliani and Mike Pompeo, came moments before Democrats issued a subpoena to the White House. Earlier this week, they said they planned to file the subpoena if Mr Trump was not forthcoming with materials relating to the Ukraine call.\n\nAsked on Friday whether he intended to cooperate with requests for materials, Mr Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s up to the lawyers. I know the lawyers think they\u2019ve never seen anything so unfair. They\u2019ve never seen anything so unjust.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been president now for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been going through this for almost three years. It\u2019s almost become, like, a part of my day.\u201d\n\nMr Pence\u2019s office responded to the Democrats\u2019 request by saying it had received the letter at the same time that it was handed to the media.\n\n\u201cThe office of the vice president received the letter after it was released to the media and it has been forwarded to counsel\u2019s office for a response,\u201d it said. \u201cGiven the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the do nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment.\u201d", "description": "Vice president Mike Pence has dismissed a request by Democrats to hand over documents for the Trump impeachment probe as not being \u201cserious\u201d.
