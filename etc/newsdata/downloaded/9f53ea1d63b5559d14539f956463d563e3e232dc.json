Is it by being on the ground, educating masses of people on the failings of the world\u2019s ignorant elite? Or is it by standing on stage at a glamorous event, brandishing a statue and a cheque? Greta Thunberg knows it definitely doesn\u2019t involve the latter.\n\nSo when it was revealed that the 16-year-old had won the Nordic Council\u2019s Environmental Prize for 2019, which included a cash prize of 350,000 Danish kroner (that\u2019s roughly \u00a340,000), she knew what she had to do: politely decline it.\n\nGreta is currently in California, having travelled to America by boat on her way to the COP25 summit in Chile this December. Instead, two climate activists attended the ceremony to make a statement on her behalf. Greta stated, via Sofia and Isabella Axelsson, that the movement \u201cdoes not need any more prizes\u201d, and that \u201cwhat we need is for our rulers and politicians to listen to the research\u201d. Yep, she has little time for professional peacocking in lieu of actual activism.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s turned down awards. Just a few months ago, she chose to decline the Children\u2019s Climate Prize, as the ceremony in Stockholm (held by a Swedish energy firm) required a number of winners to take flights into the city -- slightly hypocritical, considering the current climate.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean that every prize is off the table; she just knows what matters and what doesn\u2019t. Weeks after her rousing speech at the UN, she accepted the 2019 Right Livelihood Award -- widely considered the \u201calternative Nobel Peace Prize\u201d, looking to \u201chonour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.\u201d Of course, those prizes don\u2019t solely belong to her. As she said in her acceptance speech for the Right Livelihood Award: \u201cIt is not me who is the winner. I am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defence of our living planet.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "The climate movement \u201cdoes not need any more prizes\u201d.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db984478d390c00931f9617/lede/1572439232472-1555501902696-greta-thunberg-har.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.4512xh;0xw,0.0482xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
