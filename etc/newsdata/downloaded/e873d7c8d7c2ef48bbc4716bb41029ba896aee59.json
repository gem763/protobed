In the now infamous call, Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Biden is among the top candidates vying to run against Trump next year.\n\nThe probe stems from a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the intelligence community citing that call. And Democrats, pointing to Trump\u2019s decision around the same time to withhold military aid from Ukraine, suggested the conversation may have contained a quid pro quo, though no such offer is explicitly made, according to the White House's account of the phone call.\n\nTrump\u2019s branding of Schiff as a \u201clowlife\u201d who could be charged with treason came before news broke that the Intelligence chairman had been given a heads-up about the whistleblower's concerns before the complaint was filed in August.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3169/1155968404_6091343115001_6091348845001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office alongside Finland\u2019s president, Trump managed to partially censor himself in a crude attack on Schiff, who at the time had just finished criticizing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on national television.\n\n\u201cHe is a shifty dishonest guy who was critical of one of the great secretary of States. \u2026 The most honorable person, Mike Pompeo, and this guy was negative on Mike Pompeo. He can't \u2014 you know there's an expression, he couldn\u2019t carry his blank strap,\u201d Trump said, apparently self-bleeping \u201cjock strap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't say it,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause they\u2019ll say it was so terrible to say, but that guy couldn\u2019t carry his blank strap, do you understand that?\u201d\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Pompeo had confirmed that he was on the July phone call with Trump and Zelensky after initially playing down any knowledge of what was discussed on the call.\n\nPompeo also stoked Democrats' ire by appearing to accuse them on Tuesday of intimidating career employees at the State Department and by suggesting several potential witnesses could decline to appear for depositions with lawmakers.\n\nDemocrats have moved forward quickly with their probe, hitting Trump and his allies with a number of subpoenas over the past week, and Trump has continued to lash out, calling their investigations an attempt at a \"coup.\" Schiff on Wednesday made clear he would not put up with stonewalling by the White House, telling reporters that doing so would be considered evidence of obstruction in any eventual articles of impeachment.\n\nIn a news conference with Niinist\u00f6 later in the afternoon, Trump professed that he would cooperate with Democratic subpoenas while condemning their oversight efforts as \u201ca fraudulent crime on the American people.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/7b/60/b971ae0445be9182e95d2f4c40fd/pelosi-schiff-presser-11-28-19-am-11-31-07-am-pelosi-whistleblower-redo-2019-10-02.jpg\"\n\n\u201cI always cooperate,\u201d Trump proclaimed Wednesday afternoon when asked how he planned to respond to the flurry of subpoenas, though he maintained that Democrats were perpetuating \u201ca hoax, the greatest hoax.\u201d\n\nAn antagonistic Trump sparred with multiple reporters as they attempted to ask follow-up questions, only easing up in one instance when Fox News\u2019 John Roberts asked about The New York Times\u2019 report on Schiff\u2019s prior knowledge of the whistleblower\u2019s existence.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before, and I\u2019d go a step further,\u201d Trump said after praising Roberts\u2019 line of questioning. \u201cI think he probably helped write it.\u201d\n\nThe Times report, which came out moments before Trump\u2019s news conference, indicates no such thing; according to the Times, Schiff was made aware of the outlines of the future whistleblower\u2019s concerns when the anonymous intel official approached an aide for the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cIt's a scam,\u201d Trump asserted. \u201cJust to finish on this \u2014 I appreciate it, I love the second question, by the way, should've asked it first \u2014 but let me just say, the whole thing is a scam.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Trump demanded Schiff\u2019s resignation while claiming the congressman and the anonymous whistleblower could both be guilty of treason. He repeated those attacks throughout much of the day Wednesday, telling reporters that \u201cI have a lot of respect for whistleblowers but only when they are real.\u201d\n\nHe asserted the whistleblower\u2019s secondhand account of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky \u201cwas totally different than the fact,\u201d despite the whistleblower\u2019s summation largely tracking with the White House\u2019s rough transcript.\n\nShortly after, a Finnish reporter drew gasps and laughs in the room when she asked her president, \u201cbecause it is the biggest issue here at the moment,\u201d if he could detail what kinds of favors Trump had asked him for.\n\nTrump narrowed his eyes and cut in: \u201cOr the other way around, you mean.\u201d\n\nAnd a question from Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason about what Trump considers treasonous set the president off on a rant during which he said that \u201cbelieve it or not, I watch my words very carefully,\u201d asserted \u201cthere are those who think I\u2019m a very stable genius,\u201d and predicted that he \u201cprobably will be bringing a lot of litigation\u201d against those who participated in the Russia investigation.\n\nHe hit Pelosi for handing out subpoenas \u201clike they\u2019re cookies\u201d compared with how former Speaker Paul Ryan handled subpoena requests.\n\nWhen Mason tried to press Trump for a direct answer on how he intended Zelensky to act on requests to investigate the Bidens, Trump continued to dodge, demanding that Mason move on and ask Niinist\u00f6 a question.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Trump interrupted. \u201cAsk him a question. I've given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don't be rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir. I don't want to be rude, I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you,\u201d Mason responded, getting cut off by Trump once again.\n\n\u201cI've answered everything. It's a whole hoax. And you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country and I say in many cases the corrupt media because you're corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake. It's corrupt. You have some very fine people, too. Great journalists, great reporters. But to a large extent it's corrupt and it's fake,\u201d Trump implored. \u201cAsk the president of Finland a question please.\u201d\n\nWhen Mason relented, Trump then cut in to offer a response to Mason\u2019s question for Niinist\u00f6 before allowing the Finnish president to answer.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/71/b7/00d6a8184da3b93f62ab632957b8/191002-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg"}
