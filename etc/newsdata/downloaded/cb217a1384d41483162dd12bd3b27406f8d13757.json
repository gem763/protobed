deaths: 39 migrants found dead believed to be Chinese nationals", "language": "en", "text": "The 39 bodies found frozen to death in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex are believed to be Chinese nationals, The Telegraph understands.\n\nPolice have searched two addresses in Northern Ireland as officers continue to question a Co Armagh lorry driver over the discovery of the suspected migrants.\n\nThere has been no official confirmation, but it is understood all 38 adults and one teenager were Chinese.\n\nThe searches in Co Armagh on Wednesday night are believed to be linked to the arrest of the driver, named in reports as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Portadown.\n\nOn Wednesday night, two properties in County Armagh were searched in connection with the arrest.\n\nMr Robinson's parents are said to have flown to England to support their son, who remains in custody for questioning by Essex Police on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn Wednesday, it emerged detectives were also investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring in connection with the deaths.\n\nThe 38 adults and one teenager found frozen to death in the container are said to be migrants, though police said identifying the bodies \"could be a lengthy process\".\n\nEssex Police did not confirm nor deny that they had applied for extra time to question Mr Robinson, but the force will give an update on the situation at lunchtime, The Telegraph understands.\n\nDetectives have said the trailer containing the victims arrived at Purfleet from Zeebrugge in Belgium at around 12.30am on Wednesday and the front section to which it was attached, known as the tractor, came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 1.05am and officers were called around 30 minutes later after ambulance staff made the grim discovery at Waterglade Industrial Park in Eastern Avenue in nearby Grays.\n\nEric Van Duyse, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor's office, said that Brussels had started an investigation into the incident.\n\nHe added: \"We have no idea at the moment how long the lorry spent in Belgium, it could be hours or days, we just don't know.\"\n\nWhat we know so far\n\n39 bodies found in lorry container Driver from Northern Ireland arrested Lorry cabin registered in Bulgaria in 2017 Container docked in Essex having travelled from Belgium Bodies discovered at Waterglade Industrial Park, Grays\n\nThe incident follows warnings from the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Border Force of the increased risk of people-smuggling via Belgium.\n\nAn NCA assessment report on serious and organised crime last year said there was a \"greater focus\" on rising smuggler numbers in Belgium after the closure of the Dunkirk migrant camp in 2017.\n\nA Border Force assessment in 2016 highlighted Zeebrugge as being among \"key ports of embarkation for clandestine arrivals\".\n\nThe Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Belgium said on Thursday it believed the container in which the bodies were found arrived in Zeebrugge on Tuesday and left for Essex the same day.\n\nA spokesman said: \"It is not yet clear when the victims were placed in the container and whether this happened in Belgium.\"\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said the lorry and the container were being moved to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies can be recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the perpetrators of the crime \"should be hunted down\", while local MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the people smugglers responsible must be caught.\n\nDriver's father learned of arrest through social media\n\nCouncillor Paul Berry said the village of Laurelvale, where the Robinson family live, was in \"complete shock\".\n\nMr Berry, who has been in contact with Mr Robinson's father several times, said he learned of his son's arrest through social media.\n\n\"He had said he had been getting messages via people on social media on what was happening and at that stage it was not confirmed to him or his family that his son had been arrested,\" said the independent representative.\n\n\"In the local area the feeling is one of complete shock and hope this is not a true story in terms of his involvement.\"\n\nMr Berry, who knows the father well, said the family were \"very well respected\" in the area.\n\n\"The local community is hoping that he (Mo Robinson) has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this.\"\n\nHe said the family had been left upset by the \"unwelcome spotlight\" the incident had shone on them.\n\n\"It was very distressing for the family as they just felt they were captive in their own home,\" he said.\n\nFurther details of the last fateful hours of the lorry found to contain the bodies of 39 suspected migrants have now emerged as the police investigation into their deaths continued.\n\nThe Belgian authorities have revealed that the container in which the corpses were found early Wednesday morning arrived at Zeebrugge on Tuesday afternoon at 2.49pm local time and left the port on the same day.\n\nTracking lorry's route 'will be a key line of inquiry', police say\n\nThe Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna in Bulgaria \"under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen\".\n\nIt was registered in 2017 and left the country that year, the officials said.\n\nPolice originally thought the lorry had travelled to the UK through Holyhead in north Wales on October 19 but later revealed that the container had come directly from the Continent.\n\nThe Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Belgium said the container arrived in Zeebrugge on Tuesday afternoon - just before 3pm - and left for mainland Britain on the same day.\n\nHaving left the Belgian coast, it travelled to Purfleet in Essex, docking in the Thurrock area at 12.30am on Wednesday morning.", "description": "The 39 bodies found frozen to death in a refrigerated lorry container
