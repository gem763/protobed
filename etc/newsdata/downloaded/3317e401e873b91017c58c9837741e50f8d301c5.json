Right-hander Luis Severino, who hasn\u2019t pitched this season because of shoulder soreness, is expected to make his debut Tuesday against the Los Angeles Angels, and left-hander Jordan Montgomery will return from elbow surgery to face Toronto on Sunday, possibly following an opener. Montgomery hasn\u2019t pitched in the majors since May 1, 2018.\n\nLeft-hander J.A. Happ had a cortisone injection in his troublesome left biceps on Friday and is expected to pitch against the Angels next week. Happ pitched 4 2/3 innings against the Tigers on Thursday before being replaced by Chad Green. Happ said afterward that he\u2019s been bothered by biceps tendinitis for his past few starts.\n\nIt\u2019s been an injury-plagued season for the AL East-leading Yankees, with 30 players making 38 trips to the injured list. That\u2019s the highest total in the major leagues in at least 15 seasons.\n\nBoone acknowledged frustration with his team\u2019s poor health, but said it doesn\u2019t change his outlook.\n\n\u201cThe goal and the intentions and what we expect never changes,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed all year and it hasn\u2019t changed now. But anytime we lose some of our dudes, I get frustrated.\u201d\n\nBoone said Encarnaci\u00f3n suffered a mild internal oblique strain in the first game of New York\u2019s sweep at Detroit Thursday, while S\u00e1nchez departed the second game because of a strained left groin.\n\nS\u00e1nchez left in the fourth, one inning after he was thrown out in his first stolen base attempt of the season. He has been on the injured list three times in the past two seasons because of groin problems, including a 16-game absence in July and August.\n\nBoone said S\u00e1nchez\u2019s latest strain is similar to his previous one but \u201cin a slightly different spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll get him back by the end of the season,\u201d Boone said. \u201cObviously these next few days, how he responds and everything, will be a determining factor.\u201d\n\nEncarnaci\u00f3n left in the seventh inning of the opener, four innings after hitting his 34th home run. The veteran missed 30 games with a broken right wrist after he was hit by pitch from Boston\u2019s Josh Smith on Aug. 3.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that we can get him back at some point,\u201d Boone said.\n\nOutfielder Aaron Judge was held out of the lineup Friday after playing all 18 innings Thursday and enduring a heavy collision with the outfield wall.\n\nSeverino said he expects to throw about 75 pitches against the Angels after a trio of minor league rehab outings, one at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and two playoff outings with Double-A Trenton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d Severino said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long wait to be back but I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m helping now and I\u2019m going to be able to help my team.\u201d\n\nSeverino went 33-14 in 63 starts over the previous two seasons.\n\n\u201cThis is a guy that, the last couple of years obviously, has been in the Cy Young conversation,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThis is a guy that\u2019s a potential ace.\u201d\n\nOutfielder Giancarlo Stanton played four innings in left field Friday in a simulated game at the Yankees\u2018 minor league complex in Tampa, Florida, and remains on track to rejoin the team during the coming homestand. Stanton has been limited to nine games this season because of injuries to his left biceps, shoulder, calf and right knee.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been seeing a lot of pitching, a lot of at-bats,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe continue to feel good about how he\u2019s responding to it all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been wanting to get G back and get him moving in the right direction and building momentum. We finally feel like, over the last several weeks, he\u2019s really started to do that, so we\u2019re excited about where he\u2019s and his potential impact.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Friday he's \"optimistic\" both Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n and Gary S\u00e1nchez will be able to return before the end of the season, one day after the sluggers were injured in separate games of a doubleheader victory over Detroit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Harrison"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/yankees_tigers_baseball_21251_c0-204-4888-3053_s1770x1032.jpg?5b72e849d83b3805fba30be416b14fef08ea39ce", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
