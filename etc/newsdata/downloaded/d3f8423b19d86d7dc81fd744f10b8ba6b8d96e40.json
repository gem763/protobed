(publisher of the National Enquirer, Us Weekly, Star, Globe, OK! and Radar Online) to corner the tacky tabloid journalism market.\n\nAMI\u2019s acquisition of Bauer\u2019s In Touch, Life & Style and Closer mags also awarded the 45th president a valuable prize: effective control of the pop-culture engine that helped propel him to the White House and could very well keep him there.\n\n\u201cMr. Pecker has repeatedly used his brands as a cudgel on behalf of his friend Trump,\u201d Larry Hackett, the former editor of People, argued last week in Australia\u2019s New Daily. People, along with Entertainment Weekly, is the nation\u2019s only celeb-focused magazine not owned by Pecker\u2014with the rest of Time Inc.\u2019s magazines, they were recently purchased by Meredith.\n\n\u201cHe has peddled false stories about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama without any regard for the facts,\u201d Hackett continued. \u201cThat\u2019s regrettable if it\u2019s one or two publications. But now he has control of\u2026 magazines with an estimated readership of 38 million, a virtual monopoly on the eyeballs of supermarket and Walmart shoppers. What\u2019s to stop him from using those titles [to launch] unfounded attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s political foes, his Hollywood critics, unwanted immigrants?\u201d\n\nPecker\u2019s 36-year-old sidekick is AMI Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard, an Australian import with a checkered past.\n\nThere was a 2008 scandal, after he bought purloined medical records of Australian Football League players that got him fired from a television sports job in Australia; a 2012 sexual-harassment investigation that resulted in his abrupt departure as bureau chief of AMI\u2019s L.A. office; the end of a brief stint running the Celebuzz site after a similar internal investigation of alleged misconduct in 2013; and the allegation that, as AMI\u2019s chief content officer, he collaborated with Harvey Weinstein to gather damaging intelligence on the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s female accusers.\n\nNone of the above has prevented Howard from preaching on the importance of journalistic ethics, especially regarding spreading baseless rumors, especially when stories critical of Trump are involved. (The Daily Beast has approached Pecker and Howard for comment for this article, and will update it should any comment be forthcoming.)\n\nDuring the May 31 episode of his podcast, All Rise With Dylan Howard, he complained about a Daily Beast investigation revealing that TMZ and its Trump-friendly founder, Harvey Levin, attempted to purchase a video recording\u2014which may or not exist\u2014of Donald arguing bitterly in a Trump Tower elevator with his third wife, Melania.\n\nLevin\u2019s possible intention was to protect the president by taking the supposed video out of circulation.\n\n\u201cThis is what grates on me,\u201d Howard said during a phone chat with former Daily News gossip columnist A.J. Benza. \u201cWe, as the media, are now turning on each other. And the media is now reporting stories that other media organizations investigate and report that existence, that investigation, as a news story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unfair,\u201d Benza agreed.\n\n\u201cIs this type of reporting an assault on journalism?\u201d Howard asked rhetorically. \u201cI think there are two sets of standards in the journalism industry in 2018. I think there is an insatiable appetite to try and bring down the president, whether you like him or not. My personal opinion doesn\u2019t matter. But there\u2019s also an insatiable appetite from those, particularly in the liberal-left media, to try and bring down those that are also supportive of the president. My personal opinion is we have thrown our procedures and protocols and standards in pursuit of that agenda.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s bracingly ironic, of course, to hear the top editor of the regularly fact-challenged Enquirer inveigh against rumor-mongering.\n\nEven more surprising was Howard\u2019s angry reaction when former reality-TV star Jon Gosselin\u2014of the 2007 hit series Jon & Kate Plus 8\u2014posted on his Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts the phone number and address of a female Radar Online reporter.\n\nThe reporter had been repeatedly phoning his girlfriend and her hospitalized mother, Gosselin told The Daily Beast, in pursuit of stories about his ugly child-custody battle with his ex-wife, Kate.\n\nOn June 14, Howard left a threatening voicemail message with Gosselin\u2019s talent manager: \u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d he declared in his message, a recording of which was obtained by The Daily Beast. \u201cYour client has posted one of my staff member\u2019s personal information, including her cellphone number and address, on social media\u2014thus encouraging and inciting people to stalk, harass, and intimidate this individual. That is a felony. Your client must remove these details within five minutes or we will be filing a criminal charge and also a civil suit. Your client has been warned. Proceed at your peril.\u201d\n\nThe talent manager, who asked not to be named, told The Daily Beast that she was baffled by Howard\u2019s message\u2014she wasn\u2019t aware of Gosselin\u2019s social-media posts\u2014and that in a subsequent threatening phone call, Howard changed the subject when she brought up the Radar Online reporter\u2019s alleged harassment of Gosselin and his family.\n\n\u201cDylan\u2019s just mad I don\u2019t talk to any of his reporters,\u201d said Gosselin, who is under a judicial gag order forbidding him from discussing the custody battle with the media. \u201cBut when his reporters go after my family, I\u2019m gonna do something about it, because I\u2019m a regular citizen now. I\u2019m not on television. I\u2019m not under contract. I haven\u2019t been filmed in nine years. And now you\u2019re gonna come after me?\u201d\n\nGosselin added: \u201cYou can come after me all you want, but when you start calling my girlfriend and her family\u2014who have no clue\u2014and then try to goad them into talking, I\u2019m either gonna show up at your doorstep or I\u2019m gonna call you out.\u201d\n\nGosselin said he waited half an hour, not five minutes, before taking down the reporter\u2019s details, and he said she hasn\u2019t called back. As for Dylan Howard, he said: \u201cEvery time I come to New York, I pray that I bump into him.\u201d\n\nAn AMI spokesperson responded that the reporter was assigned to contact Gosselin\u2019s adult family members because he had been posting videos and photographs with his daughter for weeks on social media, and fans were speculating that he had gotten legal custody of her.\n\nGosselin called the reporter and erupted (according to quotes provided by AMI that he confirmed): \u201cDo not call my family members. You do not have permission. No one is allowed to talk about custody... Do not call my family. You will know when I fucking feel like releasing the information. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m not giving exclusives. I\u2019m not talking to Radar. I\u2019m done. If you have an issue, I will fucking call my attorney and they will call your attorney.\u201d\n\nThe AMI spokesperson added that once Gosselin posted the reporter\u2019s personal information and \u201cencouraged his fans to call her... they did in large numbers.\u201d\n\nJerry George, a former National Enquirer Los Angeles bureau chief and assistant managing editor of all the AMI titles\u2014who spent 28 years at the supermarket tabloid after being hired by its founder, the late Generoso Pope Jr.\u2014told The Daily Beast that while Pope \u201cbasically left it alone and let it do its thing\u201d\u2014namely aggressive, checkbook-fueled reporting and and scandal-mongering, without fear or favor\u2014\u201cwhen Pecker took over in the late \u201990s, everything changed. That became evident from Day One. The edict came down that no negative Trump stories would ever appear in an American Media publication.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump was once a favorite target of the Enquirer, fodder for headlines like \u201cCaught! Trump & His Mistress,\u201d \u201cTRUMP\u2019S MISTRESS CHEATS ON DONALD WITH TOM CRUISE,\u201d and \u201cTRUMP MISTRESS IS PREGNANT\u201d\u2014a reference to future ex-wife Marla Maples.\n\nIn other words, the Enquirer possessed a rich archive of Trump material, said AMI insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity, that could have been resurrected and re-reported\u2014but wasn\u2019t.\n\nPecker\u2019s friendship with Trump, whether warmly sincere or merely transactional, goes back to well before 1999, when the former accountant, the son of a Bronx bricklayer, was named chief executive of AMI as part of the Evercore private-equity firm\u2019s purchase of the company\u2014with the Enquirer its flagship property\u2014for $767 million.\n\nPecker\u2019s eagerness to help Trump and his minions\u2014which has already placed him in the crosshairs of federal investigators and earned him a subpoena in the criminal probe of the president\u2019s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen\u2014has prompted him to spend AMI\u2019s money to pay off Trump\u2019s various accusers to suppress damaging stories (the practice known as \u201ccatch and kill\u201d).\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign\u2014as The Washington Post\u2019s Sarah Ellison reported last week\u2014Pecker submitted stories and photos concerning Trump and his opponents for Cohen\u2019s thoughts before they were published.\n\nUnder Pecker, the Enquirer famously broke with its nonpartisan tradition to endorse Trump in the Republican nomination race\u2014under the headline \u201cTRUMP MUST BE PREZ!\u201d\u2014while regularly sliming his rivals.\n\nPecker, along with his sidekick Howard, has shown no reluctance to weaponize AMI\u2019s publications against Trump\u2019s enemies\u2014be they Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski (the subject of a tawdry story about the engaged couple\u2019s workplace affair) or Barack Obama.\n\nObama had barely taken the oath of office when the Enquirer dished dirt with tawdry headlines such as: \u201cOBAMA MARRIAGE CRISIS\u201d; \u201cMICHELLE OBAMA BOOZE BINGES\u201d; \u201cBAM BANNED FROM BED!\u201d\u2014and other thinly sourced gossip and rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, even though he was years away from his presidential candidacy, Trump could bask in such Enquirer headlines as \u201cTRUMP EXPLODES AT OPEC!\u201d; \u201cTRUMP: OBAMA HAS MADE U.S. \u2018WHIPPING POST\u2019 FOR THE WORLD!\u2019\u201d; and \u201cTRUMP ROCKS NEW POLLS!\u201d\n\nIn early April 2011, when the birther virus was infecting the fever swamps of American politics, the Celebrity Apprentice star went on NBC\u2019s Today show to allege that Obama had possibly been born in Kenya instead of the United States.\n\n\u201cThree weeks ago when I started, I thought he was probably born in this country, and now I have a much bigger doubt than I did before,\u201d the de facto leader of the birtherism movement\u2014who also happened to be marking his 11th season on NBC\u2019s prime-time schedule\u2014told a skeptical Meredith Vieira about the 44th president of the United States. \u201cIf he weren\u2019t lying, why wouldn\u2019t he just solve it?... If he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s one of the greatest scams in the history of politics and in the history period. You are not allowed to be a president if you are not born in this country. He may not have been born this country.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cI have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they\u2019re finding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have people down there searching\u2014I mean, in Hawaii?\u201d Vieira demanded.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Trump agreed. \u201cAnd they cannot believe what they\u2019re finding.\u201d\n\nMore than seven years later, Trump has provided zero evidence that he ever sent anyone to Hawaii to investigate the circumstances of Obama\u2019s birth.\n\nYet the Enquirer eagerly reported at the time that Trump had \u201chired a team of detectives to dig deep in the archives to prove that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and would be then ineligible to be president.\u201d\n\nHowever, around the same time that the then-reality television star was making his baseless claim, the National Enquirer had indeed sent a staffer to Honolulu to look into Obama\u2019s origins.\n\nAccording to colleagues in AMI\u2019s Los Angeles bureau, ace reporter Rick Egusquiza\u2014the man who broke the John Edwards love-child scandal\u2014was dispatched to the 50th state to prove that there was indeed something fishy about President Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nEgusquiza\u2014who now works for Bauer, at least until the sale is scheduled to be completed on July 1\u2014declined to comment. But former AMI staffers speculate that David Pecker boasted to Trump about Egusquiza\u2019s Hawaii trip, and Trump, on the Today show, was referring to the Enquirer\u2019s man in Honolulu.\n\nBut the AMI spokesperson said: \u201cMr. Pecker never authorized anyone going to Hawaii or discussed it with Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cRick was ordered to Hawaii and told, \u2018Don\u2019t come back until you get something to prove the birth certificate isn\u2019t real,\u2019\u201d said former Radar Online Editor Maxine Page, who described herself as a friend of Egusquiza. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t prove that, because it was real.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Egusquiza came back with interviews with the president\u2019s childhood acquaintances and photos of the young Obama\u2014including one of him as a toddler in a pirate\u2019s costume\u2014that the reporter managed to find at the apartment complex where his grandmother had lived.\n\n\u201cThe curious thing is who benefits from this?\u201d former Enquirer bureau chief Jerry George mused, noting that it\u2019s unclear how AMI and Pecker engineered the Bauer purchase, and the Us Weekly acquisition last year, at a moment when circulation and sales are in decline. (An April 19 headline in The Wall Street Journal read: \u201cNational Enquirer Parent, Staunch Trump Backer, Faces Mounting Debt, Shrinking Sales.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAs a company, they live from hand to mouth and they don\u2019t have a great cash flow, from my experience,\u201d George continued. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a news organization any more. It\u2019s becoming Pravda.\u201d", "description": "Trump acolyte David Pecker\u2019s now-expanded gossip mag conglomerate AMI gives the president effective control of the pop-culture engine that helped propel him to the White House.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1529989326/180625-grove-ami-trump-tease_ni0kw6", "published_at": "2018-06-26"}
