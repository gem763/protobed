Call Crazy Rudy'", "language": "en", "text": "A comedian duo created scathing prank New York City subway ads this week that looked familiar to commuters \u2014 but with a wicked twist on President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. \u201cNeed a lawyer?\u201d the ads asked. \u201cCall Crazy Rudy.\u201d\n\nThe messages were a send-up of Giuliani\u2019s over-the-top appearances on TV news shows as he peddles conspiracy theories, including about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as he defends Trump\u2019s phone call pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens as he held up military aid to the nation. That July call has become the centerpiece of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nGiuliani will do \u201cback-deal channels, cable news appearances, has no shame\u201d and \u201cwill work for free!\u201d pitch the mock ads.\n\nDavram Stiefler and Jason Selvig \u2014 of the comedy pair \u201cThe Good Liars\u201d \u2014 created the signs and hung them in trains on three lines Tuesday.\n\nThey also created the CrazyRudyLaw.com site, which advises: \u201cIn an effort to shield money from my wife during our divorce, I\u2019m willing to work for FREE! I only ask that you pick up the bar tab at the end of our session.\u201d The website also promises that the former New York mayor\u2019s appearances will be \u201cunhinged, combative and fun!\u201d\n\nThe pair also set up an answering machine message for the number posted on the ad and website: (347) 687-0436.\n\nStiefler and Selvig have a reputation for political high jinks. A year ago they posted \u2014 then removed \u2014 a video of them hounding Brian Kilmeade of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d outside a subway station and on the streets of New York.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people out there who are so emotional,\u201d Kilmeade told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. \u201cHow much more are we willing to accept?\u201d\n\nIn August, Selvig posted \u201cmissing\u201d posters for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio while he was running for president.\n\nHe was \u201clast seen embarrassing himself in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina,\u201d the posters stated. \u201cIf seen, please tell him to immediately return to New York and do the job he was elected to do.\u201d\n\nThere was also this:\n\nAnd this appears to be the duo\u2019s latest:\n\nGiuliani did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe \u201cneed a lawyer\u201d messages were removed by the city\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority because they weren\u2019t paid for or approved.", "description": "He does back-channel deals, has no shame and \"will work for free!\" the satirical signs pitch.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9688532200007d03dcee2f.png?cache=6sazz4udjs&ops=1778_1000"}
