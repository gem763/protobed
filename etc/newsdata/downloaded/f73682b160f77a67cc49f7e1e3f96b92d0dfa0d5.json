But the White House is going all-out to win over Republicans, with the president hosting lawmakers from both parties at the White House on Wednesday and scheduling an all-senators briefing for later in the week.\n\nWhen Defense Secretary Mark Esper met with House Republicans on Tuesday he explained the administration\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria\u2019s northern border, according to Republicans who were present. Esper told lawmakers that Trump received a phone call from Turkey\u2019s president that they were going to move ahead with their planned military offensive in \u201c48 hours,\u201d leaving the United States with few options.\n\nBut Esper struggled to answer some questions from members \u2014 including one about what the administration is doing to prevent the resurgence of ISIS \u2014 leaving a group of Republicans dissatisfied, according to a source familiar with the meeting.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
