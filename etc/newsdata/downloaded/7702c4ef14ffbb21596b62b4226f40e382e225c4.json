They gave birth to 29 children who were adopted by families in Arizona and other states including Utah.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriffs Office via AP\n\nGarcia said that officials are \"not questioning the validity of the adoptions\" and are focusing instead on how Petersen and Jennet allegedly violated a treaty between the U.S. and the Marshall Islands that banned bringing women over to give birth for the purposes of adoption and for the alleged fraudulent use of Arizona health care services.\n\n\"The last thing we want is that parents or these families to wake up and think 'Is my child going to be taken?' and that is not the case,\" Garcia said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who spoke about the case at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any interest in unwinding or interfering with adoptions that have taken place,\u201d Reyes said.\n\nAn official involved in the investigation in Utah said at the news conference that the case was \u201cunique\u201d and took 18 months to complete. He said that since news of the case initially broke late Tuesday night, the Utah Attorney General\u2019s Office received in excess of 30 calls from potential victims who had not been previously identified, suggesting that more charges could come later.\n\nBoth Petersen and Jennet were arrested Tuesday and booked into Maricopa County Jail. ABC News' attempts to reach them were not immediately successful.\n\nQuestions were raised about Petersen's law firm's adoption practices in December 2018 following an investigation by the Honolulu Civil Beat. At the time, Petersen issued a statement to The Arizona Republic saying that he was \"extremely proud\" of the work his firm did.\n\n\"My work is personally rewarding as I have helped hundreds of couples trying to adopt children,\" Petersen said in a statement to The Arizona Republic in December 2018. \"I only work with children who are United States citizens. I follow closely the laws of the states I work in and adhere to federal rules and guidelines that govern adoptions.\"\n\n\"I will continue doing the work that I love and enrich the lives of numerous families,\" Petersen said.", "description": "Paul Petersen serves as the Maricopa County Assessor, described on the office's website as a position that administers property.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/paul-d-petersen-file-ap-jef-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
