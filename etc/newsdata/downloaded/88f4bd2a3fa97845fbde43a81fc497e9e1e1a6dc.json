David Berger, is breaking china, figuratively, so as to enable the Marines to break China, literally, should a conflict erupt in East Asia.\n\nAs the only service whose forces are mandated by law \u2014 three divisions and three air wings \u2014 the Marines have relied on their traditional hold over Congress to cling to their classic approach to amphibious assault, which has gone unchanged since the 1951 landing at Inchon.\n\nIn reality, over the years, and especially during the Vietnam War and the two Gulf wars, the Marines have functioned as a classic land force, hardly differing from the Army. Moreover, beginning in the 1980s, Marines pre-stocked equipment in Norway, in order to confront the Soviets in their northern theater, and the Marines continue to train in Norway; their most recent exercise, in March, called for joint cold-weather operations with Norwegian forces.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo wonder that, over time, there have been calls at a minimum to drop the Marine amphibious mission \u2014 and no longer acquire ships to support it \u2014 or, maximally, to subsume the Corps into the Army.\n\nEnter Gen. Berger, with an entirely different vision for Marine missions in the 21st century that he has outlined in both his detailed \u201cCommandant\u2019s Planning Guidance\u201d and his more compact \u201cCommandant\u2019s Intent.\u201d\n\nTo begin with, he is refocusing the Corps on its classic role as a true naval expeditionary force, meaning that its primary focus will be on operating in tandem with the U.S. Navy. He recognizes that, ever since the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols legislation mandated joint operations across the four military services, the Marines have loosened their bonds with the Navy. Yet, Berger feels that the re-emergence of powerful potential adversaries mandates that the Marines once again act, in his words, as \u201cthe extension of the fleet.\u201d\n\nConsistent with that vision, Berger\u2019s plan is to emphasize the Marines\u2019 role in the Indo-Pacific theater and to develop forces that could effectively confront an increasingly capable Chinese military. To that end, Berger has made it clear that the Marines cannot simply rely on being transported in large amphibious ships, as has been the case for more than a half-century. Instead, he anticipates acquiring a larger number of smaller ships that would complicate Chinese targeting algorithms.\n\nBerger also envisages the Marines operating from what he terms \u201cExpeditionary Advance Bases.\u201d The Marines would establish these bases essentially under the noses of Chinese weapons ranges. The expeditionary bases would thereby facilitate operations, especially naval operations, closer to Chinese territory while complementing those with drones (the Marines have operated drones since the early 1980s) and longer-range missile systems that both they and the other services plan to acquire. Moreover, unlike fixed bases, which especially in the Pacific are increasingly vulnerable to Chinese long-range strikes, expeditionary bases would enable American forces to operate without long, vulnerable supply chains.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs with all new concepts, Expeditionary Advance Base operations requires considerable analysis and development. To that end, and more generally, Berger proposes to ramp up the Marines\u2019 war-gaming capability, quintupling its war-gaming staff over the next five years. In doing so, he is harking back to what many consider to be the halcyon days of war-gaming \u2014 namely, the 1930s, when the Navy and Marines developed and refined the amphibious assault mission.\n\nNeedless to say, many of Berger\u2019s ideas are likely to be anathema to traditionalists. In particular, old Marine hands will have difficulty coming to grips with a Marine Corps that does not solely operate from large amphibious ships. Others may wonder why Berger openly states that he will \u201cincreasingly accept risk\u201d with respect to Marine operations in the Middle East. And Berger acknowledges that he will need to reconcile his vision of a renewed Navy-Marine Corps bond with the culture that has developed since Goldwater-Nichols became law.\n\nBut he is rightly convinced that, just as the National Defense Strategy has recognized that future conflicts are more likely to reflect \u201cgreat power\u201d competition rather than the Middle East operations that have marked the past two decades, so too must the Marine Corps undergo a major transformation if its mission and capabilities are to remain relevant in the decades to come.\n\nDov S.
