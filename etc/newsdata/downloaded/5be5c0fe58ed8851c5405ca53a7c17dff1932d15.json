President Compares Border Patrol Visit to Racism, Vandalism", "language": "en", "text": "The president of Michigan State University, Samuel Stanley, sent an email to the entire student body addressing several instances that have caused \u201cconcern and anger\u201d on campus. In his email, the university president likened a recent Customs and Border Patrol visit to vandalism, among other issues on campus.\n\nMichigan State University (MSU) President Samuel Stanley bizarrely listed the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) visit to campus for a class presentation as one of four recent instances of \u201chate\u201d that have caused \u201cconcern and anger\u201d among MSU\u2019s campus community, according to a report by Campus Reform.\n\n\u201cOur community has been affected in the past several days by incidents causing concern and anger,\u201d said Stanley in his statement. \u201cI, too, am concerned, because a safe, inclusive and respectful campus is my top priority. Hate has no home at Michigan State.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecently the greater campus community has experienced vandalism at MSU Hillel, our center for Jewish student life; the presence of U.S. Customs and Border Protection on campus last week for a presentation to a class; an instance of racial bias reported from Bryan Hall over the weekend; and a survey in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences that offended students.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cinstance of racial bias reported from Bryan Hall\u201d was in reference to toilet paper that was found hanging on a dormitory door, which residents said was a racist act, claiming that it had resembled a noose. At the time of Stanley\u2019s email to students, several MSU officials had reportedly already dismissed the incident as a prank.\n\nThe \u201csurvey in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences\u201d department was in reference to a recent slur-filled survey riddled with racist and homophobic language, which was sent by professor Saleem Alhabash to students at random.\n\n\u201cThese situations have disrupted a sense of safety that should exist for everyone,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBuilding inclusive communities is at the core of our values, and the impact of recent events cannot be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to personally let you know the concerns of our campus community are being taken seriously,\u201d he added. \u201cInvestigations by both the MSU Police Department and our Office of Institutional Equity are taking place, and we are providing support to those who are affected.\u201d\n\nStanley did not clarify if he would be asking the MSU Police Department to investigate the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol visit, but did stress that the university will be holding itself accountable.\n\n\u201cWe will be responsive to these issues and will not ignore the effect they are having on our community,\u201d said the university president. \u201cIt is important to hold ourselves accountable for being respectful, culturally sensitive and informed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the coming months, I will continue to work with students and others in the campus community as we undergo a strategic planning process, including an emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cYour feedback will be critical to this plan moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s Hillel student group \u2014 which had been subjected to vandalism \u2014 told Campus Reform that the organization did not feel Stanley was making a comparison between the vandalism and the presence of CBP on campus.\n\n\u201cMSU Hillel does not believe that the President is equating what we experienced with any of the other three incidents,\u201d said Director of Jewish Student Life at MSU Hillel Nate Strauss. \u201cAdditionally, we would not want him to [do so], because they are not the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe report added that MSU Hillel also mentioned that it did not believe the vandalism it suffered had been an act of anti-Semitism.\n\nMichigan State University did not immediately respond to Breitbart News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "The president of Michigan State University, Samuel Stanley, sent an email to the entire student body addressing several instances that have caused \"concern and anger\" on campus.
