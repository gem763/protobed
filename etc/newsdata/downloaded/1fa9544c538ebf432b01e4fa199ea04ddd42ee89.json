Without us the referees would be peeling potatoes. We\u2019re tired of paying for this standard of refereeing.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Roma, Lazio move above Napoli \u2013\n\nNikola Maksimovic had headed Napoli into the lead on 16 minutes, but Remo Freuler levelled just before half-time when his shot squirmed through goalkeeper Alex Meret.\n\nPolish striker Arkadiusz Milik hit the post and crossbar before putting Napoli back on top on 71 minutes when he raced onto a Fabian Ruiz pass and rounded Pierluigi Gollini.\n\nHowever, Ilicic levelled and nearly grabbed a winner in stoppage time for Atalanta, who stayed third but now trail leaders Juve by five points.\n\n\u201cFrom the pitch, I thought it was a penalty. Then, seeing the images, I saw a big elbow to Kjaer\u2019s face,\u201d Atalanta boss Gian Piero Gasperini said of the passage of play that led to his team\u2019s controversial equaliser.\n\n\u201cThe images are very clear. Whoever was in the VAR booth confirmed what the referee saw, but I\u2019m rightly biased.\u201d\n\nRoma climbed above Napoli into fourth after a 4-0 rout of Udinese despite losing Federico Fazio to a red card on 31 minutes.\n\nNicolo Zaniolo opened the scoring before the dismissal of Fazio for a foul as the last defender.\n\nChris Smalling doubled Roma\u2019s lead early in the second half with a Justin Kluivert goal and Aleksandar Kolarov penalty wrapping up victory.\n\nCiro Immobile struck twice to take his league-leading tally to 12 goals as Lazio swept Torino aside 4-0.\n\nCagliari extended their unbeaten run to eight games with a 3-2 win over Bologna while Fiorentina came from behind to defeat Sassuolo 2-1.\n\nSampdoria remain rooted to the foot of the table despite Gaston Ramirez salvaging a 1-1 draw with an injury-time equaliser at home to Lecce.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo converted a 96th-minute penalty as Juventus defeated Thiago Motta\u2019s Genoa 2-1 to reclaim top spot in Serie A", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/014a4b_cristiano-ronaldo-scored-stoppage-time-winner-juventus-penalty-spot-ronaldo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
