Such an event would have marked a major turning point in negotiations to end America\u2019s 18-year military campaign in Afghanistan; until this point, the Taliban has refused to formally meet with the U.S.-backed leaders in Kabul.\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d\n\nThe president long has promised to end America\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East. Despite horrific Taliban attacks and little indication the group would accept a formal ceasefire, the administration had spent months forging ahead with diplomatic talks.\n\nThe administration\u2019s Afghanistan envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, met again with Taliban leaders in Qatar on Friday. But there were growing signs that opposition to the deal was mounting inside the White House, State Department and Pentagon.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example, reportedly refused to sign a peace agreement with the Taliban after the group demanded Afghanistan again be recognized as the \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d \u2014 the name by which the country was known in the years leading up to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nThe deal also did not explicitly guarantee that the Taliban would cease its attacks.\n\nIn his tweets, the president cast new doubt on whether he\u2019ll continue his push to pull the U.S. from Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIf they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d he said.\n\nThe latest Afghanistan attack saw a Taliban fighter set off a suicide car bomb in a busy diplomatic area of Kabul near the U.S. embassy. The attack killed a U.S. service member, a Romanian soldier, and at least 10 civilians. Dozens of other civilians were wounded in the assault.\n\nEarly drafts of the U.S.-Taliban peace agreement reportedly would\u2019ve seen roughly 5,400 of the 14,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan come home, along with the shuttering of five American military bases in the country.\n\nIn exchange, the Taliban would guarantee that Afghanistan will never again be used as a base from which terrorist groups can attack the West.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
