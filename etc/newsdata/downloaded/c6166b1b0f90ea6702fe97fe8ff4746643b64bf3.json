Users in turn marveled at and mocked the franchise\u2019s teal Golden Arches and tacky stucco facade. The board that approved this particular McDonald\u2019s was in Sedona, Arizona, which enforces an especially strict design code. A local in the group provided additional context: \u201cI live in Sedona [and] all the boards that run this place have a stick up their \u2026\u201d\n\nWeird McDonald\u2019s are a mainstay in the group, which interrogates the strange results of America\u2019s hyper-localized system of land-use regulation. For the most part, the chain has produced standard, recognizable stores, from Googie food stands to double-sloped mansard roofs. So when local zoning boards insist on aesthetic control, the results stand out, producing an awkward mix of formula design and local whims. If the group\u2019s comment section is any indication, the resulting McDonald\u2019s are often a bit of a disappointment. Indeed, they each in their own way suggest that something has gone awry in the way we design cities. Here are their stories.\n\n\u2026With A Side of Preservation\n\nWhen local entrepreneur Lawrence Anderer decided to bring McDonald\u2019s to the tony Long Island suburb of New Hyde Park, the chain already had the franchising process down to a science. In 1985, he acquired a cheap lot with a dilapidated old house along the Jericho Turnpike, already a busy suburban commercial strip at the time. There was just one problem: that dipalitated old home was the Denton House, a 1795-built Georgian mansion.\n\nAs locals rushed to apply historic designation to the property, Anderer\u2019s original plan to demolish the then-decaying house and build a conventional McDonald\u2019s was quickly scuttled. At this point, Anderer might have walked away, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he opted to navigate the new set of rules applied to the property, restoring the home\u2019s front facade and opening what has been called \u201cthe most beautiful McDonald\u2019s in America\u201d in 1991.\n\nA similar fight played out when McDonald\u2019s set out to open its first location in the state of Maine. Bumping up against Freeport\u2019s extremely strict design and preservation codes, it quickly became clear that the standard site plan wasn\u2019t going to fly. After raucous public debate, the town agreed to allow McDonald\u2019s to rehabilitate the Gore House, an 1850-built Colonial manor. Like Denton House, Gore House stands to this day, just one block north of the L.L. Bean headquarters. In an awkward nod to local culture, this is also one of the few McDonald\u2019s to sell the \u201cMcLobster,\u201d the chain\u2019s take on the lobster roll.\n\nDid Somebody Say Design?\n\nAs Anglos moved en masse into the American Southwest in the early twentieth century, design quickly became a key part of the region\u2019s emerging culture. As Virginia Savage McAlester describes in A Field Guide to American Houses, Spanish Revival homes sprung up behind conventional front lawns in California, while Monterey-style balconies projected from English-style massings in Texas.\n\nEnthusiasm among settlers for a unique Southwestern aesthetic reached a fever pitch in Arizona and New Mexico. Promoted by architectural historians and tourism boosters alike, Pueblo Revival quickly became popular, combining flat roofs, projecting roof beams, and stuccoed walls. Out of this, many of America\u2019s first modern design ordinances were born, requiring that new buildings incorporate what came to be known as \u201cSanta Fe style.\u201d\n\nThe folks at McDonald\u2019s got a crash course in this unique slice of American architectural history when they tried to open a franchise in Sedona, Arizona. Nestled in the hills of Central Arizona, Sedona boasts strict design codes that prohibit \u201cfranchise buildings.\u201d Designing buildings like outfits, city officials argued that the Golden Arches clashed with the region\u2019s famous red rock faces. In addition to complying with the standard Pueblo Revival design rules, which produced a curious adobe-style building, the company was required to turn the Golden Arches teal.\n\nAt the same time that planners in New Hyde Park were fighting with McDonald\u2019s to preserve the Denton House, planners in Independence, Ohio were negotiating with the chain to produce a building with quality design. Like Sedona, the outer Cleveland suburb enforced strict facade rules, requiring McDonald\u2019s to secure signoff from the town\u2019s Architecture Review Board. The result of these negotiations is a two-story, post-modern-by-way-of-Greek Revival McDonald\u2019s\u2014three-quarters of a mile east of Interstate 77.\n\nLocals seem to be content with all four developments\u2014if nothing else, for their sheer weirdness\u2014and each allowed McDonald\u2019s to slip locations into otherwise restrictive towns. But if a mixed online reception is any indication, these developments raise serious questions about the efficacy of historic preservation and design regulations.\n\nToday, the once-manicured grounds of the Denton House are a surface parking lot. And the interior of the Gore House has been gutted and remade into a garden-variety McDonald\u2019s. The Sedona McDonald\u2019s is still, at the end of the day, an outparcel next to a strip mall that could be anywhere in North America. And as Redditors have observed, the Independence McDonald\u2019s looks kind of evil.\n\nOne can\u2019t help but wonder, was it worth all the fuss to save a mansion that sells McDoubles and McFlurrys\u2014a McMansion, if you will? Are teal Golden Arches really strengthening the heritage of the Southwest? Are faux Greek Revival columns at the drive-thru window really changing perceptions about the quality of a humdrum suburb? At the same time that we likely overestimate the placemaking powers of preserving and designing by committee, perhaps there\u2019s underappreciated wisdom in just letting a McDonald\u2019s be a McDonald\u2019s.\n\nNolan Gray is a city planner in New York and a regular contributor to Market Urbanism.", "description": "", "authors": ["New Urbs"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_643234660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-22"}
