Ashamed? Indifferent? If you\u2019ve got an Android phone, Google is now giving you that option \u2014 plus other new initiatives that are part of the company\u2019s ongoing Digital Wellbeing effort.\n\nAs noted by Android Police, Google has released several new Digital Wellbeing \u201cexperiments\u201d in the Play Store. The one I mentioned above is called Unlock Clock. \u201cUnlock Clock helps you consider your tech usage, by counting and displaying the number of times you unlock your phone in a day,\u201d the app description reads. Once installed, you can find Unlock Clock inside of Google\u2019s Wallpapers app and set it as a live wallpaper.\n\nAnother experiment, Post Box, is a rethinking of how we receive notifications. Instead of incessantly hitting you with push alerts throughout the day, Post Box lets you choose a time (or several over the course of the day) when you\u2019d like to take them all at once. You can pick just once a day or have up to four notification deliveries. There\u2019s also an \u201cI need to see my notifications now\u201d option that can be selected at any time if you fear you\u2019ve missed something important by bundling everything together on a schedule like this.\n\nNext up is Morph, which is an Android launcher that shows different apps based on time of day or your location. You can set the obvious environments like work or home, but Google\u2019s example also shows situations like \u201choliday\u201d where you might want to minimize app time and be more present with others. There are already other Android launchers that offer similar time-and-place personalization, but Google\u2019s new experiment looks incredibly straightforward if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.\n\nSpeaking of time with others, another new Digital Wellbeing experiment is called We Flip. If everyone installs the app on their phone, you can all join the same session and flip a switch that starts counting the amount of time the group has gone without anyone unlocking their phone. This is clearly meant for family and friend time where people want to make a mindful effort to take a break from tech.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real: eventually, someone is going to break. After someone inevitably unlocks their phone, the session is over and everyone sees a summary. We Flip will also tally up \u201cpeeks,\u201d or times you looked at your lock screen without fully unlocking since that\u2019s half-cheating.\n\nThe last of these new Digital Wellbeing experiments is called Desert Island. As the name implies, Desert Island is meant to help you focus on only the essential apps you need for a certain task or on a particular day. You pick the crucial apps \u2014 a maximum of seven \u2014 and then start a 24-hour challenge of seeing if you can stick to only that software and nothing else.\n\nYou can still open all of the other apps on your phone, but you\u2019ll be called out for it when Desert Island serves up its summary report. Like Morph, this is an entire launcher, which might put some people off from trying it since they\u2019ll have to switch away from their current Android home screen.\n\nGoogle is encouraging developers to take inspiration from these early examples and come up with their own Digital Wellbeing experiments using a \u201cHack Pack\u201d and various APIs. \u201cThe more people that get involved the more we can all learn about building better technology for everyone,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nAre you going to give any of them a shot?", "description": "Google\u2019s new Digital Wellbeing Experiment apps include a wallpaper that shows how often you unlock your phone throughout the day and a \"game\" for keeping everyone away from tech when spending time together.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6toTQm8tm4fwCp0bbAUVZIXyrRY=/0x15:1700x905/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19312683/Screen_Shot_2019_10_23_at_11.25.37_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
