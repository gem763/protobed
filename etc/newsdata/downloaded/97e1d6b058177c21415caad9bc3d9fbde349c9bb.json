(Mike McCarn)\n\nThe Carolina Panthers announced Monday that injured quarterback Cam Newton will not play in the team\u2019s Week 4 game against the Texans in Houston.\n\n\u201cWhat Cam needs right now is time and rest for his foot. We want him at 100 percent when he\u2019s ready, so there\u2019s no exact timetable for his return,\u201d Coach Ron Rivera said in a short article posted on the team\u2019s website. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re going to go forward with Kyle [Allen] as our starter.\u201d\n\nNewton has been battling a foot problem \u2014 it\u2019s reportedly a mid-foot sprain \u2014 since the preseason and clearly was not himself in his last game on Sept. 12 against the Buccaneers. Last week, however, the Panthers didn\u2019t rule him out until Friday, letting the uncertainty linger until Rivera began to grow frustrated with the constant questions from reporters about it.\n\nRivera spoke to reporters shortly after the Panthers made the announcement and didn\u2019t shed too much light on the situation, other than to say that he\u2019s \u201cstaying out\u201d of any decision about Newton undergoing surgery.\n\nRon Rivera, on ruling out Cam Newton this week: There is no timetable. pic.twitter.com/IKsNd7Cj3u \u2014 Jourdan Rodrigue (@JourdanRodrigue) September 23, 2019\n\nBackup Kyle Allen\u2019s performance Sunday against the Cardinals certainly helped the Panthers with their decision this week. Making his second career start, Allen completed 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards and four touchdowns as Carolina won for the first time this season. According to ESPN Stats and Info, Allen\u2019s 90.6 QBR is the highest by any quarterback in his first two career starts.\n\nAfter the game, Rivera said that Newton will reassume his starting job when healthy but that the team would be \u201crolling\u201d with Allen until then. Newton has completed 50 of 89 passes this season, with zero touchdowns and an interception. He\u2019s carried the ball only five times for minus-two yards, a drastic change from previous seasons when he was an integral part of the Panthers\u2019 rushing attack.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nThe Broncos are in a \u2018world of suck.\u2019 Here\u2019s why.\n\nGiants\u2019 Saquon Barkley has ankle sprain, likely will play again this season\n\nThe Rams are the real deal.
