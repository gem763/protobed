The blaze has destroyed 206 structures, including 94 homes, and nearly 200,000 people have been forced to evacuate.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, out of 21 open shelters in the region with a capacity of 5,000, six were already at capacity.\n\nIn Southern California, conditions also remain grim as residents prepare for record-strong Santa Ana winds that are expected to last through Thursday morning, according to the Washington Post. Wind gusts up to 80 mph are bringing extreme fire danger to the region.\n\nThe Getty Fire \u2014 which erupted in the Los Angeles area on Monday \u2014 has already prompted the evacuation of more than 7,000 homes, according to the New York Times. Separately, the Tick fire, which started Thursday in Santa Clarita, triggered evacuation orders for 50,000 people. Most were allowed to return to their homes on Saturday, according to The Weather Channel.\n\n\u2014NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) October 30, 2019\n\nIn response to the various infernos, Airbnb has announced its Open Homes program. It is set to offer free, temporary housing to disaster victims through November 7. The program is straightforward: Homeowners in the areas around Santa Clarita, Sonoma County, and Los Angeles, can list their homes for $0 on the site, and Airbnb waives all booking fees.\n\nAfter a disaster strikes an area, Airbnb reaches out to hosts to see if they have space for displaced neighbors. Homeowners who aren't already hosts can make a verified Airbnb account to list their homes.\n\nDisaster victims can find available homes by clicking on a link specifically for emergency housing, or by calling the hotline at 605-249-3242.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the residents and communities impacted by the Kincade Fire and to the relief workers and first responders working hard to keep these communities safe,\" the company said in a press release. \"To support those in need, Airbnb has expanded our Open Home program to allow hosts in surrounding counties an opportunity to help those in need of temporary housing.\"\n\nAn Airbnb spokesperson told Insider that there are 2,300 hosts across California so far who are offering free, temporary housing. Out of those hosts, 570 are in the Los Angeles to help those displaced by the Tick and Getty fires, while the remainder are in Northern California.", "description": "Airbnb has announced its Open Homes program to offer free, temporary housing to disaster victims impacted by the fires raging across California.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9add3e94e8674cd4ea323?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
