I had a payment for an incorrect amount posted for a mutual fund this month. WhenI i called Schwab, they first denied it, then they removed the payment, but never did correct the amount, to the figures posted by the mutual fund company online. Now, I have to call them a third time to find out what they did this time. So far, 5 days later, no payment credited to my account. Whats going here, incompetent employees or outright fraud?", "description": "I noticed there are alot of erroneous dividend postings by various brokers.
