That's putting pressure on people with lower level skills.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 'Antiquities' carved by robots Show all 19 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Wage stagnation has gone on for a long time; skills shortages have been around for a long time. Why hasn't that moved?\u201d'\n\nTo highlight the growing gulf between skills and demand, Hays's annual Talent Mismatch Indicator rose to 6.7 in 2019 compared with 6.6 last year - the highest level since the index began in 2012.\n\nAn overall score of above 5.0 indicates that the labour market is \u201ctighter\u201d than normal.\n\nThe research found that the Asia-Pacific region is particularly striking with the wage gap between low skilled and high skilled workers higher than other areas. In North America there is the biggest gap between sought-after skills and those able to fill roles - leading to higher levels of underemployment.\n\nBut Mr Cox said the UK is \u201cactually one of the world's worst for skills mismatching. For the last three years, businesses have been pretty cautious for hiring... Investment is not being made and businesses are crying out for certainty.\u201d\n\nThe report also suggested that the rise of automation could also impact women-dominated professions, especially retail, with huge numbers of jobs going and not being replaced, as warehouses become more automated and self-service checkouts replace manned ones.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We need to create a society where it's perfectly normal that you will continue upskilling throughout your career.\n\n\u201cHR will think 'there's no point training these people, they'll be off in two years.' But we need to accept that some people will go but we'll get others with skills.\u201d\n\nPart of the issue is the mismatch between boardrooms - where many of those in positions of power have gone a traditional route of working for one company for several years, climbing through the ranks, whilst millennials are more interested in a variety of different jobs, according to Mr Cox.\n\n\u201cThey [millennials] are interested in money, but they're much more interested in the variety and type of work. They are much more willing to do a portfolio of jobs... Locking people into a particular job doesn't wash in today's world.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Wages are flatlining because companies are scrapping swathes of mid-tier positions - replacing them with algorithms\u00a0and cheap offshore labour, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Simon Neville"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/30/12/rejection.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
