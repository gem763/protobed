From September 1st, when the law took effect, to September 12th, judges approved 14 requests for Extreme Risk Protective Orders which allow for firearms to be seized from legal gun owners.\n\n\u201cThat is an extremely high number,\u201d said Alexander Roubian, president of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, who opposes the law. Critics like Roubian have argued that it violates the rights of gun owners by forcing them to relinquish their weapons before they have had a chance to be heard by a judge. \u201cIt\u2019s literally modern-day witch hunt, where you can rat out on your neighbor and their property will be taken away,\u201d he added. The law allows family members or police to make a request to a court that a person\u2019s guns and ammunition be removed because they pose a threat to themselves or public safety.\n\nOne thing we don\u2019t know is how many applications there\u2019ve been. Judges have signed off on 14 orders, but are there any that they\u2019ve rejected? If these judges are approving 100% of the cases brought to them, or close to it, is that a sign that only those that are presenting a clear danger to themselves or others are the subject of these petitions, or could it mean that the judges are simply rubber-stamping any petition they hear?\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey\u2019s Attorney General claims there\u2019s no 2nd Amendment violation taking place when an Extreme Risk Protective Order is granted.\n\n\u201cWe are not violating Second Amendment rights,\u201d said New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal at a public training on the new law Thursday. \u201cWe are just enabling reasonable measures to promote public safety and to make sure we are keeping firearms out of the hands of individuals who shouldn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\nI think General Grewal and I have very different definitions of \u201creasonable\u201d. In fact, the state\u2019s red flag law says a judge can grant an ERPO in an emergency hearing if there is \u201creasonable, probable or good cause\u201d evidence that the subject of the petition is a danger to themselves or others. Legally speaking, that\u2019s a pretty low bar. Ten days later, when the subject of the red flag law goes before the judge for the first time to try and get the order lifted, the deck is stacked against them. Those seeking the order only have to show a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d before the judge will make the order permanent, which basically means the judge just has to think it\u2019s more likely than not that a person is a danger to themselves or others. And in New Jersey, the red flag law is open-ended. It remains in effect until the subject of the order can show by a preponderance of the evidence that they\u2019re not a danger to themselves or others.\n\nI don\u2019t find any of that reasonable, particularly when there is absolutely no concern shown whatsoever for the individual who\u2019s been deemed a threat to themselves or others. The New Jersey law offers no mental health services to the dangerous person, nor does it involve any additional monitoring or intervention from law enforcement. Someone\u2019s deemed to be a dangerous person, the State takes their guns, and then leaves them to their own devices. This is a gun control law masquerading as a mental health proposal.\n\nI spoke with Scott Bach, Executive Director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, who told me that he seems the law as ripe for abuse, with few due process protections and no penalties for fabricating allegations. Bach also told me a legal challenge is in the works:\n\n\u201cI think the chances are 100 percent that we\u2019re going to litigate. The law is plainly unconstitutional in several ways. It\u2019s just a matter of making sure the timing is right. Sometimes you have to wait for the right person for the claim to succeed, but we intend to bring it. We intend to bring the law down.\u201d\n\nBach says he\u2019s aware of several individuals who\u2019ve already been subjected to the law, and says it\u2019s like the state was \u201cchomping at the bit\u201d to try out the new law as soon as possible. I imagine we\u2019ll see someone before long who\u2019s \u201cchomping at the bit\u201d to challenge the law, and the ERPO they were subjected to, as well.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/102/557026b5-0df9-4cb1-9ba4-29f2233d1e61.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
