According to the global coffeehouse chain, the first holiday season drinks of the year are set to arrive on Nov 1, and they have revealed the new beverages will look and taste like Japanese Christmas cakes.\n\nUnlike other countries, Christmas cakes in Japan are actually strawberry shortcakes layered with cream and topped with strawberries, showcasing the red-and-white colors of Christmas, which are also considered lucky for the New Year.\n\nPhoto: Flickr/Nubobo\n\nFor the 2019 holiday season, Starbucks aims to create drinks that help customers enjoy special \u201cmoments\u201d, like the toast at the start of a party, or the instant the lights are turned on at a light-up event or on a Christmas tree.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 first series of festive drinks will recreate the moment you bite into a slice of Christmas cake, as the Merry Strawberry Cake Frappuccino comes filled with beautiful red-and-white layers.\n\nAt the bottom is a \u201csponge cake crumb\u201c, made with a mixture of shortbread and finely crushed sponge cake, and on top of that is a layer of rich strawberry sauce with fresh fruit pulp. A light and airy cake-flavored milk layer makes up the rest of the drink, which is topped with a mound of cream and crunchy strawberry pieces, to create a decadent beverage that tastes just like a strawberry shortcake.\n\nAccompanying the Frappuccino is the Merry Strawberry Cake Milk, a beverage that\u2019s said to taste like \u201ceating a Christmas cake with a glass of hot milk\u201d. This one contains a sweetly tart strawberry sauce with fruit pulp, which partners perfectly with the steamed milk and rich whipped cream topping to create a mellow strawberry shortcake flavor.\n\nThe Merry Strawberry Cake Frappuccino will be available in a tall size only for 590 yen plus tax, while the Merry Strawberry Cake Milk will be sold in Short through to Venti sizes from 450-570 yen, plus tax.\n\nBoth new beverages will be available at Starbucks stores around the country from Nov 1 \u2014 the day after the Halloween Red Night and Dark Night Frappuccino party ends \u2014 and will be on the menu until Nov 21.\n\nSource: Starbucks Japan\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- We try the new Halloween Masquerade Party drinks from Starbucks Japan\n\n-- Starbucks Japan unveils new Pistachio Christmas Tree Frappuccino drinks for the holiday season\n\n-- Starbucks Japan unveils new White Chocolate Snow Frappuccino for Christmas\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/25/starbucks-japan-unveils-new-merry-strawberry-cake-frappuccino-for-christmas-2019/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "With Halloween yet to arrive, and the Night Masquerade Party drinks still on the menu, Starbucks is wasting no time in barrelling full-speed ahead towards Christmas.
