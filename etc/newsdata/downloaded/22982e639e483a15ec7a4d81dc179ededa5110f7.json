The band\u2019s second album had transformed them into a chart-topping, must-see festival act, anchored by singer-guitarist Brittany Howard\u2019s exquisite voice. They quickly earned the admiration of funk and rock heroes across generations. Paul McCartney asked Howard to join him on guitar during Let It Be\u2019s \u201cGet Back\u201d at Lollapalooza, and Prince had the Shakes play Paisley Park, where he stepped in to jam on a 15-minute version of \u201cGimme All Your Love.\u201d All of this was a dream come true for a band that got its start in Athens, a north Alabama town peppered by a constellation of mobile home parks, and played its first show ten years ago in a Decatur rock bar and grill.\n\nBut by 2017, years of touring through Europe, Japan, Canada, South America, and the United States had begun to exhaust the front woman. Work on new music stalled. Howard, now 30, called a meeting with her band to suggest a breather. \u201cWe\u2019d been trying to work for a whole year,\u201d she says, over lemonades and smokes at Brooklyn\u2019s Hoxton Hotel, explaining how the hunt for new Shakes songs turned into her debut solo album, on a muggy September afternoon. \u201cTrying to be creative together, it just wasn\u2019t happening, and I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to step away from this.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo months after agreeing to put the band on hiatus, Howard and her wife and bandmate in the folk trio Bermuda Triangle, Jesse Lasfer, left their home in Nashville and set off on a road trip, criss-crossing the United States in search of a new place to settle down. Free from obligations and distractions in Music City, Howard felt renewed. \u201cOnce I kind of gave up trying to write,\u201d she explains, \u201cthen I could write.\u201d\n\nThe result is Jaime, a short, sweet album that spins further away from straight-up rock and roll than the singer\u2019s flagship band would dare by switching up instrumentation, arrangements, and production techniques to fit the story she\u2019s telling. The playful approach paid off: the album received glowing coverage at Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and elsewhere when it came out last month. \u201cTelling my story just kinda happened,\u201d Howard says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that I did on purpose. It\u2019s just, that\u2019s all I wanted to talk about when I was writing this record.\u201d\n\nTrying to be creative together, it just wasn\u2019t happening, and I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to step away from this.\u2019\n\nThe palpable feeling of otherness in a small town is one of the sources of Jaime\u2019s power. Howard was first inspired looking out at America on the road, faced with our divisive reality. \u201cWhen you\u2019re driving around like that, you really find out who you are, especially being black and in a same-sex relationship in a small town in middle-of-nowhere America,\u201d she says. \u201cYou gotta watch your own back.\u201d \u201cGeorgia\u201d depicts a budding same-sex crush from the perspective of a girl yearning for the attention of a classmate. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wish I had a song like that,\u201d says Howard, who grew up in a trailer park in north Alabama. \u201cTo be represented by someone who thinks more like me, [rather] than being represented by these giant images in the media, like, \u2018This is what it looks like to be gay\u2026\u2019 I don\u2019t look anything like that.\u201d\n\nAfter ping-ponging between Nashville and the West Coast, songwriting commenced in earnest in Topanga Canyon. (The couple currently resides in New Mexico alongside five adorable, excitable pets who occasionally steal the show on Howard\u2019s personal Instagram page.) Jaime\u2019s other source of strength is its namesake, Howard\u2019s older sister, who passed away at 13 after contracting retinoblastoma, a rare children\u2019s eye cancer. During her break from the Shakes, Howard began writing a memoir on Lasfer\u2019s suggestion. She put it on hold once she started recording music again, but revisiting childhood as an adult lit a spark. Ask Howard about the dedication in her album\u2019s title, and she\u2019ll tell you Jaime is not a tribute but a collaboration with an essence she still feels close to. \u201cJust because someone\u2019s not here in the physical world doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not here,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery step of the way, my sister\u2019s been here. So, to me it\u2019s a team effort. I know she sees what I do, for sure.\u201d\n\nBrittany and Jamie as kids.

The early years were full of music and discovery. \u201cWhen we came into the world, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy sister taught me to have fun without having anything, really. We listened to music. We\u2019d make a song. We\u2019d draw pictures. We\u2019d make art. We\u2019d go play outside. She taught me how to use my imagination.\u201d Brittany remembers singing Madonna songs with the family and being turned onto the music of Prince by her father at an early age. As she grew older, Howard began to apply herself to music more seriously, securing the necessary instruments by joining band in middle school. She played her sister\u2019s guitar, borrowed drums from her band director, talked the family into a buying a $50 \u201cpiece-of-shit bass,\u201d scored an amp from a rich kid in the area, and produced herself on a computer the family got from the Make-a-Wish foundation.\n\nMusic was an escape as her family struggled to fit into their community. Jaime documents the family\u2019s tensions with their neighbors in \u201cGoat\u2019s Head.\u201d Howard\u2019s mother, a white woman, had two daughters with a black man in a southern community not approving of interracial relationships. Her father once awoke to discover the tires of his car slashed, and a decapitated goat\u2019s head lying in the backseat. During Jaime\u2019s illness, their home burned down, and Howard has often wondered whether it was foul play. After her sister died, Howard\u2019s family stopped going to church. Her parents got divorced. Howard found it difficult to reconcile their misfortunes with the message she heard in church: that God was good. \u201cI changed my mind about God when I was, like, 9 years old,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018He does not exist.\u2019 Like, \u2018Aw man, fuck it. We\u2019re all alone.\u2019\u201d As many queer people in communities of faith do, she also soured on Christianity\u2019s organizational restrictions, particularly the idea that their way of life exists outside of the natural order: \u201cIt was full of shame. It was full of stuff that didn\u2019t make no sense to me.\u201d\n\nJaime\u2019s \u201cHe Loves Me\u201d is about Howard\u2019s journey back faith on her own terms. \u201cMy mom had all these spiritual books lying around,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI picked up on different religions I had never heard of, Buddhism, Hinduism, ancient Sumerian texts \u2026 That\u2019s how I got on the road to finding God again, through realizing that, in a very intimate relationship between you and your maker \u2026 nobody really comes in between that.\u201d\n\nJaime might not be Howard\u2019s most personal album \u2014 she similarly wrote about love and lust with the Alabama Shakes \u2014 but it is her most autobiographical and the most expressive of her wide-ranging tastes. It reveals another side of the singer musically. Songs like \u201cHe Loves Me,\u201d which the Shakes might\u2019ve imagined as explosive hard rock, lean harder into the funk, soul, and gospel music that define Howard\u2019s taste. (Her favorite performers of all time are Prince, Nina Simone, Nat King Cole, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.) Howard is cagey about the future of the Shakes. \u201cIt feels really good to not have to secede to anyone else\u2019s ideas \u2014 which is great, I don\u2019t mind doing that,\u201d she muses. \u201cBut this is a lot more thrilling. Making my own mistakes, not having to drag anybody in it with me.\u201d Still, like any great soul artist, she remembers her roots. Later that evening, during a Q&A session at the record store Rough Trade, a fan from down south delivered the news that Egan\u2019s, a Tuscaloosa bar the Shakes used to play at the top of the decade, is now a \u201cshitty sports bar.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t pay us,\u201d Howard recalls, \u201cbut they believed in us.\u201d", "description": "Brittany Howard on her debut solo album \u2018Jamie,\u2019 being a queer biracial woman in the south, and the future of the Alabama Shakes.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/magazine/26-brittany-howard.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
