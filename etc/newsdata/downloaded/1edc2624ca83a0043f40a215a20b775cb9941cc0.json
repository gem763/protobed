Luckily, no loss of life reported.\"\n\nWith its maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph) and gusts up to 220 mph, Dorian tied the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever to come ashore, equaling the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, before the storms were named.\n\nThere were indications that the slow-moving Dorian would veer sharply northeastward after passing the Bahamas and track up the U.S. Southeast seaboard. But authorities warned that even if its core did not make U.S. landfall, the potent storm would likely hammer the coast with powerful winds and heavy surf.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ordered a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast of the state amid Dorian's threat. The order, which covers about 830,000 people, goes into effect at noon Monday, when state troopers will begin reversing lanes so they all head inland on major coastal highways.\n\nAnastacia Makey, 43, far right, looks at her phone as she and her family sits on cots with other residents inside a church that was opened up as a shelter as they wait out Hurricane Dorian in Freeport on Grand Bahama, Bahamas, Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019.

That storm did not make landfall at the strength.\n\n\"Catastrophic conditions\" were reported in Abaco, with a storm surge of 18-23 feet, and Dorian was expected to cross Grand Bahama later in the day \"with all its fury,\" the center said. The hurricane was moving to the west at 5 mph (7 kph).\n\nIn the northern stretches of the archipelago, hotels closed, residents boarded up homes and officials hired boats to move people to bigger islands.\n\nVideo that Jibrilu and government spokesman Kevin Harris said was sent by Abaco residents showed homes missing parts of their roofs, downed power lines and smashed and overturned cars. One showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of an unidentified town at nearly the height of a car roof.\n\nIn some parts of Abaco, \"you cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins,\" said Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.\n\nAccording to the Nassau Guardian, he called it \"probably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people.\"\n\nWomen sit on cots inside a church now serving as a shelter for residents who will wait out Hurricane Dorian in Freeport on Grand Bahama, Bahamas, Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019.

Dozens ignored evacuation orders, officials said.\n\n\"The end could be fatal,\" said Samuel Butler, assistant police commissioner. \"We ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety.\"\n\nBahamas radio station ZNS Bahamas reported a mother and child in Grand Bahama called to say they were sheltering in a closet and seeking help from police.", "description": "McLEAN'S TOWN CAY, Bahamas (AP) \u2014 Hurricane Dorian struck the northern Bahamas as a catastrophic Category 5 storm Sunday, its record 185 mph winds ripping off roofs, overturning cars and tearing down power lines as hundreds hunkered down in schools, churches and shelters.
