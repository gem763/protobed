The parole was to give him a chance to appear for a citizenship interview.\n\nAnalysts had been curious to see how the Trump administration would handle the case.\n\nWould-be citizens must prove they are of good moral character. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is usually very relaxed about these cases, but it was an open question whether the Trump administration would apply a stricter reading of the law.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
