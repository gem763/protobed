The government classifies drones as aircrafts, making FAA certification necessary.\n\nMatthew Sweeney, founder and CEO of Nevada-based drone delivery company Flirtey, credited the Trump administration for recently selecting a handful of \u201cpublic-private partnerships across the country to fast-track for regulatory approval \u2014 we were really privileged to be one of those,\u201d he told told Yahoo Finance during a recent interview.\n\nSpecifically, Sweeney said Trump wanted to give a boost to American companies in an effort to \u201cwin this industry.\u201d\n\nChinese ecommerce giant JD is also pursuing a plan to use drones for delivery purposes.\n\nFlirtey says its new technology helps deliver packages to customer homes in less than 10 minutes (Courtesy: Flirtey) More\n\n\u201cSince being picked in that program, we\u2019ve already received regulatory approval for a remote pilot to fly beyond the visual line of sight, to fly at night and for a remote pilot to fly up to ten \u2018Flirtey Eagles\u2019 at the same time,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Flirtey Eagle operates in 95% of weather conditions and \u201cenables point-to-point delivery\u201d to race past the competition, according to Sweeney.\n\nDelivery \u2018in 10 minutes or less\u2019\n\nIn addition to The Flirtey Eagle, The Flirtey Portal is a takeoff and landing platform that allows scalable operations from stores across the country.\n\nAccording to Flirtey, both products \u2014 along with the company\u2019s FAA-approved autonomous software \u2014 helps deliver packages to customer homes in just 10 minutes or less.\n\nThat\u2019s an important goal, as the startup looks to compete with Amazon, UPS, and others entering the space.\n\n\u201cWe hired the head of NASA\u2019s drone program, we\u2019ve got engineers from Space X, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA),\u201d he said. \u201cWe have built an aviation-grade delivery drone that can achieve the highest levels of aviation safety,\u201d Sweeney explained, touting their safety protocols.\n\nFlirtey is on track to start routine drone delivery demonstrations in the fourth quarter of this year, with a goal of flying to homes nationwide in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe view a future where anything that a customer wants delivered to their home can be delivered on-demand through Flirtey,\u201d Sweeney concluded.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:", "description": "President Trump 'fast-tracked' the drone delivery industry, according to one executive, as Amazon, UPS and others enter the space.", "authors": ["Alexandra Canal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YCHCYmWI9vTithdmRdAufw--~B/aD0xNzkxO3c9Mjc1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/e59eb4a0-954b-11e9-a6fd-5403ab0067db", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
