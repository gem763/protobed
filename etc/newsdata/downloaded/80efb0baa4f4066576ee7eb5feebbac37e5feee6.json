He says he identifies as both mixed-race and black, but he knows society views him solely as a black man.\n\n\u2018My mum is Austrian and is of Czech and German heritage. My dad is Ghanaian, specifically from the Ashanti region,\u2019 Adu tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Both my parents were the first in their families to settle in the UK. They both came to London in the early 70s and have seen London change through the generations.\n\n\u2018My mum came to study art and felt London, especially at that time, was the place for her to freely express her creativity. My dad was a poet and a musician who integrated himself into the early Black-British art and cultural movements.\n\n\u2018When I talk about my family history, both strands feel completely different.\n\n\u2018My mum comes from a creative family, my dad comes from a traditional Ghanaian background.\n\n\u2018Being a young, black kid with an Afro in suburban Vienna \u2013 I stood out\u2019 (Picture: Jerry Syder for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018Both histories have fascinating stories and figures to draw inspiration from, whether that be hearing stories of my Grandmother walking for six-weeks from what is now the Czech Republic to Vienna after WW2 with just a suitcase, or about my rich family history in Kumasi, Ghana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I can probably count on one hand the number of people I\u2019ve met in my life with the exact same mix as me \u2013 not that I ask every mixed-race person \u201cwhere are you really from?\u201d.\n\n\u2018That said, I feel being both from West Africa and central Europe is now increasingly more common.\u2019\n\nAdu says that when he was younger, he felt the internal friction of his mixed heritage a lot more; he puts it down to figuring out who he was. But he says growing up in London helped to accelerate the rate of his own self-acceptance.\n\n\u2018My mum came to study art and felt London, especially at that time, was the place for her to freely express her creativity\u2019 (Picture: Adu Lalouschek)\n\n\u2018I was exposed to many different cultures and had an appreciation for the breadth of different identities,\u2019 Adu tells us.\n\n\u2018As a kid, I used to visit my Grandmother in Vienna twice a year, and while I loved visiting our family there, being a young, black kid with an Afro in suburban Vienna \u2013 I stood out.\n\n\u2018At school in London, even though my first name is Adu, many people were shocked when I told them I was Ghanaian. Many assumed that I was of Afro-Carribean heritage and would always ask how my parents met.\n\n\u2018As I\u2019ve grown older, the way I view identity has evolved and I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019ll never be able to summarise myself in one word or phrase and that\u2019s okay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If I were to try to now, I guess I could say I\u2019m a Ghanaian-Austrian filmmaker, who was born in Vienna but is as London as they come. Try that for small talk.\u2019\n\nAdu has always struggled with the question of which side he feels more closely aligned to. He doesn\u2019t feel comfortable picking \u2018sides\u2019 and finds it frustrating that he is expected to.\n\n\u2018Another way to look at this,\u2019 Adu says, \u2018is that whenever someone asks me where I\u2019m from, my response is \u201cLondon\u201d. If probed further I would say Ghanaian-Austrian. I\u2019m not one without the other.\n\n\u2018My whole life I\u2019ve been aware of myself as black, and my experiences tie into that\u2019 (Picture: Adu Lalouschek)\n\n\u2018I do, however, identify as black and feel a strong connection within the black British community. That\u2019s because my whole life I\u2019ve been aware of myself as black, and my experiences tie into that.\u2019\n\nAs a teenager in London, Adu was stopped and searched by the police on a number of occasions, and he says it had a direct impact on his formative years, and how he saw himself in the world.\n\nA study earlier this year found that black people in England and Wales are 40 times more likely to be stopped and searched by police. The figures were released after home secretary Sajid Javid recently made the controversial powers easier for police to use.\n\n\u2018When I\u2019d hear the police talking on the radio and refer to me as \u201cIC3\u201d or \u201cyoung black male\u201d there was no ambiguity to how I was viewed in society,\u2019 explains Adu. But he also says this isn\u2019t the only way he relates to being black.\n\n\u2018As a creative, my work is influenced by my experience and varied upbringing\u2019 (Picture: Adu Lalouschek)\n\n\u2018I have so many positive experiences for how my blackness has shaped the way I view the world, and being mixed-race goes hand-in-hand with who I am today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As a creative, my work is influenced by my experience and varied upbringing. If anything, being mixed has been an asset to me.\u2019\n\nAlongside the benefits of being mixed, Adu, like a lot of mixed-race people, experienced an element of internal conflict when he was younger \u2013 he had to do some work to come to terms with his identity, but he realises this is a consequence of the problematic ways society understands race.\n\n\u2018I dealt with racism in white society and the privilege of having lighter skin within the black community,\u2019 says Adu. \u2018I always had a nuanced understanding of how identity and privilege shift, depending on your environment.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met someone from a minority background who hasn\u2019t experienced racism at some point in their life; be that overt or covert.\n\n\u2018We live in a majority white society that is still coming to terms with its minority population. You can see that with issues like Brexit and the Windrush scandal. I am also fortunate to live in the melting pot of London, where MLE (Multi-Cultural London English) is the predominant language of the younger generation.\u2019\n\nAdu says that one of his goals is to use his professional position to be able to improve levels of diversity, particularly within media \u2013 which is still an overwhelmingly white workforce, even in London.\n\n\u2018My parents are from two different continents, but my experiences have also been greatly informed by being from London\u2019 (Picture: Adu Lalouschek)\n\nAs part of that journey, Adu is making documentaries about Ghana, his father\u2019s birthplace, and discovering the links to his lineage at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Going to Ghana for the first time as a teenager and re-connecting with my heritage completely changed my viewpoint on everything,\u2019 says Adu. \u2018I intuitively understood what returning to my father\u2019s homeland would mean for my identity; I felt whole.\n\n\u2018Making documentaries in Ghana about everyday people and their lives, was a way for me to help others to connect to their background and see Ghana in an authentic light.\u2019\n\nAuthenticity is important to Adu, as is individualism. He doesn\u2019t want to be lumped into a collective group. He tells me that he wants people to understand that his mixed heritage is unique to him, and him alone.\n\n\u2018Although I can empathise with the experiences of other dual-heritage people, we don\u2019t necessarily share the same background or life experiences,\u2019 he explains. \u2018My parents are from two different continents, but my experiences have also been greatly informed by being from London.\n\n\u2018I might have more in common with my Asian friend in Bethnal Green than I do with a Jamaican-Irish person who I\u2019ve just met.\n\n\u2018Identity is important to acknowledge, and I am proud of difference, but people can\u2019t be so easily put into boxes.\u2019\n\nMixed Up Being mixed-race is so much more than just black and white (Pictures: Jerry Syder) Mixed Up is our weekly series that gets to the heart of what it means to be mixed-race in the UK today. Going beyond discussions of divided identity, this series takes a look at the unique joys, privileges and complexities that come with being mixed-race - across of variety of different contexts. The mixed-race population is the UK's fastest-growing ethnic group, and yet there is still so much more to understand about the varied lived experiences of individuals within this hugely heterogenous group. Each week we speak to the people who know exactly how it feels to navigate this inbetween space.\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Friends tell me I\u2019m not \u201cblack enough\u201d but I won\u2019t change who I am\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018You don\u2019t have to be white to be English \u2013 I\u2019m proud to represent modern England\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me to pick a side \u2013 I am mixed-race, so I am both\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Adu's parents are Austrian and Ghanaian, but says who he is has been shaped by growing up in London - he says the world sees him as black.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris", "Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88981088_1572424223.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
