The world seemingly can\u2019t get enough of high-performance German luxury cars. Audi Sport, for example, plans to double its output by 2023.\n\nIts latest creation is the Audi RS7 Sportback, an ultra-heated version of the second-generation A7 five-door hatch/sedan which was released in Australia late last year.\n\nThe 4-litre twin-turbo V8 delivers the goods; the rear steering system and other features help maintain stability.\n\nThe new RS7 can take five occupants (one more than before) at speeds of up to 305 km/h. More dramatic than its top speed is the rapidity with which it ramps up its pace.\n\nWe picked up an example at Frankfurt airport and, within about 10 minutes, hit a non-restricted segment of a billiard table-smooth autobahn. The 120 km/h allowed until then felt like a cantor and, with a mighty V8 roar, in what seemed like no time at all, we were exceeding 250. Most roads can feel a little narrow at those speeds, but the car itself remained rock solid and would have happily kept accelerating if not for the clusters of traffic we kept catching.\n\nWhich sort of tells you that even in Germany you can rarely reach this car\u2019s potential, while in Australia\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t test the claim, but an engineer told me it is safe to do a hasty double-lane change at 300 km/h.\n\nThe car\u2019s normal top speed is electronically limited to 250. It\u2019s the optional \u201cdynamic package plus\u201d with carbon-ceramic brakes and other upgrades that unlocks the 305 speed, and a large number of Australians ticked that box with the previous model.\n\nLike almost all German high-performance cars, the RS7 is majestic under heavy braking, which is an imperative if you are storming down autobahns.\n\nDue to reach its first Australian customers in mid-2020, it is differentiated by an aero bodykit and other exterior enhancements. The guards have been flared to accommodate wider wheels (that wasn\u2019t the case on the previous model) and, for the first time with any RS, there are different door skins to the donor car. These have a prominent ridge along them which serves to pull the visual weight down and give the car a lower, longer look. The same treatment has been given to the RS7\u2019s A6-wagon based RS6 stablemate, due here about the same time.", "description": "If you need to transport five people at five kilometres a minute, the RS7 Sportback is for you.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2242%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/95ddd1894daa3c03d089572ebaa05c3a1e74b67a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
