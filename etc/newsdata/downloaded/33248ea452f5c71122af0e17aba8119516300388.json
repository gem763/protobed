A report emerged on Thursday indicating that the puberty-blocking drug Leuprolide Acetate (Lupron) has resulted in tens of thousands of serious \u201cadverse reactions\u201d in patients, including more than six thousand deaths. That\u2019s bad enough, but it\u2019s even more significant when you consider that this is one of the drugs being administered by doctors to so-called \u201ctransgender children\u201d to unnaturally prevent their normal sexual development. And the testing done on the drug by the FDA for such applications appears to be thin at best. (Daily Wire)\n\nMore than 6,300 adults have died from reactions to a drug that is used as a puberty blocker in gender-confused children, Food & Drug Administration data reportedly shows. \u201cBetween 2012 and June 30 of this year, the FDA documented over 40,764 adverse reactions suffered by patients who took Leuprolide Acetate (Lupron), which is used as a hormone blocker. More than 25,500 reactions logged from 2014-2019 were considered \u2018serious,\u2019 including 6,370 deaths,\u201d The Christian Post reported on Thursday. \u201cLupron is being prescribed off-label for use in children who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria despite the lack of formal FDA approval for that purpose,\u201d the outlet explained.\n\nYou can do a search of the FDA\u2019s incident reports here and enter the name of the drug (Lupron) to see their data.\n\nDespite the possible adverse side effects, there are approved uses for Lupron, but it tends to be administered only for serious conditions. It\u2019s useful in treating prostate cancer in men and endometriosis in women. For children, it is sometimes used to treat precocious puberty, a condition where children begin puberty at an unusually early age, but only for a short time.\n\nThe list of potential side effects for the drug is alarming. It includes breast disorders, malignant neoplasms, and psychiatric and nervous disorders. Stop and think about that for a moment. If you have a child that is already so confused that they are questioning their \u201cgender identity\u201d before they\u2019ve even reached the age where their body is dealing with such issues, do you want to give them a drug that can produce psychiatric or nervous disorders?\n\nTo top it all off, the FDA has never formally approved the use of Lupron for treating gender dysphoria in children. Two years ago the agency announced that it was beginning a study of \u201cnervous system and psychiatric events in association with the use of \u2026 a class of drugs including Lupron, in pediatric patients.\u201d We don\u2019t know the results of that study yet.\n\nWhat adults, including transgender individuals, choose to do with their own bodies is their business as long as they\u2019re willing to take responsibility for the results. But the experiments being performed on confused young children who have been convinced that they were somehow born the \u201cwrong gender\u201d are simply monstrous. Blocking the natural arrival of puberty in otherwise healthy children should be considered child abuse and medical malpractice to begin with. All of the questions raised in this report about one of the drugs being administered to do such things makes it all the worse.", "description": "The madness continues", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/prescription.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
