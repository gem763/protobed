He urged that India should permit UNMOGIP to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nThis unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1970 ceasefire violations.\n\nThe deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas is deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws. The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The Indian Deputy HC Gaurav Ahluwalia Tuesday was summoned at Foreign Office to condemn the unprovoked ceasefire violations by Indian forces along the LoC.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/foriegn-office-750x369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
