Links to episodes and full seasons of the Comedy Central show on streaming service Youku are dead, according to the outlet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA message reading \"According to the relevant law and regulation, this section is temporarily not open\u201d reportedly turns up on a \u201cSouth Park\u201d thread on China\u2019s largest discussion platform, Baidu\u2019s Tieba.\n\nThe ban on \u201cSouth Park\u201d content reportedly follows a recent episode entitled \u201cBand in China,\u201d according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIn the episode, Randy gets caught attempting to sell weed in China and is sent to a work camp similar to the \u201cre-education\u201d internment camps in the Xinjiang Province where possibly more than 2 million Muslim minorities have been held.\n\nWhile detained, Randy runs into an imprisoned Winnie the Pooh, an apparent knock on China's decision to heavily censor images of the character, who has been compared to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe episode also depicts characters Stan, Jimmy, Kenny and Butters forming a metal band that becomes so popular that a movie about the group begins production.\n\nHowever, the script is altered to make it more marketable in China like Disney or Marvel movies.\n\n\"Now I know how Hollywood writers feel,\" Stan says at one point while he is watched by Chinese guards.\n\nYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China. #southpark23\n\n\n\nWatch \"Band in China\": https://t.co/GQEQL9ynCs pic.twitter.com/RepekgO3j9 \u2014 South Park (@SouthPark) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cSouth Park\u201d creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone invoked a controversy surrounding the NBA in an \u201cofficial apology to China\u201d posted on the show's Twitter account Monday, writing they \u201cwelcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe too love money more than redeem and democracy,\u201d the note reads. \u201cXi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all \u2026 Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest by bountiful! We good now China?\u201d\n\nThe tweet came after Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey voiced support for the thousands of pro-democracy protesters that have taken to the streets of the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong in recent weeks.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association responded by suspending ties with the Rockets.\n\nMorey deleted his initial tweet. He also later issued a statement on Twitter, saying he did not intend \"to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.\"\n\nThe NBA issued its own statement, saying on Sunday it recognized that Morey's comments \"have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized the NBA\u2019s response, accusing the league of putting money over human rights.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Comedy Central for comment on the reported Chinese ban of \"South Park.\"\n\n--This report was updated at 2:49 p.m.", "description": "\u201cSouth Park\u201d content has reportedly been scrubbed off the internet in China after a controversial episode critical of Chinese censorship and the detention of Muslim minorities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/southpark_comedycentral_100719.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
