Blakeman described how an unremarkable Tuesday morning was violently wrenched into a crisis that forever altered the nation, as well as his own family. He recounted the intensity, professionalism, and service of his colleagues as the terrorist attacks unfolded, the steady leadership and profound compassion of President Bush, and the ultimate sacrifice of his own nephew, Tommy, who was lost that day. When we invoke the term \"never forget,\" it's essential that we recall the heartbreak and sacrifice of 9/11. Keeping those memories fresh and alive requires sharing difficult stories. Listen to our exchange:\n\n#NeverForget requires telling & listening to painful stories. Brad Blakeman was the only WH staffer who lost a relative that day -- his hero nephew, Tommy.\n\n\n\nPlease listen & share, especially w/ those who are too young to remember what 9/11 was like: https://t.co/N9u39jmCfc \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) September 11, 2019\n\n\n\nHere is more information about Thomas Jurgens, who was 26 years old and recently married when he rushed into the burning towers to help others.

Officer Jurgens' uncle, Police Officer Paul Jurgens, of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, was also killed on 9/11 while responding to the scene.\n\nJurgens was instructed to leave the building via radio transmission shortly before his death, and he refused, responding that there were too many people who needed his help.
