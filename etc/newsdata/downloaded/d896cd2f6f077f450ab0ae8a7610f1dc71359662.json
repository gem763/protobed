After Chuck Schumer raised former Defense Secretary James Mattis\u2019s prediction that ISIS forces would grow after U.S. troop withdrawals, Trump called him the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d adding that he wasn\u2019t \u201ctough\u201d enough. Trump also bragged that he successfully \u201ccaptured them in one month,\u201d a timeline for defeating ISIS that was much faster than Mattis\u2019s prediction.\n\nAttempting to downplay the troop withdrawal that directly benefited the interests of Turkey, Syria, ISIS, and Russia, Trump said that the war in Syria was being fought \u201cover land that has nothing to do with us.\u201d The claim echoed the president\u2019s public statement earlier in the day when he called Kurdish forces \u201cno angels\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of sand they can play with \u2026 it\u2019s possibly never going to be very stable.\u201d\n\nTrump also turned his ire on the Democrats in the room, boasting of his high ceiling for loathing: \u201cI hate ISIS more than you do,\u201d he reportedly told Pelosi. He also said he was only in attendance because \u201csomeone wanted this meeting, so I agreed to it.\u201d The White House organized the meeting.\n\nDemocrats ultimately walked out after the president called Nancy Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d On his way out, Trump yelled \u201csee you at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe sparring continued after the meeting: Nancy Pelosi called Trump\u2019s behavior a \u201cvery serious meltdown\u201d and that \u201cwe have to pray for his health\u201d \u2014 a diagnosis that the president quickly shot back her way on Twitter:\n\nNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\nTrump also tweeted a picture of the Speaker in a dominant pose in an attempt to show she\u2019s the \u201cunhinged\u201d pol in the room, though it\u2019s more likely to be remembered, along with her underhand State of the Union clap, as one of the stronger images of the Speaker\u2019s career. Trump, forever unable to read a room, seems not to realize that the faces of his men at the table may reveal just who\u2019s having the \u201cmeltdown.\u201d", "description": "Frustrated by criticism over his decision to remove troops from Syria abandoning Kurdish allies to Turkish forces, Trump reportedly called James Mattis the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and insulted Nancy Pelosi as a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/14/Trump_meltdown.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
