He\u2019s tired of talking about it already.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very confident in our core group,\u201d Kekalainen said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a little aggravated by the doubters, to be honest with you, because it shows disrespect to our core group that brought us all that success we\u2019ve had in the past three years.\u201d\n\nKekalainen decided to go with a strategy of counting on trusted veterans to step up their offensive production along with moving up NHL-ready prospects to help fill the void left by Panarin - who made it clear a year ago he didn\u2019t want to re-sign with the team and subsequently left for the New York Rangers - and Duchene, a trade-deadline rental who signed with Nashville.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to do it by committee,\u201d said Atkinson, who had a career-high 41 goals and 28 assists last season. \u201cHopefully, the guys who get the opportunity seize the moment, step in and step up for us because we\u2019re going to need everyone.\u201d\n\nAlexandre Texier and Emil Bemstrom, both 20, are among the prospects expected to contribute. Texier came to the U.S. at the end of last season, had a short stay in the minors and then showed flashes of what he could do down the stretch for the Blue Jackets. Bemstrom starred in the Swedish professional league and comes to camp amid plenty of hype.\n\n\u201c(Panarin) is a very good player, he\u2019s a game-breaker. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and say that\u2019s a hole,\u201d said coach John Tortorella, who acknowledged he has a chip on his shoulder because of the predictions of doom. \u201cIt just gives other people an opportunity to fill that, and I feel very comfortable where we\u2019re going with some of our young kids.\u201d\n\nKekalainen\u2019s biggest offseason move was adding veteran help with Gustav Nyquist, a top-six forward who had a career-high 22 goals and 38 assists last season with Detroit and San Jose.\n\nReplacing Bobrovsky, a two-time Vezina Trophy winner, is the toughest order. Columbus will give Korpisalo a chance to be the everyday guy. Korpisalo has played well in stretches as Bobrovsky\u2019s backup for the past four seasons. He\u2019ll compete with the flashy 25-year-old Merzlikins, who has been outstanding in the Swiss league and in international play.\n\nPlayers who have been here awhile insist the naysaying will go away if they win.\n\n\u201cWe feel confident with what we have in this room,\u201d All-Star defenseman Seth Jones said. \u201cWe understand what the narrative is probably going to be this year, and I think now more than ever we have to maintain the tight chemistry in this room and not let outside noise interfere with what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Jackets, who got to the second round of the playoffs after a stunning sweep of Tampa Bay in the opening round last spring, will skate together for the first time Saturday free of the drama Panarin and Bobrovsky dragged around all last season after both made it known they didn\u2019t want to stay in Columbus any longer than necessary.\n\n\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have the shiny pieces people like to talk about,\u201d captain Nick Foligno said. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be a lot of headlines, a lot of great plays going on because of the skill we have.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The offseason drama churned up by the exodus of some of their top stars is now behind the Columbus Blue Jackets.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mitch Stacy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/blue_jackets_moving_on_hockey_79953_c0-232-4092-2617_s1770x1032.jpg?fa0cda629ead8c2af7531ad6343bac87c84e9353", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
