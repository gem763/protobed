More divisively, the group and its leaders also have aggressively argued that current immigration levels present a threat to the livelihood of black Americans.\n\nThat framing has rankled many black activists \u2014 some of whom have documented being harassed online by ADOS supporters \u2014 who have long adopted a more Pan-African ideology and see any effort to delineate among various groups of black Americans as having the potential to fuel xenophobia. In interviews, half a dozen activists and academics praised Darity\u2019s work but found themselves perplexed by his willingness to associate with ADOS.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National Which-Americans-Should-Get-Reparations"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
