Folks waited in lines for hours for the device, which starts at $700. The iPhone 11 Pro's base price is $1,000 and the larger iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,100.\n\nOne Australian man was lucky enough to be the first Sydney resident to buy an iPhone 11, and he even got a standing ovation from the Apple Store employees.\n\nCNET news editor Daniel Van Boom captured the moment on video and shared it in a tweet that has since gone viral.\n\nIn the video, the man walks out of the store in front of dozens of cheering employees who filled the store. The gleeful iPhone 11 owner then takes his place right in front of the entrance to flash his iPhone 11 box in one hand and a peace sign with his other.\n\nRead more: The 7 most disappointing features in iOS 13\n\nIn several replies to the video, the internet appeared incredibly disturbed by the entire process.\n\nClapping for purchases of new devices is a timeworn tradition at Apple Stores \u2014 though not one that employees say they particularly enjoy. A 2018 article in The Guardian delved into the concept of the Apple Store and its \"carefully managed drama\":\n\nProducts are clapped, customers waiting overnight to buy them are clapped, their purchases are clapped, claps are clapped. Clap, clap, clap. \"My hands would sting from all the clapping,\" said one manager. Claps, cheers, performances of rapturous engagement provided, by design, a ready-mixed social glue to bind teams together, reaffirming both the character of the brand and employees' cultish devotion to it.\n\nAnd while standing ovations at Apple aren't new, one Twitter user slammed the applause for consumerism as it happened on the same day as the Global Climate Strike, in which as many as 250,000 young people took to Lower Manhattan alone to protest climate change.", "description": "\"This is embarrassing for the entire human race,\" one Twitter user said about the video depicting Apple employees and a very happy iPhone owner.", "authors": ["Rachel Premack"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8643e52e22af2c693105d7-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
