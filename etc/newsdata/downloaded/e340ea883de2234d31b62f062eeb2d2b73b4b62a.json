(Andre Chung for The Washington Post)\n\nCapital One Arena, home of the Capitals, Wizards and Georgetown men\u2019s basketball, is the latest venue to ban backpacks of all sizes. A Monumental Sports and Entertainment spokeswoman said the revised bag policy, which will take effect when the Capitals host the Chicago Blackhawks in their preseason opener on Monday, was mandated by both the NHL and NBA.\n\nIn addition to backpacks, luggage bags, roller bags, hard-sided bags and briefcases of all sizes are prohibited inside Capital One Area, as are bags larger than 14 inches long, 14 inches tall and 6 inches wide. All of those restrictions were in place last season. Adults accompanied by small children are permitted to bring diaper bags into the arena, and exceptions will also be made for fans who use backpacks or other types of bags for medical reasons.\n\nCapital One Arena would like to remind fans of the venue\u2019s security policies for all events including the upcoming @Capitals, @WashWizards and @GeorgetownHoops seasons.\n\n\n\nBeginning this season, backpacks - regardless of size - will be prohibited at the venue. pic.twitter.com/wPa6e11vSm \u2014 Capital One Arena (@CapitalOneArena) September 13, 2019\n\nBaggage restrictions have tightened at sports venues in recent years, with the NFL introducing a clear bag policy in 2018. The San Jose Sharks, Carolina Hurricanes and St. Louis Blues are among the NHL teams going one step further than teams like the Capitals, by implementing clear bag policies at their arenas for the coming season. Bans on backpacks, regardless of size, are increasingly common. Citing safety concerns, the Nationals joined a handful of MLB teams in banning backpacks at Nationals Park this year. Scott Fear, the Nationals\u2019 VP of public safety and security, said the ban would \u201cmake the stadium safer and much more secure, by prohibiting the bag that has the most compartments.\"\n\n[Fancy new scoreboard, SkyRing display coming to Capital One Arena]\n\nThere are no plans to have temporary storage lockers installed outside Capital One Arena on game nights, as is the case at Nationals Park and D.C. United\u2019s Audi Field. In hopes of expediting the entry process, which requires all guests to walk through a metal detector, Capital One Arena will introduce \u201cNo Bag/Express Lines\u201d at the F Street Entrance for fans without bags or bags smaller than 4.5 inches by 6.5 inches.\n\nThe backpack ban isn\u2019t the only change at Capital One Arena this season. Monumental Sports and Entertainment announced Monday that the second phase of renovations to the 22-year-old venue are on track to be completed by the Capitals\u2019 regular season home opener on Oct. 5. While the full capabilities of the new center-hung scoreboard will not be on display during the preseason, Monday\u2019s game should provide fans a first look at the behemoth\u2019s 360-degree continuous video screen and 7,000 total square feet of LED display across eight distinct display area.\n\nPhase II of renovations at @CapitalOneArena are slated for completion for the @Capitals season opener Oct. 5.\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of upgrades are completed and will be in place for the Caps preseason games, several new additions will not make their official debut until Oct. 5. pic.twitter.com/LjZJM58JXs \u2014 Capital One Arena (@CapitalOneArena) September 16, 2019\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nEvgeny Kuznetsov doesn\u2019t need our scorn.
