REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nPrevious governments recognized their responsibility as \u201ckeepers of an extraordinary section\u201d of the planet, including the Great Barrier Reef, Attenborough said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).\n\n\u201cWhat you say, what you do, really, really matters,\u201d he said in an excerpt of the interview released ahead of its broadcast.\n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019ve been upstanding and talking what I see is the truth about what we\u2019re doing to the natural world, and then you suddenly say \u2018No, no, it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t matter how much coal we burn\u2019 ... Then what do you say?\u201d he added.\n\nTens of thousands of young Australians joined millions of people around the world in protests last week to demand political leaders take steps to stop climate change.\n\nAustralia\u2019s last Labor government introduced a 2012 tax on carbon emissions. It would later turn into a cap and trade scheme in a country that is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita due to its reliance on coal-fired power plants.\n\nIt was repealed in 2013 when the current conservative government took power. That same year Australia pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but recent data shows emissions are climbing.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s strong support for the coal industry, including backing a controversial proposed mine by India\u2019s Adani Enterprises, was seen as a key factor in his unexpected election win in May.\n\nMorrison has repeatedly said Australia will meet its climate accord targets, but \u201cat a canter\u201d.\n\nMorrison is on an official visit to the United States and his office did not immediately respond to Attenborough\u2019s remarks. The prime minister did not attend a U.N. climate summit in New York this week, but will address the U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\nIn the interview, Attenborough referred to a 2017 incident when Morrison, then Treasurer, brandished a lump of coal in parliament and told opposition members not to be afraid of it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a joke,\u201d Attenborough said.\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t opening a coal mine, OK, I would agree it\u2019s a joke. But you are opening a coal mine.\u201d", "description": "British naturalist Sir David Attenborough has criticized Australia for changing its rhetoric on climate policy, saying the government's support for new coal mines showed the world it did not care about the environment.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433254572&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0HG", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
