As North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reported,\n\n\"A source tells NPR the drug distributors Amerisource Bergen and McKesson have reached a tentative settlement with at least some state attorneys general, as has the drugmaker Teva. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, is reporting McKesson, Amerisource Bergen and Cardinal Health have reached a tentative national settlement. ... It remains unclear how these last-minute settlements might affect a federal trial set to begin Monday in Ohio.\"\n\nThat trial will be presided over by U.S. District Judge Dan Posner who has been urging the parties to settle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sue Ogrocki/AP Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\nIn another legal development, a state judge in Oklahoma, Thad Balkman, is acknowledging a $107 million error in a recent verdict assigning responsibility for that state's opioid epidemic that has claimed more than 4,000 lives from 2007 to 2017.\n\nIn August, Balkman ruled that drugmaker Johnson and Johnson should pay $572 million for contributing to Oklahoma's opioid crisis after the state sued for $17 billion.\n\nBut the judge said his ruling included $107.6 million for addiction costs when he meant to order a penalty of $107,600.\n\nKGOU's Jackie Fortier reported,\n\n\"His announcement could mean the judgment will be cut. But it's unclear how much Johnson & Johnson will ultimately have to pay Oklahoma \u2014 the judge will rule on other legal objections to his verdict at a later date.\"\n\nA new study by the Society of Actuaries estimates that the opioid epidemic has cost the U.S. economy about $631 billion over the past four years. The study finds that the unrealized lifetime earnings of those who died prematurely due to drug overdoses and health care costs associated with opioid use were the biggest drivers of the economic drag created by the opioid crisis.", "description": "A new study estimates that the opioid epidemic has cost the U.S. economy about $631 billion due to health care costs and the unrealized lifetime earnings of people who died of overdoses.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/15/ap_19288698781236_wide-f0911ede66f0e3b0e66521dc614ca00294a4fec3.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
