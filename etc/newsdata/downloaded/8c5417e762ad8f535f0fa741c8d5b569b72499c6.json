Here are five things you should know about the senator from Massachusetts. USA TODAY\n\nA new national opinion poll conducted by Monmouth University shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as the leading Democratic presidential candidates, though the poll also shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection to be unchanged since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAmong registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, 28% preferred Warren, and 25% preferred Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., came in third place at 15%.\n\nShortly before the poll's release, Sanders was hospitalized after suffering chest discomfort at a campaign event in Las Vegas.\n\n\"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,\u201d said campaign adviser Jeff Weaver.\n\nThe poll shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection among registered voters at 39%, an identical finding to Monmouth's August poll. His approval rating was 43%, and his unfavorable rating was 56%.\n\nBoth South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., polled at 5%.\n\nAuthor and activist Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang polled at 2%.\n\nAll other candidates polled at 1% or less.\n\nThis poll, one of the qualifying polls for the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, does not change the makeup of the debate stage. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and businessman Tom Steyer polled at 1%, and Yang's polled at 2%, all below the 3% debate qualification threshold.\n\nMore: 2020 White House hopeful Bernie Sanders hospitalized after suffering chest pains\n\nMore: Poll: Only 4 in 10 Republicans think Trump mentioned Biden on Ukraine call even though he acknowledged doing so\n\nMonmouth also surveyed voters about the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged pressuring of the Ukranian government to open an investigation into Biden.\n\nAccording to the poll, 43% of registered voters believe Trump's allegation that Biden had interfered in a Ukranian government investigation into his son Hunter Biden's business dealings, though belief in that claim breaks along partisan lines.\n\n67% of Republicans believed Trump's claim, in comparison with 19% of Democrats, and 45% of independents.\n\nMonmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murra argued this finding could spell trouble for the Biden campaign\n\n\"The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,\" said Murray.\n\nThe poll of 434 registered Democratic voters was conducted from Sept. 23-29, with a 4.7 percentage point sampling margin of error.\n\nFor the results about Trump's approval and the Ukraine controversy, Monmouth surveyed 1,018 registered voters, with a 3.1 percentage point sampling of error.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/02/monmouth-poll-shows-biden-and-warren-lead-trump-approval-unchanged/3841442002/", "description": "Among registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, 28% preferred Warren, and 25% preferred Sanders as the Democratic nominee.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published P.M.
