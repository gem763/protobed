Mattis got in some choice jabs at the president at a black-tie dinner, and now we have an excerpt from a forthcoming book about the Trump administration\u2019s Pentagon.\n\nGuy Snodgrass, Mattis\u2019s former chief speechwriter, paints a decidedly unflattering portrait of the commander-in-chief, describing him as having the attention span of a squirrel \u2014 which was particularly evident in a July 2017 meeting between Trump and a handful of Cabinet members.\n\nIt was the president\u2019s first Pentagon briefing about where around the world U.S. forces and embassies are located. And Mattis, alongside then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, was hoping to convince Trump not to withdraw troops from key strategic regions, and to explain the importance of the U.S.\u2019s commitments to certain allies.\n\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t having any of it. Instead of discussing the issues at hand, Snodgrass wrote, Trump was fixated on French President Emmanuel Macron, whom Trump had recently met on a trip abroad.\n\n\u201cI just returned from France,\u201d Trump reportedly said. \u201cDid you see President Macron\u2019s handshake? He wouldn\u2019t let go. He just kept holding on. I spent two hours at Bastille Day. Very impressive.\u201d\n\nTrump then launched into his big ask: a large-scale military parade in the U.S. (His protracted mission to make the parade happen infuriated even members of his own party and leaders in the Pentagon, who wanted the military to remain an apolitical group.)\n\n\u201cI want a \u2018Victory Day.\u2019 Just like Veterans Day. The Fourth of July is too hot. I want vehicles and tanks on Main Street. On Pennsylvania Avenue, from the Capitol to the White House. We need spirit! We should blow everybody away with this parade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe French had an amazing parade on Bastille Day with tanks and everything. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d\n\nSnodgrass added that Trump looked visibly bored when Mattis spent a long time on one particular subject, or used technical jargon.\n\n\u201cFor the remainder of the meeting, Trump veered from topic to topic \u2014 Syria, Mexico, a recent Washington Post story he didn\u2019t like \u2014 like a squirrel caught in traffic, dashing one way and then another,\u201d Snodgrass wrote about the president.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI learned an important lesson that would pay off when Trump returned for a briefing the following January. Only use slides with pictures \u2026 no words.\u201d\n\nOther reporting about the Trump administration has corroborated the idea that Trump doesn\u2019t much like reading.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you can imagine \u2026 Trump won\u2019t read anything \u2014 not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers, nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored,\u201d economic adviser Gary Cohn has reportedly said about Trump.\n\nThe president also reportedly refuses to read daily intelligence briefs that outline the most critical information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThe excerpt comes just a few days after Gen. Mattis mocked Trump in public, at a black-tie dinner in New York, skewering Trump's \"bone-spur\" avoidance of military service and his penchant for round after round of golf. Mattis resigned from his post last December.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019, in Washington.
