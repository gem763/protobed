Not so. Over the break, a dozen more Democrats came out in favor, bringing the number to 131, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler said an impeachment inquiry might begin in late fall, after hearings this month and next.\n\nThe pooh-bahs of the House leadership are proceeding cautiously. One of them rightly told me last week that the worst thing they could do would be to lose an impeachment vote. They need a majority of the House\u2014217 Democrats (plus independent Justin Amash)\u2014which means they must gather at least 87 more commitments by the end of the year. There are currently 235 Democrats.\n\nCan they get there? (Any later than early 2020 and it\u2019s too close to the election). The party line is Democratic members will do their duty and look at the evidence, which Trump is fighting furiously in court to withhold. This argument is partly legit (it\u2019s important to build a public case) but mostly window-dressing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the moderates already know that the man obstructed justice, abuses power every day, and is clearly unfit for office.", "description": "The Senate will acquit the president if the House impeaches him, true. But that\u2019s not a reason not to do it. It\u2019s exactly why they should do it.", "authors": ["Jonathan Alter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565040758/190805-alter-trump-impeach-tease_pnokzb", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
