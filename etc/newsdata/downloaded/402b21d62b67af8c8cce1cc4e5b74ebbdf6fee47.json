Drew Harwell on how Beijing-based TikTok is suspected of censoring the Hong Kong protests. And Maura Judkis takes us into the kitchen with \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star Antoni Porowski.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nThe complications of Trump\u2019s contradictory statements on Iran\n\nSaudi Arabia estimates that damage from the attack on its oil facilities over the weekend has cut production by 50 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen initially claimed responsibility for the attack, the United States dismissed those claims, saying the damage was too extensive and the execution too sophisticated to be done by them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe working assumption among U.S. officials is that Iran was behind it,\u201d says White House reporter Anne Gearan , \u201cbut the United States has not made a 100 percent determination.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. officials are reluctant to unequivocally assign blame directly to Iran. On Twitter, President Trump said that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate against Iran. He then abruptly shifted gears, saying that the United States did not \u201cwant war with anybody.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got competing instincts here,\u201d Gearan says. \u201cAt the same time as the president wants very much to confront a tough adversary with greater toughness, the president also very much wants to negotiate with Iran.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\nHong Kong protests largely absent from Beijing-based TikTok\n\nProtests in Hong Kong are in their 15th week with no sign of abating. Evidence of unrest can be quickly found on social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram. But on the Beijing-based social media app TikTok, Hong Kong protests are almost nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis might be censorship,\u201d says tech reporter Drew Harwell . \u201cThe Chinese government and the Communist Party are extremely heavy-handed in the kind of materials they allow online.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok is one of the most popular mobile apps in the United States and is China\u2019s most successful social media export abroad. But its opacity is igniting fear and suspicion that the company is censoring the pro-democracy protests at the expense of its users and shaping their understanding of world events.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than guacamole\n\nFood writer Maura Judkis takes us into the kitchen to whip up some recipes from \u201cQueer Eye\u201d food star Antoni Porowski\u2019s new cookbook.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Anne Gearan explains the White House\u2019s shifting messaging on Iran.
