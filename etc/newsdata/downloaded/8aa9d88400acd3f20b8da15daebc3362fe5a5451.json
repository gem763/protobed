In legal terms, a boy can therefore not be raped by a woman, and a girl who is sexually abused by a woman cannot be considered a victim of rape. Such sexual transgressions will be regarded as immoral assault (Le Roux 1992: 142)\".\n\nThis definition changed in 2007, when rape was classified as being gender neutral.\n\nThe Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007 also referred to as the Sexual Offences Act) is an act of Parliament that reformed and codified the law relating to sex offences.\n\nThe definition of rape, as defined by the act, is \"any person (A) who unlawfully and intentionally commits an act of sexual penetration with a complainant (B), without the consent of B, is guilty of the offence of rape\".\n\nThe page with the definition is allegedly contained in Unisa's study guide for EDPH0D8 - the Educator in a Pastoral Role.\n\nIn the introduction to the chapter \"Child Abuse: an Educators Guide for the Senior Phase and FET\" wherein the definition is included, it is stated that \"some people do not respect the fundamental rights of others, especially those of women and children, who are usually very vulnerable ... in this learning unit, we deal with the problem of child abuse in our contemporary society and ways to empower the senior phase and FET educator.\n\n\"It is difficult to define the definition of child abuse, as researchers cannot agree on one comprehensive definition,\" it read.\n\nSocial media users expressed outrage at the oversight.\n\nSome called the university a \"disgrace\".", "description": "A University of South Africa (Unisa) study guide drafted by lecturers and published in 2011 has been criticised for its outdated definition of rape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/672/429750328f3d4fa181df4cf156612c94.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
