This is a big win for jobs, 401-K\u2019s, and, frankly, EVERYONE!,' the president wrote on Twitter. 'Our Country is doing great.'\n\nAfter bragging about U.S. Special Forces who killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Trump pronounced America 'stronger than ever before, with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy!'\n\nHe had told reporters Monday morning that he was 'a little bit ahead of schedule,' on the first tranche of trade agreements with Beijing, quickly adding: 'Maybe a lot ahead of schedule.'\n\n'Probably, we'll sign it.

The Federal Reserve is expected to be the latest to follow that trend at its two-day policy meeting beginning on Tuesday, with wide expectations that it will cut interest rates for a third time this year.\n\nTrump was headed to Chicago when he spoke about his China trade deal; there he signed an executive order creating a commission to study the administration of justice\n\n'It just seems like the things that would disrupt the rally \u00ad\u2013 tightening monetary policy \u00ad\u2013 off the table. Some kind of big battle with the Chinese seems to be off the table, some kind of political upheaval seems be off the table,' said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.

Still, third-quarter earnings are expected to show a decline of 2%.\n\nInvestors are waiting for earnings from heavyweights this week such as Apple Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Merck &Co Inc.\n\nChipmakers, which have acted as a proxy for trade tensions with China, gained 1.67%.
