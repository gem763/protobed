In recent years, some courts have read that language to include discrimination against LGBT people as a subset of sex discrimination.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court appointee, said there are strong arguments favoring the LGBT workers. But Gorsuch suggested that maybe Congress, not the courts, should change the law because of the upheaval that could ensue. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of judicial modesty,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nDavid Cole, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing fired transgender funeral home director Aimee Stephens, said the situation at the court itself showed such concerns were overblown.\n\n\u201cThere are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men\u2019s room and the court\u2019s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen,\u201d Cole said.\n\nTwo other conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, did not squarely indicate their views, although Roberts questioned how employers with religious objections to hiring LGBT people might be affected by the outcome.\n\nThe first of two cases involved a skydiving instructor and a county government worker in Georgia who were fired for being gay. The second case involves transgender people, and the audience in the courtroom included Stephens, transgender actor Laverne Cox and some people who had waited in line since the weekend for Tuesday\u2019s arguments.\n\nThe Trump administration and lawyers for the employers hit hard on the changes that might be required in bathrooms, locker rooms, women\u2019s shelters and school sports teams if the court were to rule that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 covers LGBT people. Lawmakers, not unelected judges, should change the law, they argued.\n\n\u201cSex means whether you\u2019re male or female, not whether you\u2019re gay or straight,\u201d Noel Francisco, Trump\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer said.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, a conservative, seemed to agree with that argument, saying Congress in 1964 did not envision covering sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to change the meaning of \u2018sex,\u2019\u201d Alito said. Justice Clarence Thomas, who returned to the bench Tuesday after staying home sick the day before, said nothing, as is his custom.\n\nAlito pressed Pamela Karlan, the Stanford University law professor representing the gay employees, about whether an employer who refused to hire a qualified candidate who was gay without knowing the candidate\u2019s gender was guilty of sex discrimination.\n\n\u201cSo this is Saturday Night Live Pat, as an example, right?\u201d Karlan said.\n\nAlito replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not familiar with that.\u201d\n\nKarlan obliged. \u201cYou can never tell whether Pat is a man or a woman,\u201d she explained.\n\nKarlan said repeatedly that such a case is merely hypothetical, but eventually conceded it would not qualify as sex discrimination.\n\nIf the votes of some conservative justices seemed in doubt, the liberals\u2019 views were clear.\n\n\u201cAnd we can\u2019t deny that homosexuals are being fired merely for being who they are,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. \u201cAt what point do we say we have to step in?\u201d\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out that the term sexual harassment was unknown in 1964, but now is considered sex discrimination.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan suggested sexual orientation is a clear subset of sex discrimination, saying that a man who loves other men cannot be treated differently by an employer than a woman who loves men.\n\nThe cases are the court\u2019s first on LGBT rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement and replacement by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative.\n\nA decision is expected by early summer 2020, amid the presidential election campaign.\n\nA ruling for employees who were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity would have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don\u2019t protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBT people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school.\n\nThe Trump administration has changed course from the Obama administration and now supports the employers in arguing that the civil rights law\u2019s Title 7 does not prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status.\n\nDuring the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe Trump administration and the employers say Congress could easily settle the matter by amending Title 7 to include LGBT people. Legislation to that effect is pending in Congress, but is not likely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nBut the workers contend, and the lower courts that have ruled for them have reasoned, that the law as it stands plainly covers sexual orientation and gender identity because discrimination against them is based on generalizations about sex that have nothing to do with their ability to do their jobs.\n\nThey also argue that they were fired for not conforming to sex stereotypes, a form of sex discrimination that the Supreme Court recognized 30 years ago.", "description": "The court's decision in the employment discrimination case is expected by early summer 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d07fb2100003d07ac7b4f.jpeg?cache=dtyprp38nm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
