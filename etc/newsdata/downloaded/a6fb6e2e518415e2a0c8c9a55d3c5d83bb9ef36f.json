A landmark report by the International Energy Agency lays bare the extraordinary maturation of an industry which until recently was believed could only ever be a bit-player in the energy mix.\n\nBut an enormous fall in the price of constructing offshore wind farms, combined with improving technology and the germination of pockets of political will, means the planet is witnessing the tipping point at which the slide towards clean energy becomes an economic certainty.\n\nDespite the UK being described as a \u201chostile environment\u201d for renewables just last year, the IEA notes that even without strong government support, Britain is leading the charge towards offshore wind power generation \u2013 although that lead is set to be taken by China within six years.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Wind power is getting cheaper, and new expenses are cropping up with fossil fuel extraction \u2013 as investors increasingly divest from dirty power. Association with environmentally unfriendly practices is becoming more toxic in a global population increasingly concerned about climate change.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the shift can provide considerable business opportunities for existing fossil fuel players. This means instead of competing with the renewables sector, oil and gas companies are in a position to deploy their offshore expertise.\n\nAccording to the IEA, around 40 per cent of the lifetime costs of an offshore wind project, including construction and maintenance, \u201chave significant synergies\u201d with the offshore oil and gas sector. This part of the renewables sector is estimated to be worth more than $400bn (\u00a3310bn) in Europe and China over the next two decades.\n\nThis is just one way money is now inexorably moving into renewable energy generation.\n\nEarlier this year, the IEA revealed global investment in coal had tumbled by 75 per cent in three years, and a year before, the organisation noted: \u201cIt appears that banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, utilities and other operators in advanced economies are exiting the coal business.\u201d\n\nFracking, which has provided a massive amount of energy in the US, is hitting powerful opposition in the UK, and with government support for electric boilers and heat pumps in homes set to impact gas demands, it is increasingly looking like a doomed venture.\n\nSolar power is also seeing a huge boom. In just five years, the world\u2019s solar capacity is expected to grow by 600 gigawatts \u2013 almost double the total electricity capacity of Japan, according to the IEA.\n\nIn total, renewable energy capacity is forecast to grow by 1,200 gigawatts by 2024 \u2013 equivalent to the total electricity capacity of the US.\n\nBut the headway being made in renewable capacity can provide camouflage for environmentally unsound practices by major players in the energy sector. Investment in clean energy by fossil fuel firms and governments provides a unique opportunity to point to the good being done, and obscure the continuing damage being done to the planet.", "description": "Wind \u2013 you can\u2019t see it, but that invisible blustery stuff is going to be powering us into the end of the 21st century and beyond.\u00a0A landmark report by the International Energy Agency lays bare the extraordinary maturation of an industry which until recently was believed could only ever be a bit-player in the energy mix.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/18/offshore-win.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
