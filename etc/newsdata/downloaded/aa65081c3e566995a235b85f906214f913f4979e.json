(Photo: Mark Henle/USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nIt\u2019s been a big week for the USA TODAY NETWORK with journalism awards season in full swing. The Arizona Republic and USA TODAY NETWORK won a prestigious Scripps Howard Award, and the NETWORK announced the winners of its annual \u201cBest of the USA TODAY NETWORK\u201d for 2017.\n\nThe Scripps Howard Foundation\u2019s 65th competition recognized the most impactful journalism of 2017 for work in 15 categories. The Arizona Republic and the USA TODAY NETWORK won the innovation award for its multi-media report \u201cThe Wall: Unknown Stories, Unintended Consequences.\u201d The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, another member of the USA TODAY NETWORK, was named a finalist in the business/financial reporting category for its \u201cMexico Blackouts\u201d investigation. The Arizona Republic and USA TODAY Network will be presented with the innovation award, along with $10,000 in prize money, at a ceremony on April 19 in Cincinnati that will be livestreamed on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nThe \"Best of the USA TODAY NETWORK\" awards honor top-notch journalism demonstrative of the NETWORK\u2019s meaningful impact in communities across the country. An impressive panel of judges \u2013 subject matter experts who also are decorated journalists, educators and thought leaders \u2013 selected winners in eight categories: public service/watchdog, writing, photo, video, consumer engagement, digital storytelling, breaking news, and voice/opinion. This year\u2019s award winners underscored the important role of journalism in American society, even during a challenging time for news, and exemplify the very mission of NETWORK.\n\nHere are some highlights of the NETWORK projects honored this week:\n\nThe Arizona Republic and USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s multi-platform project \"The Wall: Unknown Stories, Unintended Consequences,\u201d which examined President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, won both a NETWORK award for video and a Scripps Howard Award for innovation. More than 30 NETWORK reporters and photographers spent six months exploring life along the nearly 2,000-mile border, and their groundbreaking reporting was bolstered by immersive technology, including aerial and 360-degree video, virtual reality, bots, drones, documentaries, photos, podcasts, and LiDAR data. The report was published at a crucial time when Congress was considering funding for a border wall, and its in-depth look at the border continues to inform policy discussions among government representatives, as well as voters. \"The Arizona Republic and the USA Today Network strategically used innovative techniques \u2013 360 video, drones, virtual reality \u2013 to support the journalism and enhance the audience's understanding of the subject matter. \u2026 The result is a playbook of emerging best practices designed to maximize the potential audience,\u201d said the judges of the Scripps Howard Award.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel won in the NETWORK\u2019s public service/watchdog category and was named a Scripps Howard Award finalist in the business/financial reporting category for its investigation into blackouts at Mexican resorts. The investigation, led by reporter Raquel Rutledge, began with the death of a Wisconsin college student in a swimming pool and exposed a broader problem of vacationers consuming tainted alcohol in Mexico. The investigation found indifferent responses to cases by Mexican authorities and questionable handling by the U.S. State Department, prompting an investigation of the State Department. The Journal Sentinel also revealed that TripAdvisor had blocked warnings about blackout cases at Mexican resorts, leading the Federal Trade Commission to review the company\u2019s business practices. \u201cThis is dogged, persistent reporting at its finest,\u201d said the NETWORK judges. \u201cThe reporting leveraged the scope of USA TODAY and the network to find more than 100 such cases. This is a vitally important investigation, built one story at a time.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY and Naples Daily News tied with the Journal Sentinel for first place in the NETWORK\u2019s public service/watchdog category for the network-wide investigation into the exploitive truck leases used by short-haul trucking companies at California ports. Led by Daily News reporter Brett Murphy, the investigative series revealed how port trucking companies took advantage of poor drivers, many of them immigrants, and explored how retail giants like Amazon and Walmart benefited from these trucking companies. House Democrats subsequently proposed The Port Drivers\u2019 Bill of Rights Act of 2017 to identify work standards for port truckers and the Clean Ports Act of 2017 to loosen federals restrictions that prevent cities from regulating trucking companies. \u201cThe \u2018Rigged\u2019 series avoids a simplistic good-versus-bad tone. Instead, it sets the problem in the context of regulations requiring newer trucks, the influence of Big Box retailers and Amazon, and all of our desires for ever-cheaper goods,\u201d said the judges. \u201cThis is nuanced reporting showing the human consequences of a complex global economy.\u201d\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer earned second place in the NETWORK\u2019s video category for a week-long inspection of the heroin crisis in Cincinnati, led by photographers Carrie Cochran and Meg Vogel. The judges described the video, which spotlighted 180 ODs and 18 deaths in 1 week, as \u201ca powerful examination enhanced by sturdy narration, haunting police dispatch audio and a range of people affected by the same problem.\u201d They said, \u201cEmotional interviews smartly bolstered by day-by-day data about overdoses and deaths help humanize a confounding issue.\u201d\n\nTo see the full list of the winners of the 2017 USA TODAY NETWORK journalism awards and to learn more about the projects, please read the official announcement.
