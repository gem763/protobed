However, he has continued his career in the G League and has found a lot more success.\n\nAfter averaging 14.3 points and 6.7 rebounds in 2017-18, he posted 12.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game last year with the Agua Caliente Clippers, an affiliate of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he shot 43.3 percent from three-point range (143-of-330) over the past two years after struggling to a 26.1 percent mark during his time in the NBA.\n\nHis improved shooting could help him get another chance on the big stage, although he will first need to stay healthy.", "description": "The road back to the  NBA  just got harder for  Anthony Bennett  as the 2013 No. 1 pick will undergo  arthroscopic surgery on his sore left knee, according to  Jonathan Feigen  of the  Houston Chronicle ...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/831/136/hi-res-09f3eabb30808737003f4cda91a06877_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
