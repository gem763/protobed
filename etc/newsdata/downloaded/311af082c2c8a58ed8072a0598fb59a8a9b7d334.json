The \u201cPhotograph\u201d music video shows Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger walking down an empty street, holding a framed image of Kroeger and his producer up to the camera. Trump\u2019s riff on an existing meme replaces that image with a Tucker Carlson \u201cscoop\u201d circulating on right-wing media.\n\nTrump\u2019s display sent the Internet into fits, partly because it seemed to crystallize the complete craziness of the president\u2019s current impeachment-inspired frenzy. This Ukraine scandal is all so serious, and yet at the end of day it\u2019s all so silly: The commander in chief\u2019s tenure is under existential threat, and his response is to send out a dumb clip of Kroeger preparing to ask \u201cwhat the hell is on Joey\u2019s head?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDumb or dumber, the meme bears demystifying. It illuminates a basic truth about our president.\n\nPeople in the meme-generating depths of the Web did not make Nickelback memes because they liked Nickelback. They made Nickelback memes because they did not like Nickelback, and because Nickelback was everywhere anyway. The music was barely musical; it was a crummy commodity foisted upon the citizenry by people trying to sell us stuff. The record industry shoved \u201cPhotograph\u201d in our face the same way Kroeger thrusts the frame toward his audience, as if commanding us to care.\n\nSo this begat Nickelbacking, a relative of Rickrolling that involves, basically, calling someone on the phone and playing Nickelback. It begat a Facebook page setting up a contest for likes between Nickelback and a pickle. (The pickle won.) It begat the \u201cPhotograph\u201d bit, which struck at the emptiness at the song\u2019s center. You could replace that picture with anything at all, because it all meant nothing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNickelback didn\u2019t exactly become famous for being famous. It became famous for being famous despite being horrible. That makes Trump the Nickelback president. He was elevated to the top of society despite being utterly deplorable, and also because he was utterly deplorable.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to it. The initial transformation of Nickelback from anodyne top-40ers to detested webwide phenom actually spawned an intelligent critique and is an excellent example of what Dale Beran, author of \u201cIt Came from Something Awful: How a Toxic Troll Army Accidentally Memed Donald Trump into Office,\u201d argues that memes are all about. Disenchanted netizens spent their time dumpster-diving for societal detritus and mushing it back together to mock the world that created it, or at least to underscore its meaninglessness.\n\nTrump, however, wasn\u2019t sharing Nickelback because he\u2019s a nihilist, or because he\u2019s addicted to irony, or because he gets it at all. He was sharing Nickelback because he doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s something known to those who grew up online as a \u201ccursed boomer meme.\u201d These memes are cursed because they are, basically, bad: occasionally indecipherable and almost never achieving the effect they intend. They\u2019re boomer memes because they come from that crowd-of-a-certain-age that seems to have stumbled onto the Internet and now keeps bumping into things.\n\nMany of these memes are variations on formats popular among millennials, but warped to the edges of recognition by some soon-to-be grandfather who has recently discovered the wonders of Photoshop: \u201cOrange man is a scary monster,\u201d a sign reads in front of a flannel-clad student at a table, \u201cCHANGE MY DIAPER.\u201d Some are originals, borrowing only the conventions of meme-making \u2014 macros with the white \u201cImpact\u201d font, say, or excessive collaging \u2014 to build something bafflingly new. Most of all, they\u2019re deadly earnest, which is sort of the opposite of what memes are supposed to be.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the president loves memes, though he does. It\u2019s that he loves these cursed memes in particular. Because as much as Trump is the Nickelback president, or the post-truth president, or the reality TV president, or the 140-character president, he is, above all, the cursed boomer president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump is full of the emptiness in the \u201cPhotograph\u201d frame. He is more commodity than man, and his every absurd action makes a mockery of the culture that created him. The problem is, unlike the Web-dwellers who originated so much of the vernacular he has adopted for his own \u2014 whether they\u2019re his friends on 4chan, or his foes on Twitter, or a mix of both on Reddit or anywhere else \u2014 he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s anything funny about it.\n\nThe Nickelback meme\u2019s appearance on a Wednesday afternoon dramatized a contortion that is a constant in today\u2019s America. Trump is dangerous, but he\u2019s also ridiculous \u2014 a peril and a parody at the same time.\n\nRead more:\n\nMichael Gerson: Trump\u2019s anti-impeachment rhetoric has already gone too far\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s tweets distract from the Ukraine matter, but we can\u2019t ignore them\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump has placed himself above the law.
