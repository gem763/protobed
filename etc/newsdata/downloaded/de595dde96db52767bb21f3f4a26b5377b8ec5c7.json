But if you thought Apple's App Store is all clean and secure, we're here to pop this bubble for you.\n\nReuters\n\nMobile security firm Wadera discovered 17 clickware-based malicious apps on Apple's App Store. Clickware apps are notorious to generate advertising revenue by fooling its users.\n\nUpon Wadera's notification, Apple went ahead and removed 15 of these apps from its App Store.\n\nWhat's surprising is the fact that all these apps are from a small app development company based out of Gujarat called AppAspect Pvt. Ltd.\n\nThe apps when opened, used to open web pages in the background while clicking on ads. Whenever a user was using any of these apps, a backdoor would connect to the command and control centre that would enable the opening of webpages and clicking of ads without the user even finding out about it.\n\nDon't Miss 1.7 K SHARES 115 SHARES 4.5 K SHARES 647 SHARES 3 K SHARES\n\nWadera stated in a blog post. \"The clicker trojan module discovered in this group of applications is designed to carry out ad fraud-related tasks in the background, such as continuously opening web pages or clicking links without any user interaction.\"\n\nThe post further added, \"The objective of most clicker trojans is to generate revenue for the attacker on a pay-per-click basis by inflating website traffic. They can also be used to drain the budget of a competitor by artificially inflating the balance owed to the ad network.\"\n\nReuters\n\nAppAspect has these apps on the Play Store too. However, they aren't showing a similar behaviour as the iOS apps. But not for lack of trying.\n\nWadera's post says \"AppAspect's Android apps had once been infected in the past and removed from the store. They have since been republished and don't appear to have the malicious functionality embedded. It's unclear whether the bad code was added intentionally or unintentionally by the developer.\"\n\nInstall apps from trusted sources only and always read the reviews before downloading an app to be wary of such malicious apps.", "description": "Malicious apps are a common thing on Google's Play Store.
