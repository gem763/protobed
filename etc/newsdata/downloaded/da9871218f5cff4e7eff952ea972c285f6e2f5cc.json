However, treatment can control HIV and enable people to live a long and healthy life.\n\n'A functional cure would suppress the amount of HIV virus in the body to such low levels that it can\u2019t be detected or make you ill \u2013 but it would still be present,' the website clarifies.\n\nIn 2015, the family grew by another member when Ariel and Damian adopted a little girl named Victoria, who, like Olivia, will also be soon celebrating her fifth birthday.\n\nAccording to Pink News, the story comes just months after a new study, called PARTNER2, proved that there is zero risk of transmitting HIV while on antiretroviral treatment.", "description": "Damian Pighin, 42, and Ariel Vijarra, 39, adopted their daughter Olivia, now five, in 2014 after she was rejected by 10 families for having HIV.
