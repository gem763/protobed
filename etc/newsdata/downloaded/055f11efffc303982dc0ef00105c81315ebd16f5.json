Matt Bevin from Democrat candidate Andy Beshear after they view ads highlighting Beshear\u2019s support of biological men competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThe Campaign for American Principles (CAP) states: The ads are moving voters in an incredible way \u2014 the chart below represents over 2,000 respondents. The gray bar represents Bevin\u2019s support among voters BEFORE seeing the ad and the blue bar is Bevin\u2019s support from voters AFTER seeing the ad. For voters 45-54, Bevin sees an 8pt increase in support, 55-64 give him an additional 4.1pts, and 65+ shift over 9.4pts towards Bevin after seeing the ad.\n\n\u201cAndy Beshear is too extreme for Kentucky,\u201d CAP states in its second digital ad in the state.\n\n\u201cAll any athlete wants is a fair shot in competition,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator states. \u201cTo play by the rules. To show how hard work pays off and how champions are made.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if the rules change?\u201d the narrator asks. \u201cIf Andy Beshear gets his way, there won\u2019t be any rules. Anyone at any time could change teams for any reason. Beshear calls this equality. But is it fair?\u201d\n\n\u201cVote against Andy Beshear,\u201d CAP urges. \u201cHe\u2019s too extreme for Kentucky.\u201d\n\nCAP notes its first ad attacking Beshear for his extreme views that would destroy women\u2019s sports was released on September 23 as part of a $250,000 digital ad campaign microtargeting 400,000 Democrat and independent voters in Kentucky.\n\nThis second ad will be added to the rotation, microtargeting the same voters, and CAP will spend an additional $200,000, bringing its total spend in the race up to $450,000.\n\nA recent study in Sweden has shown that biological males who claim to be transgender women still retained considerable advantages over biological females in strength and muscle mass, even after a full year of hormone therapy.\n\n\u201cDespite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in [transgender men], the [transgender women] were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12 months of treatment,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThese findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen\u2019s eligibility to compete in the women\u2019s category of athletic competitions.\u201d\n\nIn another study, researchers concluded that male athletes who claim to be female hold an \u201cintolerable\u201d advantage over biological female athletes.\n\nThree professors \u2014 two in bioethics and one in physiology \u2014 noted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is allowing \u201ctransgender women\u201d to compete against biological females if their testosterone is below 10 nmol/L. However, even that level is \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than that of biological females, they asserted.\n\nThe researchers also stated that \u201cindirect effects of testosterone will not be altered by hormone therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained,\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness,\u201d state the professors.", "description": "A group has released an ad attacking Kentucky Democrat governor candidate Andy Beshear for his support of \u2018trans\u2019 men competing in women's sports.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trans-sports-ad-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
