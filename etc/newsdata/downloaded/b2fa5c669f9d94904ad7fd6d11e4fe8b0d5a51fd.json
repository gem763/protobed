Jonathan Atkins/Handout via REUTERS/Files\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Embattled money manager Neil Woodford\u2019s suspended LF Woodford Equity Income Fund is to be wound up, the fund\u2019s authorised corporate director Link Fund Solutions (LFS) said on Tuesday.\n\nWoodford, one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile fund managers, had his flagship 4.3 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) fund suspended from trading in June after an increase in demand from clients to take their money back.\n\nAt the heart of Woodford\u2019s troubles was the scale of his holdings in unlisted or illiquid assets, which are hard to sell quickly and which have become a focal point for the British regulator\u2019s ire in subsequent weeks.\n\nDespite seeking to sell down his illiquid holdings and move into liquid stocks ahead of a planned December reopening of the fund, Link said on Tuesday the process was not going as planned.\n\n\u201cWhilst progress has been made in relation to repositioning the Fund\u2019s assets, this has unfortunately not been sufficient to allow reasonable certainty as to when the repositioning would be fully achieved and the Fund could be re-opened,\u201d Link said in a letter to investors.\n\n\u201cLFS has concluded that an orderly realisation of the Fund\u2019s assets allows the return of money through interim payments to investors more quickly than if the Fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the decision, Neil Woodford will cease to be the investment manager of the fund with immediate effect and the fund\u2019s assets will be split into two portfolios managed by others.\n\nBlackRock Advisers will take charge of selling the fund\u2019s listed assets while PJT Partners will continue with its previously agreed role in helping to sell the fund\u2019s highly illiquid assets, Link said.\n\nThe winding up of the fund will begin on Jan. 17, 2020. In a separate statement, the Woodford Patient Capital Trust said its board would continue to review its management arrangements and would make a further announcement in due course.", "description": "Embattled money manager Neil Woodford's suspended LF Woodford Equity Income Fund is to be wound up, the fund's authorised corporate director Link Fund Solutions (LFS) said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441014296&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0CX", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
