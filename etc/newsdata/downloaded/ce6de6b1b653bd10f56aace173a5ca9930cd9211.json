Yes, the tariffs can be raised higher. These are low-level tariffs that could go to 50 percent or 100 percent,\u201d he said, as reported by the South China Morning Post.\n\nPillsbury said an \u201call-out trade war\u201d is a real possibility.\n\nThe Office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed to FOX Business on Thursday that negotiations between the U.S. and China are ongoing. They are expected to resume on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thirteenth round of high-level negotiations is scheduled to take place in D.C. next month.\n\nPresident Trump said last week a deal would not happen unless it was a good and fair agreement for the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go back to a situation where [the U.S.] giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fare. Not going to happen,\u201d he said before a crowd during a rally in North Carolina.\n\nIn a gesture of goodwill, Trump recently made the decision to delay a new round of tariff increases on $250 billion worth of goods from China, which were scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1. The two-week postponement was made to accommodate the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The increases will take effect on Oct. 15, instead.\n\nThese increases will follow the new round of tariffs that went into effect on goods from both countries at the outset of September. The U.S. implemented tariffs worth 15 percent on a host of goods from China, a decision that was met with countermeasures.\n\nChina subsequently filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO), asking it to facilitate \u201cconsultations\u201d with the U.S. to reduce or end tariffs.\n\nThe countries were close to striking a trade deal in the spring, but the Chinese ultimately decided not to move forward because of some of the demands the U.S. was making. Since then there has been little progress toward reaching a comprehensive agreement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "New report claims an \u201call-out trade war\u201d is a real possibility.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/375e7e8d-donald-trump-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
