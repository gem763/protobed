He did not, however, sign up for a combined 10 penalties worth 95 yards to be called in the first half between the Tennessee Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nBrady used the 117th tweet in his account\u2019s history to air his frustration about the active refs.\n\nToo many penalties. Just let us play!!!! #TENvsJAC \u2014 Tom Brady (@TomBrady) September 20, 2019\n\nThings came to a head in Titans-Jaguars when a Kamalei Correa hit on Minshew was flagged for roughing the passer. The hit seemed low enough and soon enough after a Minshew pass attempt to be legal, but, you see, Correa\u2019s helmet touched Minshew\u2019s chin.\n\nCan\u2019t have that.\n\n\u201cIn #TENvsJAX, there was helmet contact to Jaguars QB Gardner Minshew\u2019s chin, therefore roughing the passer was called.\u201d - AL pic.twitter.com/u70IpR5Viw \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) September 20, 2019\n\nBy that point, Tom had seen enough.\n\nStory continues\n\nI\u2019m turning off this game I can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore #TENvsJAC \u2014 Tom Brady (@TomBrady) September 20, 2019\n\nBrady is, of course, no stranger to roughing the passer penalties. He has vocally argued for many in his favor, and one hit to his legs from a lunging Bernard Pollard in 2008 famously spurred an NFL rule change. And yet, he has a point about the frequency of penalties in the NFL this season.\n\nAccording to NFLpenalties.com, NFL games have averaged 9.72 flags per game through two weeks this season, with 622 penalties called in total. Compare that to an average of 7.62 last year, and you might see a problem forming for the league\u2019s product.\n\nIt\u2019s especially bad with holding penalties, as the Fox broadcast revealed that such flags through Week 2 have spiked from 119 in 2017 and 109 in 2018 to a whopping 179 this year. Brady might not be a fan of that.\n\nTroy Aikman, the color commentator for Titans-Jaguars, even agreed with Brady. The Cowboys great called the number of penalties this year \u201cnauseating.\u201d The NFL will have to hope enough fans don\u2019t agree with the two quarterbacks, or some major changes in the league\u2019s priorities might be needed.\n\nTom Brady would like to see fewer flags in NFL games, at least in the ones he's watching.
