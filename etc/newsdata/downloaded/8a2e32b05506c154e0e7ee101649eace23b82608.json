As for the farts, we\u2019re not sure there\u2019s a real impetus for their inclusion, other than the fact they\u2019re hilarious, as are goats bleating.\n\nThe feature was added to the Model 3 last month, and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently proposed new rules that would allow the customization of the sounds used.\n\nOn top of these heads-up noises, Tesla car horn sounds may similarly be made customizable, The Verge reports. Laws vary state to state, but most suggest as long as the horn can be heard from 200 feet away and aren\u2019t \u201can unreasonably loud or harsh sound or a whistle,\u201d you\u2019re okay.\n\nThat theoretically means you can make your car fart constantly or on command \u2014 win-win!\n\nWhile everybody is having fun in North America, it seems like the Europeans will have to do with much more boring options, as usual. While their rules will come into place in 2021, they state electric vehicles \u201cshould sound similar to the sound of a vehicle of the same category equipped with an internal combustion engine,\u201d prompting us to make a fart of a different tune.", "description": "Fart!
