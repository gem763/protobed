'It's one of those gambles that you take.\n\n'There's one thing in life that's for sure, and that's a universal language, everybody wants to see someone get knocked the f*** out.\n\n'It will never go anywhere, people love it, and of course tragedy strikes, but that's what makes it exciting, people know that you can f***ing die in boxing.\n\n'I do get scared at times because I feel uncontrollable, I've thought about it many, many times.'\n\nThe Gypsy King feels Wilder is the one running scared from their lucrative rematch\n\nWilder's raw power was illustrated when he floored Tyson Fury in the final round of their epic clash last December.\n\nThe Brit defied all logic to rise from the canvas and rally back that night to take the fight to the judges, who returned a split-decision draw verdict.\n\nA money-spinning rematch between the heavyweights looked likely for early next year with February 22 the proposed date, but an eye injury to Fury sustained in the win over Otto Wallin last month and his impending WWE debut has threatened to put a spanner in the works.\n\nWilder has accused Fury of jeopardising recovery from a gruesome 47-stitch eye cut by making his shock wrestling debut against Braun Strowman at WWE's Crown Jewel event so he can pull out of their second date.\n\nWilder accused Fury of jeopardising recovery from a gruesome cut by making his WWE debut\n\nBut the Gypsy King has insisted that it is Wilder who is running scared from the blockbuster re-run of their December classic.\n\nHe told Sportsmail: 'Deontay doesn't fancy fighting me again,' said Fury. 'He knows he's missed the best chance he'll ever have of beating me, in our first fight.\n\n'If he couldn't do it when I was just coming back from that long lay off, fat and out of fighting condition then he doubts he ever will.\n\n'He also knows he's not getting any better at 34, that he's on the way down now and coming to the end of his career.\n\n'Me pull out? I'm a born fighting man. Absolutely, my next fight after I have some fun and keep myself active in WWE will be Deontay in February. Unless of course something goes drastically wrong.'", "description": "Deontay Wilder has confessed he often gets scared he could kill someone in the ring.
