Photo: Michelle Groskopf/Michelle Groskopf\n\nSince February, the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration has given 130 individuals \u2014 randomly selected from neighborhoods with a median household income at or below Stockton\u2019s of $46,033 \u2014 monthly payments of $500, no strings attached. The disbursements are part of an 18-month pilot program studying the effects of a universal basic income (UBI). Since February, I have followed five of the recipients to watch how this unexpected windfall has changed their lives. Read the stories of Laura, Greg, Danielle, and Phyllis for more about what a basic-income policy looks like for real people.\n\nMonth One \u201c I f I o n e d a y d e c i d e t o w o r k f o r a c o m p a n y , m y s t a r t i n g s a l a r y w o u l d b e e a s i l y $ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 i f I d o n \u2019 t e v e n d o v e r y w e l l . \u201d\n\nI visit Grace at her apartment in an \u00adaffordable-housing complex in one of the city\u2019s \u201chot zones\u201d \u2014 so called for their high crime rate. It\u2019s three days before the first disbursement. We sit side by side on a bed in her living room, which is otherwise empty except for a crib and a large playpen containing a few toys and stuffed animals. Grace\u2019s 1-year-old daughter, Jackie, is with her father so Grace can focus on her career. She and Jackie\u2019s father are \u201con a kind of break,\u201d she says.\n\nGrace tells me she just got back from a ski trip to Lake Tahoe with a group of 40 \u201cwomen in tech\u201d organized by Arielle Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s younger sister. She shows me pictures on Facebook of herself among the women gathered in front of the ski lodge\u2019s fireplace, all of them wearing matching facial masks. Grace doesn\u2019t ski, so she rented the gear and bought herself a jacket and ski pants, putting about a thousand dollars on a credit card.\n\n\u201cHonestly, that trip wouldn\u2019t happen if I didn\u2019t have already the $500 as a possibility, because my credit card right now is basically maxed,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s worthy of an investment\u201d \u2014 \u00adespecially since a successful entrepreneur friend later paid the tab.\n\nA few years ago, Grace, who is 31, founded a start-up that aims to use artificial-\u00adintelligence-informed urban design to bring smart technologies and self-\u00addriving cars to cities. She has met with venture capitalists to pitch them on plans for updating city infrastructure to allow for cars to talk to intelligent traffic-control devices and for smart homes whose doors can be closed or heat controlled remotely. Grace is currently the only employee. Last summer, she approached the mayor\u2019s office about positioning Stockton as a test city and has been connecting the mayor\u2019s team with players in the self-\u00addriving-car world. The women on the ski trip could become investors or want to collaborate on the project.\n\nGrace grew up in China. She came to the U.S. at 18 to attend an elite East Coast college on a full scholarship and has been a student on and off ever since. She has a master\u2019s degree in East Asian studies and is now studying computer science and robotics through two online master\u2019s programs, which she thinks will help with her start-up. So far, she has borrowed about $180,000 to cover tuition and living costs; it has ballooned to $220,000 with interest. As long as she keeps her grades up, she can put off making payments while in school \u2014 but the interest keeps growing. This sum is on top of another $25,000 in credit-card debt. I ask if owing nearly a quarter of a million dollars ever keeps her up at night.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I one day decide to work for a company, my starting salary would be easily $150,000 if I don\u2019t even do very well.\u201d She says her LinkedIn profile regularly attracts headhunters. \u201cI\u2019m basically telling them I\u2019m not hirable because I want to become a billionaire. I want to change the world.\u201d\n\nGrace talks fast without pausing, often staring into the distance as if toward a future she hopes to help shape: one \u201cwith a new set of rules in terms of social contract [and] understanding what role government will play in it \u2026 a world where we humans may not actually work in exchange for money anymore\u201d and where the profit from companies like hers \u201cwill be very generously distributed among people.\u201d\n\nI point out that she sounds a lot like the advocates for universal basic income describing a future transformed by technology. Grace waggles her head, unsure what she thinks about the concept of UBI just yet. When she got her SEED letter, she knew about the program only because the venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, an early investor in SpaceX, had mentioned the pilot while hearing her pitch to make Stockton a smart city. (He turned her down, joking that it\u2019d be easier to go to Mars than to transform Stockton.) \u201cMyself, I really want people for the short term to work,\u201d says Grace, echoing a common conception that UBI will encourage recipients not to work. (That effect has been debunked by most studies.) But like UBI\u2019s supporters, she sees students such as herself \u201cwho are studying to create something of higher value\u201d as worthy of society\u2019s support. She has friends in Sweden who get public funding to study, and \u201cin Singapore, the government actually pays you to stay.\u201d\n\nGrace, though, lives off loans and whatever side hustle she can manage. She tried becoming an Uber driver, but after four days of driving, the company banned her from the platform because of numerous one-star ratings. \u201cI guess I am really not a good driver,\u201d she says, laughing. Now she\u2019s in the process of applying for a license to run a home-based day care. She plans on hiring someone to help so she can study while her daughter and a few other children are cared for in her home.\n\nIn the meantime, the SEED money means she can cover her rent and meet her minimum payments on her credit cards. \u201cI really think this $500 is going to make a huge impact on my life,\u201d she says. \u201cElon Musk at one point was sleeping under a desk because he couldn\u2019t afford to have an apartment. Actually, a lot of my friends who are now doing really well in their start-ups were sleeping in cars, and any of them could just sell their hours for a salary.\u201d She lifts her chin a little higher. \u201cWe choose not to.\u201d\n\nMonth Four \u201c T h e s y s t e m i s e a t i n g u p a l l m y t i m e . \u201d\n\nThe next time I see Grace, the bed is gone from the living room, and there are three cribs in its place. A kid-size table and chairs sit against the kitchen wall. There is a colorful plastic ramp over which a baby can crawl inside the playpen. The hallway is stuffed with camera gear to offer child portraits to her day-care clients, and an upright piano sits by the kitchen to teach the children music. The day-care license has come through, but her daughter is still living with her father. Plastic accordion files overflowing with court documents cover the floor.\n\nSince our last visit, Grace has told me more about Jackie\u2019s situation. When her daughter was born, Grace and the father were living in an apartment in the \u201cgood\u201d part of Stockton, but when Jackie was 4 months old, the father moved out. Grace soon ran out of diapers and was using makeshift cloth ones. She was nearly out of formula and facing homelessness once her lease ended. She looked in the phone book for some kind of social services and found a listing for Child Protective Services, which she called to ask for help. Grace sought counseling and was diagnosed with, and treated for, postpartum depression, which had been made worse with the departure of the baby\u2019s father and losing the housing and support he had been providing. According to the CPS reports, which Grace shared with me, she told various social workers that she had thoughts of wanting to harm her baby and didn\u2019t want to care for her anymore. But Grace maintains that she said those things only to justify the agency\u2019s taking of Jackie. She acknowledges she needed some time apart from her daughter to get herself stable and find a new living situation. As it was, Grace ended up sleeping in her car for a few nights before moving to a local women\u2019s shelter. Grace believes her lack of money contributed to CPS taking her child. A 2014 article published by the American Bar Association concludes that \u201cwhile poverty can lead to increased rates of actual maltreatment, poverty itself is often mistaken for neglect.\u201d\n\nIn late March, the county court awarded Jackie\u2019s father full legal custody and Grace twice-weekly supervised visits. The court questioned Grace\u2019s \u201cmental stability\u201d and said she posed a risk to her daughter, even though the results of Grace\u2019s court-ordered psychological interview found her to be \u201cwithin normal limits.\u201d She had also voluntarily attended 20 sessions with a therapist, who said she was making progress working through the trauma of having her child taken from her.\n\nThe day after the court took away her custody, her day-care license came through, an irony Grace likes to cite in her defense. But Grace is in and out of court so frequently trying to get her daughter back that she hasn\u2019t been able to accept any long-term clients. This morning, she is headed to the courthouse to file a petition asking for joint custody. She is representing herself because she can\u2019t afford a lawyer. Her long black hair is slightly curled, and she\u2019s dressed up in a pale-yellow crewneck sweater and a black knit skirt.\n\nShe has to go up to the fourth floor, where family court is located, get a number, and wait to request to file the petition; then she goes down to the first floor to wait to have the petition sent, then back up to the fourth floor to get another number and wait to show proof that the petition was mailed. In the middle of it, I run out to my car to put more money in the meter.\n\nWhen I come back, another woman in the waiting room has struck up a conversation with Grace after watching her take a call for work. \u201cWhat work?\u201d I ask. Grace says she\u2019s been providing spiritual and romantic advice through an app online. In fact, the day before, Grace worked for 16 hours straight, not even taking time to eat. She earned over $300. She is excited about her new gig because she can make her own hours and it won\u2019t interfere with her court appearances or her studying or her work on the autonomous-car project.\n\nIt\u2019s three hours before we get out of there. \u201cThe system is eating up all my time,\u201d Grace complains as she walks briskly back to the car. From court, she drives to one bank to withdraw her fourth disbursement in cash and then to another bank, where she deposits it to cover her negative balance from multiple $35 overdraft charges. She has $384.03 left over, which is all her money in the world besides $10 in her purse. She hasn\u2019t been able to afford food recently, so her neighbors have been sharing what they bring back from the food bank. In turn, she drives them to their various appointments. As we ride, Grace tells me the SEED money is basically saving her life right now. \u201cI\u2019m really not supposed to be in this situation,\u201d she says. \u201cIn America, with my credentials, I should be able to actually take care of myself.\u201d\n\nMonth Seven \u201c I \u2019 m a c t u a l l y r e a l i z i n g t h a t p r o b a b l y i t i s c h e a p e r f o r m e t o b e c o m e a l a w y e r m y s e l f . \u201d\n\nGrace and I sit in the kid-size chairs at the kid-size table next to her kitchen. All of the day-care cribs, the playpen, and the high chairs are pushed to one side of the room. A large red suitcase sits in the middle of the floor. When Grace moves it out of the way, a little voice emanates from inside: Gee, gee-gee. The suitcase holds the toys she brings on her weekly visits with her daughter. Jackie is almost 2, and she is talking more every visit. \u201cShe\u2019s actually surprising me with a lot of complex sentence structures,\u201d says Grace, adding softly, \u201cThey are doing a good job teaching her.\u201d It\u2019s been 16 months since Jackie was taken from Grace\u2019s care. Other than two weeks this past June, when Grace was briefly allowed unsupervised visits, she has seen her daughter only in the bleak interiors of government-approved visitation centers. She hasn\u2019t been able to let her crawl over the colorful plastic ramp in her apartment or pound out notes on the piano or sit for her very own photo portrait. Grace isn\u2019t allowed to take any pictures or videos of \u00adJackie during their visits at all.\n\nA law firm in Los Angeles has filed a pro bono appeal in the custody case. Grace is hopeful that it will be successful. Since she is in court constantly, she tells me, \u201cI\u2019m actually realizing that probably it is cheaper for me to become a lawyer myself.\u201d She was just accepted to a night law school in Sacramento and is now driving one hour each way to class three to four times a week, which is adding significantly to her expenses. As a part-time night school, it\u2019s not accredited by the ABA, which means Grace can\u2019t get financial aid or federal loans and must pay the $1,300 monthly tuition out of pocket. It will take four years to get her degree, but she wants to use it to help other people fight CPS decisions. She is also working on some business ideas with her entrepreneur friend. (\u201cI think he wants to date me,\u201d Grace admits, blushing a little.) They\u2019re developing a legal-aid app to leverage a pending change in California law that will allow nonlawyers to offer legal advice. This new \u201clegal tech\u201d bill, as it\u2019s called, would make routine legal transactions more affordable. It would also automate many lawyer jobs out of existence.\n\nBetween trying to get Jackie back, pursuing the law and computer-science degrees, taking the occasional child-care client, and keeping up with her online clients\u2019 demands for spiritual guidance, Grace has been struggling to manage her time. She has become one of the app\u2019s most popular advisers, with hundreds of five-star reviews: \u201cYou have such a profound understanding of love, life, and relationships!,\u201d reads one comment. She has earned a little over $7,000 since May and is no longer accruing overdraft charges. The affordable-housing complex has even bumped up her rent to reflect her rosier economic reality.\n\nShe sometimes feels guilty about receiving the SEED money. Her neighbors, who don\u2019t have the same access to opportunities, seem more deserving of such help. Still, she thinks the Stockton demonstration has allowed her to achieve some stability. \u201cI realize the importance of this $500. It gives me the assurance that everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d That, in turn, has helped fuel her plans for her future. \u201cThe moment when you feel like you are actually able to cover your basics, my personality just allows me to start really thinking about expansion.\u201d\n\nThis project was supported by a grant from the investigative news site Capital & Main.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
