Shut up!'\n\nLater Murray complained: 'The sound came from him, which you're not allowed to do, it's against the rules, it's hindrance, you shouldn't do it. Fabio wanted to engage with me, I probably shouldn't have done, but I am not having him talk to me like that on court.'\n\nAn angry Murray remonstrated with umpire Fergus Murphy during the encounter\n\nMurray told Fognini to 'shut up' as he complained about the Italian's conduct to the umpire\n\nUnfortunately for the double Wimbledon champion, Fognini, no stranger to controversy, came out and played a strong game to take it into a tiebreak. During that he again played some of his best tennis of the match to clinch it 7-2.\n\nThere followed the most abrupt handshake and, with security heavies lingering, there were some more barbs from Murray before he left the court.\n\nAnd so finished a three-week trip to China, during which Murray has showed he once again belongs at least in the top thirty with his current level of form and fitness.\n\nMurray and Fognini shook hands at the end of the match when Italian sealed a win\n\nHe could easily have taken the first set, having led 4-2 before being pegged back and losing the tiebreak 7-4. In the second he broke early and then the Italian went walkabout, as he is wont to do.\n\nMurray then served for it at 5-4 and 6-5 in the third but could not land the killer blow. When the dust settles, however, he can reflect on three tournaments in which he had made plenty of progress on a remarkable journey.\n\nNext week he will round off a four-week campaign by playing in the European Open in Antwerp.", "description": "MIKE DICKSON: Andy Murray became involved in a furious row with opponent Fabio Fognini before falling to an agonising defeat in a fiery encounter at the Shanghai Masters event.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447342-0-image-a-95_1570546266458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
