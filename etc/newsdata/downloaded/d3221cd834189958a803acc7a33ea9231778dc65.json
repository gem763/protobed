After 18 years in the party, he told the news program, he believes Republicans are using Black men like him as \u201cpolitical pawns\u201d in their \u201cpro-white\u201d agenda.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is a rich guy who is mired in white privilege to the extreme,\u201d Cheadle told PBS on Thursday. \u201cRepublicans are too sheepish to call him out on anything and they are afraid of losing their positions and losing any power themselves.\u201d\n\nCheadle didn\u2019t say where he\u2019ll run, but Federal Election Commission records show he\u2019s run four times before in California\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\nSCOOP: Gregory Cheadle, the man President Trump once called \u201cmy African American,\u201d is leaving the Republican party & running for Congress as an independent.\n\n\n\nHe says Trump has a \u201cwhite superiority complex\" and the party is pursing a \"pro-white\" agenda. https://t.co/TItxY5zBMu \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 12, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s blatant displays of racism have been a cornerstone of his presidency and campaign.\n\nIn less than three years, Trump has suggested that a deadly white supremacist rally had \u201csome very fine people on both sides,\u201d inspired violence by continuing to slur immigrants as criminals and rapists, and launched a travel ban targeting Muslims.\n\nHe also singled out four Democratic lawmakers, all of whom were women of color, in a feud earlier this year, urging them to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.\u201d\n\nCheadle said Trump crossed the line for him when the president attacked the city of Baltimore and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) earlier this summer.\n\nIn late July, Trump blasted Cummings as a \u201cracist\u201d and described Baltimore as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d of a district where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d\n\nCheadle, who is from Redding, California, told PBS that he had enough of the Republican Party when he saw his friends defend Trump\u2019s remarks on Baltimore.\n\n\u201cThey were sidestepping the people of color issue and saying that, \u2018No, it\u2019s not racist,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey were saying these people were socialists and communists. That\u2019s what they were saying. And I thought this is a classic case of whites not seeing racism because they want to put blinders on and make it about something else.\u201d\n\nTrump faced backlash during his 2016 campaign when he pointed to Cheadle as \u201cmy African American,\u201d though at the time, Cheadle said he wasn\u2019t offended.", "description": "Gregory Cheadle, now an independent, told \"PBS NewsHour\" that Republicans use Black men like him as \"political pawns\" in a \"pro-white\" agenda.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a97102300001c0552149d.jpeg?cache=hsteoph0hc&ops=1778_1000"}
