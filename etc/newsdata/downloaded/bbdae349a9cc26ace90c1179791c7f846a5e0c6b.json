It is something that I will probably never waver from.\u201d\n\nThe England rugby star is reflecting on his heritage. Not Australia, where he was born, or Wales where he grew up, but Tonga, the land of his mother and father and family before them. Vunipola has never been shy about discussing his blood line, in fact he is the opposite. He is proud to be a Tongan.\n\n\u201cBeing in fancy places in London I know that it is not my place,\u201d he adds.\u201d Sometimes I get a rash on my arm from being in those places. I tell my wife that all the time.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOn Sunday, Vunipola will become the first family member to play against Tonga, with the irony being that father Fe\u2019ao and uncle Elisi both played for the Pacific Island against England at the Rugby World Cup 20 years ago. It is not a strange feeling for the 26-year-old, given he is closing in on 50 international caps and very much feels as English as the rest of the squad after moving to the United Kingdom at the age of seven.\n\nYet there is something in the back of his head \u2013 a voice \u2013 that remains loyal to Tonga. It could play into his hands this Sunday, given he will have a good sense of what is flowing through the opposition\u2019s veins, what is being said in their minds. It will be that same voice.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. England vs Tonga predicted team Show all 24 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. England vs Tonga predicted team 1/24 England vs Tonga Who should Eddie Jones select in his opening squad for the Rugby World Cup? Reuters 2/24 1. Joe Marler With Vunipola absent, Jones would be wise to go with experience and Marler\u2019s XX caps bring just that. The Harlequins prop looked to have no chance of featuring at the World Cup when he retired last season, but could end up being the first name on the teamsheet in the opening match of the campaign. REUTERS 3/24 2. Jamie George The expectation is that Jones will go fully loaded for the opening game and then look to rest his best players where possible, given it will give them just under two weeks to prepare for their Argentina test. George is certainly one of those, and with two other hookers in the squad in Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jack Singleton, Jones can afford to give George a good hit-out before standing him down for the week. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler This selection doesn\u2019t seem to be too much of an issue, given that Kyle Sinckler will bring form, power and pace to the pack if selected against Tonga while Dan Cole has a vast amount of experience at World Cups to deal with the job at hand. However, given the physicality of the Pacific Islanders, it might be sensible to deploy Sinckler first to give Tonga a few problems of their own. Getty Images 5/24 4. Maro Itoje Now we start to get to the tricky positions. If Mark Wilson fails to get through full training as he manages a knee injury, then he cannot realistically be considered for the opening fixture. That could then leave England in a bit of a whole, and as a result, we\u2019re selecting Itoje to play just 40 minutes. Jones could then send on Courtney Lawes for the second 40, with both slated to start against the USA. EPA 6/24 5. George Kruis Joining Itoje in the second row is his Saracens colleague George Kruis. The lock has enjoyed a wonderful return to form over the last year and his lineout expertise could prove a handy tool against Tonga, whose set-piece could prove a weakness. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry The absence of Wilson, if he fails to recover, leaves Jones with a tricky situation. He could start the inexperienced Lewis Ludlam on the blindside, deploy Courtney Lawes there, or choose to go with his double-openside tactic of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. It\u2019s the latter that we\u2019re going for, as Curry fills the No 6 shirt having impressed in the World Cup warm-up games. EPA 8/24 7. Sam Underhill Underhill takes the No 7 shirt to provide England with that double-edge at the breakdown. If England can disrupt Tongan possession and slow them down at the ruck, it negates a lot of their best qualities. Both Curry and Underhill would then be stood down for the second match, allowing Lawes to start at 6 and Ludlam to start on the openside. EPA 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola It looks guaranteed that Vunipola will start against the country of his heritage with Wilson struggling, and as Jones has said over the last few weeks, the best way to get him at his best is to get the No 8 playing minutes. That could potentially see Vunipola double up and face the USA too, but it\u2019s hoped that Wilson will be back in time to start. EPA 10/24 9. Ben Youngs Youngs remains the first-choice scrum-half for now and should get the nod to start the campaign unless Willi Heinz has done enough in training to oust him from the shirt. REUTERS 11/24 10. George Ford England are keen to stay away from the brutality that will be thrown their way from the Tonga defence, and as such it looks like George Ford will start alongside Owen Farrell to ensure the ball is moved around to the outside backs. Ford impressed in playing every game of the warm-up series, and deserves to start the opening match on merit alone. REUTERS 12/24 11. Jonny May Just wind him up and let him go. May\u2019s in the form of his life, and will start in Japan as their first-choice wing. Getty Images 13/24 12. Owen Farrell Farrell captains the team from the No 12 shirt \u2013 which he returned to for the record victory over Ireland last month \u2013 in order to add that creativity to the midfield. Farrell is big enough to bring the physicality needed in an inside centre, but it\u2019s the ability to move the ball outside him that will be the most important quality needed. Action Images via Reuters 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi It seems the smartest thing to do in selecting Tuilagi to fight power with power against Tonga, and then wrap him up in cotton wool for the Argentina game. With Henry Slade short on minutes after a knee injury ruled him out of the warm-up games, and Jonathan Joseph down the pecking order, Tuilagi could cause havoc in the opening game \u2013 but he is needed for much later in the tournament and a 50-minute hit-out before giving Slade minutes looks the best option. Getty Images 15/24 14. Anthony Watson This is where the back-line selection gets tricky. With Nowell injured, England will have to reply on Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson looking after the No 15 shirt. However, Joe Cokanasiga is another who has struggled with a knee injury this week, and you wouldn\u2019t want to expose Ruaridh McConnochie to the Tongans in his first fully competitive international Test. As a result, Watson will be needed to start on the wing. Action Images via Reuters 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Daly could be another player forced to double-up, as you would rather push the new Saracens addition to go back-to-back rather than Watson, given the latter\u2019s recent injury problems. Daly has proven he has that in him before, having played back-to-back between on the Lions tour ahead of the first Test, and with Nowell returning later in the tournament, Daly could be rested in one of the latter pool games. PA 17/24 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie Seems to be the natural understudy to George given that Jack Singleton is yet to play any minutes at hooker. Action Images via Reuters 18/24 17. Ellis Genge Could play a pivotal role in this World Cup off the bench as he did against Italy, with his injection of power likely to sap the energy reserves of the Tongan pack. AFP/Getty Images 19/24 18. Dan Cole A wise-old head to bring on in the closing stages. EPA 20/24 19. Joe Launchbury The Wasps lock will cover the second row, but with one eye on him starting against the USA, his minutes should be limited. AFP/Getty Images 21/24 20. Courtney Lawes Can come on for Itoje at half-time or soon after in order to allow both to go again on Thursday. Getty Images 22/24 21. Willi Heinz Provides cover for Youngs but should get enough minutes under his belt to push his claims for a starting spot later in the tournament to keep Youngs on his toes. Getty Images 23/24 22. Henry Slade Provides cover for fly-half if the worst happens to Ford and Farrell, but more use as a replacement for Tuilagi and an early introduction would be useful to give him minutes. Getty Images 24/24 23. Joe Cokanasiga/Ruaridh McConnochie If fit, Cokanasiga takes the final place on the bench as he can bring a second-half impact on the wing and Watson can cover full-back should anything happen to Daly. However, his fitness is under a big question mark, and should he fail to recover from the knee injury he\u2019s been struggling with, McConnochie will get the nod.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cI know because I have had the same mentality,\u201d Vunipola adds. \u201cThey have a lot of pride. You can just go back through the history - Tonga has never been colonised and that is probably drip-fed down through to my dad and me.\n\n\u201cI know that my dad thinks they could have beaten England - even though they lost 101 to 10. That is just the way they are and that helps me a lot to prepare for games because I put myself in a position where I am second best, and I am always trying to be the best.\n\n\u201cTonga will say all week that we don't respect them, but we do. We respect them a lot, but that gets them going - hopefully we show them more than enough respect in terms of how we play.\n\n\u201cIt is my first time playing against Tonga. It is different to playing against Fiji because I am not Fijian. But I am Tongan, my parents are and my grandparents are so it will be very emotional just as much as anything else. I have to get my head right.\u201d\n\nVunipola is one of four players in this England squad with Pacific Island heritage, joining elder brother Mako, Samoa-born Manu Tuilagi and Joe Cokanasiga, who was born in Fiji to a father in the British Army. Vunipola was also in the squad the day that the 2015 Rugby World Cup began, when a misfiring performance against Fiji rather set the tone for England\u2019s shambles of a home campaign. There is of course the danger that it happens again in Sapporo.\n\n\u201cThe difference between playing Tonga in the autumn and playing them now is that everyone is watching,\u201d Vunipola explains. \u201cIt will be a different kind of beast altogether. They always go alright at World Cups, they always take a big scalp so we have to be prepared for that and be prepared for an onslaught of relentless physicality, but we have players who can play that way and players who can play the other way.\n\n\u201c2015 is a good reference point for us. How do we take the sting out of Tonga\u2019s attack and everything else they use? But we have talked about that as a team a lot. How quick can we play, how long can we play for to try and tire them out?\u201d\n\nSomewhat surprisingly though, England will have a bit more support behind them than they would have expected. On Sunday afternoon, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a family will gather round a small, old-fashioned television box and cheer on the red rose against their own country.\n\n\u201cMy grandma and my aunty\u2019s house is kind of a point where they go to watch the games together as a celebration. Whenever we are playing, whether that is at home for England or for my club, they will all be watching and supporting and messaging me or my wife. I\u2019ll know about it if they are watching because they think it is all down to them that we are winning!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those box TV\u2019s, you know with one coming out at the back. I don\u2019t think they know what a flat screen is yet. They love it, although I don\u2019t think they watch it too much unless it\u2019s rugby or a fashion show.\u201d\n\nFamily means a lot to Vunipola. In an interview with The Independent at the start of the year, he revealed it to be among the three keys to his life, alongside rugby and religion. The latter was placed above the other two as it is what he says has defined him to shape him into the man he is today. It also landed him in trouble when he defended Israel Folau, the former Australia rugby union player, for expressing his beliefs, even though Folau did that through a string of homophobic and hateful messages on social media.\n\nVunipola learned his lesson from that incident that landed him warnings from both club Saracens and the Rugby Football Union. It would be na\u00efve to think that Vunipola has changed his beliefs as a result, but he is learning when and where to express certain things. \u201cMy biggest work on is keeping my head down. I\u2019m much louder than my brother, I kind of just say what\u2019s on my mind. That gets me into trouble a lot, but that\u2019s the person I am, that\u2019s how I grew up.\n\n\u201cMy dad, my parents\u2026and my brother to be fair [are quite hard on me]. I\u2019ve got a few people who are telling me what to do. Sometimes I listen, sometimes I don\u2019t. It just depends if I want to or not.\u201d\n\nSunday will be another occasion where Vunipola will need to keep his emotions in check. The back-row forward expects to be targeted by the Tongan defence, given most other teams double-up on him anyway. But there will also be the emotion of the day in facing the nation that defines him, with family from the UK, USA and Australia watching on inside the Sapporo Dome along with his parents back home. England defence coach John Mitchell has no concerns over England\u2019s colossal forward being targeted \u2013 \u201cI think he is experienced enough to deal with it\u201d \u2013 but it will be a special day regardless for the Vunipola family and one that the boy from the island has not had to deal with before.", "description": "\u201cAt the moment I am not really enjoying the weather even though it is probably closer to the climate,\u201d says Billy Vunipola, sheltered from the scorching Miyazaki heat. \u201cThings like that remind myself that I am still the boy from the island.
