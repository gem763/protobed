His release saves the team less than $200,000 against the salary cap in 2019, and he also will count $2 million in dead money against the cap in 2020.\n\nColvin was involved in the coverage on both of the Saints' passing touchdowns in New Orleans' 30-28 win over Houston on Monday night. He also allowed a 41-yard completion on third-and-2 with 2:05 remaining in regulation and was playing off-coverage on the 9-yard gain the Saints used to set up kicker Wil Lutz's 58-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\nIn parts of two seasons, Colvin finishes his Texans tenure with 34 tackles and one pass breakup in 11 games (three starts). A fourth-round pick of the Jaguars in 2014, he had 166 tackles and 14 pass breakups in 48 games (25 starts) across four seasons for Jacksonville.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns placed Gaines, 28, on injured reserve on Sept. 1, and he was released with an injury settlement on Saturday.\n\nEntering his sixth NFL season, Gaines has 22 starts in 52 career games with the Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills and Cleveland, recording 138 tackles, one interception and 16 pass breakups.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "The Houston Texans released cornerback Aaron Colvin on Tuesday, according to multiple reports, even though more than $7 million in guaranteed money remained on his contract.
