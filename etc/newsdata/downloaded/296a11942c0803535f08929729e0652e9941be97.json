REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nPrabowo, a 68-year-old former special forces commander, has been accused of human rights abuses and trying to grab power after his then father-in-law Suharto was ousted from the presidency in 1998.\n\nAn opposition leader during Widodo\u2019s first term and with unsuccessful runs for the presidency in 2014 and again this year, Prabowo has now been named defense minister. [nL3N2780LV]\n\nOn the campaign trail, critics said his message, much like U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016, amplified potential threats to the country. In speeches, he often said Indonesia was on the verge of fragmentation, exploited by unspecified foreign powers.\n\nBut after failing to overturn Widodo\u2019s election victory through the courts, Prabowo and Widodo patched things up at a number of meetings in recent weeks - dismaying many of their own supporters.\n\n\u201cPrabowo is a huge gamble for Jokowi. He could turn out to be an excellent defense minister who carries Jokowi\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Evan A. Laksmana of the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, using the nickname of the president.\n\n\u201cOr Prabowo could be a disaster, with bureaucratic infighting with the broader security establishment and the politicization of the defense establishment heading to 2024,\u201d added Laksmana, referring to the date of the next election\n\nPrabowo comes from an elite political family. His father was one of Indonesia\u2019s most prominent economists, serving in the cabinets of the country\u2019s first two presidents Sukarno and Suharto.\n\nBut Prabowo has been dogged by persistent allegations of human rights abuses, in particular during the economic crisis that led to Suharto\u2019s downfall in 1998.\n\nSuharto\u2019s replacement B.J. Habibie has said the second night after he was sworn in, Prabowo showed up at the presidential palace, armed and with a squad of special forces soldiers, and tried to stage a coup.\n\nShortly thereafter, Prabowo was discharged from the army for breaking the chain of command and ordering troops to arrest activists.\n\nHe has repeatedly denied the allegations against him or said he was following orders.\n\nAfter his swearing in on Wednesday, a relaxed-looking Prabowo said he would immediately head to his ministry.\n\n\u201cI will learn the latest situation and then we will begin work,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nPRACTICAL BENEFITS\n\nIt was a far cry from this year\u2019s bitterly fought election, when Prabowo had initially refused to concede defeat and eight people were killed and more than 900 wounded during rioting in Jakarta after rallies by his supporters descended into clashes with security forces.\n\nFor Widodo, his inclusion could have practical benefits by making it easier for the government to push through legislation, given that with the backing of Prabowo\u2019s Gerindra party, government support in parliament increases to 74%.\n\nFakhrul Fulvian, chief economist at Trimegah Sekuritas, said Gerindra\u2019s inclusion \u201cwill be positive\u201d for planned economic reforms by ensuring they get firm support from parliament.\n\nHe noted, however, that by increasing the number of parties in the coalition, it could make it harder to execute reforms.\n\nRights activists say Widodo is going too far in pushing his agenda.\n\n\u201cIndonesia is going through a slide in freedom that has become the cornerstone of Indonesian democracy for the last 20 years,\u201d said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International in Indonesia.\n\n\u201cThe cabinet shows that his political pendulum is in the direction of efforts to achieve something without caring much for how to achieve it,\u201d said Hamid, describing the inclusion of Prabowo as the \u201cpolitics of accommodation\u201d.\n\nWellian Wiranto, an economist at Singapore\u2019s OCBC Bank, called Prabowo\u2019s appointment \u201ca bold bid for national unity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhether it works out or not may well turn out to be more crucial to Indonesia than policies per se.\u201d", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo took what appeared to be his biggest political gamble on Wednesday by including former general Prabowo Subianto in the cabinet, his main rival who has long harbored ambitions for the presidency.", "authors": ["Ed Davies", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444057096&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0OC", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
