Do not read on unless you have watched episode three\n\n\u2018When I say something will happen \u2013 that thing will happen\u2019\n\nDespite his pills regimen, Logan seems to only grow stronger as he makes further headway in his predatory approach for PGN. This episode takes place against the growing, militant polarisation of the US, between the shouty far-right and an the increasingly organised anti-fascist movement, and alarm at an increasingly trigger-happy culture. The Disunited States indeed; but would bringing all the major news channels under the Waystar umbrella have a desirable, unifying effect?\n\nKendall spends a lot of this episode on the company roof terrace; surveying the Manhattan landscape like a future kingdom, or considering throwing himself off the ledge? Whichever, it\u2019s here that he puts in the call to Rhea Jarrell (Holly Hunter) from PGN. She, Logan and Kendall will meet, discreetly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kendall, Rhea and Logan: Jeremy Strong, Holly Hunter and Brian Cox. Photograph: HBO\n\nConnor, meanwhile, has been packed off to a management training course like small boy to camp; to Brightstar Adventure Park, owned by Waystar, where he lurks incognito, forced to watch an introductory video featuring Kendall and himself, but with his spoken part has been cut out. Shiv has been invited by Roy to spend the day at the firm. Kendall regards her warily but she insists she is \u201cjust observing\u201d. She in turn is put out at just how close Kendall seems to be to their dad, even administering his medicines.\n\n\u2018I will not let go of what is mine!\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, at ATN, there\u2019s a problem. One of their stars, Mark Ravenhead, is revealed to have had youthful Nazi associations, bringing the wrath of antifa on the channel. In a meeting to discuss the star and following a slit-throat signal from an observing Shiv, Tom recommends ditching him. Cyd and Logan disagree. When Tom meets Ravenhead, however, it emerges that he is an avid reader of Mein Kampf whose regret at the second world war is the millions of lives lost by Germans, Russians, Poles ... full stop.\n\nThe meeting is interrupted, however, by a gunshot, precipitating a security alert. Tom does not cover himself in glory with his woman-and-children-last flight to the panic room. Greg, meanwhile, panics that the room doesn\u2019t seem exactly watertight.\n\nIt turns out, to Tom\u2019s indignation, that there is more than one panic room. The secure one is occupied by Logan and Shiv \u2013 and eventually Rhea, who didn\u2019t quite manage to leave the building before the shutdown. She had earlier conveyed from PGN a \u201ctypically balanced and nuanced \u2018fuck off\u2019\u201d with regards to Logan\u2019s takeover bid but the mogul sensed some wiggle room and so it proves. Kendall begins throwing figures at her in a one-sided bidding war, starting at $21bn. Shiv is surprised to be observing all this; we know she is against the takeover but no one else in the room, not even Rhea, seems to share that sentiment. Logan says the issue is one of trust. If PGN can trust him when he says he won\u2019t interfere editorially, a deal may be on. Rhea suggests that a good \u201cpeace offering\u201d would be to ditch the \u201cWalmart Mussolini\u201d Ravenhead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan Ruck as Connor Roy.

Connor, who regards the service as a campaign fundraising opportunity, however, is in attendance. Willa makes a gaffe when she refers to the deceased as Mo to his widow. That was his nickname; his real name was Lester. \u201cDad wouldn\u2019t let us in the pool with him,\u201d says Connor. At the funeral, he is confronted by Michelle, Logan\u2019s biographer but gives nothing away, even paring down his eulogy to the barest of facts to stymie her.\n\nAs the \u201cgunman\u201d is revealed to be an ATN producer who killed himself at his desk, Greg suggests to Tom that he maybe leave his current job as underling? Seeing a fellow worker used as a human footstool did not help. Tom rains water bottles and the fury of a slaveowner on him; \u201cI will not let go of what is mine!\u201d Later, however, when Greg tries blackmail, mentioning certain documents he possesses, Tom strangely beams with pride at Greg, offering him a new title and big pay rise.\n\nIt has been a tough day for Roman, despite making a friend in trainee Brian, and he tries to relax with some phone sex with Tabitha. It doesn\u2019t work out, however, and in frustration, he phones Gerri. Something has been stirring between them since last week and an initially heated conversation becomes arousing for Roman as he invites her to shower him with insults.\n\nBack at the office, having circled each other all day, Shiv confronts Kendall on his closeness to their dad. Is he blackmailing him? How does he get away with the drugs, and a recurring kleptomania problem? A tearful Kendall assures her, re the succession, that \u201cit\u2019s not going to me.\u201d Being useful to Dad is not a strategy but his reason for living. They hug; he returns to the rooftop.\n\nThe Heir Apparent\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kendall and Siobhan (Sarah Snook). Photograph: HBO\n\nHard to call. Shiv is marginalised by Logan in the PGN deal, in which Kendall plays a prominent role. But something is eating at Kendall; for all his executive success, he\u2019s barely hanging on to life. If they are in competition, he seems to concede at the conclusion. Logan, meanwhile, clearly and consciously, is playing them off against each other.\n\nNotes and observations\n\n", "description": "A tough day for Roman, while Shiv finally confronts Kendall on his closeness to their dad.
