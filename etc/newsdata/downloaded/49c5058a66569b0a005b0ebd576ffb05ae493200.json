Now, at 20 years old, he has one of the biggest 'pick your own\u2019 pumpkin patches in the country\n\nJames Maxey was just 13 when he started growing pumpkins on his family farm to sell to his friends for a bit of extra pocket money.\n\nSeven years on, his \u2018pick your own\u2019 pumpkin patch is one of the biggest in the country, and now sells 25,000 of them each autumn.\n\nIt attracts more than 100,000 visitors in October and is now a big part of his family\u2019s farming business.\n\nMr Maxey started off with just 200 pumpkins on half an acre. The family now produce 20 different varieties of different shapes, sizes and colour - including one called a \u2018warty goblin\u2019 which has lumps all over it.\n\nThey cover almost six acres on their farm in Kirklington, Nottinghamshire.\n\nMr Maxey, now 20, said: \u2018I started when I was 13 next to the farm shop with a little half-an-acre field with about 200 pumpkins in it which I sold to my school friends.\n\n\u2018Every year I planted more and more and now I\u2019ve about five or six acres.\u2019\n\nThe success of his pumpkin empire led him to leave school at 16 to run the business full-time.\n\nMr Maxey started selling pumpkins for pocket money. He said: \u2018I started when I was 13 next to the farm shop with a little half-an-acre field with about 200 pumpkins in it which I sold to my school friends'\n\n\u2018I have always wanted to be out and could never sit in a classroom or anything,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have always got to be out doing something.\u2019\n\nPhotographs taken from above by a drone have captured the scale of the huge operation.\n\nMr Maxey said: \u2018We grow around 25,000 pumpkins, which includes 20 different varieties. They are all different shapes, sizes, colours so it\u2019s grown massively.\n\n\u2018It takes about week to plant them in the field but about six months to wait for them to grow.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve done this for seven years and we\u2019ve struggled to keep up with demand. It\u2019s a very busy time for us and we\u2019ve delighted with how it\u2019s grown.'\n\nThe pumpkins now cover almost six acres on his parents' farm in Kirklington, Nottinghamshire, and he sells 25,000 of them each autumn\n\nMr Maxey runs the pumpkin business from the farm owned by his parents Keith, 50, and Katherine, 47.\n\nHe employs 35 staff to run the seasonal business, which is open from 9am until 5pm, seven days-a-week up to Halloween.\n\nThe price of the pumpkins ranges from \u00a32 for smaller ones to \u00a310 for the largest.\n\nBut despite being surrounded by pumpkins, Mr Maxey is not a fan of their taste.\n\nHe said: \u2018I roasted one last year because I thought I should at least try eating one but I wasn\u2019t keen.\n\nMr Maxey employs 35 staff to run the seasonal business, which is open from 9am until 5pm, seven days-a-week up to Halloween\n\nThe price of the pumpkins ranges from \u00a32 for smaller ones to \u00a310 for the largest. But despite being surrounded by pumpkins, Mr Maxey is not a fan of their taste\n\n\u2018I think most people buy them to decorate at Halloween but we supply a number of restaurants and shops so obviously people do enjoy their taste.\u2019\n\nMr Maxey buys thousands of pumpkin seeds from a supplier in Lincolnshire which he plants in the fields in the Spring with a converted planter attached to a tractor.\n\n\u2018Every year we grow more and more pumpkins to keep up with the demand because in previous years we have run out before Halloween but last year and this year we have grown a lot more to take us through to the 31st,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Any pumpkins which are left over get chopped up and ploughed back into the soil so nothing is wasted.\n\nMr Maxey buys thousands of pumpkin seeds from a supplier in Lincolnshire which he plants in the fields in the Spring with a converted planter attached to a tractor\n\n\u2018The soil around this area has quite a lot of clay in it which I think helps our pumpkins maintain their deep dark orange colour.\n\n\u2018In supermarkets pumpkins tend to be quite light and almost yellow but ours have a nice dark colour to them which people like.\u2019\n\nPumpkins have become synonymous with Halloween, with parents and children enjoying cutting out faces to make spooky lamps.\n\nFigures show sales have jumped by nearly a third since last year.\n\nHouseholds have already spent \u00a31.5 million on squashes in the build-up to Halloween, 29 per cent up on the same period in 2018, according to researcher Kantar.\n\nLast year, Poundland removed polystyrene pumpkins from sale for Halloween after receiving backlash over plastic pollution.", "description": "James Maxey started off with 200 pumpkins on half an acre but now covers six acres.
