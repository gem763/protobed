Ideologies are reductive and lead us to exaggerate in our attempt to understand intellectually, but without accepting, understand without admiring, understand without assuming, and then reality is received in categories, the most common of which are the categories of \u2018isms.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis said Monday that Amazonian tribal wear is not much different from the odd hats that Church officials wear.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
