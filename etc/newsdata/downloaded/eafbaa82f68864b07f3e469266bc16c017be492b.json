Black Mirror is officially happening guys. It\u2019s here.'\n\nBut Caroline, 39, quickly wrote back: 'Have you managed to see a copy before me ? Please forward .. am desperate to see..'\n\nMore to say: Jameela Jamil had started a feud with Caroline Flack over her new show The Surjury in which candidates have to pitch their plastic surgery dreams to a jury of people\n\nShe's not impressed: Jameela loves to attack women who do things she doesn't agree with - sometimes justified - but Caroline wasn't taking her words lying down\n\nTwo sides to every story: Caroline had some choice words for Jameela after her post\n\nThe premise of The Surjury is that participants will go under the knife if they are given the thumbs-up by a 12-strong jury.\n\nContestants will have to secure 75 per cent of the jury vote to get their procedure, and then will be invited back to 'show off the results' after a few months.\n\nCaroline's new show recently wrapped up filming in Manchester, and is expected to air on Channel 4 in early 2020.\n\nBut following Jameela's post, a fan tweeted Caroline: 'How can you be so defensive about a show this toxic and exploitative that you\u2019re willingly hosting?'\n\nShe replied: 'Because I\u2019ve filmed it and the people who have taken part are amazing and have been through a lot and life is about individual choice...'\n\nSorry, what? But Caroline seemed confused as to why Jameela was attacking the show before she has even seen it\n\nAnother fan then wrote: 'Are you saying it's not how the article suggested? Is it done in a 'positive, compassionate way\"?\n\n'After reading about your personal journey with your mental health I'm surprised at your choice of job but ultimately they would have got another presenter.'\n\nCaroline responded: 'Well mental health is a sensitive subject and as we progress we are constantly asked to be more open and visible.\n\n'My feeling toward the show is that it opens up conversations on why some people turn to surgery to help them lead the life that they believe will make them happier.'\n\nHappy to talk: Caroline answered fans who had questions about the show and explained why she felt happy to present it despite its controversial nature\n\nOpen and honest: Caroline said the show goes a lot deeper than one might think and addresses why people feel the need to get surgery\n\nIt's true that Jameela has not seen the show yet and a Channel 4 spokesperson insists the main focus is actually about giving people confidence.\n\nA Channel 4 rep previously told The Sun: 'Rather than wag a disapproving finger, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 and allows those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice.\n\n'The show will neither glamourise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities. All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord.'\n\nThey're not a fan: At first glance, it appears as though Jameela has a lot of support for her words as many thought the show's concept was questionable\n\nRoss McCarthy, executive producer for show creators Gobstopper Television, added: 'This is a totally new way of doing peer-to- peer advice.\n\n'Our pitchers will either get the surgery they\u2019ve always wanted, or a massive boost in confidence when the public rules they don\u2019t need work at all!'\n\nCaroline first announced the news that she would be presenting the show on social media, writing: 'Over the Mooooooon to be hosting my first @channel4 show \u2764\ufe0f #thesurjury.\u2019\n\nJameela has previously started spats with the Kardashians for promoting laxative weight-loss products, Victoria's Secret model Sara Sampaio over a 'starved' models post.\n\nShe's also locked horns with Piers Morgan, who labelled her a 'virtue-signalling twerp' after the actress said criticism of the Duchess of Sussex was rooted in racism.\n\nHowever, Jameela seemed to have a lot of support on Twitter as fans wrote about their own concerns about the show's concept.\n\nThey wrote: 'Do people all want to look the same. I love crooked teeth, an interesting nose or pokey out ears, it\u2019s these differences that make us beautiful and interesting. You look at Ivanka Trump, she\u2019s had so much surgery she can\u2019t talk properly and is unrecognisable from her teens.'\n\n'It blows my mind that enough people thought this was an acceptable idea and that it has gone this far. How was it not shut down the moment the idea was pitched??? Ffs, the human race is doomed.'\n\nMixed opinions: Lots of people were taking Caroline's side in the row as well and accused Jameela of knocking others down in order to get her point across\n\n'I'll feel bad for someone who watches the show & feels disgusted with themselves because they might resemble 1 of the \"before\" contestants, but ultimately it's their bodies to do what they want with. I mean I'll never give it 30 seconds of my time, but that's people's own choice.'\n\nYet lots of people were taking Caroline's side as well on social media.\n\nThey wrote: '@jameelajamil how can you say you\u2019re a feminist and preach about mental health when you\u2019re literally knocking another woman\u2019s work and as such, encouraging others to do the same before the programme has even aired?!'\n\n'Exactly Caroline... If people CHOOSE to have surgery it is THEIR choice! I\u2019m getting fed up of folk taking other people\u2019s choices away from them... it is easy to be all fluffy and say \u2018accept who you are\u2019 .... it isn\u2019t that simple! If surgery makes someone happy, I\u2019m all 4 it.'\n\nControversy: Earlier this year, surgeons condemned the programme for 'glamorising' procedures (file photo)\n\n'Oops, another day another Twitter spat. Jameela even though you are doing good it this dirty old world doesn't it get draining, scrapping with people on social media every day.'\n\nEarlier this year, medical professionals warned of the potential harm of the programme, saying it glamorises and trivialises life-changing procedures, and could lead to a rise in botched surgeries.\n\nChannel 4 director Ian Katz said the aim of the broadcaster was to 'make entertaining, mischievous and innovative shows about the big issues and arguments in Britain today'.\n\nThe British Association Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) president and surgeon Mark Henley said: 'We are extremely concerned about the message this programme portrays and its particular focus on young people.\n\n'Based on the promotional materials alone, we believe the show will trivialise the serious decision all should take when considering aesthetic procedures.\n\nReady to go! In a new Instagram post shared to her account, the Love Island presenter recently enthused she's 'over the moon' to front her first show for Channel 4\n\n'It is disappointing that, in 2019, we are still having to remind large broadcasters of the potential harm caused by glamorising cosmetic surgery - particularly when targeting young adults or those with self-esteem issues.'\n\nChannel 4 said in promoting the show: 'From bum-lifts to nose jobs, sculpted abs to breast enlargements, The Surjury allows people to explore their choices more thoroughly.'\n\nSurgeons have suggested many people who have gone under the knife are less confident after a procedure than they were before.\n\nMark added: 'There is every chance that a show like The Surjury - which asks young people to 'pitch' their 'dream' surgery to a panel - will encourage viewers to rush into personal decisions about cosmetic procedures without considering all outcomes and risks, or taking the time to ensure they visit a reputable surgeon.\n\n'This is particularly a concern given the frequency with which BAPRAS surgeons are having to perform complicated reconstructive procedures on individuals who have received 'botched surgery' both at home and abroad.'", "description": "Jameela Jamil has laid into Caroline Flack's new show, Surjury, before it has even aired.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/19881076-0-image-a-87_1571396995369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
