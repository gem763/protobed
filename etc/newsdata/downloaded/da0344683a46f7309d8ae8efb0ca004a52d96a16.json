He tried limiting his minutes, sometimes no more than two or five minutes a game. He tried sitting him for several games at a time.\n\nThe team tried having Bennett work more closely with coaches before and after practices. Teammates tried expressing words of encouragement to build Bennett\u2019s confidence.\n\nStill, the struggles persisted.\n\nBennett shot 35.6 percent from the field that season. He was poorly conditioned. He couldn\u2019t defend. And he never played consistent minutes.\n\nThe Cavaliers had taken a chance on the 6-foot-8, 245-pound power forward. They drafted him No. 1 overall in a 2013 NBA draft that included Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, CJ McCollum and Victor Oladipo, but it was a talent pool that didn\u2019t feature any clear-cut superstars at the time.\n\nBennett, then 20 years old, was supposed to give the Cavs another piece to add to Thompson and Kyrie Irving to help lift the team into contention after three straight losing seasons in the wake of LeBron James\u2019 free-agent departure in 2010.\n\nBut four games into the season, he hadn\u2019t scored a field goal. His only points came from a pair of free throws in his first game. He averaged 4.2 points and three rebounds for the year. He played in just one of the final 18 games. And he was traded to Minnesota after the season ended.\n\nStory continues\n\nBennett spent his next three seasons on three teams. He averaged 5.2 points in 57 games for the Timberwolves in 2014-15, then 1.5 points in 19 games for the Toronto Raptors in 2015-16, and five points in 23 games before he was waived by the Brooklyn Nets in 2017.\n\nTeams questioned his desire. They wondered whether he had the drive to work when things got tough. He didn\u2019t develop into the player he needed to be as the No. 1 pick, at least not quickly enough, and he was out of the league and termed a bust before age 25.\n\nPerhaps that player everyone expected him to be is still there. Bennett\u2019s made a name for himself in the G League in the past couple of years. He\u2019s averaged career highs in points, rebounds and minutes.\n\nCoaches have said the Brampton, Ontario, native\u2019s story is not yet over. And in July, the Houston Rockets offered Bennett a non-guaranteed deal for the upcoming season.\n\nHis shot at redemption might be close, but he\u2019ll need to show flashes of the player he was long before he ever donned an NBA jersey.\n\nThings didn't go well for Anthony Bennett in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Mark Duncan)\n\nBennett was a special player\n\nIn his younger days, Bennett was typically one of the most explosive players on the court.\n\nHe was a five-star recruit out of Findlay Prep High School in Henderson, Nevada. He played AAU basketball for CIA Bounce. He played for the Canadian National Team\u2019s Under-16 and Under-17 teams in the FIBA World Championships and led Canada to two consecutive bronze medals.\n\nHe\u2019d developed the reputation of being a naturally athletic, versatile offensive weapon who could rise up for a thunderous dunk or shoot from anywhere on the court.\n\n\u201cHe was powerful,\u201d said Mike Peck, Bennett\u2019s coach at Findlay Prep. \u201cHe had great size from his body, his frame. And once he got with us, he was consistently in our lifting program. He put the strength on that frame. Just naturally, he was athletic.\n\n\u201cWhen he would finish sometimes, when he got a lane to the basket or when he was at the rim, it was heads-up. Look out.\u201d\n\nBennett wasn\u2019t in good playing shape when he arrived for his junior year at Findlay Prep after attending Mountain State Academy in Beckley, West Virginia. He spent most of that season on the bench, something Peck credited with setting him up for a standout senior year.\n\n\u201cNot playing much and watching games from the bench \u2026 sometimes that\u2019s the best teacher and motivator there is,\u201d Peck said. \u201c[Players] don\u2019t want to sit and watch games. They want to be out there playing. I think that probably motivated him. And \u2026 I think he saw and realized, \u2018I need to step it up.\u2019 And my guess is that\u2019s what got him and put him in another gear and got his mind focused on what it needed to be, and he really took off.\u201d\n\nDespite his explosiveness on the court, Peck noticed Bennett\u2019s level of conditioning was not where it needed to be.\n\n\u201cHe was one of those guys that when he had time off, hey, you\u2019re not one of those guys that\u2019s just gifted in the area of conditioning where you can just take four days and sit on the couch,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to do something. I\u2019m not saying you gotta run 40-yard sprints for an hour and a half. But you gotta do something because your level of conditioning can go down quicker.\u201d\n\nStill, Bennett led the team to a 32-1 record and its third straight ESPN National High School Invitational Championship, and he grabbed the attention of schools around the country, including Florida, Oregon, Washington and UNLV.\n\nIt started out so well\n\nThere were less than two minutes left in a game against Cal early in the 2012-13 season.\n\nCoach Dave Rice\u2019s UNLV team led for most of the second half but trailed the Golden Bears by two points.\n\nBennett, a freshman, caught the ball on the baseline, faked a 3-point shot, then launched himself toward the basketball with his limbs stretched as far as his body would allow before slamming the ball through the hoop.\n\nRice still remembers the play. He still remembers Bennett\u2019s 25-point performance that night.\n\n\u201cThe bigger the game, the better he played,\u201d Rice said. \u201c\u2026 I walked off the court after we\u2019d won that night \u2013 and I already knew we had a special player \u2013 but it was very obvious that he was different, that he had a very, very bright future.\u201d\n\nBennett made what Rice described as \u201cmomentum-changing plays\u201d at UNLV. Though he only coached him for one year, Rice admired Bennett\u2019s humility, his maturity and his team-first attitude.\n\nHe added that Bennett never missed a game at UNLV. He did everything coaches asked him to do, and he stayed after practice to get extra work in.\n\n\u201cHe was the kind of guy you want on your college team every year because he was so talented,\u201d Rice said. \u201cHe was a top-10 player coming out of high school. He would go on to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft. And yet, he was all about the team \u2026 and he was easy to coach because he had a great basketball IQ, and he wanted to win. He wanted to be part of it, but he wanted his team to share in it. He always wanted to include everyone.\u201d\n\nRice sat next to Bennett the day he officially declared for the draft in 2013. They both wore UNLV polo shirts to the news conference \u2013 Rice was in red, Bennett sat to his right in black.\n\nBennett made little effort to hide his emotions that day. He held his face in the palm of his right hand before raising his face to address reporters.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank all of you for coming out. Thank you for all the support this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as of today, I\u2019m here to announce that I\u2019m declaring for the 2013 NBA draft. I know it\u2019s not gonna be easy, but I\u2019m ready to learn and work hard.\u201d\n\nAnthony Bennett last played in the NBA with the Nets in 2017. (Rick Madonik/Toronto Star via Getty Images)\n\nHow did it go wrong?\n\nCJ Miles had only seen a few of Bennett\u2019s games at UNLV before Cleveland drafted him.\n\n\u201cHe was a monster,\u201d said Miles, who was starting his second season with the Cavs when Bennett joined the team. \u201cAt that time, this is when the league was really starting to turn towards that three and four position, and definitely stretch fours and smaller guys.\n\n\u201cHe was breaking the mold. He was big enough, strong enough and skillful enough to be right in that spot. He was a super athlete at this time.\u201d\n\nMuch like other NBA fans who were tuning in to Cavs games to see what the No. 1 pick would do, Miles was focused on Bennett.\n\nHe watched him struggle in areas he\u2019d excelled in when he was younger.\n\n\u201cHe missed a free throw, and he kind of put his head down because he had been struggling,\u201d Miles said of one of Bennett\u2019s first NBA games. \u201cAnd I told him, \u2018It\u2019s the same game you\u2019ve been playing. It\u2019s the same skill set you have that got you here,\u2019 and just tried to remind him that.\u201d\n\nBennett\u2019s inability to adjust to this new level of basketball went hand in hand with the perception that he didn\u2019t have the desire to improve.\n\nMiles watched Bennett play with drooping shoulders, a lowered head and an indecipherable expression on his face.\n\nBennett had always been quiet and unassuming. Even Peck noticed it when Bennett was younger. He wasn\u2019t a conversational person. He rarely engaged in a lot of dialogue.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside ... if you\u2019re struggling, and you\u2019re not showing emotion either, it\u2019s really hard because now it\u2019s like, \u2018He must not want to get better,\u2019 or, \u2018He must not want it,\u2019\u201d Miles said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at it that way because his demeanor is \u2026 he\u2019s not showing emotion. I don\u2019t think anybody ever looks at it from that route.\n\n\u201cThey just look at it like, \u2018He should be fired up.\u2019 And some people aren\u2019t built like that. That\u2019s just not how they do things. Granted, he was like any young kid. He had to learn how to work.\u201d\n\nCan Bennett make it back to the NBA?\n\nCoach Brian Adams received an email before the beginning of the season last year that said his Agua Caliente Clippers (the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 G League affiliate) would trade for Bennett\u2019s rights for the upcoming season.\n\nAdams, previously a coaching associate for the Clippers, said he was nervous before meeting Bennett.\n\nHe\u2019d seen his highlights with the Maine Red Claws the previous year, where he\u2019d averaged 16 points and 7.6 rebounds, but he knew little about the type of person and player Bennett was until the season started.\n\n\u201cHe was open to whatever it took,\u201d Adams said of coaching Bennett.\n\nBennett was in good shape and showed no signs of poor work ethic when he joined the team in Ontario, California, Adams said.\n\nHe spent hours in the gym throughout the season \u2013 so many that he had to be told to leave at times.\n\nHe showed he could still be the effective shooter he once was. Against the Austin Spurs early in the season, he scored 36 points, knocking down eight 3-pointers and missing just one of 13 free throw attempts.\n\nHe developed a consistent pre- and post-workout routine that included a warmup and movement drills, followed by a series of midrange jumpers and 3-pointers.\n\nBennett dealt with a couple of knee injuries in the G League, and his health has been an issue throughout his career. But the more time Adams spent with Bennett, the more he felt some of the previous criticisms were based on misconceptions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a quiet kid that wants to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to be a good NBA player.\u201d\n\nBennett\u2019s been described as relatively undersized at 6-8, but he fits the mold of the new-age NBA big man. Perhaps his recently elevated game and ability to stretch the floor will be enough to resurrect his NBA career with Houston, which opens training camp at the end of the month.\n\nPeck\u2019s message to him is to know his role on a Houston team that already has offensive weapons in James Harden and Russell Westbrook.\n\nAdams\u2019 advice is to forget the past and the pressure of being the No.1 pick.\n\nAnd Rice is simply proud of the work Bennett\u2019s put in to get himself to this point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told people for two or three years that he\u2019s gonna have another opportunity,\u201d Rice said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna work.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After flaming out early, Bennett has had success in the G League and now he has another shot with the Rockets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OueV.m.nj5fOeRNR.xeitQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i99YjxWHLo6OilRhFZjG.A--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b1855f90-d4c3-11e9-baaf-d46af1f9072e", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
