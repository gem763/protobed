Twitter/Led By Donkeys\n\nMr Martin, who heads the new International Crime Coordination Centre, said the issue was one of the \u201cbiggest challenges\u201d for UK law enforcement bodies trying to mitigate the impact of Brexit.\n\nHe said police leaders had been in discussions with the Home Office about introducing a power of arrest for Interpol red notices from EU member states.\n\n\u201cLegislation is being drafted by the Home Office at the moment,\u201d Mr Martin said. \u201cMy understanding is it won\u2019t be in before 31 October but they\u2019re hoping to get it into the next session [of parliament].\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSince March we\u2019ve upped the gear with the Home Office to try to get this through.\u201d\n\nYvette Cooper, the chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said the potential law was first raised in spring and questioned why it was not ready in time for Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve previously been told that there is a significant reduction in security and policing capability in the event of no deal,\u201d she added.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

These are largely tried and tested mechanisms that we already use for cooperating with many non-EU countries.\n\n\u201cA strong security relationship between the UK and the EU in the future is in everyone\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nLater on Wednesday, Sajid Javid announced new funding for police forces across England and Wales to recruit the 20,000 new officers promised by the prime minister.\n\nThe chancellor promised \u00a3750m for the first year of the uplift, with \u00a345m to be spent by the end of 2019 to get the first 2,000 officers in place.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen too many horrifying stabbings on Britain\u2019s streets, so with our frontline officers reporting that they are overstretched it\u2019s clearly time to act and do more,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice leaders have raised doubts over whether there will be enough suitable candidates or sufficient training capacity to hit the target in three years.\n\nAnalysis by The Independent suggests that more than 46,000 will have to be hired to meet the target and replace departing officers, and more than half of police forces are failing to meet recruitment targets.\n\nEven if achieved, the uplift would still fall short of the 21,000 officers lost since 2010 \u2013 and there are no plans to reverse the separate decline of 15,000 police staff.\n\nJohn Apter, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: \u201cWhat must be ensured is that this initial momentum is maintained, and the full 20,000 uplift of extra officers is achieved. These must be genuine extra officers. And now we need to see more detail of how and when all of this will be achieved.\u201d\n\nThe sharp reduction in funding for police and the wider criminal justice system has been linked to rising violence and plummeting prosecution rates.\n\n\u201cToday we invest more in our criminal justice system to manage that increasing demand, with a 5 per cent real-terms increase in the resource budget for the Ministry of Justice and an increase in their capital budget to \u00a3620m next year, and an extra \u00a380m for the Crown Prosecution Service,\u201d Mr Javid said.\n\n\u201cTaken together today\u2019s spending round will dramatically improve the functioning of the criminal justice system, with more prosecutors, a reformed probation system, better security in prisons and funding to begin delivery of 10,000 new prison places.\u201d\n\nHe also announced a formal review of tackling serious and organised crime, and \u00a330m to tackle online child exploitation.\n\nThe Bar Council said the announcements were \u201cdrops in the ocean in budgetary terms and will only go so far in restoring a justice system which is falling apart at the seams\u201d.\n\nNational Police Chiefs\u2019 Council chair Martin Hewitt said extra officers would help reduce crime and ease pressure on officers, adding: \u201cAdditional funding announced for the wider criminal justice system is also very welcome as it will help to improve criminal justice outcomes and hold criminals to account.", "description": "Police officers will not be able to arrest internationally wanted murderers, rapists and criminals on sight after a no-deal Brexit because the government has failed to bring in the necessary law.
