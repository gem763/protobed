The supported this outlook in two primary ways:\n\n1. Removed Phrase Stating That The Committee \u201c\u2026Will Act To Sustain The Expansion\u2026\u201d\n\n2. Bullard\u2019s Dovish Dissent Disappears\n\nThe only substantive change the committee\u2019s monetary policy statement was to remove the phrase it has used to hint at interest-rate cuts in the past. With this tweak, it\u2019s clear that the Fed views its \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d as complete and that any further interest-rate cuts will be in reaction to slowing economic data.\n\nAfter dissenting in favor of an immediate 50bps cut to the Fed Funds rate last month, James Bullard joined the majority in voting for just a 25bps cut this time around. Meanwhile, the hawkish voters (Esther George and Eric Rosengren) still preferred rates to remain steady, meaning that in aggregate, the central bank may be leaning toward leaving interest rates unchanged in December as it currently stands.\n\nFOMC Takeaways\n\nSource: FOREX.com\n\nIn the immediate reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision, traders trimmed bets on an interest-rate cut next month, with the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool now showing the of such a move dropping from 27% to 22% ahead of Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s press conference. In terms of market moves, we saw the tack on about 10 pips against its major rivals and yields on U.S. treasury bonds tick up 1-2bps.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Chairman Powell noted that monetary policy is \u201cin a good place now,\u201d supporting the notion that any further cuts will require deteriorating data.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: US Dollar Index Futures.
