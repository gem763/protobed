There are no words to properly describe my feelings toward that film.\n\nTo be clear, you should go see Parasite, the new movie from Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho, assuming any of this sounds appealing to you. The film somehow manages to strike a balance between being very fun and funny, and being extremely tense and serious, packed inside what could maybe be very vaguely described as a heist movie about class, earning every moment of it along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you get to see a movie where you truly have no concept of where it\u2019s headed, and Parasite delivers on that in a deeply fulfilling way.\n\nCheck out seven trailers from this week below.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nHere it is, the one and only trailer that matters this week. This month. This year? I\u2019m excited, and I\u2019ve already bought my tickets (for night two, so everyone be cool). I\u2019ll admit: I kind of imagined Kylo being the main villain in this one, and I\u2019m not sure how the return of an antagonist who\u2019s been entirely absent for two films is going to pan out. But we\u2019ll see soon enough \u2014 the film comes out December 20th.\n\nSilicon Valley\n\nSilicon Valley is wrapping up after a six-year run, and it arrives at a time when big tech might need more skewering than ever. The season starts October 27th.\n\nBloodshot\n\nYou know, for a movie with a name as truly dumb as Bloodshot, Bloodshot has a much more interesting sci-fi conceit than you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s sort of like Edge of Tomorrow, but with a darker element of manipulation and more rippling muscles. (I haven\u2019t seen Edge of Tomorrow so... apologies if those are also in that movie.) It comes out February 21st.\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables\n\nAmazon is bringing France\u2019s 2020 Oscar submission to the US. The film, from director Ladj Ly and winner of Cannes\u2019 Jury Prize (essentially 3rd place, though worth noting that it lost to Parasite, which, having just seen Parasite, ...yeah), is inspired by the 2005 riots in Paris, focusing on a group of men tasked with keeping the peace. It comes to theaters January 10th.\n\nI\u2019m With The Band: Nasty Cherry\n\nEverything I see from Charli XCX makes it clear how much of a pop genius she is, and this just seems to be the latest example. She\u2019s crafting a new band and using a Netflix show to help build their star power along the way. I have no doubt she\u2019ll write them some seriously catchy songs, too. The show comes out November 15th.\n\nThe Aeronauts\n\nWhile I think the combination of Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones, and hot air balloons is generally a little cheesy, I\u2019ve heard good things about The Aeronauts so far. Amazon recently abbreviated the film\u2019s theatrical run, so it starts streaming on December 20th, after premiering in theaters just two weeks earlier, on December 6th.\n\nThe King\n\nThe King has actually been in a very small number of theaters for the past two weeks, but now it\u2019s a week away from heading to Netflix. It\u2019s a surprisingly cool-looking adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, and it might just hold us over until the 2019 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet performance we\u2019re really waiting for comes along \u2014 his role as Laurie in Little Women. The King starts streaming November 1st.", "description": "I\u2019m writing this entire column having just gotten back from seeing Parasite, so you\u2019ll have to excuse me if my thoughts are a little scattered because Parasite is, to put it mildly, completely...", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUiRAwejs4hoIOFuo23B2WQWlCk=/192x0:1728x804/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19320548/ep9_ff_001865_f9ad975f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
