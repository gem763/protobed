I explained to her why I needed my aisle seat, but at this point, everyone was looking at me like I\u2019m this raging arsehole for separating a mum from her kids.\u201d\n\nFor all the people-pleasers out there, we\u2019re here to tell you: You do not have to agree to change seats when asked. Seating assignments are first-come, first-serve (or in many cases, something you\u2019ve paid a premium for) which means getting the seat you want is each passenger\u2019s own responsibility. Below are a few instances you might find yourself in and why it\u2019s perfectly OK to refuse a request to trade \u2014 and the rare instance in which you actually might prefer to swap seats.\n\nThey offer a bad exchange\n\nA passenger in a middle seat has asked for your coveted aisle one. Politely refuse and explain that you prefer the seat you picked; as the Points Guy writes, if you\u2019re asked why you\u2019re unwilling to trade, a simple \u201cbecause this is my assigned seat\u201d will suffice. Or be honest and explain that you just don\u2019t want a middle seat. Unless the exchange is equal, like one aisle seat for another, don\u2019t consider the trade.\n\nYou have a quick connection\n\nYou\u2019re seated at the front of a flight so you can quickly deplane and make your connection. Don\u2019t let someone take your seat and potentially compromise your ability to make your connecting flight. Explain the circumstances and why their seat would make it difficult for you to board your next flight on time. They should understand and willingly walk away in defeat. You\u2019ve got a perfectly good reason to hang onto your seat here, and even if you didn\u2019t, the other person was never entitled to it in the first place.\n\nA passenger wants to sit next to their partner\n\nIt\u2019s the most common excuse of them all; you\u2019re seated next to the friend or partner of someone who\u2019s sitting several rows back in the plane, and they\u2019re wondering if you\u2019ll switch so they can spend the flight together. Sounds nice, but you don\u2019t have to move. They can survive without each other for a few hours, and if their need for each other was really that dire, they could have planned in advance and booked seats next to each other. Stay put.\n\nWhen you should give in\n\nThere\u2019s no circumstance under which you are required to give up your seat (unless an airline is involuntarily bumping you from a flight, but that\u2019s an entirely separate discussion) \u2014 but there are times when you might want to trade. If the seat being offered to you is an upgrade, like they are offering an exit row seat with extra legroom, then go for it. If the exchange is equal but might benefit that person who can sit alongside their child, then you could trade if you\u2019re feeling charitable.\n\nBut don\u2019t give in if you feel inconvenienced at all by the request. If you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll ask another passenger or simply give up. And if you\u2019re dreading spending a flight alongside a bitter passenger whom you\u2019ve denied the chance to spend a couple hours gabbing with their partner, remember: It\u2019s not your fault. Put on a movie or a pair of headphones and let them stew in their middle seat.", "description": "On a recent Reddit thread, u/christontoast666 explained his moral dilemma when agreeing to switch seats on a flight with another passenger. \u201cI booked an aisle seat on a 12-hour flight to Europe, and when I got on the plane, a woman asked me if I would mind switching with her so she could sit with her kids,\u201d he...", "authors": ["Spandas Lui", "Tooran Alizadeh", "Edward Helderop", "Tony Grubesic"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/mrffeb1lidthllf8eabx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
