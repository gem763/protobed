Especially when you fly to the other side of the globe for the pleasure of snapping some Insta-worthy shots. Imagine that once you get there, you\u2019re struck with disappointment: the reality looks nothing like the pics you drooled over on Instagram.\n\nThis is probably what happens to countless travellers who come to Penataran Agung Lempuyang temple in Bali, a frequent sight on Instagram feeds. Many photos on social media will show the wildly popular tourist hotspot reflected against a body of water. In reality though, the temple is not at all surrounded by water and the reflection is actually fabricated through a camera trick. The photographer cleverly places a mirror under the camera lens in such a way that the entire image appears to be reflected on the non-existent water.\n\nThis case definitely highlights the importance of doing your homework before going on vacation, to manage your expectations. Reports of camera illusions aren\u2019t difficult to find online. To find out more about the sham, I searched for the temple on YouTube and found a video review by Indian vlogger Antarik Anwesan.\n\n\n\nIn the video, Anwesan documents his journey to Penataran Agung Lempuyang temple in Karangasem, Bali. While waiting in line to take a photo in front of the \u201cGate of Heaven\u201d, the name used by tourists for the temple, he notes that more people were in line for a photo than for the actual temple. He ended up waiting two hours for his turn to snap a pic.\n\nBefore you cancel your trip to the temple though, be comforted that there\u2019s still a chance for you to snap a photo of the temple and it\u2019s reflection without manipulation. Well that is, if you\u2019re as lucky as this French tourist who was able to take a genuine photo because of a huge puddle in front of the Gate of Heaven.\n\nPerhaps this is also a good reminder not to believe everything you see on Instagram. In Brazil, home to the Instagram hotspot Pedra Do Telegrafo, tourists snap photos that show them seemingly risking their lives hanging off the edge of a cliff.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s just an illusion. They\u2019re actually hanging off a rock that\u2019s barely off the ground.\n\n\n\nAnother similar spot is the Yangzhou Zhongshuge library and bookstore in China. The floor is basically a huge black mirror that reflects the curved bookshelves, making it look like the subject of the photo is floating in a massive\u2026 book tunnel.\n\nBetter yet, here\u2019s another reminder: when traveling, seek out the experience, not something to show off on social media.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE Indonesia.", "description": "The camera trick used at Lempuyang temple, popularly known as 'Gate of Heaven\u2019, is more common around the world than you may think.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d22e93fcf32c8000845f45c/lede/1562569665986-Untitled-design-38.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
