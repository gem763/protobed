You\u2019re a progressive voter who likes Elizabeth Warren. You drive a Prius, hate guns, and buy kale in bulk, but you find out that Warren does not support taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery for convicts. So, that\u2019s it? Dealbreaker?

This is the binary thing Democrats don\u2019t get because apparently they never saw the movie \u2018Officer and a Gentleman\u2019 where a drill sergeant forces Richard Gere to admit the same truth that Democratic voters need to face: \u201cI got nowhere else to go.\u201d\n\nYes. You hear that Bernie, and Elizabeth, and Beto, and the rest of them? They\u2019ve got nowhere else to go.
