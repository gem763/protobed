REUTERS/Aly Song/Files\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will seek to narrow differences enough to avoid a scheduled Oct. 15 tariff rate increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nBut the atmosphere surrounding the talks was soured by the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s decision on Monday to blacklist 28 Chinese public security bureaus, technology and surveillance firms, citing human rights violations of Muslim minority groups in China\u2019s Xinjiang province. A day later, the U.S. State Department imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials related to the Xinjiang issue.\n\nIf negotiations break down again, by Dec. 15, nearly all Chinese goods imports into the United States \u2014 more than $500 billion \u2014 could be subject to punitive tariffs in the dispute that erupted during U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in Sydney on Thursday that the tariffs were working, forcing Beijing to pay attention to U.S. concerns about its trade practices.\n\n\u201cWe do not love tariffs, in fact we would prefer not to use them, but after years of discussions and no action, tariffs are finally forcing China to pay attention to our concerns,\u201d Ross said in remarks prepared for delivery on an official visit to Australia.\n\nAlthough some media reports suggested both sides are considering an \u201cinterim\u201d deal that would suspend planned further U.S. tariffs in exchange for additional purchases of American farm products, Trump has repeatedly dismissed this idea, insisting that he wants a \u201cbig deal\u201d with Beijing that addresses core intellectual property issues.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington on Wednesday, Trump said: \u201cIf we can make a deal, we\u2019re going to make a deal, there\u2019s a really good chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion China wants to make a deal more than I do,\u201d Trump added.\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies\u2019 access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nLOWERED EXPECTATIONS\n\nBut Chinese officials, surprised and upset by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, including video surveillance gear maker Hikvision, (002415.SZ) along with the suspension of U.S. visas for some Chinese officials, told Reuters that Beijing had lowered expectations for significant progress from the talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen China respond with concessions to someone throwing down the gauntlet in this manner,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIt suggests to me that the U.S. may have determined that progress was impossible so everyone is just going through the motions.\u201d\n\nOther flashpoints that have cropped up in recent days include China\u2019s swift action to cut corporate ties to the National Basketball Association over a team official\u2019s tweet in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.\n\nBut in a possible easing of tensions, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration will soon issue licenses allowing some U.S. companies to sell non-sensitive goods to China\u2019s top telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies. [HWT.UL]\n\nThe report cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. A Commerce Department spokesman said the agency has been given no such direction. Huawei since May has been on the same trade blacklist affecting Hikvision because the United States says the company can spy on customers - an allegation Huawei denies.", "description": "The United States' and China's top trade negotiators were set to meet on Thursday for the first time since late July to try to find a way out of a 15-month trade war as new irritants between the world's two largest economies threatened hopes for progress.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439124728&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9909I", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
