Sutton Power Station near Wilmington, North Carolina. (Photo: AP)\n\nHurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina a year ago today. And while its winds were only Category 1-force, its record rainfall and floodwaters caused major devastation \u2014 especially to coal ash ponds, which can contain toxins like mercury and lead. This toxic sludge can pose a major public health threat if it reaches waterways or nearby communities.\n\nA year later, the state of North Carolina has made strides cleaning up these toxic sites, but advocates argue a lot of work remains.\n\nThe toxic tragedy began well after Hurricane Florence hit the coast. Floodwaters stayed high, and in many places rose more than a week after the hurricane made landfall.\n\nAll that water eventually caused a dam to break at Lake Sutton, which is next to a former coal plant with a coal ash pond operated by Duke Energy. The water breached the pond\u2019s retaining wall and released the mixture into surface water, which flowed into the Cape Fear River. A study by Duke University researchers confirmed that fact \u2014 which was previously a source of debate \u2014 earlier this year in a peer-reviewed study.\n\nCoal ash was a problem in the state before Hurricane Florence, so the company had already begun the process of cleaning up. Still, the hurricane underscored the dangers of coal ash, Frank Holleman, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Centre, told Gizmodo. A certain level of urgency followed the fallout of Florence \u2014 an urgency that was much needed and much delayed.\n\n\u201cEven when the weather is good, these sites are dangerous.\u201d Holleman said. \u201cBut when the weather is bad, there\u2019s an even greater risk.\u201d\n\nDuke Energy has cleaned up the coal ash pond at its Sutton Plant since Florence, as well as another two coal ash basins, company spokesperson Bill Norton told Gizmodo. Eight basins have been excavated in total, amounting to some 20 million tons of coal ash. That includes 5 million tons in the last year alone, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a huge amount of progress,\u201d Norton said.\n\nBut Duke Energy also has a history of coal ash issues. The Dan River spill in 2014 is a prime example, when some 39,000 tons of coal ash leaked out of a pipe near a defunct coal plant, threatening the environment.\n\nThat coal ash spill remains one of the largest the nation\u2019s seen, yet Duke was barely able to recover any of the coal ash. The state had launched four lawsuits against Duke Energy the year before, and the Dan River disaster served as further incentive for the state to begin enforcing environmental protections and shut down these facilities.\n\nBy 2015, Duke Energy announced it\u2019d begin cleaning up some of its 59 coal ash basins, recycling some of it into construction material and sending the rest to landfills. However, the company has been moving slowly. No excavations started until 2015, and none were completed until 2017. It will take another 30 years to completely shut down its operational plants, storing coal ash in nearby landfills instead of ponds in the meantime.\n\nThe process can be so slow because a proper plan must be made with ample time for the public to comment. Environmental reviews take at least a year (and usually more). Once a decision is made on what to do with the coal ash \u2014 whether that\u2019s excavating a site entirely or capping a pond in place \u2014 the execution of that plan can take at least a few years if it\u2019s done right. But this delayed response turned into a disaster when Hurricane Florence arrived.\n\n\u201cAll of these coal ash ponds should be fully excavated, taken away from the banks of our rivers, and put into lined landfills that will no longer poison our communities and our environment.\u201d\n\nSeven months after Florence, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality decided it would help Duke Energy skip a step in deciding how to clean up: It ordered the company to excavate all its remaining sites, not cap in place.\n\nExcavation involves removing all water from coal ash ponds, and then transporting the remaining ash to a landfill. The process is costlier than capping a pond in place. When a site is capped in place, the water is removed, but the coal ash stays there, covered with liners and sometimes dirt and plants. It\u2019s buried under a layer of protection that\u2019s supposed to ensure the ash never escapes, but many advocates don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a safe alternative to excavating the ash entirely because there\u2019s always a chance that system fails. The state appears to agree.\n\n\u201cCapping in place is pollution in place and should never be allowed to happen,\u201d Matthew Starr, an organiser with the Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, told Gizmodo. \u201cAll of these coal ash ponds should be fully excavated, taken away from the banks of our rivers, and put into lined landfills that will no longer poison our communities and our environment.\u201d\n\nDuke disagrees with advocates and the state. It\u2019s challenging that order in court. The company argues that capping the remaining basins is \u201ca safe method\u201d and that excavating the remaining six sites instead would cost the company an additional $US5 ($7) billion \u2014 an added cost it would pass along to its customers.\n\n\u201cPlant retirement costs are, historically, paid for by our customers,\u201d Duke Energy\u2019s Norton wrote in an email to Gizmodo.\n\n\u201cCustomers typically pay for the construction of the plant, the operation of the plant, and the retirement of the plant. Additionally, the North Carolina Utilities Commission has determined that costs to comply with environmental requirements established by state and federal regulators are part of the normal operations of an energy company, and those costs are appropriate to include in customer bills. Managing waste and safely closing ash basins are also part of the work of supplying customers with reliable electricity to meet their energy needs.\u201d\n\nWhile the legal battles play out, a large amount of coal ash remains vulnerable to flooding. And that threat only increases in a warmer world where our atmosphere holds more moisture, and unleashes more intense rains. The situation is looking better than it did a year ago, but another Hurricane Florence could cause yet another environmental tragedy.\n\nThe truth is, however, that nearly all coal ash sites around the country are already leaking into groundwater \u2014 and that\u2019s without the damage of an extreme storm. That\u2019s why advocates want to see these sites cleaned up. Not just in North Carolina but everywhere.\n\n\u201cEvery day that millions of tons of toxic waste sit in unlined pits, more and more hazardous chemicals leak into the groundwater,\u201d Earthjustice senior counsel Lisa Evans, told Gizmodo. \u201cMore and more damage occurs every day, so the sooner that the utility can remove the ash and close the site, that\u2019s the action that will stop the damage.\u201d", "description": "Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina a year ago today.
