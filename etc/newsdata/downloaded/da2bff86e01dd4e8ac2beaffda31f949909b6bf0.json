Very amusing, but perhaps a bit mean. The group, after all, had some good times under Justin King.\n\nBut, then, even tragedies have the occasional lighter moment. There just hasn\u2019t been a lot of light at Sainsbury's in recent times.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFrom the wreckage of his attempt to merge with Asda, CEO Mike Coupe needed to come up with something.\n\nHis script was unveiled ahead of a \"capital markets day\" designed to woo the City, alongside a trading update revealing that like for like sales (which excludes new space) fell again, this time by 0.2 per cent.\n\nNot a big fall, it\u2019s true, and some parts of the business are growing, but it\u2019s still an overall fall.\n\nCan Coupe (finally) reverse that and raise a smile among his audience at a time when the group has been flirting with following M&S out of the FTSE 100?\n\nThe early performance of the shares tells you the City\u2019s critics\u2019 were mostly a shade warmer than those at Shore. It\u2019s an audience that\u2019s always pleased with cost cuts and Coupe is promising a lot of them. Some \u00a3500m over five years.\n\nUp to 70 Argos outlets are set to vanish from the High Street, with 80 new ones opening up as concessions in Sainsbury\u2019s stores. This cuts rent, and makes better use of existing space.\n\nThere will be 110 new convenience outlets opening, offset by 30-40 closures. The group also plans to build 10 additional superstores. They aren\u2019t very fashionable these days but the Sainsbury\u2019s has land and planning permissions so it might as well make use of it where it thinks it can make money. The flip side is that there will be at least as many closures.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Competition & Markets Authority was cast in the role of Iago because someone had to kill it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
