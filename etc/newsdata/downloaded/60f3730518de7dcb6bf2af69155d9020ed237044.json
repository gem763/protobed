It also indicated that Julius Baer had been a minority stakeholder in Seba as of 2018.", "description": "A top executive at private Swiss private banking Julius Baer says cryptocurrencies are still at the stage of a \u201cDarwinian\u201d process of selection", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNmE5ZjE5NWVmNjRiMzliZGU5YzFkNTdlY2Q4M2Q0YjkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
