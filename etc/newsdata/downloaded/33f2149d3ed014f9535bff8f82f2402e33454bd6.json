Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\n\"The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\" Trump wrote.\n\n\n\nThe two sides have held on-again, off-again efforts to mitigate the conflict for months with little to show for it until this point beyond increasingly escalating tariff threats.\n\nIt's a significant step, but the deal could still fall through\n\nThe agreement reached Friday marks a significant step toward ending the dispute, though both sides acknowledged a long road ahead to ending the tariff war that has been roiling global markets since March of 2018.\n\nA written pact has yet to be signed and is still weeks away, and the deal could still fall through in the meantime. Trump told reporters he didn't believe that would happen.\n\n\"There was a lot of friction between the United States and China, and now it's a lovefest. That's a good thing,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He gave a positive yet more measured review of the agreement.\n\n\"We have made substantial progress in many fields. We are happy about it. We'll continue to make efforts,\" Liu said.\n\nThe initial \"phase-one deal\" could be finalised next month, Trump suggested, when he and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend an economic summit in Santiago, Chile.\n\nStill, even as Trump suspended a new round of tariffs planned for October - an increase to 30% from 25% on $250 billion (R3 trillion) in Chinese imports - tariffs on some $360 billion (R5 trillion) worth of Chinese goods remain in place.\n\nTrump's plans to hike tariffs in December on clothing and electronics remain in place.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the two countries are substantively nearer to resolving key points of tension, such as intellectual-property rights and currency manipulation.\n\nIf the deal comes to fruition, it would provide a much-needed salve on the wounds of the US agriculture sector, a key Trump constituency that has suffered as China has thrown counter-punches to Trump's tariffs.\n\nBut some experts nonetheless poo-pooed the results of the negotiations and threw cold water on Trump's claims of a major victory for farmers, saying such relief could've been obtained long ago in earlier negotiating rounds.\n\n\"If this turns out to be all there is, we could have achieved these results a year ago or more,\" Derek Scissors, a trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute who has advised the Trump administration, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd despite the progress and Trump's confidence that a formal pact will be hammered out in November, the reality of the countries' turbulent relationship suggests the progress could still be scuttled before the next rendezvous in Chile.\n\n\"If they couldn't agree on a text, that must mean they're not done. Wishing an agreement does not one make. This isn't a skinny deal. It's an invisible one,\" Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Reuters.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Friday's pact represents a significant step, but a written deal hasn't been reached and could still fall apart.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2866/9fa176591e144d75883c41a16ecd9bf9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
