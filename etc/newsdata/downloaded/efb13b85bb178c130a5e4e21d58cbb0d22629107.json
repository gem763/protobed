In court, she denied having had an abortion, saying she had been treated for internal bleeding -- testimony backed up by her gynaecologist.\n\nShe was sentenced under Article 490 of the Muslim-majority kingdom's legal code.\n\nThat article punishes sexual relations out of wedlock, while the law also forbids all abortions unless the mother's life is in danger.\n\n- 'Obsolete' ban -\n\nIn a case that sparked widespread debate on personal and media freedoms in Morocco, her gynaecologist, who spoke up in her defence, was given two years and her fiance one year in prison.\n\nThe anaesthetist was handed a one-year suspended sentence and the medical assistant eight months, also suspended.\n\nRights groups were quick to condemn the verdicts, which Amnesty International described as a \"devastating blow for women's rights\" in the country.\n\nAhmed Benchemsi, the regional director for Human Rights Watch, described the sentencing of Raissouni and her fiance as a \"black day for freedom in Morocco\".\n\nThe verdicts were \"a blatant injustice, a flagrant violation of human rights, and a frontal attack on individual freedoms,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe prosecution insisted she had been seen by a medic and showed signs of pregnancy and of having undergone a \"late voluntary abortion\".\n\nIt had said her detention had \"nothing to do with her profession as a journalist\".\n\nBetween 600 and 800 back-shop abortions occur each day in Morocco, according to estimates by campaign groups.\n\nIn a manifesto published on September 23 by Moroccan media outlets, hundreds of women declared themselves \"outlaws\" by claiming to have already violated the \"obsolete\" laws of their country on abortion and other social norms.\n\nIn the early 1970s, in a similar text, French women calling themselves the \"343 sluts\" famously declared they had had an abortion when it was still illegal.\n\nLast year, Morocco tried thousands of people for sex out of wedlock, 170 people for being gay and 73 for pregnancy terminations.", "description": "Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni who was sentenced to one year in jail for an \"illegal abortion\" and sexual relations outside marriage walked free on Wednesday, shortly after being granted a royal pardon.
