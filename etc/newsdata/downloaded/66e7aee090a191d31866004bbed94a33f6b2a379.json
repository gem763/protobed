But his main mechanism for financing his Freedom Dividend is a value added tax of 10 percent.\n\nIn brief, a value added tax (VAT) is a form of sales tax that\u2019s applied to every step in the supply chain. Exactly how business models pass along the costs of the tax is debatable, but economic studies are pretty unanimous that most of the burden gets handed off to the end consumer. Since lower-income households spend more of their budgets on basic consumption, that makes a VAT regressive: it takes a bigger percentage of poor Americans\u2019 income than of wealthier Americans\u2019 income.\n\nYang says his VAT won\u2019t apply to basic staples like groceries and clothing. But the research suggests these sorts of carve-outs don\u2019t really help with the overall regressive impact. He also argues no lower-income person could ever buy so much that their VAT burden cancels out their UBI. Which is true, but besides the point. The point is, for poorer Americans who already rely on the safety net, Yang\u2019s UBI results in no net increase in income to begin with. Therefore, any jump in their consumption costs will leave them worse off on net.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeff Spross", "Theweek.Com Articles Andrew-Yangs-Ubi-Problem"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
