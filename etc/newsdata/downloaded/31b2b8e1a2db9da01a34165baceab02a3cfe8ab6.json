For out of the overflow of his heart, his mouth speaks.\u201d \u2014 Luke 6:45\n\nWords matter.\n\nThey matter all the more so when they are uttered or tweeted by the President of the United States, who has more power than anyone else on earth to make sure that \u201cwhat starts out as a sound, ends in a deed.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s lies and false claims, thousands of them, have been authoritatively documented. His ad hominem personal attacks on political rivals and people he hired and appointed \u2014 Michael Cohen is a \u201crat,\u201d Jeff Sessions \u201cweak and ineffective,\u201d Rex Tillerson \u201cdumb as a rock,\u201d Jerome Powell has \u201cno guts, no sense, no vision\u201d \u2014 are no longer surprising. His tirades, taunts and threats, it should now be clear, are damaging our democracy.\n\nTrump\u2019s incitement of violence was evident during the presidential campaign of 2016. If Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWhere are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates?

At a campaign rally, he encouraged his supporters to \u201cknock the crap\u201d out of protesters in the audience, promising to cover their legal expenses if they were arrested.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump Donald John TrumpWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation Trump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment MORE encouraged police officers to be less mindful of the safety of suspects they were taking into custody. His recommendation \u2014 \u201cPlease don\u2019t be nice\u201d \u2014 was condemned by many human rights groups and law enforcement organizations. The president also characterized some of the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\n\nIn the last few weeks, President Trump has ratcheted up his reckless rhetoric. At a private event for staff of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York City, Trump said that whoever helped the whistleblower (whose complaint Trump\u2019s own Inspector General deemed \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d) was \u201cclose to a spy,\u201d and continued: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nA president of the United States threatening a whistleblower and anyone who shared information with him or her with potential execution \u201cin front of public servants, not to mention their young children, is a dangerous and damaging development,\u201d a large group of former officials of the State Department and other agencies maintained, in a letter urging members of Congress in both parties to condemn the remarks. \u201cSuch a statement is not only illegal, it is immoral.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUndeterred, Trump suggested a few days later that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSE Cupp: How much longer will allies excuse Trump's behavior? Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy Attorney says he's representing second Trump whistleblower from intel community MORE (D-Calif.) could face \u201carrest for treason.\u201d He then re-tweeted the warning of Robert Jeffress, an evangelical pastor, that impeachment would provoke a \u201ccivil war-like fracture in this nation from which the country will never heal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,\u201d said Adam Kinzinger Adam Daniel KinzingerTrump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy House Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging Jeffress denies predicting 'actual civil war' over Trump impeachment MORE (R-Ill.), a former Air Force pilot. \u201cThis is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 2, President Trump branded the impeachment inquiry \u201ca coup.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, it is worth noting, has used words in another, equally damaging way. Far more than any of his predecessors, Trump has insulated his administration from oversight and accountability by hiding information from Congress and the American people. The White House has acknowledged that transcripts of the president\u2019s phone calls with leaders of several foreign countries, including Ukraine, have been moved to a secret server, to which only a very small number of officials have access.\n\nAnd the administration has made dubious (and, one hopes, not precedent-setting) claims of executive privilege to prevent officials from testifying or producing documents to congressional committees, in what appears to be a strategy of running out of the clock (before the courts compel them to comply, as they almost surely will), secure in the knowledge, as Greg Sargent has put it, that \u201cthe right-wing media would lay down a covering fog of pro-Trump obfuscation and mainstream fact-checks got drowned out by the din, and their own both-sidesing instincts.\u201d\n\nSunshine is, indeed, the best disinfectant. Without transparency, we cannot have well- informed citizens. But these days, alas, Republican officeholders and Trump\u2019s base of voters shrug off and enable tirades, taunts, and threats and a stonewalling of Congress they would surely deem unacceptable in a Democratic administration.\n\nDonald Trump has, indeed, succeeded in building a wall. The president and his apparatchiks \u2014 such as Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report House GOP Intel member: 'Why should I care about' another Trump whistleblower Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy MORE, Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayTrump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy George Conway: Romney should treat Trump criticism as 'a badge of honor' Meghan McCain: Trump, Giuliani 'blowing it on a JV level' MORE, William Barr William Pelham BarrHouse GOP Intel member: 'Why should I care about' another Trump whistleblower Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy Attorney says he's representing second Trump whistleblower from intel community MORE, Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoPentagon distances itself from Ukraine controversy Spokeswoman: Perry encouraged Trump to focus on energy, economy in Ukraine call House chairman: Pompeo not complying with impeachment inquiry MORE, and fake newscaster Sean Hannity Sean Patrick HannityTrump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy GOP turns furor on media amid impeachment fight Maddow on going to dinner with rivals Hannity, Cuomo: 'I doubt they eat the same things' MORE \u2014 are walling off the presidency from the checks and balances and the appropriate disclosure of information that are essential to a well-functioning democracy.\n\nAnd they\u2019re daring us to do something about it.\n\nGlenn C.
