SUSANNA REID: Why we MUST keep the Ladies' loos for the ladies", "language": "en", "text": "There comes a time in every woman\u2019s life when she just needs to escape to the Ladies. And I don\u2019t mean for the obvious.\n\nWe may need some private space to collect our thoughts at a party, fix our make-up at a restaurant or, in extremis, retreat for a cry. It\u2019s my refuge if I\u2019m being bothered at a gathering or need to escape from a crowd.\n\nI once went to the Mayfair club Annabel\u2019s and the best thing about it was the Ladies. Perfumed air, exotic wallpaper, full-length mirrors \u2014 when you\u2019ve had enough of the bustle, it\u2019s like having a rest in a boudoir: a female sanctuary.\n\nIn her latest column Susanna Reid has come out in defence of the Ladies' toilets\n\nThe TV presenter said that businesses should have a male, female and gender-neutral toilet facility after The Old Vic (pictured) said all its loos would be gender-neutral\n\nThe Ladies isn\u2019t just a convenience, it\u2019s the place I\u2019ve always gone to give myself a pep talk. One night early in my university years, the man of my dreams arrived at the student bar. I was overcome with nerves. What to say to this god (who looked remarkably like Aidan Turner in Poldark, now I come to think about it)?\n\nI didn\u2019t stay to make conversation. I retreated to the Ladies with my girlfriends for a serious discussion.\n\nAfter 20 minutes I emerged, confident and brimming with enthusiasm. Only the toilet paper stuck to my shoe destroyed the image of a calm, collected me. Funnily enough, he wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nBut there are fears this week that the Ladies may be on the way out after London theatre The Old Vic became one of the first to switch to gender-neutral toilets. Olivier-nominated actress Frances Barber has joined a growing number of theatre-loving women outraged about the new set-up.\n\nWhile The Old Vic has put out a statement insisting that the number of toilets available to women has risen from 12 to 24, in fact these are all shared with men \u2014 who also have a toilet block with 18 urinals at their disposal. How can that possibly make sense?\n\nThey said that this has doubled the number of toilets available to women visitors to 24\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have thought theatre toilets were central to the audience experience \u2014 except they often are for us unlucky women, when we\u2019re still stuck in the queue at the end of the interval.\n\nMissing the toilet break and having to sit with your legs crossed for the second half of the performance really takes the enjoyment out of a show.\n\nOFF-AIR GOSSIP Elton John recalls Princess Diana being charmed by Richard Gere, whom I interviewed at Claridge\u2019s once while my mum watched the boys in another room. I told Richard he was her favourite star \u2014 so he asked mum\u2019s name, then bellowed \u2018Sue, get in this room\u2019 down the corridor. She was in heaven.\n\nWhen I went to see Hamilton at London\u2019s Victoria Palace Theatre, I shared a seemingly never-ending queue with two magazine editors. It was a good job they were entertaining company. I found out about the entire contents of the next issues of their publications before we\u2019d even reached the toilet door.\n\nThe move towards fully unisex toilets in schools is causing concern among parents. We all remember how body conscious we felt around the opposite sex as teenagers, and youngsters going through puberty may want somewhere more private to retreat to.\n\nIn fact, a recent report revealed some girls are so anxious about sharing loos with boys when they are on their period, they are simply staying at home rather than going to school.\n\nOthers won\u2019t use them all day and even cut down on drinking liquids at school to avoid the need to use the toilet, which one GP said increases the risk of girls suffering urinary and bladder infections.\n\nHowever, the Good Morning Britain presenter said that they should be left as a sanctuary for women to collect their thoughts, fix make-up or cry in safety (stock image)\n\nYes, create a gender-neutral facility, but for young people to be comfortable they should surely have the choice. There have been times I have needed to be with my girlfriends in the loo to hold back my hair after downing too many shots. Or we\u2019ve had enough of the noise at a club and gather to make our own gossipy row by the basins instead.\n\nBesides all that, there\u2019s the hygiene issue. Men leave the toilet seat up \u2014 convenient for the next man, inconvenient for the next woman.\n\nCall me squeamish but the less your hands have to interact with a public toilet seat, the better.\n\nMen may feel uncomfortable sharing with women, too. It goes both ways.\n\nI believe everyone should feel comfortable using the facilities and some may want gender-neutral spaces, which I support. But not at the cost of all single-sex loos.\n\nThere is no easy answer, apart from the costly refurbishment of buildings to include Ladies, Gents and gender-neutral conveniences.\n\nUntil this happens, I\u2019d like to keep a private female space.\n\nTHE REAL STRICTLY CURSE: DANCING WITH LAST YEAR'S WINNER\n\nAfter Kevin Clifton won Strictly with Stacey Dooley last year, was Anneka Rice doomed to an early exit when she was paired with him?\n\nOla Jordan lifted the glitterball with Chris Hollins in 2009 \u2014 and was voted off in the second week in 2010.\n\nIn 2011 Aliona Vilani won with Harry Judd and in 2012 she had to retire early after a training accident.\n\nThe year I took part, Aljaz Skorjanec won with Abbey Clancy, the next year he finished tenth. Celebs: if your pro just won the show, the Strictly curse may waltz off with your dreams before you\u2019ve even got going.\n\nSusanna Reid, who has been on Strictly, claimed Anneka Rice was doomed to suffer an early exit after being paired up with last year's winner Kevin clifton\n\nPIZZA EXPRESS CAN'T GO - DOUGH BALLS ARE A FRAZZLED MUM'S SAVIOUR\n\nWhen my boys were little and food wasn\u2019t easily delivered via an app, the restaurant at the end of the road was my saviour. The announcement \u2018let\u2019s go to Pizza Express\u2019 was always received enthusiastically.\n\nTheir Piccolo children\u2019s menu replaced my home-cooked efforts when I could no longer summon the energy. Dough balls, miniature pizza and a nod to healthy eating with the hopeful salad that was always ignored were a failsafe, and the legions of exhausted mums nursing Pinot Grigio around me clearly agreed.\n\nChildren\u2019s parties at Pizza Express were a regular affair, to the dismay of more intimate diners. The tiled floors didn\u2019t help the acoustics, either.\n\nShe also called for Pizza Express to be saved from collapse because of its dough balls\n\nBut as the children grew up, it lost its appeal and takeaway apps have become my usual convenience food when I\u2019m having a lull. Plus, the attraction of a meal there dimmed: it felt like going to a place I saw as the children\u2019s diner.\n\nBut those dough balls \u2014 and a Fiorentina for me \u2014 still appeal on a bare-fridge night. Whether you fancy an American Hot or a plain Margherita, no one wants to see the doors close on Pizza Express.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S GUILTY TREAT\n\nI don\u2019t get time to read often \u2014 the last hour before bed is somehow always spent clearing up the day\u2019s mess instead.\n\nBut I\u2019ve finally caught up with the novel everyone\u2019s raving about and I haven\u2019t been able to put it down.\n\nFleishman Is In Trouble by first-time writer and New York Times hack Taffy Brodesser-Akner, is a saucy but moving satire about divorce. There\u2019s a bidding war for the movie rights and I\u2019m backing Jonah Hill for the lead.", "description": "In her latest column, Susanna Reid has come out fighting for the ladies' toilets, arguing that businesses should provide male, female and gender-neutral toilets.
