My life was left relying on an old seat belt.\n\n'I remember the process of getting on the ride, and as it started the barrier clicked a bit, so I thought that was fine.\n\n'We must have been half way through the ride, it was bouncing a lot, spinning us around, but then the actual carriage position of it changed, so all our weight was facing forwards onto the bar. My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier.\n\n'It started to bounce and that's when remember it tilting - I was worried about coming out but that's the last thing I remember.\n\n'I remember the sensation of falling out. I didn't know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital. People thought I was dead.'\n\nJade fell from what is believed to be the AirMaxxx 360 ride just before 8pm and landed on the base of a nearby ride, thought to be The Sizzler. Pictured, police at the scene\n\nMs Harrison is still unable to smile nine days after the accident and faces weeks on liquid food. Pictured, the scene on October 7\n\nMs Harrison said she came to at the fairground with a mouth full of blood.\n\nShe added: 'I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for life.\n\n'Really small children are allowed to go on these fast rides at the fair.\n\n'I'm angry this could have happened to my little sister, it could have happened to a child, and they might not have been as fortunate as me.'\n\nShe added: 'My face is still really swollen, I can't smile, it worries me that my mouth will never feel the same again, I also have a big gash on my chin which was sewn up.'\n\nMs Harrison has now instructed Hudgell Solicitors to carry out a 'full and transparent' investigation.\n\nGarry Leach, chairman of the Showmen's Guild, said ride operators were 'devastated' and doing all they could to assist the Health and Safety Executive, which is leading the investigation.\n\nBut Hull Fair bosses said visitors have more chance of being 'struck by lightning in Sainsbury's' than being thrown off a ride.\n\nThe ride is believed to be the same one which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia five years ago.
