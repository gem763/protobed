Splatter enamelware combines the best features of two of this year\u2019s most enduringly trendy materials: the durability and feel of brass with the random, unique patterns of marble. But unlike either brass or marble, splatterware \u2014 sometimes known as swirled or marbled enamelware \u2014 comes in a rainbow of bright, bold colors, making it the ideal affordable dining-room accent for any decorating scheme.\n\nSplatter enamelware is also practical \u2014 good as everyday tableware, cookware, and general kitchen d\u00e9cor \u2014 not just a one-off accessory. It\u2019s easy to clean like ceramic, but shatterproof like plastic, and since it\u2019s produced by baking shards of porcelain onto steel at a superhigh temperature, enamelware is oven-safe, fire-safe, and dishwasher-safe (but not microwave-safe because of the metal, so don\u2019t make that mistake).\n\nWe\u2019ve recommended blue splattered-enamel tumblers and a red marbled-enamel bowl on the Strategist before, but those are the basics.
