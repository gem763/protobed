On Tuesday evening, Nancy Pelosi announced an 'Impeachment Inquiry' but there were few specifics and no voting was announced.\n\nFurther facts will emerge today and then there will be a full-blown 'spin' war between the two political parties. It doesn't take a psychic to know that the Republicans will claim that Trump is exonerated and the Democrats will claim that he is a treasonous SOB that should be impeached.\n\nIt will make for some interesting political drama but our job here is to navigate the stock market response. The easy logic is that an impeachment battle creates uncertainty and that is bad for the market. The indices are already in a precarious position and this just happens to be the peak week for negative seasonality so the technical conditions favor the downside.\n\nHowever, as this market has proven repeatedly in recent weeks and months, simple logic usually does work well. Despite a number of major news events in recent weeks including a surge in oil, central bank interest rate cuts, weak economic news and a major rotation out of growth stocks and into value, the movement of the indices has been fairly mild.\n\nIt should come as no big surprise that there are very intense feelings about President Trump and that the Democrats are determined to hit him as hard as possible. The market knows this and that is why the impeachment process isn't necessarily the market disaster that many think it might be. The market dealt with the Mueller investigation for years with endless promises that it would find Trump guilty of obstruction. The market never had any major negative reaction to the endless leaks and constant spin.\n\nThe big difference right now is that the technical condition of the indices is more precarious than it has been in a while and there are signs of waning economic growth. However, the market has been in a negative mood for a while and has already priced in some downside. That has been one of the main reasons the indices have held up.\n\nIt is of particular interest how the Big Picture Bears have been unable to figure out what catalyst might trigger market downside. None of them saw this impeachment matter coming. They have been focused on slowing economic growth and central banks, and have had no success in timing downside.\n\nEarly indications are flat as market participants wait for further news this morning. My major concern right now is the poor technical condition of individual stocks. This sort of news flow drives the indices and leaves individual stocks bid-less. That eventually will produce some good opportunities but this market is just too volatile at the moment to make big moves.\n\nThe political battle that is taking place isn't all that surprising and the likelihood is that both sides will claim that the evidence favors their position. The market may decide that it isn't all that important which has been the case with all the big events lately.\n\nI start the day with a very high level of cash and my game plan is to focus on looking for some individual stocks to buy as the political drama develops. I don't expect to put money to work very quickly. I think the bears may be in danger of overplaying their hand at this point.", "description": "I start the day with a very high level of cash and my game plan is to focus on looking for some individual stocks to buy as the political drama develops.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Impeachment Battle Matters More To Political Partisans Than Market Participants", "I Start The Day With A Very High Level Of Cash", "My Game Plan Is To Focus On Looking For Some Individual Stocks To Buy As The Political Drama Develops.", "Bruce Kamich", "Dave Butler", "Bret Jensen", "Gary Berman", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/173efc40-ce75-11e9-848d-9533cfbb5663.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
