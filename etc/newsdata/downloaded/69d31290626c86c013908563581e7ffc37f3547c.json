However, Nio shares, which were trading at $1.69 on Tuesday prior to the market close, are still down some 49% from just a month ago.\n\nIn the third quarter, Nio delivered 4,196 of its five-seater ES6 SUV and 603 of the ES8, its more expensive seven-seater premium electric SUV. As of September 30, 2019, aggregate deliveries of the company\u2019s ES6 and ES8 reached 23,689 vehicles, of which 12,341 vehicles were delivered in 2019.\n\nNio founder, chairman and CEO William Li credited more \u201ccompetitive retail prices\u201d on the ES6 for contributing to the jump in deliveries. He added that the company began in October delivering ES6 and ES8 vehicles with an 84 kWh battery pack that extends their range to 316 miles and 276 miles, respectively. Li expects these longer-range vehicles to accelerate orders and deliveries in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio has struggled to hit its own guidance in previous quarters. Nio began deliveries of the ES8 in China in June 2018. And while deliveries initially surpassed expectations, they slowed in 2019. The company reported loss of $390.9 million in the first quarter. The rout continued in the second quarter when Nio reported a loss of $462 million.\n\nNio delivered 3,553 vehicles in the second quarter, a 7.9% decline from the first period of 2019.\n\nNio\u2019s response to its dismal numbers has included shifting its vehicle production plans, reducing R&D spending and cutting thousands of jobs. The company plans to cut its workforce from 9,900 people down to 7,800 by the end of the third quarter, Li said in September when reporting its earnings. He also said there will be additional restructuring and some non-core businesses will be spun off by the end of the year.\n\nIn June, Nio faced a new problem when it voluntarily recalled nearly 5,000 of its ES8 high-performance electric SUVs after a series of battery fires in China and a subsequent investigation revealed a vulnerability that created a safety risk. The recall affected a quarter of the ES8 vehicles it has sold since they went on sale in June 2018.\n\nNio was able to complete its recall for the 4,803 ES8s by prioritizing battery manufacturing capacity for this effort. But that significantly affected production and delivery results, Li said at the time. Nio delivered just 837 electric vehicles in July.\n\nBut even before the recall, delivery numbers were down. Nio delivered 1,340 vehicles in June, 1,089 in May and 1,124 in April. Those numbers rebounded in September when Nio said it delivered 2,019 vehicles.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if these rosier numbers signal the beginning of a broader turnaround for Nio, which has accumulated about $6 billion in losses since its founding in 2014.
