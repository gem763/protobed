Shares of DBS closed up 13 Singapore cents or 0.53 per cent to S$24.68 on Monday.\n\nParkson Retail Asia: The independent auditor has flagged a \"material uncertainty\" about the watch-listed department store operator's ability to remain as a going concern, highlighting the net loss of S$34.6 million incurred in the fiscal year ended June 30.

Shares in Parkson last traded at 2.1 Singapore cents on Friday.\n\nArtivision Technologies: The Catalist-listed video solutions provider has obtained a further six-month extension to complete a reverse takeover deal where it will give up a 70 per cent stake in exchange for Mobile Credit Payment (MC Payment).
