That song was about being addicted to Bieber; her new tune Lose You To Love Me is about being free of Bieber - both videos are shot in black-and-white closeup.\n\nTruth hurts: Selena Gomez was visiting Ryan Seacrest's show in Los Angeles with two friends as she shared her feelings on her two new songs - Lost You To Love Me and Look At Her Now - that are clearly about her ex Justin Bieber\n\nShe said The Heart Wants What It Wants is her favorite music video she has ever recorded. But she is happy to have the opposite feelings now as Lose You To Love me serves as a bookend.\n\n'From going from there to where I am now is the greatest feeling,' she said, making it seem as if she is happy to finally be over Bieber once and for all.\n\nThe lyrics for Lose You To Love Me also make that clear as she firmly says goodbye to the Canadian crooner, who moved on to model Hailey Baldwin two months after he split from Gomez. The musician and the blonde married soon after.\n\nOver him: She added her favorite video was The Heart Wants What It Wants, and now she gets to release Lose You To Love Me which is like a bookend. 'From going from there to where I am now is the greatest feeling,' she said, making it seem as if she is happy to finally be over Bieber once and for all\n\nGomez also explained why she didn't release the songs earlier.\n\n'It\u2019s actually perfect timing because I was going to release it two years ago and none of the words that I\u2019m speaking would have existed.\n\n'So taking a moment to actually feel the feelings that I\u2019ve gone through, it\u2019s just \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m just so grateful that it\u2019s out. It\u2019s weird too because I wrote this song over a year ago \u2026 and it\u2019s like I feel completely different from when I wrote it. ... It\u2019s such an interesting feeling.\n\nThe timing is right! Gomez also explained why she didn't release the songs earlier. 'It\u2019s actually perfect timing because I was going to release it two years ago and none of the words that I\u2019m speaking would have existed\n\nShe had so much pain: 'So taking a moment to actually feel the feelings that I\u2019ve gone through, it\u2019s just \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m just so grateful that it\u2019s out. It\u2019s weird too because I wrote this song over a year ago \u2026 and it\u2019s like I feel completely different from when I wrote it. ... It\u2019s such an interesting feeling,' she added\n\nBack when they were happy: They dated again from November 2017 until March 2018. On the left they are seen in 2018 and on the right they are pictured in November 2011\n\n'It's more beautiful for me because I know exactly where I was when I wrote it and how I felt.\n\n'It would have been too hard to release it when it was written, now it's fun, I am smiling. It's all the feelings right? It's everything from happy to emotional to realizing it and being frustrated. I wanted to validate all those feelings.'\n\nRyan asks her about seeing Justin with Hailey and how difficult that must have been.\n\nShe was frustrated: 'It's more beautiful for me because I know exactly where I was when I wrote it and how I felt. 'It would have been too hard to release it when it was written, now it's fun, I am smiling. It's all the feelings right? It's everything from happy to emotional to realizing it and being frustrated. I wanted to validate all those feelings'\n\n'I\u2019m really grateful too because I\u2019ve actually experienced that a million times before and that\u2019s the unfortunate part about what I do,' she admitted.\n\n'It\u2019s all very real to me and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just entertainment for other people; but I think I had become numb to it and it would be stupid of me if I didn\u2019t acknowledge what I had felt because it would be inauthentic and that\u2019s everything I claim to be and do.\n\n'I know there are thousands of people \u2026 who have felt this feeling and it\u2019s extremely real, and on top of the social media and everything, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in my position or someone else\u2019s because you\u2019re always going to somehow find this negative space and that\u2019s why I have to be careful and I just have to take steps back and just focus on what I\u2019m doing and nobody else.'\n\nHe hurt her a ton: 'It\u2019s all very real to me and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just entertainment for other people; but I think I had become numb to it and it would be stupid of me if I didn\u2019t acknowledge what I had felt because it would be inauthentic and that\u2019s everything I claim to be and do,' she stated\n\nThen this happened: Two months after Justin and Selena split, he started seeing Hailey. They wed in September 2018 and had a formal wedding earlier this month; the couple seen this month\n\nShe added she waited so long to 'express what I felt' because she wants to express 'exactly' how she felt.\n\n'This is where it turns into art,' said the brunette.\n\nAnd Gomez added that the reaction shocks her because everyone writes about something they felt and the biggest topic is love so it only makes sense that she would write about her heartbreak.\n\n'I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve waited this long to express what I\u2019ve felt... I\u2019m always going to be honest with people. I\u2019ve never not been.\n\n'I might not be overly chatty about it all the time, but this is where I\u2019m able to release it. This is where it turns into art. \u2026\n\nShe looked back now for a reason: She added she waited so long to 'express what I felt' because she wants to express 'exactly' how she felt. 'This is where it turns into art,' said the brunette\n\n'It actually shocks me. Because everyone writes about something they felt \u2026 and the biggest topic is love, and, in a way, it\u2019s not something negative. It\u2019s actually something positive that I was able to experience that was as beautiful and ugly as it was. I think it\u2019s beautiful I\u2019ve been able to turn this into a new chapter.'\n\nLose You To Love Me is a black and white video shot on and it comes off as very 'raw,' she agreed.\n\nThe second video with all the choreography was used with several Phones taped to the walls and 'everywhere really,' she said.\n\nThe two have a very long history - they started dating in 2011.\n\nBrave turn: Her first song is called Lose You To Love me and has a raw feel\n\nAnother good one: Her second song is called Look At Her Now at is about empowerment\n\nShe added Look At Her Now is her going into bigger and better things.\n\n'All I know is these two songs were me wrapping up a chapter in a pretty little bow,' she stated.\n\nAnd she added that the rest of the songs on the album are about how she is now and promised, 'I've saved the best for later.'\n\nThe host asked how she feels dropping these heartbreaking songs back to back; both fully acknowledge that they are about her heartbreak over Bieber.\n\n'I think I feel a sense of relief, it's been four years since I've been working on this album,' began Selena.\n\nBack to work: In addition to releasing new music, Selena has posed again for Puma\n\nThe day before she told E! News: 'I wrote [Lose You To Love Me] over a year ago. It's obviously a very emotional song for me.'\n\n'It's interesting to see how far I've come from that point to now,' she added.\n\n'Me sharing my story is exactly what I've always done. I can't be unauthentic. I can't pretend that I'm not going through something when it's obvious that I had been.'\n\nSelena - who was involved in an on/off relationship with Justin over a number of years - hopes her fans can relate to her new single.\n\nRetro feel: She is in white by an older home and a vintage car as she waters the plants\n\nShe shared: 'It's one of those songs where I just feel like it's out, it's released and I hope that girls and guys all over the world can feel supported. That's a feeling everyone's felt.\n\n'That was something that I needed to do for myself regardless of what was [going to] come after.'\n\nMeanwhile, a source recently said that Selena's single is 'obviously' about Justin.\n\nThe brunette beauty doesn't mention Justin by name in the song, but according to an insider, the track relates to the 'Love Yourself' hitmaker rather than The Weeknd, who Selena has also dated.\n\nThe source explained: 'Although the song Lose You to Love Me was co-written and a collaboration, Selena was very involved in writing and creating it, and the song is obviously about Justin.\n\n'Her fling with The Weeknd did not inspire the song - their relationship was much more short-lived and not deep enough to inspire it.'\n\nShe has now been linked to 26-year-old Niall Horan.\n\nMeanwhile, Selena's friend Taylor Swift called the Los You To Love Me song 'perfect' and a 'triumph.'", "description": "The former Disney star was visiting Ryan Seacrest's show as she shared her feelings on her songs - Lose You To Love Me and Look At Her Now - that are clearly about her ex.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20182160-0-image-a-22_1572012246425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
