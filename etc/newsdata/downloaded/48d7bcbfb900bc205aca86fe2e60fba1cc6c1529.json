If you've just been watching our special coverage president trump still the United Nations in New York just sat down. But the man at the center of this controversy. Over phone call he had in July Ukraine's present president Vladimir as a Lynn ski. That phone call released early this morning a memorandum from the White House you're the key findings of that call it's put him up for you. If you've been trying to digest all of this today the the phone call it. Transcript of sorts a rough transcript highlighted that the president did in fact ask Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival Joseph Biden. Back in July the president also offered. To have attorney general bill Barr assistant netting pray along with Rudy Giuliani. All of this reveals in a whistle blower complaint that the Justice Department announced today that they reviewed but did not pursue. I Johnson two GU have been leading the charge on all of this reporting. Just reminder this is an extraordinary phone call and certainly unusual for any president in any time to even suggest something about it. And the fact that the White House for the last several days have been trying to spin us and say there's nothing here nothing a look at. We really have to question are we talking about the same turns right received today that there's a lot in here and I think the fact that we see the president. You bring up Biden to the Ukrainian leaders constantly and repeatedly CNN you need to look into this level offer the assistance of the attorney general my personal counsel who apparently according to Zealand's key who were already Giuliani first parity been in touch. With the ukrainians prior to this July phone call there's a lot here unpacked I do think the big thing that we are learning over the course. Of this growing investigation that's really what it is we are seeing now the house launching between all six investigative committees looking into this. The need to figure out the timeline here what happened around this COLT what actions were taken and not take him because of that phone call we've already learned they just a week prior so that phone call. President trump Warner's acting chief of staff may only need to hold back he'd been promised to Ukraine just a month earlier. And then suddenly where it goes we need to figure that out and then also from this call. Did the president have any follow up conversations with the people he references DT pick up the phone and called bill bargain for economic called deed. Bill Barr or Rudy Giuliani Giuliani follow up and have a conversation with the ukrainians as president trumps it. What happened is part of this transcript we have a lot of questions is still sort out. In short was there an implicit quid pro quo here even though it doesn't appear there was a direct one pure Thomas or Chief Justice correspondent is here as well I guess a lot of people asking and social media appear. Did the president break the law what's your read on that here how would you approach that affect your asking that question today. Well the Justice Department is rendered its verdict on whether the president broke a law in regard to campaign finance violations and they. How are saying no he did not. And not to get too technical here but basically they're saying that a request by the president of the United States to have the ukrainians. Do an investigation of his rival in this case by. That investigation is not a quantifiable thing under the statute so therefore they're saying. No violation here. But clearly. The attorney general is now under additional scrutiny. As the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Natalie just set a little while ago that the president has dragged the attorney general. Into this but let's be clear in terms of what the Justice Department is saying about. Barr's role in this. Quote. The president has not pass the attorney general to contact Ukraine on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with the Ukraine on this or any other matter. Nor has the attorney general discuss this matter or anything relating. To Ukraine with Rudy Giuliani's so the Justice Department is making clear that at least on this matter as raised by the president. The bar has had nothing to do it thus far. To hurt the police some might see though the police. Rendering their own judgment on themselves there we shall see how Democrats. Way this and their investigative hearings thank you for that peer let's bring in Mary Bruce our senior. Our congressional correspondent Mary Republicans rallying around the president today even as you're hearing privately. A lot of them very uncomfortable with the language the president used in that call. Yep publicly. Almost the majority of Republicans they'll come out and talk and air backing the president and following up with what we just heard from him. And that that there was no pressure they insist and are eager to highlight that they feel there was no quid pro quo that that the president was simply trying to root out corruption here in fact Lindsey Graham one of the president's top allies flat out disputes the notion. That the president was trying to act ask for a foreign leader to help them investigate his political rival Joseph Biden they say. They that this is all just Democrats playing politics that they're eager for a Muller 2.0 one Republican told me about Lindsey Graham actually said that attracted to use this call to launch impeachment is insane and that's a quote. But the question is what comes next and this is where you're beginning to see some interesting cracks tiny tiny tiny pistol little cracks attacks on the last DeVon. You're Mitt Romney the only Republican to really come out loudly in voiced concern about this he says what he read today was deeply troubling. And I have talked with other Republicans we are announcing a few coming out and voicing some concerns saying that the president's. Actions were inappropriate that's how senator Twomey. Is describing it I've talked to others. Who say that look like it certainly isn't having they would have done the question what are they gonna do about it and so far you don't have any Republican saying that what they read today announced an impeachable offenses. Do not think they would do not something they agree wit. Some innate racism some red flags with them. They're not impeachable Patton. They're both sides in this political fight already in their quarters Mary Bruce thank you so much. All of this of course played out John as we heard for the first time since this story broke from being Ukrainian president himself just a short time ago. Basically saying that he felt no pressure now from president trump here's a little bit of that exchange. The latter was a great letter. Meaning the letter revealing to call that was done at the insistence of myself and other people that read it. It was a friendly letter there was no pressure the way you had that built up that call it was going to be the calls from hell it turned out to be a nothing call. Other then. A lot of people said I never knew you could be so nice so. Part of the problem you have is you have the fake doozy of a lot of corrupt reporting if some very fine reporters and journalists forgive a lot of corrupt reporters lot of corrupt. And a journalist I would rate you write in their by the way. Vehicle no I. EU move read everything. We I think you read text. Idea that I'm sort of I don't want who beat you pool. To. Do a great take all them. Lose elections. In an axis of Hewitt say no you sure that he had. I think blues this phone pool feed to us normal we spoke about many seeing spend day. So I think you'll read is that nobody post. Yet. Earth. In other words no pressured John the president trying to make a point here that there was no. Leverage being used by denying that military aid but still raising a lot of questions with how the president sort of thing mangled that listen pres. You can call it a good phone call he wants the cream called a nice phone call he wants. Falls fall now we can actually see what congress is going to look at and the result lot here I I I do think in the lining I read this 800 times I know. We from the set screen couple times as well I just think that that they we have the present United States. Saying on this line quote there's a lot of talk about Biden's son the fight and stop the prosecution a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do the attorney general will be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me. Among many areas. All of this transcript we're going to see congressional Democrats and investigators dive into and DeVon. We've got mortar com we're gonna wait and see when the complaint is declassified and unsealed we're gonna wait and see if this whistle blower goes up and cooperates with the investigations being launched in both chambers in the house and the senate and I do think as we start today said earlier fault that timeline. Will we actually get some timely transfer storm memo called what you will of that April phone call that is gonna. He enters first phone call were there other phone calls and of course the Director of National Intelligence will be in the hot seat tomorrow. A lot more to come in the story Johnson to Julie in charge force here to ABC news thank you so much that's. Get some reaction now from one of those congressional Democrats are joining us on Capitol Hill a friend of the briefing room. A congressman Jason croft Colorado's been on the show before congressman great to see you again have you back also you were one of the seven our congressional freshman Democrats who wrote that op Ed this week in the Washington Post. Explaining your turnabout on this issue of impeachment. I share with us now your reaction to this call transcript and and why you decided now is the time to begin impeachment. Well in the past week just the allegations alone that a sitting president would try to course a foreign government leader using. Today international security assistance funds to gain an advantage election was shocking. Get a release of this transcript is actually even more disturbing if that's possible. Yeah what what was outlined an and the conversation between. President trump and Ukrainian president. Is so disturbing that it just underscores the urgency of this issue and the need for congress to take very fast action to get our arms are on the facts. What exactly happened who was involved in what we need to do in the name of national security to addressing. And do you think you have enough facts today congressman crow two to cast an affirmative vote. If articles impeach whom were brought forward do you think do you think that an offer out there already. Well because this is a national security issue and we have to stay laser focus on the fact this is a president. Ongoing national security issue. We can't we we have to follow a process. It we have an obligation to the country. To our soldiers serving overseas. To our constituents to make sure that we get all of the facts because the security of our nation depends. So we have to make sure we're following a process for getting the facts they're getting the whistle blower complaint and are calling in the appropriate witnesses they can providing additional contacts and information about that. Because rushing that process that would mean that we were knocking the facts. We have to do it urgently because this is ongoing and this is a national security issue went to make sure following a process that's transparent as well. Thank you looked at this story so complicated I think to so many of our viewers to everyday Americans. Trying to make sense of Ukraine in bad vice president Biden's son in these it could competing allegations. I wanted to ask you to respond to president trumps rebuttal here. And that what this is really all about is four for former vice president Joseph Biden's son. Doing some pretty significant business dealings in Ukraine we we know that actually is true he was on the board of that company. I'm the do you see any sense that there could have been any wrongdoing there. I've seen no merit to what the president said there you know that let me tell you what this really is about. It's about a sitting president. That according to get this letter and this isn't a transcript by the way are what keeps on referring to as a transcript these are notes. That were taken contemporaneous. During the call you up our staffers and that's what some information we need is what more was left out of there how where these next notes taken who took them. How we have to get that information but this is about a sitting president with holding US security assistance funds. To have a foreign government investigate a political rival that is what leave the latter that the notes at this call show that's at the allegations. Presumably and it was a more complainer about. And in just say that additional contacts all of this happens within the context of Ukraine that's at act of war with Russia right now. You know that did this could these called notes talked about a javelin missile system that the president Ukraine raised during the call. He one of the reasons why there aren't Soviet tanks. Rolling across Ukraine right now is because of these javelin missiles and we've provided them to do you BCC Keary Europe. And the fact that the president is willing to use those as a carrot are presumably. Is very disturbing to me. Yes the president of Ukraine in that call indeed memo we have does ask for some more javelin missiles as he's in the president says I would like you to do us a favor though. Perhaps implying something first. There congressman before I let your guard when I just ask you about how your constituents are feeling about all of this have you heard from. Voters in your district about the developments in the past 24 hours you think public opinion didn't come around. On this story. Yet we have heard from a lot of people in my community a more action actively soliciting nasty back. And communicating. Know what it is we're doing in Washington to protect our national interest and secure our country. And you know we have to be very transparent you know I would have seen earlier as if to make sure we're communicating this. Constantly that this is an open and fair process. I was sent to Washington to make sure that I was delivering for the American people on health care. On prescription drug prices and climate change on gun violence and here we are doing that. We passed over 260 bills the last nine months that we sent to the senate on those issues at the same time we have to make sure we are upholding the constitution. In conducting our oversight role of the executive branch and that's exactly what we're gonna do. Congressman Jason pro Colorado thank you so much for coming on sir one of the few veterans in congress we should say served in Iraq and Afghanistan and we think him for his service there. Congressman crow. Colorado odds for Terry Moran in the conversation now Terry because as we wrap up this moment in today's. Extended coverage we're looking ahead to the president I'm holding yet another press conference for clock. This afternoon we can start to see his strategy coming together Terry they're gonna try to spin this deflected. Insert to paint. A lot of the players in this episode as partisan hacks. A dreaded this is this is. The trump playbook and he's very good at it president trump is an excellent advocate for his own interests he won the presidency that way he has continued. To dominate every news cycle that way and that is the challenge before Democrats are Democrats rightly. Want to patiently develop the evidence call witnesses in their hearings and show the American public. What they believe is the case for an impeachment of this president meanwhile this president who dominates television and dominates the media and social media with his. 64 million plus. A Twitter followers wants to move on in the next minute news cycle and the attention span of the American public gets shorter and shorter. So right now it's a contest. Between the evidence as it develops depending on what it shows. And the president's ability to drive the news cycle that is a challenge for Democrats no question about it. And for the American public who need to understand. What did go on here when you have in a pretty serious members of congress including. One Republican at least and in the house and one in the senate saying we need to take a look at this. And that fight is going to continue to play out Terry Moran our chief national correspondent thank you so much we should say were just getting some breaking news as well. A word now from the Republican. Ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee get in units of California just announcing in the house floor. I that the Director of National Intelligence will transmit to congress this afternoon. The whistle blower complaint that set all of this into motion it was the complaint that was initially blocked by the trump administration we expect congress. Back to receive that this is ahead of the DN eyes testimony tomorrow on Capitol Hill will be quite. A spectacle. An answer we will carry out for here on ABC news live tomorrow meantime order take a quick break right now what we will be back at 3:30 eastern time thirty minutes from now with a special edition of the briefing room.
