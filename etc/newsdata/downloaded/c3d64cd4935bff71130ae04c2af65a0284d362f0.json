In her latest Instagram photos, Rihanna is seen cradling the newborn in her arms while another snap shows her planting a sweet kiss on his cheek.\n\nAnd frankly, it looks as though baby Justus is quite fond of Aunt Oh NaNa as he continued to sleep peacefully through the photoshoot.\n\nOur hearts.\n\nIn an emotional Instagram post, RiRi said: \u2018I\u2019m so grateful that I was here for your first day on the playground kid!! Aunty loves you so much already. CONGRATULATIONS to the Davis fam! @jennnrosales you a beast for making this look easy. @the_aa you a champ and a super dope dad.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued referring to Jen\u2019s eldest child: \u2018@aaronrodolfodavis I know you not gonna like sharing yo mama, but you get all the new toys, lil bro only gets your old ones so you good! Here\u2019s to baby #JustusJoshuaDavis.\u2019\n\nRiRi then revealed her cool nickname, writing: \u2018Aunty Oh NaNa x JJ.\u2019\n\nNaNa? We\u2019re guessing that\u2019s a cheeky reference to her hit 2010 single What\u2019s My Name? You know, the part in the chorus that goes: \u2018Oh na-na, what\u2019s my name?\u2019\n\nNever mind\u2026\n\nRihanna is known to be particularly close with Jen, who has worked with the popstar since the early days of her career, and even gave the assistant\u2019s son the first listen of her new music earlier this year.\n\nThe We Found Love singer posted a photo of Jen\u2019s first boy, Aaron, sitting on the soundboard in a recording studio with large headphones covering his ears.\n\n\u2018Thank you @jennnrosales and @the_aa for blessing my day a lil mo,\u2019 while Jennifer added: \u2018When tia @badgalriri gives you the first listen. #newmusic.\u2019\n\nPerhaps RiRi is sneakily getting in practice for if and when she decides to start a family with boyfriend Hassan Jameel. The couple have been dating for more than two years and Rihanna, 31, admitted she would love to have children in the future, telling Interview magazine in June: \u2018More than anything in life.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
