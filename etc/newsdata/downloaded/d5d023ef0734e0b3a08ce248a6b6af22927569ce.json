Thirty-seven per cent said they strongly agreed, while 35 per cent somewhat agreed.\n\nMethodology The results are from The Logic\u2019s September 2019 subscriber survey. A private link was sent to subscribers by email and the survey was conducted online. All respondents were kept anonymous and duplicates were removed as needed. Subscribers were asked to provide responses to a series of questions. They were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with two statements. The first was \u201cCanadian legislators should allow more foreign competition in the country\u2019s telecommunications market.\u201d The second was \u201cCanadian legislators should impose price caps on the country\u2019s internet and wireless service providers.\u201d Their choices were: strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, neither disagree nor agree, somewhat agree, strongly agree.\n\n\u201cOur domestic providers are fleecing us,\u201d wrote one subscriber.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the prices of communications services (wireless, internet, television and home phone combined) fell by 11 per cent between 2016 and 2018. But Canadian wireless plans still cost more than those of most G7 countries\u2014though the Big Three telecoms\u2014Bell, Rogers and Telus\u2014have argued their networks are higher quality.\n\nThe three firms had 90 per cent mobile-subscriber market share, according to a 2018 CRTC report. \u201cCanada\u2019s wireless service market is dominated by the Top 3,\u201d the commission noted.\n\nForeign firms are allowed to participate in the Canadian telecom market, but in limited ways. Overseas owners are not allowed to acquire over 20 per cent of the voting shares of any Canadian carrier with more than a 10 per cent market share. They also can\u2019t own more than 33.3 per cent of the voting shares of a wireless provider\u2019s holding company.\n\n\u201cCanadians pay some of the highest telecom fees in the world,\u201d wrote one subscriber. \u201cWith foreign competition, it will lower the cost for everyone.\u201d\n\nBut another argued the regulatory environment is not what\u2019s stopping international firms from setting up in Canada. \u201cThey choose not to because the industry is already competitive and there is not a business case for them to enter the market,\u201d argued one subscriber.\n\nMany respondents said they preferred policies that would encourage more companies to offer wireless and internet services to measures that limit prices.\n\n\u201cIncrease competition and let the market do its work,\u201d wrote one subscriber. \u201cPrice caps would lead to less investment.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, about 63 per cent of respondents said Canada should impose price caps on its internet and wireless service providers. Around 32 per cent said they strongly agreed with the idea, while 30 per cent said they somewhat agreed.\n\n\u201cI believe that telecommunications are a public good and a public service, which should be available to all, anywhere in the country,\u201d wrote one subscriber, \u201cand that they should be affordable, and revenue neutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur rates [are] embarrassing,\u201d wrote another. \u201cI cannot believe that I now hate my cell phone bill and don\u2019t mind my cable bill\u2014I never believed that could happen.\u201d\n\nOpening the market to more foreign competition could lead to lower prices for internet and wireless plans and increase economic growth, according to internal government documents prepared for officials reviewing the Telecommunications Act in 2018, and obtained by The Logic. Doing so could also boost the stock prices of domestic giants like Rogers, Telus and Bell, the documents said.\n\nBut Canadian carriers have opposed foreign firms\u2019 attempts to enter Canada in the past. In 2013, the then-Conservative government\u2019s new telecommunications policy attracted the interest of U.S. giant Verizon, which considered entering the Canadian market. In response, Bell, Rogers and Telus launched an ad campaign claiming the the regulations gave foreign carriers an unfair advantage in the market by allowing them to buy up smaller players. Verizon eventually lost interest in entering the market.\n\nAsked for comment, Bell and Rogers directed The Logic to the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association (CWTA), which represents wireless firms.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian wireless market is fiercely competitive,\u201d said association spokesperson Greg Burch. \u201cForeign investors are able to enter our market. but with multiple providers competing for a relatively small market, it is likely that investors see more lucrative opportunities elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRichard Gilhooley, Telus communications manager, said the company \u201chas always expressed support for foreign investment and ownership in Canada, and we welcome competition from inside or outside of Canada provided it\u2019s fair and equitable.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said regulating domestic retail prices would be \u201cunprecedented for a G7 country,\u201d noting that wireless prices have decreased since 2014.\n\n\u201c[Price caps] stifle innovation and discourage investment in the expansion and upgrading of wireless infrastructure,\u201d Burch said. He also argued declining wireless prices from \u201cvigorous facilities-based competition\u201d make them \u201cunnecessary.\u201d\n\nAll four major parties have taken aim at telecoms charges during the current federal election campaign.\n\nShare the full article!

If prices don\u2019t decrease enough using those measures, they would implement more rules in two years.\n\nThe Conservatives have criticized the incumbent Liberals\u2019 regulatory approach, calling it \u201cheavy-handed.\u201d The party has not yet proposed its own policies on wireless rates.\n\nThe NDP has promised to put a price cap on wireless and internet bills based on what customers in other OECD countries pay. Leader Jagmeet Singh has also said the party wants \u201ctrue, unlimited data plans,\u201d as opposed to current offerings that throttle data speeds once a certain amount has been used.\n\nThe Greens\u2019 platform states it would allow more domestic competition against the major telecoms to lower prices, creating \u201creforms to Canadian laws and fees\u201d that would make it easier for smaller firms to do so.", "description": "Majority also support price caps on wireless and internet services", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wireless_Pricing_Report_2018-P_Doug-Ives-CP_19006909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
