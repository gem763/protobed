These are goods and services produced by humans. Who will supply these goods and services? Who will pay for them?\n\nIf some people are entitled by \u201cright\u201d to the products and work of others, it means that those others are deprived of their rights and property. No one has the right to impose obligations, unrewarded duties or involuntary servitude on others. There is no such thing as a right to enslave.\n\nEntitlements, welfare and an expanding list of \u201crights\u201d such as health care, food and housing do not constitute freedom; they constitute dependency. These aren\u2019t rights; they are rations of involuntary servitude.\n\nSelf-sustaining, self-reliant citizens are the foundation of a free society. Our culture no longer reflects this ideal. Our educational system no longer teaches how or why the individual rights protected by the Constitution created the highest standard of living on the planet. The right to life does not mean others must provide you with the necessities of life.\n\nED KONECNIK\n\nFlushing, N.Y.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
