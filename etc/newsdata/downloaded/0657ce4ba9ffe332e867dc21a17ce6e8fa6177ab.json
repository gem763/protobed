At Christmas time, when we are on holidays, I'm going to be in an isolation ward,' he said.\n\nDespite his refreshed and stylish appearance Barry's body is riddled with tumours and issues.\n\n'I have a whole bunch of giant tumours, like big holes in my body. In my pelvis I've got a big one in my thigh.'\n\nFellow Channel 10 host Lisa Wilkinson asked him about the state of his prognosis.\n\nBarry told Lisa Wilkinson: 'I learnt early in life, that if you invest in negativity, there is literally no dividend'.

They told me three months the first time,' he said.\n\n'I learnt early in life, that if you invest in negativity, there is literally no dividend.\n\n'Look if I smile at you that's a relatively easy investment - Look I smiled at you and you smiled back, that's a beautiful dividend,' he said to Lisa.\n\nFamily first: Barry (pictured with his children Arabella and Bennett) was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2017 after already having gone through cancer previously\n\nBarry previously told Australian Men's Health while he considers himself to be an optimist, the thought of his lasting memory being so negative for his children has been on the forefront of his mind.\n\nHe has changed his focus to strengthening his mental health, while still taking steps to keep in shape and gradually build up his physical strength.\n\n'What I have is not curable. But I'm in a great place.
