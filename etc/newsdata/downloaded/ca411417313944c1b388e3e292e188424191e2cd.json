McDermott, 58, will remain at the company in an advisory role through the end of the year.\n\nShares of SAP rose as much as 8.1% in Frankfurt on Friday, the most since April, and are up 31% for the year.\n\nMorgan, 48, who joined SAP in 2004, most recently served as president of the software giant\u2019s cloud business group. She became the first American woman appointed to SAP\u2019s executive board in 2017 when she was named president of the Americas and Asia. Klein, 39, joined SAP as a student in 1999 and has been chief operating officer since April 2016, and on the executive board since 2018.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s departure was unexpected, but the new co-CEOs were on investors\u2019 \u201cshort-list\u201d to take over in future, Citigroup analysts including Walter Pritchard said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe decision was made based on my determination that 10 years is a long time to be CEO,\u201d McDermott said on a conference call after the announcement. \u201cYou get to the point when you have done what you set out to do and then some.\u201d\n\nMcDermott joined Walldorf, Germany-based SAP in 2002 and was the first American to hold the CEO position at the firm. He embraced cloud computing, changing the way SAP sold software so customers could use it over the internet. He\u2019s been transitioning the company through acquisitions and revamped products, challenging rivals Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp.\n\nWhile SAP had pledged to triple cloud revenue by 2023, the effort has shown mixed results and the company has pushed to shore up profit margins with the support of activist investor Elliott Management.\n\nEarlier, SAP reported preliminary third-quarter revenue and profit that topped analysts\u2019 estimates. Cloud bookings, a key metric in the company\u2019s transition, increased 33% on a constant currency basis, more than double the pace of the second quarter, the company said.\n\nSAP\u2019s 3Q results \u201cwill likely be received positively and we\u2019d expect will drive a relief in shares,\u201d Citi said in its note.\n\nMcDermott cited the strong results as a reason for the timing of the leadership change, saying he wanted to give his successors the reins while the company is at \u201cmaximum strength.\u201d\n\nMorgan said she was only three hours into her tenure so didn\u2019t know what changes she might push for, but expressed optimism in the leadership structure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very big believer that when two people come together, you can really get a lot done,\u201d she said on the conference call.\n\nMcDermott said he was uncertain about his future plans.\n\n\u201cI will do something at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today\u2019s SAP\u2019s day. There is no doubt in my mind the future of SAP is even brighter now.\u201d\n\n(Updates with comments, context and shares throughout.)\n\n--With assistance from Joe Easton.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE named executives Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein as the successors to Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott, who\u2019s stepping down after leading Europe\u2019s largest software company during a decade of major industry changes.The two SAP veterans will become co-CEOs effective immediately", "authors": ["Nico Grant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C6Zjnfj98qojPWkqHgV8Ew--~B/aD0yOTI2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b3dd5b9dff3d8d1ed907cb299e08a434", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
