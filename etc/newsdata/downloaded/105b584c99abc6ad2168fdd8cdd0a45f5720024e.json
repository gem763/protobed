Will Hurd, Texas Republican, while appearing before members of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cOutside of that, we do face significant threats. I\u2019d say number one is not necessarily kinetic, but cyber. This is a cyber war,\u201d Mr. Maguire continued. \u201cWe talk about whether or not the great competition is taking place with Russia and China, and we are building ships and weapons to do that, but in my estimation the great competition with these countries is taking place right now and is doing that in the cyber realm.\u201d\n\nMr. Maguire, a retired Navy rear admiral, was named acting director of national intelligence by Mr. Trump on August 15. An intelligence community whistleblower had filed a formal complaint alleging wrongdoing on the president\u2019s part days earlier, the likes of which was the main topic of discussion during Thursday\u2019s previously scheduled committee hearing.\n\nDaniel R. Coats, Mr. Trump\u2019s last Senate-confirmed director of national security, similarly said last year that \u201cthe digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe warning signs are there. The system is blinking, and it is why I believe we\u2019re at a critical point,\u201d Mr. Coats warned at the time.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
