When the council president declined, he and other RN councillors walked out then posted the incident online.\n\nThe government condemned the public humiliation of the mother and education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said no law had been infringed.", "description": "A rift has emerged within President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s ruling majority over whether women who wear the Islamic headscarf when accompanying children on school outings are contravening France\u2019s strict rules on secularism.", "authors": ["Henry Samuel", "Douglas Carswell", "Shanker Singham", "Asa Bennett", "Pieter Cleppe", "Tom Harris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000081660463-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
