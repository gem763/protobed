Elijah Cummings, during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cumming, who died Thursday at age 68, was remembered as a moral voice of conscience in a divisive era \u2014 a leader who fought for civil rights and took on the White House as a prominent figure in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nBorn to a family of Southern sharecroppers, Cummings was a formidable orator who advocated for the poor in his black-majority district of Baltimore: \"Steely yet compassionate, principled yet open to new perspectives,\" former President Barack Obama said.\n\nIn a testament to Cummings' ability to forge friendships across the aisle during a time of intense political polarization, tributes poured in from across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted his \"condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see firsthand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader.\" He also ordered flags at the White House and other federal buildings to be flown at half-staff through Friday to honor Cummings.\n\nEarlier this year, Cummings defended his city against Trump, who criticized the Democrat's district as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\" Cummings replied that government officials must stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments\" that distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\n\"Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\" Cummings said.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led investigations of the president's government dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to Trump's family members serving in the White House.\n\nObama, whose 2008 presidential bid counted Cummings as an early supporter, said he and his wife, Michelle, were \"heartbroken\" by the loss of their friend.\n\n\"He showed us all not only the importance of checks and balances within our democracy, but also the necessity of good people stewarding it,\" Obama said.\n\nWith Cummings' death, Americans \"have lost a great leader at a time of crisis in our democracy,\" civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis said.\n\n\"When this nation needed him most, he became a moral voice 'crying in the wilderness,' and his words and actions called a reluctant nation to conscience,\" the Georgia Democrat said in a statement.\n\nWords of praise also came from Cummings' Republican admirers.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Cummings as \"a living legend in his native Baltimore\" and said he \"counted close friends and admirers from all across the political spectrum.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called Cummings \"a respected adversary\" who was tough but fair.\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, a veteran Democrat from New York, will for now take over leadership of the House oversight committee, according to a senior Democratic leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the decision publicly.\n\nThe committee, authorized to investigate virtually any part of the federal government, is one of three conducting the House impeachment probe of Trump. Cummings was among the three chairmen to sign a letter seeking documents into whether Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate the family of Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden. The committees have issued subpoenas of witnesses after the Trump administration's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment probe and have jointly been meeting behind closed doors to hear testimony.\n\nSeparately, Cummings led an effort to gain access to Trump's financial records. His committee subpoenaed records from Mazars USA, an accounting firm that provided services to Trump. The panel demanded documents from 2011 to 2018 as it probed Trump's reporting of his finances and potential conflicts of interest. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled the records must be turned over.\n\nCummings died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications of longstanding health problems, according to his office. He had hoped to return to Congress within about a week after a medical procedure for which he hadn't offered details. He'd previously been treated for heart and knee issues.\n\nHis widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, chairwoman of Maryland's Democratic Party, said in a statement: \"He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem.\"", "description": "Maryland Rep.
