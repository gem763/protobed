Going beyond the limits of a box score, Porter looked strong and like someone who very much has a chance at cracking Denver\u2019s rotation.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. could swing the Nuggets\u2019 season\n\nStory continues\n\nPorter, ranked by Rivals as the No. 1 player in the Class of 2017 and considered a potential top pick, fell to the Nuggets at No. 14 due to concerns about his health after missing nearly the entire college basketball season as a freshman at Missouri because of back surgery. Those concerns were later validated when it was revealed he would miss all of last season after undergoing a second back surgery.\n\nThe convenient part about Porter\u2019s situation for the Nuggets is that they aren\u2019t under pressure to force minutes on him. The team returned basically the entirety of a roster that won 54 games and the No. 2 seed in the West last year and has plenty of depth at the small forward position. Torrey Craig, Will Barton and Juan Hernangomez all saw minutes ahead of Porter on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be an interesting year for Mike, a lot of expectations,\u201d Nuggets head coach Malone said, per the Denver Post. \u201cComing to a team that had a really good season, that has a lot of depth. Nothing is going to be given to Mike, he\u2019s going to have to earn everything he gets. We all understand his talent and the potential that he has. I think for him, it\u2019s just go out there and play and as we continue to play, we\u2019re going to help you learn from everything you\u2019re going through, because at the end of the day, these experiences will be his best teacher.\u201d\n\nAs important as it is to make sure Porter can ease back, the fact also remains that no player can swing the Nuggets\u2019 season this year quite like Porter if he lives up to the hype. Few players in the NBA can swing the entire NBA season like Porter if he gives the Nuggets another deadly shooter for Nikola Jokic to find or another pick-and-pop threat for Jamal Murray and Gary Harris.\n\nIt is way too early to tell if Porter can be that guy this year \u2014 and impossible to say if he will stay healthy \u2014 but Tuesday was a good first step.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After two lost seasons and two back surgeries, the Nuggets' 2018 first-rounder is finally here.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HVUIbYEW7BrFX64widoJOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NjguMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kmZDuhYfZZ29SivZU9jMtQ--~B/aD0yMzU5O3c9MzQ3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0d080ff0-ea56-11e9-a6dd-44fa32132c74", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
