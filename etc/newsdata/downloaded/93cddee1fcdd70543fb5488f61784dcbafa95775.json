The opposition Conservative party \u2013 currently neck-and-neck with Trudeau\u2019s Liberals \u2013 confirmed it had sent the video to Global News earlier in the week.\n\nA spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did \u201cknowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was\u201d.\n\nJustin Trudeau brownface: Canada PM apologises after image emerges Read more\n\nThe scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin \u2013 complete with dark skin makeup and a turban \u2013 at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher.\n\nTrudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song.\n\n\u201cI apologise profoundly,\u201d Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself.

He has apologized. I know it is not representative of the man he is,\u201d Mitzie Hunter, a black member of Ontario\u2019s Liberal party, tweeted. \u201cThis is a teachable moment for all of us.
