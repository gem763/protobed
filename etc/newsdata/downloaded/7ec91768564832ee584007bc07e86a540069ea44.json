It was a night that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will quickly want to forget, but it only raised more questions about the current state of this side.\n\nThis was uninspiring fare from United, even though Mason Greenwood\u2019s breakthrough briefly threatened to save Solskjaer from a discreditable draw for the second time in the space of a week. Rochdale had a teenage dream of their own: Luke Matheson, a year Greenwood\u2019s junior, volleyed in an equaliser eight minutes later.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Solskjaer\u2019s side are still failing to create clear-cut opportunities against organised defences, but at least the penalty woes of the early weeks are behind them. Their spot-kicks were faultless, in fact, with Daniel James scoring the decisive kick and sparing his manager's blushes.\n\nRochdale show Manchester football can survive\n\nThe last few months have been among the most painful in the history of Greater Manchester football. The sad loss of Bury from the Football League and the near-death experience of Bolton Wanderers led many to question whether life in the shadow of United and City is sustainable in the long-term.\n\nRochdale, however, are proof that local community clubs in the region can survive and succeed. A noisy 6,000-strong following filled out Old Trafford\u2019s away end better than some more illustrious visitors, while Brian Barry-Murphy\u2019s team themselves made this cup tie a true contest.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rochdale-raised Axel Tuanzebe became the youngest player to captain United since Norman Whiteside in 1985, having skippered the club at every youth level before tonight. Articulate and intelligent, his leadership qualities are clear.\n\nAnd yet it was a selection that spoke volumes, given the seniority elsewhere on the pitch. If a 21-year-old making only his second start in the best part of two-and-a-half years was the best captaincy option, what exactly does that say about his elders?\n\nRusty Pogba's miss nearly proves costly\n\nOne such senior player is Pogba who, in fairness, was returning from an ankle injury and playing for the first time since last month\u2019s draw at Southampton. There were glimpses of his supreme ability, little flicks and turns, but just as many signs of rustiness.\n\nHe will regret, more than anything, the free far-post header after 34 minutes that, from no more than 10 yards out, he nodded over the crossbar. It was arguably United\u2019s best chance of the evening, but one that their record signing could not convert.\n\nChong struggling to find his feet\n\nOf the young players to be handed first-team opportunities by Solskjaer, only one is yet to really find his feet. Tahith Chong tracked back studiously, but failed to have much of an effect going forward and was replaced on the hour mark. He lasted only eight minutes longer against Astana.\n\nChong has demonstrated his ability in United\u2019s youth ranks time and again. There is a player there, one United worked hard to sign from Feyenoord as a schoolboy and one Solskjaer has talked up ever since his return last December. One of the few plus points of this victory will be another cup tie and another opportunity to blood him through.", "description": "United problems laid bare by League One opponents Manchester United progress to the fourth round of this year\u2019s EFL Cup, but only after having their many problems exposed by third-tier Rochdale.
