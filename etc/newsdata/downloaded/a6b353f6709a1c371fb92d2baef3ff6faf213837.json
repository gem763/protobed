Going back to the same venue will bring back good memories and hopefully I can play some decent stuff again.\n\n\u2018I played really well against Ronnie. Even the top players miss when you put them under pressure and punish their mistakes. To beat him 6-1 was fantastic and probably the best result I have had. Any time that you play Ronnie it is a different experience. He is the man and always will be, as long as he keeps playing.\n\n\u2018As good as John Higgins and Judd Trump are, Ronnie is a little bit special to play against and it is amazing when you beat him.\n\n\u2018If I end my career having not won a ranking event, I will have nobody to blame but myself. Getting to that final did give me extra confidence. I just need to be more consistent.\u2019\n\nThe 2019 English Open begins on Monday in Crawley where Davis will continue his quest for a first ranking title at 47-years-old.\n\nLast year\u2019s beaten finalist takes on former world champion Graeme Dott in the first round, while O\u2019Sullivan is back in Crawley and faces Jamie O\u2019Neill in his opener.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s English Open opponent Jamie O\u2019Neill is back on tour after a \u2018four or five year party\u2019\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and Judd Trump complete cracking English Open line-up", "description": "Mark Davis produced a huge shock at last year's English Open as he hammered Ronnie O'Sullivan 6-1 in the semi-finals, a result he sees as the best of his career....", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-635537908_1570990554.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
