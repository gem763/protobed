Some of the donors that we studied said they would want to take part.\n\n\"We'd plan to give transplants to 40 recipients to begin with. Some would receive the real thing and others a placebo. All of them would get antibiotics for their BV too though.\"", "description": "Doctors believe some women with repeat infections could benefit from the procedure.", "authors": ["Michelle Roberts", "Health Editor", "Bbc News Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/886B/production/_108732943_gettyimages-874067096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
