Just about two decades later, he is the face of another one. His current act as Trump\u2019s globe-hopping investigator and defender whose actions have helped spur an impeachment inquiry in Congress is a legacy-altering role, and probably his grandest. He may have gotten the title in 2001, but Rudy Giuliani is truly America\u2019s mayor in 2019.\n\nAs much as Giuliani spoke to the resilience Americans wanted to feel in the fall of 2001, he is now speaking to the mania many of us feel in the fall of 2019. The US in 2019 is less aspirational and more a 75-year-old man shouting warnings of treason from a cable news sofa. It\u2019s less \u201ccity of one\u201d and more \u201cI will be the hero.\u201d It\u2019s less \u201cextraordinary grace\u201d and more inopportune spittle.\n\nThe US in 2019 is yelling non sequiturs at you on the phone because you aren\u2019t asking the right questions. It is demanding your attention, even though you\u2019re not really sure what it\u2019s demanding. It is paranoid, anxious, and somehow winking.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Berman", "Buzzfeednews.Com Article Mattberman Rudy-Giuliani-Impeachment-Ukraine-Donald-Trump-Fox-News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
