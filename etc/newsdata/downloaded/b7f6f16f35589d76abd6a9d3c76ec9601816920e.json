For example, a policy on how the department evaluates corporate compliance programs was intended to help compliance officers convince management to invest in such programs, Mr. Miner said.\n\nSensitive negotiations around criminal settlements rarely spill into the public view. But in at least one case, involving Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA, the Justice Department appeared to accept the argument that a company was unable to pay the entire sum of a criminal fine.\n\nIn the case of Odebrecht, prosecutors and the company agreed the appropriate criminal fine for its misconduct was $4.5 billion, to be split between the U.S., Brazil and Swiss governments. But prosecutors agreed the fine was subject to an inability-to-pay analysis to be conducted at a later date, since Odebrecht had claimed it was only able to pay about $2.6 billion.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Miner also highlighted efforts by the Justice Department to use data analytics to boost its health care and securities fraud enforcement programs.\n\nTrading data in the commodities or securities markets could be used to identify indicators or anomalies that can suggest manipulation or fraud, Mr. Miner said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we are now approaching enforcement, particularly in the commodities arena, around a data-driven approach,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "There are few guidelines for resolving such claims, Matthew Miner, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, said in prepared remarks delivered at a conference in Houston.
