REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nInvestor focus for now is centered on the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday. Expectations it will push interest rates even further into negative territory have weighed on the euro EUR=EBS, which has shed 3% since June.\n\nThe single currency edged higher to $1.1050, with bets divided on the likely scope and style of any stimulus.\n\n\u201cNobody really wants to commit yet,\u201d said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Gain Capital in Singapore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the trade-war boost last week, it\u2019s filtered through this week, and so markets are taking a bit of a breather,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s in that little in-between stage - what\u2019s going to keep to keep that value going?\u201d\n\nThe ECB decision is likely to set the tone for upcoming rate-setting decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan next week, and for the broader global risk appetite.\n\nSince being fired by news last week that a new round of U.S.-China trade talks were scheduled for next month, the risk-on sentiment has begun to fade.\n\nBut there was still enough optimism left for Asian equities to move higher, and for U.S. bond yields to hold near a one-month high, while the retreat from safe havens saw the yen ease to 107.77 per dollar, its weakest since Aug. 1.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 stood at $1.2356, near its six-week high of $1.2385 hit earlier in the week on the reduced chances for Britain to crash out of the European Union without a divorce deal.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNY= and Australian dollar AUD=D3 briefly jumped after the editor of Communist Party newspaper The Global Times tweeted that China would introduce measures to mitigate the trade-war impact.\n\nOverhanging the buying of riskier currencies, however, are signs of a slowdown in global demand.\n\nECB policymakers are leaning toward a revival package that includes a rate cut, a pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks over the side-effects of negative rates, five sources familiar with the discussion said last week.\n\nGermany also signaled its readiness for relaxing its staunch opposition to deficit spending to support the economy.\n\nOn the other hand, concerns have been building that global central banks are reaching the limits of their stimulus options, especially those with negative interest rates and sub-zero long-term sovereign bond yields.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the incoming policy stimulus by the ECB will be enough to offset the headwinds faced by the bloc,\u201d said Han Tan, a market analyst at brokerage FXTM.\n\n\u201cShould the ECB not live up to markets\u2019 dovish expectations this week, that may allow the euro to post some immediate gains,\u201d he said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe ECB\u2019s policy decision and conveyed outlook may also prompt immediate moves in the dollar, considering that the Euro accounts for more than half of the dollar index.\u201d\n\nThe dollar index .DXY was steady at 98.332.\n\nMuch of the broader positive mood in recent days has been driven by optimism that a high-level meeting of U.S. and Chinese negotiators at Washington next month can deliver some sort of trade-war circuit breaker.\n\nThat was tamped down somewhat by White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Tuesday, when he urged patience about resolving the two-year trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies and said to \u201clet the process take its course.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of a breakthrough has stoked appetite for Asian currencies such as the trade-exposed South Korean won KRW=, which drifted higher to 1193.35 per dollar, close to its highest since Aug. 2.\n\n(The story is refiled to insert apostrophe on investors\u2019 in lead paragraph.)", "description": "The dollar steadied on Wednesday as investors' appetite for risk showed cautious improvement and the yen weakened in the shift away from safe havens, but currencies kept to tight ranges ahead of a series of major central bank meetings over the next week.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428576618&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A01D", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
