He was pushed into an autorickshaw and taken away by police.\n\nTwo Tibetan activists, both women, staged a protest inside Chennai airport, holding a banner that read: \"Xi Jinping Stop Occupation in Tibet - Free Tibet.\"\n\nChina sent troops into remote, mountainous Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist ever since.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. China brands him a dangerous reactionary who seeks to split off nearly a quarter of the Chinese land mass.\n\nThe 1989 Nobel Peace laureate denies the charge and says he seeks greater rights for Tibetans.\n\nThe Dalai Lama and the so-called Tibetan government-in-exile have been based in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamsala for decades, but India has been careful not to let Tibetans embarrass visiting Chinese leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nTERRITORIAL DISPUTE\n\nIndian officials say they expect China to respect its core concerns in the same way, including over the issue of Kashmir.\n\nModi and Xi will be aiming to move forward on a set of confidence-building measures during the informal summit in Mamallapuram, a short distance from Chennai, an Indian source briefed on the discussions said.\n\nIndia and China share a 3,500 km (2,200 mile) border, over which they went to war in 1962. Its course remains unresolved despite more than 20 rounds of talks.\n\nThe border has been largely peaceful, but there have been occasional stand-offs between soldiers from the two Asian giants. The measures on the table include more border trade, tourism and even joint military patrols to boost trust, said the source.\n\n\"Priority will be given to enhancing confidence-building measures and people-to-people exchanges,\" a second government source said.\n\nModi and Xi will also discuss India's ballooning trade deficit with China and the question of allowing Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei into India's 5G network.\n\n\"Xi will have an in-depth communication with Modi on issues that have overall, long-term and strategic significance on bilateral relations, set the tune and guide the direction for future development of the ties,\" Chinese state media quoted Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui as saying.\n\nXi will head to Nepal on Saturday, the first Chinese president to visit the buffer state between India and China in 22 years.\n\n\"We need to make greater efforts to develop a Multi-dimensional Connectivity Network across the Himalayas,\" he wrote in an article in three Nepali newspapers.\n\nChina has been building infrastructure in Nepal along with other South Asian countries as part of Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative, raising disquiet in India which long saw countries such as Nepal as part of its sphere of influence.", "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to agree new security measures along their unsettled border during a summit on Friday, officials said, in an effort to smooth ties ruffled by differences over Kashmir.
