But then Lydia came home with a swollen black eye. The little girl told her mother that her classmates hit her and threw a shoe at her.\n\nCalculli says she reported the incident to her daughter\u2019s school, but nothing came of it. She turned to social media, where Batman impersonator Jack Asbury saw the post and offered to walk the little girl to school. Calculli posted an adorable photo of the shy girl holding the black-caped superhero\u2019s hand in the classroom.\n\nWTSP reports the toddler has since been moved to an advanced learning class.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Batman descended on a Florida preschool to help a 3-year-old girl who was being bullied.
