CFC chemicals, which are found in older fridges, cause damage to the ozone layer and contribute to climate change at a far greater rate than equivalent amounts of CO2. Gases in newer fridges are far less damaging, but can still be harmful to the environment when emitted.\n\nInstead, they must be recycled by specialists.\n\nBut in 2017 just 51 per cent of the theoretically available blowing agent was captured across eight licensed plants, according to the study by a global sustainability consultancy Anthesis.\n\nIn 2018 only 59 per cent was captured, meaning the equivalent of 30,000 patio heaters worth of CO2 escaped into the atmosphere.\n\nOver two years that equated to releasing 418,660 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, or the emissions of 100,000 family cars.\n\nOne plant captured just a quarter of blowing agent in 2017 and 27 per cent last year.\n\nLicences for recycling plants are dependent on periodic reporting on performance.\n\nThis includes the amount of blowing agent theoretically available in the machines they are recycling and the amount recovered.\n\nHowever, much of the data was incomplete with some plants only providing half the required amount per year.\n\nAround four million household fridges are sold annually in the UK.\n\nAbout 2.7million old fridges were disposed of and processed at specialist plants in 2017 and 2.5million in 2018.\n\nCFCs in fridges and freezers have been gradually phased out over 30 years, but modern fridges still contain elements that contribute to climate change when released, though to a much lesser extent.\n\nLabour MP Mary Creagh, chairman of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee, said: 'Environmental permits should be respected.\n\nThat recycling facilities are failing to meet targets, or opting not to report performance, puts our health at risk.\n\nAbout 2.7million old fridges were disposed of and processed at specialist plants in 2017 and 2.5million in 2018\n\n'Once again the under-resourced Environment Agency is unable to tackle potential waste crimes. My committee will take up this issue.'\n\nDr Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: 'The Environment Agency need to up their regulatory game.'\n\nA spokesman for campaign group the Environmental Investigation Agency said: 'The Environment Agency should investigate this without delay. We're in a climate emergency where every tonne counts.'\n\nThe report stated that while many sites across Europe achieve the required capture rates, in the UK only the Telford-based plant AO consistently does so. In late 2018, Viridor St Helens also achieved this.\n\nThe Anthesis study, commissioned by AO, analysed submissions to the EA obtained from Freedom of Information requests.\n\nAn Environment Agency spokesman said: 'We check the performance of these plants against the terms of their operating permits through a combination of inspections, audits and data monitoring \u2013 where necessary we will take action to make sure they comply with those terms.'\n\nJohn Roberts, AO's chief executive, said: 'Customers have every right to trust brands to give them what they are paying for.\n\n'This wasn't the case in the recycling industry and retailers were turning a blind eye so we invested \u00a310million in a recycling plant to make sure we were in control, meaning AO customers can be safe in the knowledge that their products are recycled to the right standard.'", "description": "Since 2002 it has been illegal to dispose of fridges in a way that releases certain emissions.
