But it's not cheap.\n\nIf you want to visit, one way to cut down on expenses is to book your flights with points and miles.\n\nLuckily, it isn't hard to earn enough points from top rewards credit cards to book a flight to Japan, especially if you're open to flying in economy class.\n\nFor example, if you have Ultimate Rewards points from a Chase card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, you could book a round-trip flight on ANA by transferring just 60,000 points to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club.\n\nRead more personal finance coverage.\n\nJapan is an incredible travel destination, perfect for luxury and adventure travelers alike. It's also quite expensive, so you'll want to plan out your trip carefully to avoid sticker shock. Flights are one of the biggest expenses and, luckily, you can cover them with points and miles.\n\nBelow are five of the cheapest ways to get to Japan in economy class on points and miles, along with the rewards credit cards that can help you earn the points you need to get there.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It's important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.\n\nAll Nippon Airways (40,000 to 55,000 miles round-trip)\n\nJapanese carrier All Nippon Airways has many \"sweet spot\" awards in its loyalty program, and the US to Japan is one of them.\n\nIt takes just 50,000 miles round-trip to fly ANA to Japan in economy class. During low season (most of January to February, and April), redemption rates drop to 40,000 miles round-trip. Even high-season awards are reasonable, at 55,000 miles.\n\nIf you're wondering how on earth you can get your hands on some ANA miles, it's actually easier than you might think. ANA is a transfer partner of two major bank rewards programs: American Express Membership Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards. Points from both programs transfer to ANA at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nEarning 40,000 to 55,000 miles for a round-trip ticket to Japan is as easy as one credit card sign-up bonus.
