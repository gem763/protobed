(Image: NASA, ESA, A. Simon (Goddard Space Flight Centre), and M.H. Wong (University of California, Berkeley)\n\nI\u2019ve seen many pictures of Saturn, some crisp and clear, some blurry, some big, some small. I think I have the authority to tell you that this new image from Hubble is an especially good one.\n\nSaturn attracts a lot of attention, what with its rings, its hexagon, its large size, and its moons, some of which might even have the conditions for life. I don\u2019t really have any reasons or science to back up why this one is good. But when I saw this one, I thought, \u201cWow.... that\u2019s a nice picture of Saturn.\u201d I would say it\u2019s even better than last year\u2019s.\n\nHubble takes images of Saturn every year when the Earth is at its closest to the gas giant, or about 1.36 billion kilometres away. This year, that occurred on June 20. Scientists are specifically interested in the planet\u2019s weather and how it evolves over time. Hubble can take these impressive images because it\u2019s able to keep itself pointed at the planet for a relatively long period of time (compared to the window for imaging that a passing space probe would have, for example), according to a Hubble release.\n\nTwo years ago now, scientists ended the Cassini mission that was studying the ringed planet \u2014 specifically, they crashed the probe into Saturn\u2019s atmosphere. But researchers have been able to glean lots of insights from the data the spacecraft returned.\n\nFor example, Saturn\u2019s rings might be only 100 million years old and might only last for another 100 million years. The rings also might be raining thousands of pounds of matter onto the planet\u2019s surface every second.\n\nThey\u2019ve also learned that Saturn\u2019s enormous hexagon (which by itself could fit four Earths end-to-end) might be a lot taller than expected.\n\nIt\u2019s an awesome planet, and we\u2019re lucky that this year we got an especially good look at it.", "description": "I\u2019ve seen many pictures of Saturn, some crisp and clear, some blurry, some big, some small.
