State-owned or state-controlled companies now own most of the bookshops and newspapers in the territory.\n\nBeijing also accelerated economic integration between Hong Kong and the mainland, hoping that material wealth would reduce dissatisfaction in the city. After all this, they still ended up with the worst outbreak of unrest on Chinese soil since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.\n\nThe conclusion Beijing has drawn from the past four months of rage is the only one possible in an authoritarian \u2014 increasingly totalitarian \u2014 system: they were far too soft last time around. When the moment is right, they must act ruthlessly to punish Hong Kong.\n\nJust as in China in the aftermath of 1989, Hong Kong\u2019s education system will be overhauled to promote \u201cpatriotic\u201d narratives; \u201cunreliable\u201d civil servants and judges will be purged; news outlets will be muzzled; all business figures, including multinational companies, will be expected to display loyalty to the motherland. The internet will probably be censored.\n\nMass arrests are likely. This is a best-case scenario, predicated on the protests ending now \u2014 which is unlikely.\n\nIn Beijing, the discussion is instructive. Party cadres say there is nothing really wrong with the fish-tank that is Hong Kong, but what is needed is for all the \u201cbad fish\u201d to be replaced with \u201cgood fish\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe central government will try to retain the trappings of an international financial centre \u2014 open markets, a freely convertible currency, a relatively independent and professional judiciary for non-political cases \u2014 but will quickly strip away the rights and freedoms that make Hong Kong unique.\n\nThe calculus of Communist rule does not allow for concessions to unruly provinces. If President Xi Jinping were to compromise and grant Hong Kong the right to vote for its leaders then what about Shanghai or Shenzhen? If he does not harshly punish the territory then the rest of the nation and his many political enemies would smell weakness, rather than applaud his restraint.\n\nBecause the people of Hong Kong instinctively understand what is coming, they are unlikely to quietly return to their ordinary lives.\n\nNeither side can back down. So the chances of People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers on the streets of Hong Kong are rising every day as the violence escalates. One senior police official says privately that as many as a quarter of his officers are joining peaceful protests in their spare time.\n\nHated as it is right now, the Hong Kong police force is made up of Cantonese-speaking locals. Faced with a Mandarin-speaking occupying army from the north, many officers would choose to join the rebellion.\n\nThis scenario would rob Beijing of the luxury to choose when and how it punishes the city.
