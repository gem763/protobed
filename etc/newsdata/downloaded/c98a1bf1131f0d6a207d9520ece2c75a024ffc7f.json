Or, as Nancy Pelosi might cast it, the leaders of two co-equal branches of the government.\n\nNow, with her decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into him, Speaker Pelosi and President Trump are combatants in a historic showdown that will test the nation and shape the legacies of two of the most consequential American politicians of current times.\n\nFor the next few months, it will be Trump v. Pelosi.\n\nSince Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 elections, Pelosi has approached Trump with respect for his office, blunt candor in their private consultations, and scathing rebuke in her public comments. \"Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,\" she scolded him at their first meeting after the midterms. That exchange solidified her reputation as the most formidable Democratic counterpart he has faced since moving into the White House.\n\nThe president has approached her with what seems to be a wary respect. At one point, he even offered to provide Republican votes to help her win the election as Speaker \u2014 she didn\u2019t need them \u2014 although now he is complaining bitterly about the course she is taking as a \"new Witch Hunt!\"\n\nThey are members of the same generation; she is 79, he is 73. He is the undisputed leader of a Republican Party that has been recast in his image; she is the nation\u2019s highest-ranking Democrat and the party\u2019s de facto leader, at least until a presidential nominee emerges.\n\nBut it is hard to imagine two leaders with such different styles and such different strengths and weaknesses.\n\n'AKA your worst nightmare!'\n\nTrump is mercurial and impulsive, conferring with friends, family and friendly talk-show hosts but relying most of all on his own gut. He is not a detail man; fact-checkers often conclude various statements he makes are untrue. He draws energy from raucous rallies in which he routinely speaks for more than hour and basks in the adoration of his most fervent supporters.\n\nPelosi is meticulous, disciplined, controlled. She has held a disparate Democratic caucus together by being the most careful of listeners to other members of Congress, asking their views and understanding their motivations. She is more skilled at cutting deals behind the scenes at the Capitol than with delivering big speeches on the stump.\n\nStill, even Democratic critics who in the past have complained Pelosi has stayed too long in the leadership, that it was past time for fresh faces to take over, see her as ideally suited to this moment.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have some policy disagreements but NP (Nancy Pelosi) was the best to lead us into battle against Trump,\u201d California activist Melissa Byrne, an organizer for Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns, tweeted the other day. Veteran Democratic strategist Brad Woodhouse retweeted that and added: \u201cmay I introduce you to @SpeakerPelosi Mr. Pres? AKA your worst nightmare!\u201d\n\nPelosi has been negotiating the narrow path between the most liberal Democratic House members who have been pushing for impeachment almost from the start of Trump\u2019s presidency and more moderate members from swing districts who have worried that step risked sabotaging their chances for re-election.\n\nShe had been slow-walking impeachment, arguing for the need to gain support from Republicans and the public first. That changed with Trump's acknowledgment that he encouraged the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, his potential 2020 opponent; a whistleblower's complaint accuses White House officials of trying to hide the account of the conversation in a server intended for national security secrets.\n\nNow Pelosi has switched to fast-forward mode, suggesting that a House vote on Articles of Impeachment could be held before the end of the year.\n\n\"Let us be prayerful. Let us be solemn. Let us try not to make it further divisive,\" she said Saturday night in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. \"But we cannot ignore our oath of office to defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"", "description": "President Trump and Speaker Pelosi have been the oddest of couples.
