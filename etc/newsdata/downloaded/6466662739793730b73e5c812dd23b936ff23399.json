I am working.' I mean, I'd been working professionally since I was 16. And I was living on my own, making my own money. I was like, 'I'm fiercely independent.'\"\n\nKEVIN BACON REFUSES TO DANCE ALONG TO 'FOOTLOOSE' IN PUBLIC: 'I TEND TO AVOID IT'\n\nShe continued: \"So when I did fall in love with Kevin, it really just felt like there was some urgency to get married, and I don\u2019t know what it was. Suddenly this thing came over me and I was terrified.\u201d\n\nSedgwick went on to explain that she initially felt this way because she \"couldn't count on people.\"\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t where I felt like I would be successful,\" she said. \"A lot of people had let me down and so I was not interested in being vulnerable or connected in a really serious way.\u201d\n\nWHY KEVIN BACON WON'T REVEAL THE SECRET TO HIS AND KYRA SEDGWICK'S LONG-LASTING MARRIAGE\n\nHowever, despite her initial reservations, Sedwick admitted that Bacon \"just was the one, you know? He was just the soul mate, he was just the one.\"\n\nWhen asked what the secret to their long-lasting marriage was earlier this year, the \"City on a Hill\" star told Fox News that he won't reveal it.\n\n\"There is no secret,\" Bacon began, before clarifying: \"In fact, I've often had a couple of different one-liners for that answer, and then I decided that really the answer is I'm not going to answer it because the last thing I want to do is come up with some quote that is going to summarize a 30-year relationship you know?\"\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's disrespectful to the relationship,\" Bacon added. \"So I don't really know.\"\n\nSedgwick and Bacon celebrated their 31st wedding anniversary earlier this month, marking the milestone with gushing tributes to each other on social media.", "description": "The pair met on the set of the 1988 film \"Lemon Sky.\" They married that same year.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Bacon20Sedgwick20REUTERS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
