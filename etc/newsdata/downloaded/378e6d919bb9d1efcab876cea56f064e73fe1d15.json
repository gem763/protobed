She died on the way to hospital.\n\nHolden was sentenced in February 2017, in B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster, after admitting his involvement in both deaths.\n\nListen to Surakka react to news that Holden was granted day parole:\n\nThomas Robert Holden has been granted day parole after serving fewer than three years of his 10-year sentence. 0:15\n\nJustice Elizabeth Arnold-Bailey told the court the 10-year sentence, \"reflects the need to deter others from acting similarly to resolve difficult interpersonal situations.\"\n\nThe court heard that in the years leading up to her killing, Dudley had been a partner with Holden in an illegal marijuana grow operation. Eventually, they had an affair.\n\nLisa Dudley was shot in Mission in September 2008 and died four days later. (Courtesy of family)\n\nDudley's stepfather, Surakka, says there seems to be no justice.\n\n\"Holden directed the killing. His finger may not have been on the trigger, but he pulled it. He paid $25,000 to have Lisa killed and Guthrie killed. So it is just terrible that he would only serve two years and eight months,\" said Surakka.\n\nThomas Holden, 46, leaves the B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster after a judge put off his sentencing to Feb. 10, 2017. (Belle Puri/CBC)\n\nDay release conditions\n\nParole Board of Canada documents show Holden became eligible for day release on Oct. 3. The board outlined various reasons for the decision, citing \"excellent\" behaviour since Holden was incarcerated and indicated Holden could participate in a men's trauma group while on release.\n\n\"What kind of message does this actually send out to people about the processes involved in taking human life? In our opinion, it devalues that. It's disgusting to me. Our family doesn't think of it as justice at all,\" said Surakka.\n\nEmergency crews loaded one of the two victims in the Mission, B.C., shooting into a helicopter for transport to hospital in 2008. (CBC)\n\nFor now, Holden is living at a community residential facility and is eligible to apply for overnight passes. His release is contingent on several conditions, one of which is to stay away from Dudley's family members.\n\nHolden will be eligible for full parole by March 2020, according to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.", "description": "The family of a Mission, B.C. woman killed in a targeted hit is outraged the man who\u00a0orchestrated the killing is out on day parole after serving fewer than three years of a 10-year sentence.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3911470.1571253983!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lisa-dudley-s-parents.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
