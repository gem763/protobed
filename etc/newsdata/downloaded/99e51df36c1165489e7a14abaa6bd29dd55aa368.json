Make sure 'being successful' isn't how you measure your self-worth\n\nYour sense of self-worth should decouple from professional success. FGorgun/Getty Images\n\n\"When I became a father, I was just getting my company off the ground. Of course, I was excited to fall in love with this brand-new little person in my life, but I was also concerned: If my company ever got traction, was I going to be forced into some sort of Faustian bargain, trading my business against my family? Looking back on things so far, I had it all wrong. To be a successful entrepreneur, I needed something outside of the office to become the core of my identity. To be clear, this doesn't need to be kids, or even family. All that matters is making sure your sense of self-worth is tied to something decoupled from your professional success, or failure. If 'extraordinary professional success' is what you need to feel good about yourself, you'll be reluctant or feel unbearable stress when it comes time to take the really big, important risks. And, ironically, that will just get in the way of your success. To be clear, my advice isn't to go and have a kid before starting a company, but just to make sure the core of your identity and your sense of self-worth is tied to something more grounded than your company's valuation. Ironically, that's the best way to set yourself up for the risk-taking you'll need to maximize it.\"\n\n\u2014 Ben Sigelman, co-founder and CEO at LightStep, a company that makes complex microservice applications more transparent and reliable for customers including Lyft, Under Armour, Medium, GitHub, and Twilio", "description": "From having the exact same routine every morning to regularly declining meetings, here's how they get it done.", "authors": ["Christina Desmarais"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6eb8322e22af17a47c0200?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
