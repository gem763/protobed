Luskin told Yahoo News that Sondland got the order from a State Department official in a phone call at 12:30 a.m. on the morning he was scheduled to appear.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff blasted the Trump administration for blocking Sondland\u2019s testimony, saying that Sondland had turned over to the State Department text messages or emails \u201cdeeply relevant\u201d to the investigation, but that the department had refused to provide them to Congress.\n\nIn his statement Friday, Luskin said that his client cannot turn over those documents under federal law.\n\n\u201cThe State Department has sole authority to produce such documents, and Ambassador Sondland hopes the materials will be shared with the Committees in advance of his Thursday testimony.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, second from right, in 2018. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) More\n\nThe announcement came hours before Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, was scheduled to testify before the same committees as part of the House impeachment probe. Yovanovitch was removed from her post, reportedly because she objected to the backchannel communications between Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and the government of Ukraine.\n\nSondland, a businessman and investor whose companies donated at least $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, was appointed by Trump in May 2018. Ukraine is not part of the European Union, but he has said he took on special assignments from Trump outside his nominal duties.\n\nIn text messages released last week, Sondland was party to key exchanges on whether the White House was withholding a military aid package for Ukraine as part of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in exchange for a Ukrainian investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, wrote in a text message to Sondland at 12:47 a.m. on Sept. 9.\n\nSome hours later, during which Sondland reportedly consulted with Trump, he replied: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intensions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nHe then added: \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "After being blocked from testifying in the House impeachment inquiry, Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the EU and a central player in the Ukraine controversy, will appear before Congress next week.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eYBwq48EKUPpoYEhcLV7ig--~B/aD0yMjc3O3c9MzA3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c21ddc70-e9da-11e9-bdf3-9a660c5276da", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
