Then on Sept. 29, a story was published that said the 33-year-old would appear on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nPer Luke Bailey of the Independent, edits have been made to the online versions of the stories since Rooney's statement:\n\nPer the BBC, The Sun said they did not want to comment on the allegations.\n\nThe Rooneys have been married for 11 years, having met each other during their schooldays, and have four children together.\n\nDC United star Wayne has been playing his football in the United States since the summer of 2018 after leaving Everton. However, he will return to the English game in January after agreeing a deal to join Championship club Derby County as a player-coach.", "description": "Coleen Rooney has said stories were leaked from her private Instagram account to  The Sun  newspaper by Rebekah Vardy, wife of former England international striker Jamie Vardy...", "authors": ["Matt Jones"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/226/hi-res-f565aaf540ddbabc4b3a2af13a7b42ac_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
