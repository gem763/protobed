But just like moving home, a renovation can be a combination of stress and excitement, and \u2013 often puts immense strain on households.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to escape all the disruption that comes with a tiling renovation, but what you can do is lay the foundation for a smoother, less stressful one,\u201d says Tiisetso Mokotjo, product manager at Saint-Gobain Weber.\n\nWhile tiling upgrades are inconvenient, time-consuming and messy, there are several steps that can be taken by homeowners to manage and reduce potential stress and mess in the home.\n\nTile over existing tiles\n\nLet technology work for you and cut out the dust, noise and disruption that comes with chipping out tiles - the bane of any renovation project. When choosing your adhesive, find one that allows tiles to be laid directly onto existing tiles or substrates- preferably one that doesn\u2019t require primer as this cuts out surface preparation work. Not only will this simplify the process, but it also ensures a cleaner, faster and cheaper renovation thanks to a reduction in labour and surface preparation material costs.\n\nOpt for a quick setting adhesive\n\nContractors, workmen and the possibility of limited access to power and water adds to the disruption of an upgrade. So the trick is to minimise downtime and renovate quickly. There are several quick-setting adhesives on the market, some of which set in as little as six hours. Traditionally, tile adhesives can take up to 48 hours to dry but modern developments are changing this. If your household is a busy one, with pets and young children, lay your tiles last thing in the day and leave them to dry overnight. If tiles are laid during the day, think about taking the family on an outing while the adhesive dries. There are quality products available that not only set in six hours, but are primer-free too, saving you even more time and hassle.\n\nPlan your colours, materials and shopping-list upfront\n\nOne thing that can fall by the wayside is the colour of grouting and adhesive. From the outset, match your materials and be sure you have sufficient quantities on site. Plan the process and discuss clearly and concisely what you want upfront to avoid making last minute choices or hardware trips. The rule of thumb for adhesive is to match your tile colour. Weber\u2019s new Renovate offers a white adhesive, which is not always easily available, for lighter tiles, as it avoids staining light coloured tiles. When choosing grout, it\u2019s all about your personal preference \u2013 match the tone of the tile for a unified look or go for contrast if you want the tiles to pop. Also make practical considerations like waterproofing early on and consider using an adhesive that doubles as a moisture barrier\u2013 it\u2019s especially nifty for kitchens and bathrooms upgrades where moisture levels are high.\n\nSource: W24\n\nBack to homepage", "description": "", "authors": ["Truelove Via"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/3-ways-to-make-home-renovations-better/assets/jNlIAEKYJ3/a0ddf227b2f542259a93f2bcb5d1f81d-620x350.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
