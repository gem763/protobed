Let's find that out tomorrow.\"\n\nPressed on whether there is a chance he could back an election on Monday, he replied: \"The principle is: take no-deal off the table, EU answer tomorrow, then we can decide.\"\n\nMr Corbyn denied there was any confusion over his position and suggested he could state on Friday whether Labour will back an election.\n\n\"There's no confusion at all,\" he said.\n\nPressed on whether an extension to the end of January would constitute no-deal being taken off the table, he replied: \"We will know tomorrow what the extension will be and I can answer that question tomorrow.\n\n\"We are not resisting the chance to have an election.\"\n\nEarlier today the Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Government will table a motion in the Commons calling for a general election on Monday.\n\nIt came as the government scrapped plans for a budget on November 6 as the Prime Minister pushed for an election.\n\nLabour 's shadow leader of the House Valerie Vaz said Labour would back an election \"once no-deal is ruled out and if the extension allows\".\n\nThe Prime Minister's move puts Labour in a difficult position because Jeremy Corbyn's objection to an election has been the threat of no deal.\n\nAfter Boris Johnson wrote to the EU asking for a delay in theory it removes their key objection.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBut Labour fear they will lose seats in a pre-Christmas poll.\n\nAnd if they whipped to back the vote around 100 Labour MPs have said they would rebel.\n\nThis evening there was a frantic internal debate on how the party should react.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn held informal discussions with some key shadow cabinet members.\n\nIt's understood that there were differing opinions in the meeting.\n\nA shadow minister was told by the whips' office today that \"no Labour MP should vote for it\".\n\nAnother shadow minister told the Mirror: \"Why give him what he wants? A truncated \u201cscrutiny\u201d of bill and maybe he gets it through plus a general on his terms? No chance.\n\n(Image: North News & Pictures ltd)\n\n\"Plus once we agree to a general everyone up sticks and leaves to campaign - you can\u2019t have proper scrutiny with an election breathing down your neck. He is dangling. Leave him there.\"\n\nBut there are suggestions that within the Leader's office there is pressure to vote for the poll.\n\nFollowing the meeting Shadow Cabinet Secretary Jon Trickett said: \"Let\u2019s be absolutely clear. Getting rid of this awful Tory government is our top priority. Our troops are ready, the party is fully prepared. Let\u2019s get at them!!\"\n\nThis morning Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey was asked if Labour would vote for a general election as soon as the Prime Minister asks for one after the EU grants an extension.\n\nShe told the Today programme: \"That's our position. But we also want the Prime Minister to look at the compromise that's been offered that a lot of MPs support, and that's the ability to be able to properly scrutinise the Bill.\"\n\nBoris Johnson's letter to Jeremy Corbyn in full\n\nLast week, I agreed a new Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union. This is a great new deal which Parliament could have ratified and allowed us to honour our promises and leave by 31 October. Sadly you succeeded in persuading Parliament to ask the EU to delay Brexit until 31 January 2020.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Commons voted for our new deal but again voted for delay and, even worse, handed over control of what happens next to the other EU member states.\n\nI have repeatedly made clear to EU leaders since I became Prime Minister that I believe any delay to be extremely damaging for the country and my view has never changed that we should leave on 31 October. However, it is clear from public and private comments of President Tusk that it is likely that the EU will offer a delay until 31 January, though it is possible that a shorter delay will be offered.\n\nIn our meeting yesterday you suggested that we propose a new timetable for getting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) through Parliament.\n\nThis Parliament has, with your encouragement, voted repeatedly for delay. The vote on Tuesday was Parliament's last chance to get Brexit done before 31 October and it voted, again, for delay. I am extremely sceptical this habit will change and many will doubt that this Parliament will do anything other than waste more time and then, in January, ask for yet another delay.\n\nThese repeated delays have been bad for the economy, bad for businesses, and bad for millions of people trying to plan their futures. If businesses assume that this Parliament will stay, paralysed, refusing to take responsibility for month after month into 2020, it will cause misery for millions.\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal explained Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on 17 October 2019, though it still needs approval by MPs and is now on ice. The 64-page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workers' rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

This would, obviously, be my preference but I was legally prevented by Parliament and the courts from suggesting this. In this circumstance, I assume you will reverse your vote of Tuesday and you will cooperate with me to get our new Brexit deal ratified so we leave with a new deal rather than no deal.\n\nIf the EU offers the delay that Parliament has requested - that is, we must stay in until 31 January - then it is clear that there must be an election. We cannot risk further paralysis. In these circumstances, the Commons will vote next week on whether to hold an election to be held on 12 December. This would mean that Parliament would dissolve just after midnight on 6 November.\n\nIf you commit to voting for an election next week (in the event of the EU offering a delay until 31 January and the Government accepting, as it is legally forced to do by Parliament), then we will make available all possible time between now and 6 November for the WAB to be discussed and voted through, including Fridays, weekends, the earliest starts and the latest finishes.\n\nThis means that we could get Brexit done before the election on 12 December, if MPs choose to do so.\n\nBut if Parliament refuses to take this chance and fails to ratify by the end of 6 November, as I fear it will, then the issue will have to be resolved by a new Parliament. An election on 12 December will allow a new Parliament and Government to be in place by Christmas.\n\nIf I win a majority in this election, we will then ratify the great new deal that I have negotiated, get Brexit done in January and the country will move on.\n\nIf you win a majority, then you will, I assume, implement your policy: that is, you will ask for another delay after 31 January 2020 to give you the time both to renegotiate a new deal then have a referendum, in which you may or may not campaign for your own deal.\n\nIt is time for MPs finally to take responsibility. More people voted Leave in 2016 than have ever voted for anything. Parliament promised to respect the referendum result. But Parliament has repeatedly avoided doing this.\n\nGiven this situation, we must give the voters the chance to resolve this situation as soon as reasonably possible before the next deadline of 31 January. We cannot risk wasting the next three months then this farce being replayed with yet another delay in January 2020 and still no way for the country to move on.\n\nThis Parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new Parliament that can make decisions. Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of Parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\n\nYou have repeatedly said that once the EU accepts Parliament's request for a delay until 31 January, then you would immediately support an election. I assume this remains your position and therefore you will support an election next week so the voters can replace this broken Parliament.\n\nI am copying this letter to the other Westminster political party leaders.", "description": "Labour will whip its MPs to abstain on the vote on Monday", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa", "Reuters", "North News", "Pictures Ltd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717948.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
