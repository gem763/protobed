Turkey considers the biggest militia in the SDF a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe Turkish government wants to create a \"safe zone\" in the area, where it can resettle Syrian refugees currently in Turkey.\n\nMany of them are not Kurds and critics warn this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.\n\nDozens of civilians have been killed in the operation so far and at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN.\n\nKurdish-led forces have been a key ally of the US in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. They described the US withdrawal, which preceded Turkish action, as a \"stab in the back\".\n\nThere are fears the destabilisation could risk a resurgence of IS, as thousands of former fighters and their relatives are being detained in northern Syria. Hundreds of IS family members are said to have already escaped from one camp.\n\nSome aid organisations have been forced to suspend operations and evacuate international staff over security fears.\n\nFacing immense pressure, Kurdish-led forces announced a deal on Sunday with the Syrian government for military support to help repel Turkey.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists the operation will continue until his country's \"objectives have been achieved\" despite the involvement of Syrian government forces.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A Kurdish Syrian woman cries during the funeral of five Syrian Democratic Forces fighters in Ras al-Ain\n\nThe US has imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the country's military offensive in northern Syria.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also phoned his Turkish counterpart to demand an immediate truce, Vice-President Mike Pence said.\n\nMr Pence said he would travel to the region \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nWhat are the US sanctions?\n\nAction has been taken against Turkey's defence and energy ministries, as well as the ministers of defence, energy and interior, the US Treasury said. The move freezes their assets in the US and bans transactions with them that involve the US financial system.\n\nPresident Trump has faced mounting pressure to take action against Turkey - a Nato partner - including from Republicans usually loyal to his administration.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, President Trump also said he would raise tariffs on Turkish steel back to 50% and \"immediately stop\" negotiations related to a \"$100 billion trade deal\" with Turkey.\n\n\"The United States and our partners have liberated 100 percent of ISIS's ruthless territorial caliphate,\" the statement said. \"Turkey must not put these gains in jeopardy.\"\n\nVice-President Pence warned that the sanctions would worsen \"unless and until Turkey embraces an immediate ceasefire\" and negotiates a long-term settlement on the border.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The vice-president insisted that the US \"did not give a green light to Turkey to invade Syria\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who leads the Democrats, said on Twitter that the sanctions fell \"very short of reversing the humanitarian disaster brought about by [the president's] own erratic decision-making\".\n\nEarlier on Monday, European Union countries committed to suspending arms exports to Turkey but stopped short of an EU-wide arms embargo. In response, Turkey said it would examine its co-operation with the EU due to its \"unlawful and biased\" attitude.\n\nUS sanctions lighter than expected\n\nAnalysis by Mark Lowen, former BBC Turkey correspondent\n\nDonald Trump is now sanctioning Turkey for an invasion that he is widely considered to have enabled. By announcing a withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, President Erdogan was given a de facto green light to move in.\n\nThe sanctions might appear hefty, targeting senior ministers and hiking steel tariffs, but in reality, they are lighter than expected - and we have been here before.\n\nIn August 2018, Donald Trump lost patience with Turkey's imprisonment of an American pastor, sanctioning two ministers and imposing 50% tariffs on Turkish aluminium and steel. The Turkish lira plunged to a record low of 7.2 to the dollar.\n\nSince then, the lira has somewhat recovered - and appears to have largely shaken off today's measures. The US represents just 5% of Turkey's steel export market.\n\nPresident Erdogan tends to dig in his heels when he feels under pressure. There is no sign of any change of tack by him - yet.\n\nWhat is happening in Syria?\n\nFollowing the deal with Kurdish-led forces, the Syrian army began to move towards the border on Monday.\n\nThe deal is seen as a boost for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as it meant his troops would return to north-eastern areas for the first time since 2012, when their withdrawal to fight rebels elsewhere allowed Kurdish militias to take control.\n\nDespite disagreeing with their attempts at self-rule, Mr Assad did not seek to retake the territory, especially after the Kurds became partners in the coalition against IS with US troops on the ground.\n\nApart from fighting IS, the Kurds were fundamental to the US in limiting the influence of rivals Russia and Iran and keeping some leverage on the ground.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict\n\nSyrian state media and Russia's defence ministry said government forces had entered the strategic town of Manbij, inside the area where Turkey wants to create its \"safe zone\". Turkish troops and pro-Turkish, anti-government fighters had been gathering near the town.\n\nFor now, Syrian forces will not be deployed between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, where Turkey has focused its efforts.\n\nUS-led coalition forces had now left Manbij, a spokesman said on Twitter.\n\nThe UN Human Rights office has called on Turkey to investigate suspected war crimes being carried out by pro-Turkish forces.\n\n\"Turkey could be deemed as a state responsible for violations by their affiliated groups as long as Turkey exercises effective control of these groups or the operations in the course of which those violations occurred,\" spokesman Rupert Colville said.\n\nThe warning came after footage emerged over the weekend that appeared to show summary executions of Kurds, including female politician Hevrin Khalaf.", "description": "Moscow says it will not allow fighting between the two, amid Turkey's offensive in northern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r29fc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
