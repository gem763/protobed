All told, it considered 5,825 new appointments, of which 578 were of women.\n\nTwo years after appointing a female CEO, companies were perceived by investors as being less risky, the study found. And the companies saw improved momentum in their stock prices.\n\nCompanies with women CFOs were also perceived as less risky bets by investors and were more profitable. Looking across the entire 17-year period, the study found that the women CFOs' companies, during their tenures, generated a combined $1.8 trillion more in gross profits than their sector averages. For example, one of the firms with a female CFO generated $208.6 million in gross profits in a given quarter. That was nearly $33 million more than the $175.7 million average gross profit for companies in the same sector.\n\nRead More", "description": "There's more evidence to suggest putting women into top leadership roles is good for business.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191010165329-generic-female-ceo-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
