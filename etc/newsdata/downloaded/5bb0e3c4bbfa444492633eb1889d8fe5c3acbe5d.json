Two sides in poor runs of form, enduring slides which could well result in the head of their manager hitting the block.\n\nFor Steve Bruce and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer time is running out, and fast. A Toon win would give Bruce the momentum to push on in hope of something better, but heavy defeat could spell what many already believe - he isn't up to it.\n\nUnited likewise find themselves toothless away from home, having not emerged victorious in an away fixture since March. Travelling Red Devils would not accept defeat against a wayward Newcastle and, should that happen, the writing may well be on the wall. Sportsmail examines what the fixture means to both sides, and the consequences.\n\nThe two men have faced off as managers before, but the pressure on Sunday's game is huge\n\nThe Newcastle view\n\nIn a way, Steve Bruce can afford to lose this one more than his opposite number, as long as the performance is improved.\n\nThat is what happens when expectations are so lowered on the back of last Sunday's 5-0 defeat at Leicester, a display during which the team as good as gave up.\n\nFor a plucky defeat here with signs of a positive response from the players might just be enough to buy Bruce a little time.\n\nSteve Bruce is facing increasing pressure, having recently seen his side lose 5-0 to Leicester\n\nAdded to that is the backing he has from the hierarchy and their reluctance to go through the trauma of sacking and appointing managers.\n\nFor now, then, Bruce is safe, so long as Sunday's game does not descend into humiliation, as it did at Leicester.\n\nWere Newcastle to 'surrender' once more - Bruce's own words - then the international fortnight would be extremely uncomfortable for the head coach and there would be calls for him to go.\n\nWould it be a crisis? A lot of that would depend on the fallout and the noises emerging from the squad and elsewhere within the club.\n\nCertainly, though, there is a feeling among supporters that Newcastle have made a mistake in appointing Bruce and they want the club to recognise that sooner rather than later.\n\nBruce recently expressed a concern that he hasn't been given the time to make his changes\n\nThere has been precious little evidence so far to offer a counter-argument to those concerns and Bruce's latest comments - revealing he will revert to Rafa Benitez's defensive tactics because the players aren't good enough for his attacking style - have not gone down well.\n\nSo be it on the pitch or off it, very little is going right for the manager at present and his tenure is in danger of unravelling quicker than he could have ever imagined.\n\nIt says a lot of how bad the situation has become that his players trying their best against Manchester United will be a cause for optimism.\n\nThe United view\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer starts the day in the bottom half, having presided over United's worst start to a league campaign since 1989.\n\nOnly five members of this squad \u2013 Ashley Young, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic, Sergio Romero and Lee Grant \u2013 were even born then. Let that sink in: this is worse than under David Moyes. Worse than Louis van Gaal. Worse than Jose Mourinho.\n\nWill defeat at St James' Park plunge them into crisis? No, because United are already there, living their catastrophe where even finishing in the top six seems a stretch right now.\n\nThe demise is deepening by the week for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, whose time is running out\n\nThe 49 points accrued over Solskjaer's 28 Premier League games is actually two fewer than Mourinho's last 28 matches.\n\nThey don't score goals. They've only found the net more than once in three of their last 22 games since that night in Paris and, at AZ Alkmaar on Thursday evening, refused to push Mason Greenwood through the middle, opting for Daniel James instead.\n\nThere is now definite mutiny within the fanbase. Solskjaer has rightly found himself heavily criticised for poor performances and the decision to allow two strikers in Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to leave \u2013 however inconsistent they were \u2013 without replacements lined up. Equally, there is a reasoned argument for no manager being able to springboard this club to former heights under the Glazer family's rule.\n\nDifferent groups have differing opinions on whose fault this all is but ultimately it's a mixture of so many problems in so many areas of United that is hard to know where to start.\n\nIt's the impossible job at the moment \u2013 and that goes right through the club, not just the dire results and lacklustre displays.\n\nUnited arrive having slumped in midweek against AZ Alkmaar, registering no shots on target\n\nThe scouting system has been described by sources as 'a mess,' with potential candidates for jobs there shocked at what they've found at Carrington and subsequently going cold on various roles.\n\nUnited is a collective muddle, Ed Woodward shouldering a fair amount of the blame for a confused transfer policy and a sapping culture.\n\nWatching some of United's players laughing and joking after the embarrassment of being taken to penalties was eye-opening; so too smiling faces following defeat by Crystal Palace at home.\n\nThey lack leaders, not in terms of vocalising frustrations but leading by example.\n\nThey don't have goals, their best players aren't turning up. As for his squad, Solskjaer is three players short and their rivals are running away from them.", "description": "There is much than just a football game on the line at St James' Park this afternoon, as Newcastle United welcome Manchester United to the north east.
