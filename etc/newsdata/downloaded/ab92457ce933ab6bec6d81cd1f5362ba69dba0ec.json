And for staffers at federal agencies that have led the administration\u2019s response to Dorian, a storm that has wreaked havoc on the Bahamas and battered the coast in the Carolinas, Trump\u2019s involvement has been a mixed blessing.\n\nThe president has been eager for updates on the hurricane\u2019s path, they said, and the White House was responsive to requests from agencies as they planned an emergency response in Florida, the Carolinas and Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where the administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in 2017 was widely criticized as contributing to a slow recovery and a high number of deaths.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s personal involvement as the megaphone for the government\u2019s public messaging has also served as a distraction, according to agency staffers and independent hurricane response experts who are working with the administration.\n\nAfter canceling a trip to Poland to stay in the Washington area to monitor the storm, Trump has flown on Marine One from Camp David to play golf at his private club in Sterling, Va.; feuded with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who criticized the golfing; mocked Puerto Rico as \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth\u201d; and spent days, and numerous tweets, defending his stance that Alabama had been in the storm\u2019s path.\n\nTrump and his administration continued their Alabama crusade Friday, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an unsigned statement siding with Trump over its own scientists on whether the state was at risk of a direct hit from Dorian. Alabama was never in the \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d used in tracking storms, and the National Hurricane Center never mentioned the state in its documents.\n\n[\u2018What I said was accurate!\u2019: Trump stays fixated on his Alabama error as hurricane pounds the Carolinas]\n\nDavid Lapan, who served as a DHS spokesman until October 2017, said Trump\u2019s willingness to use his large social media presence \u2014 with 64 million Twitter followers \u2014 to amplify warnings and guidance from federal agencies can be viewed as a positive. The president has retweeted scores of messages from the Hurricane Center, the National Weather Service and the Coast Guard, as well as from state and municipal government agencies and local news outlets.\n\n\u201cWhen he gets involved in creating his own messaging, getting the facts wrong in the process, that\u2019s where it\u2019s damaging,\u201d said Lapan, now a vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nLapan \u2014 who was involved in DHS\u2019s responses to Hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey in 2017 \u2014 said Trump\u2019s actions could be confusing for the federal workforce, such as when he asserted that the storm was threatening Alabama days after the path had definitively turned away from the state, according to government experts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really sure as part of the workforce: \u2018Is this guidance? Are we supposed to be carrying these things out?\u2019 \u201d Lapan said. \u201cWhat people end up doing is tuning that out or saying: \u2018I\u2019m only going to listen to people who are my direct bosses. If the president says something, I will wait to hear it from my chain of command.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump has been regularly briefed on the storm, according to White House aides and staffers in the federal agencies. The former reality-television star has shown particular interest in superlatives, asking whether storms are the \u201cbiggest\u201d or the \u201cstrongest\u201d in recent years. He publicly marveled at one point that the storm was a Category 5, which he insisted he had never heard of before.\n\nIn fact, four other storms of that size have threatened the United States since he took office.\n\nTrump has been \u201cvery engaged,\u201d said one administration official from a federal agency who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Trump has been in personal contact with agency leaders, this official said, and the president seemed at times to be \u201ctaking a daily, and an almost hourly, interest in the hurricane.\u201d\n\nOne former U.S. government official who served in a previous presidential administration and has helped in Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery efforts said he was impressed with the Trump administration\u2019s preparations on the island ahead of Dorian.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency was \u201creally forward-leaning,\u201d said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. \u201cI felt they were in a pretty good place to deal with a storm that was insane before changing directions. I\u2019m not a Trump fan, but there\u2019s nothing I could criticize about what they did in Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nYet this person said Trump\u2019s role should be \u201ccheerleader in chief\u201d for the federal workforce. \u201cHis job is to instill confidence in the system,\u201d he said. Reporters \u201cshould be covering whether we have water or have done the right thing with evacuations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re focusing on why he\u2019s playing golf or Sharpie-gate. It\u2019s an absolute distraction, and it hurts the response.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Tremendously big\u2019: Trump reaches for superlatives in the face of calamity]\n\nWhite House staffers privately expressed frustration that the media made a big story out of the altered weather map and Trump\u2019s comments on Alabama. But they acknowledged that Trump fueled it by fixating on the issue and repeatedly raising it with administration officials, reporters and outside advisers.\n\nTrump has been preoccupied with other issues this week as well. He complained last weekend to advisers about his \u201cphony\u201d poll numbers and unfair coverage on Fox News \u2014 in his mind, MSNBC and CNN are against him so Fox should be for him.\n\nMaking matters more uncertain, Trump is operating with \u201cacting\u201d leaders \u2014 at DHS with McAleenan, who had been head of Customs and Border Protection until being promoted in the spring, and at FEMA with Peter Gaynor, who has served as acting administrator since last October.\n\nLapan, the former DHS spokesman, said he sensed that Trump asserted himself in a more forceful public role as Dorian approached than he had during the hurricanes in 2017, when then-FEMA Administrator William \u201cBrock\u201d Long, who had been confirmed by the Senate, marshaled the response.\n\n\u201cI wonder if the president felt more compelled to insert himself,\u201d Lapan said. \u201cIs he more emboldened to step into those circumstances than he might have been?\u201d", "description": "For the staffers at agencies that have led the administration\u2019s Dorian efforts, the president\u2019s involvement has been a mixed blessing.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Josh Dawsey", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OOTAMSgg7VS7RlGKncwvnhw8K5o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XLA5RGGQ6YI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
