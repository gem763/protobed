We're in Las Vegas. I'm feeling so much better.\n\n\n\nThank you for all of the love and warm wishes that you sent me.\n\n\n\nSee you soon on the campaign trail. pic.twitter.com/nk3wWIAuE7 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 5, 2019\n\nSoon after, he posted a video on Twitter showing him standing at a Las Vegas park with his wife.\n\n\"I just got out of the hospital a few hours ago and I'm feeling so much better,\" Sanders said. \"See you soon on the campaign trail.\"\n\nSanders's campaign said he would participate in the fourth Democratic debate on October 15.\n\nOldest Democratic candidate\n\nThis marks the second time in two months that health problems forced Sanders to cancel campaign events.\n\nIn September, he backed out of some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. His campaign said at the time that Sanders felt fine.\n\n190822182019055\n\nAs the oldest candidate in the Democratic 2020 field, Sanders has sometimes jokingly referenced his age on the campaign trail.\n\nHe is one of three septuagenarians who are leading the crowded race and have sparked questions within the party about whether Democrats need to coalesce around a younger leader.\n\nYounger candidates, such as 37-year-old South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have said it is time for a new generation to lead the Democratic Party and the country.\n\nFormer Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro appeared to make a jab at 76-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden's age during the September debate.\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" the 45-year-old asked.\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter, who turned 95 this week, recently said he hoped there would be an \"age limit\" for the presidency and said he did not believe he could undertake the duties of the job if he were just 80.\n\nDemocrats know that if they nominate one of the candidates who is 70 or older, it will be hard for them to use 73-year-old President Donald Trump's age against him.\n\nSanders, Biden and 70-year-old Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have all pledged to release updated medical records.", "description": "Sanders had surgery performed to treat blocked artery, having stents inserted after suffering chest pains on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/7647e24435b64ca9a748614d43de46d9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
