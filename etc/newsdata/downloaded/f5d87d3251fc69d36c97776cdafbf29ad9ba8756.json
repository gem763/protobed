He was evacuated to Auckland on Wednesday suffering from pneumonia, Radio New Zealand reported. He died on Thursday morning.\n\nPohiva was a key figure in Tonga\u2019s pro-democracy movement, which saw him regularly clash with Tonga\u2019s monarchy over his more than three decades in politics. In 2014 he became the first commoner in Tonga to be elected to the position of prime minister by Parliament, rather than being appointed to the role by the king.\n\n\u2018Our people are dying\u2019: Australia\u2019s climate confrontation in the Pacific Read more\n\nOver the course of his parliamentary career \u2013 which began in 1987 \u2013 he was dismissed by the king along with the rest of his party, imprisoned for contempt of parliament, and twice charged with sedition.\n\nPartly because of Pohiva\u2019s push for democratic reforms, Tonga became a constitutional monarchy in 2010 and now has representative elections for parliament, however, reverence for the monarchy remains strong and the country has strict sedition laws.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tonga\u2019s late prime minister Akilisi Pohiva (third from left) attended the Pacific Islands Forum Tuvalu in August.

Dame Meg Taylor, the secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum called him a \u201cfighter until the very end\u201d, a \u201ccompelling advocate for democracy and freedom, and a kind man and principled man with great affection for Pacific people\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs one of the longest serving parliamentarians in our region, Prime Minister P\u014dhiva dedicated his life to the service and leadership of his country and people. During his political career we saw him transition from firebrand activist to an elder statesman of the Blue Pacific always staying true to his strong ideals of democracy and human rights,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nDuring his political career we saw him transition from firebrand activist to an elder statesman of the Blue Pacific Dame Meg Taylor\n\nRalph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister, who said: \u201cMy condolences for a good friend and principled leader\u201d and Australia\u2019s prime minister called him \u201ca passionate advocate for his people, for his beloved Tonga and our Pacific family.\u201d\n\nDespite his ill health, Pohiva attended the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu in August, telling the Guardian that he thought this year\u2019s PIF would likely be his last but that he had been determined to attend because of the importance of the summit, especially due to climate change.\n\n\u201cMy physical presence in the meetings is significant to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is mostly likely that this will be my last attendance at a forum so it was very important to me to be here.\u201d\n\nFrank Bainimarama (@FijiPM) I mourn the passing of Tongan PM \u02bbAkilisi P\u014dhiva, who inspired the world with raw emotion at last month's Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu (which, despite his health, he attended in recognition of the urgency of climate action). We must honour his legacy by continuing this fight. pic.twitter.com/MRHysVAaDU\n\nPohiva spoke passionately at the forum about the need for urgent action on the climate crisis, which is already having serious impacts on Pacific nations such as Tuvalu and Tonga, and called for action to end alleged human rights abuses in West Papua. Tuvaluan prime minister Enele Sopoaga said Pohiva had cried at the leaders\u2019 retreat while talking about two young women who had presented to leaders on Monday about the impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nDame Meg Taylor said Pohiva \u201cshowed great courage and resolve to attend the meeting while he was very unwell. I think in many ways he came to say goodbye, to show his respect and solidarity with the Forum Leaders and to make a final resounding stand on issues close to his heart.\u201d", "description": "Pohiva, 78, who had been a champion of democracy and activist for action on climate change, has died after a long illness", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82b0bf4d5e07c174f1e58be7f94a40b7e7aac2a5/0_236_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8179c80d85fdf3e0c9c2ebbd7318e3ed", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
