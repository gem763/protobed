Then she won him over. The California senator has a ways to go to win over African American voters. This is the story of how she converted one prominent voice.\n\nLuther \u201cLuke\u201d Campbell, the former 2 Live Crew frontman and \u201coriginal bad boy of hip-hop,\u201d absolutely torched Kamala Harris a few weeks after she announced her bid for president.\n\nWriting in the Miami New Times, Campbell argued many blue-collar African Americans, especially men, had made up their minds not to vote for the onetime prosecutor. He lumped her in with politicians who have denied defendants rehabilitation and targeted innocent people.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd in a riff that critics slammed as sexist, Campbell questioned Harris\u2019 marriage to a white man. He even suggested she used a romantic relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown to advance her career.\n\n\u201cLike everyone else, black voters want help from one of their own,\u201d Campbell wrote, slipping in that Harris\u2019 mother was from India. \u201cThe Bushes made sure their people got oil money. Bill Clinton let the telecommunications industry gobble up small radio and TV stations. And Donald Trump is looking out for his developer buddies through a tax cut and opportunity zones that gentrify minority neighborhoods. Meanwhile, Harris has let black people know they can\u2019t count on her.\u201d\n\nSo it was more than a little curious when Campbell announced very publicly he\u2019d changed his mind. In an Instagram video last week, he said he and Harris had recently talked on the phone about her record and presidential priorities, from gun control to the rehabilitation programs she started. Campbell said he wanted to determine whether she\u2019s a \u201creal sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went back and looked deeper at the record,\u201d Campbell said in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nLuther Campbell speaks at a July 2018 panel in Beverly Hills, Calif. | Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Photo\n\nBut the story of Campbell\u2019s about-face isn\u2019t so simple: It\u2019s a window into how Harris is working to allay skepticism of her among African Americans \u2014 particularly black men wary of her background in law enforcement \u2014 and of how far she has to go to make inroads with a critical constituency that Joe Biden so far is dominating in the polls.\n\nHarris and her surrogates routinely reach out to black influencers like Campbell, in most cases before they might publicly air any concerns. The campaign at times dispatches its chairman, the candidate's sister, Maya Harris, whose background in criminal justice reform and close relationship with the senator help provide insight only she could.\n\nThat Campbell could make the unexpected turn gives hope to an underlying theory Harris advisers have: that her courtroom experience will prove more of an asset than an anchor. But people on the outside involved in the discussions with Campbell stress that his hesitation underscores the work Harris must do to introduce herself while fleshing out her motives as California\u2019s attorney general and the district attorney of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cShe obviously has bona fides in certain parts of the black community: She\u2019s an HBCU graduate, an AKA. She is a black woman in every sense of the word,\u201d said Tiffany Cross, founder and managing editor of the Beat DC, a newsletter on the intersection of politics, policy and people of color, referring to Harris\u2019 time at Howard University and in the oldest African American sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\n\u201cBut the black community is not a monolith,\u201d Cross added. \u201cIn certain parts of the black community, HBCUs and AKAs just don\u2019t resonate. And, when people only hear whispers that you were the prosecutor who locked up black men, that\u2019s something that\u2019s an uphill climb. The campaign is trying to combat it, and trying to address it, but they have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nTo Harris, Campbell represents a hard-to-reach demographic she\u2019ll need to convince. Campbell, whose raw lyrics and videos with scantily clad women put him at the center of free speech fights decades ago, calls it the \u201csilent majority\u201d that powered Barack Obama.\n\nCampbell\u2019s evolution on Harris unfolded over many months. It started with calls from a surrogate and ended with Harris herself. In between, the rapper said he heard from a Florida congresswoman who endorsed Harris. He got beat up in testy interviews and at home: His wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law are AKAs. He said they all really like Harris.\n\n***\n\nCampbell\u2019s New Times column landed online like a thunderclap. Symone Sanders, then a free-agent Democratic strategist who later took a job with Biden, essentially told Campbell to shut up.\n\n\u201cUncle Luke is no political mastermind or strategist,\u201d Sanders tweeted at the time. \u201cWhy do black men keep popping up with their unsolicited opinions about Kamala Harris?\u201d\n\nBut Cross, who brought up Campbell\u2019s piece on Joy Reid\u2019s MSNBC show, gave it more credence. In an interview, she said critics need to consider that Campbell is viewing Harris through the lens of black men who are disproportionately affected by the justice system.\n\nBehind the scenes, Harris surrogates were treating the put-downs seriously. Bakari Sellers, a former state lawmaker from South Carolina, immediately reached out to Campbell. Democratic activists have said Campbell is a respected and even feared voice in Florida politics and has an extensive following among middle-aged African American men nationally.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone that you want on your side,\u201d Sellers said when asked why he took it upon himself. \u201cLuke can have the conversations that you can\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nDays after connecting with Campbell, Sellers appeared as a guest on the musician\u2019s podcast. Campbell still seemed indifferent toward Harris, even after Sellers touted her advocacy for women and children who suffered from abuse.\n\nThen, last month, thousands of African American journalists arrived in Miami for the National Association of Black Journalists conference. Campbell sat for an interview with Cross. She brought up his column about Harris, noting a lot of people considered it sexist.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018Oh, God. Here we go,\u2019\u201d Cross recalled.\n\nShe wanted to know when he became the moral authority on relationships.\n\n\u201cI mean, should we revisit \u2018As Nasty As They Wanna Be,\u2019 and all the albums and things you put out about women?\u201d Cross asked. She said it was fair game to probe Harris\u2019 record, but the personal shots went too far.\n\nWhen it was over, she texted a contact at the Harris campaign. Cross felt like Campbell was open to persuasion.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t combative, but he didn\u2019t have a counterpoint to a lot of the things I raised with him,\u201d she said.\n\nCampbell did another long interview at the Miami event, this one with The Atlantic\u2019s Jemele Hill, who previously had Harris on her show. Late in the podcast, the senator came up again. Hill argued Harris had created one of the most progressive prisoner reentry programs in the country. Hill also told Campbell he should pay attention to Biden for not apologizing for his tough-on-crime record.\n\nCampbell\u2019s aversion to Harris was melting.\n\n\u201cOut of all the candidates, I really like her the most,\u201d he eventually told Hill. But Harris needs to overcome the perception of being a powerful black woman who went after black men to prove herself, he said. On the show, Campbell mimicked black politicians who avoid advocating a black agenda.\n\n\u201cI get so sick of that shit. \u2018Oh, I\u2019m for everybody,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNo, you black. You need to be for us.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

I\u2019ma bring him over. Don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d\n\nBy the time Harris reached out to Campbell, on Aug. 15, the previous conversations had left such an impression that he\u2019d come around to her.\n\nCampbell told POLITICO Harris talked about her reentry initiative to lower recidivism among low-level drug offenders. She said she wants to change how credit scores are calculated to boost black homeownership. He told her he supports allowing law-abiding people to keep guns for protection. Harris volunteered that she has a .45-caliber gun herself \u2014 for protection, Campbell said.\n\nThe fact that Harris came to him even after his personal attacks made a big impression.\n\n\u201cThat got me more than anything. That I could write all those tough words \u2026 that I could say what I did on those interviews, and she\u2019s woman enough to say, \u2018Let\u2019s have a conversation,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMost men, they take it personal, take their little toy and they go sit down.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding on the endorsement, Campbell said he kept reflecting on the first Democratic debates, thinking who could really take on Trump. Biden, he said, is too old. Bernie Sanders \u201cis just going to go up there and start screaming.\u201d He believes Elizabeth Warren reacted \u201cin a little fragile way\u201d by releasing a DNA test to prove claims to Native American ancestry. Her support for reparations for descendants of slaves didn\u2019t help, either. \u201cWe as African Americans know that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Campbell said he doesn\u2019t think Cory Booker\u2019s message is resonating: \u201cHe gives us a black history lesson every time he talks.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s Harris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI can say I made a mistake.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The California senator has a ways to go to win over African American voters.
