Police department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Johnson indicated he parked his car after feeling lightheaded. Officers checked on Johnson\u2019s well-being and didn\u2019t observe any signs of impairment.\n\nJohnson drove himself to his home nearby.\n\n\u201cThere were no charges of intoxication, no information of intoxication as far as I know,\u201d Guglielmi said.\n\nGuglielmi says Johnson requested the investigation because he believes officers and the superintendent \u201cought to be held to the highest standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what that means is they\u2019re going to interview the officers, they\u2019re going to look at all available evidence just to make sure that this is above-board and happened as described,\u201d Guglielmi said.\n\nThe 59-year-old Johnson underwent kidney transplant surgery in August 2017. His son Daniel was the donor.\n\nGuglielmi said Johnson visited a doctor earlier this week regarding a medication change. He said the superintendent on Wednesday expressed concerns about feeling exhausted. Guglielmi says Johnson visited a doctor Thursday to be evaluated on issues concerning his blood pressure.\n\nJohnson was hospitalized in June after doctors found a small blood clot in his lung during a stress test done as Johnson approached the two-year anniversary of his transplant. The clot was treated with medication and rest.\n\nJohnson was appointed superintendent in March 2016 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. His predecessor, Garry McCarthy, was fired days after the release of a video of the 2014 fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder last year and is serving a nearly seven-year prison sentence.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson asked the city's police department to conduct an internal investigation on himself Thursday after he was found lying down in a car.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/chicago_police_superintendent_99129_c0-124-2990-1868_s1200x700.jpg?d681813b8507cc4344b2bfb45d20092c0a7b7fee", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
