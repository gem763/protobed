I do not care about the prize. The prize is in my home.\n\n\"I have five prizes in my home that I seek to get, I've got them.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\n\"I just want to compete now, I want to come back, I want to get sharp, I want to show the best of myself and continue to climb. So that's why I am seeking to do.\n\n\"So we are looking to do that sometime in December, hopefully have a charity mixed martial arts event for zero prize.\n\n\"The prize will go to charity, so that's what we are aiming for.\"", "description": "Conor McGregor hasn't fought for over a year, since his Khabib Nurmagomedov loss, and has seemingly fallen out with the UFC", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666933.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UFC-229-Khabib-v-McGregor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
