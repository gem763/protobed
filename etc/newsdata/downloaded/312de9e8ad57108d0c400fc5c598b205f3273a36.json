What That Means For Altria Stock.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nFederal prosecutors in California joined a long list of regulators and political figures bearing down on Juul Labs. At first glance, that looks like bad news for Altria Group , which owns 35% of the maker of vaping products.\n\nYet the cigarette stock held its ground on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe back story. Altria (ticker: MO) spent $12.8 billion for its stake in Juul Labs last December. Many people saw the move as logical because the widespread view that e-cigarettes are safer than traditional ones has brought a surge in vaping, amid a decline in consumption of traditional cigarettes.\n\nStill, the proliferation of e-cigarettes, both for tobacco and marijuana, among teenagers has brought concerns regarding federal regulation. More recently, a mysterious and sometimes fatal lung disease linked to vaping has put a spotlight on the industry.\n\nJuul, a leading player in vaping, has come under particular scrutiny.\n\nThe company has noted its products don\u2019t contain THC\u2014the active ingredient in marijuana\u2014or the vitamin E compounds apparently linked to these deaths. But President Donald Trump has said he hopes to ban non-tobacco vape flavors that have made it popular with non-smokers.\n\nAnalysts have speculated that the potential for regulation may have been a key factor behind Altria and Philip Morris International \u2019s (PM) decision to explore a merger.\n\nWhat's new. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday night that the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Northern District of California is in the early stages of a criminal investigation into Juul.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s report didn\u2019t specify the focus of the probe, but noted the company is facing several investigations of its marketing practices, given Juul products\u2019 popularity among teenagers. The company declined to comment in the report, but has said it has never intended for youth to use its products.\n\n\u201cWe have taken dramatic action to contribute to solve this problem, which is why we implemented the JUUL Labs Action Plan to address underage use of JUUL products,\u201d the company said in December.\n\nDespite the negative news, Altria shares were up 0.4% to $41.06, while Philip Morris stock was up 1.3% to $71.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has ticked up 30.11 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 has advanced 0.1%.\n\nLooking ahead. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note Tuesday morning that Juul would be an important part of the combined Philip Morris and Altria.\n\nHerzog wrote, \u201cwe believe JUUL is a critical piece of the deal\u2019s strategic rationale that increases MO\u2019s attractiveness even in the current, admittedly tough, U.S. regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nThough regulatory pushback from Juul\u2019s marketing practices could throw a wrench in this, Herzog wrote, \u201cwe doubt it would derail the companies\u2019 plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, we believe all of this risk would have been considered and, in our view, we think the companies view this risk as manageable,\u201d Herzog added.\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com", "description": "The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in California are in the early stages of a criminal investigation of Juul, which is 35% owned by Altria.", "authors": ["Connor Smith"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110190/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
