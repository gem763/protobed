We remain ready to negotiate common rules for subsidies in the aviation industry. We can still prevent further damage.\u201d\n\nThe WTO this week ruled that some subsidies EU states paid to planemaker Airbus were illegal, giving the United States the right to react with tariffs on goods imported from the EU.\n\nWashington announced plans for new tariffs on Wednesday.\n\nGermany\u2019s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, also a Social Democrat, on Thursday said Europe should react prudently as trade conflicts in a globalized world were in nobody\u2019s interest.", "description": "The European Union is likely to take retaliatory measures in response to new U.S. tariffs on European goods, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told newspapers in remarks published on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436947603&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930A7", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
