It came out just before kickoff that the junior running back decided he\u2019d rather redshirt than take more beatings this fall \u2014following the lead of starting quarterback Art Sitkowski, who pulled the plug on the 2019 season earlier this week.\n\nRutgers quarterback Artur Sitkowski talks with coach Chris Ash during their game against Penn State in 2018.

It certainly reeks of \u201cI\u201d before \u201cteam,\u201d which goes counter to everything we\u2019ve loved and preached about sports for generations. But take a step back and assess the big picture. These decisions are not being made in a selfish vacuum. They are part of a cultural shift \u2014 in college sports, where athletes are empowered like never before, and particularly in football, where we grasp the game\u2019s dangers better than our fathers and grandfathers.\n\nSo here is a debate with two passionate sides, and both have some merit. This is a thorny issue with lots of gray area, complexity, nuance. That might seem unsatisfying in the 240-character echo chambers we\u2019ve created, but it\u2019s reality.\n\nWINNING UGLY: No. 18 Michigan gets needed defeat of No. 14 Iowa\n\nDOMINANT LIONS: Penn State tops Purdue as Big Ten showdowns await\n\nLet\u2019s try to stand in the shoes of all stakeholders here.\n\nPut yourselves in Sitkowsi\u2019s shoes. He had become a human pinata, pounded behind a porous offensive line. Have you seen some of the whacks he took this fall? Then his head coach and his offensive coordinator got ousted. The program is in chaos, getting stampeded weekly, the butt of jokes and memes. Should he put his health on the line for that, especially in an era when college stars are skipping bowl games \u2014 bowl games! \u2014 for fear of injury?\n\nPut yourself in Blackshear\u2019s shoes. He saw Sitkowski cut bait \u2014 and his prospects of becoming a tackling dummy rise as Rutgers went to a third-string quarterback and a play-caller who was roaming Bergen Catholic's sidelines two years ago.\n\nPut yourself in interim head coach Nunzio Campanile\u2019s shoes. Allowing these guys to wash their hands of the team but still wear the colors on gameday probably goes against everything he\u2019s stood for as a guy who\u2019s molded kids into men for 20 years. But he\u2019s in a precarious spot, smack in the middle of a program and sport in transition.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that I had the best answer to deal with that on short notice,\" Campanile said during his postgame press conference. \"It\u2019s something we will address obviously over the course of this week and we\u2019ll address it in a way our team is comfortable with.\u201d\n\nCampanile noted that the two cases are not quite the same \u2014 Sitkowski agreed to be the emergency quarterback, leaving the door open to a possible return this season. Word is Blackshear's pullout happened late, just hours before the game.\n\n\u201cAm I disappointed by it? Incredibly,\" Campanile said. \"Do I understand it? I guess so, I guess that\u2019s the world way the world is now.\u201d\n\nHe added, \"This is a game about a team. It\u2019s about sacrificing personal accomplishment for the success of the team. But if that\u2019s the world they\u2019re living in and they\u2019ve got a lot of people telling them, \u2018Worry about you, worry about you,\u2019 I get it. I\u2019m raising two boys and I\u2019m trying to raise them about being willing to sacrifice some of the things they want to do for the people around them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I get it. He (Blackshear) is a great kid and we\u2019ll see what happens in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nPut yourself in their teammates\u2019 shoes. They took the field Saturday against Maryland, representing Rutgers in the toughest of times, putting their own health on the line when those two other guys said, \"nah.\" They absorbed the business end of a 48-7 shellacking from a weak Terrapins squad, and it\u2019s only going to get worse with Minnesota, Ohio State, Michigan State and Penn State waiting down the line. Those four teams entered Saturday\u2019s action with a combined record of 17-1.\n\nHere is what five of them said about it after the game.\n\nDrew Singleton, sophomore linebacker: \u201cI support them. I definitely support them. Those guys are my brothers.\u201d\n\nFreshman quarterback Johnny Langan, who was pressed into service as the starter: \u201cWe\u2019re all that we\u2019ve got right now. Whoever is with us, we\u2019ll take that and play as hard as we can . . . It\u2019s not something I can really control . . . It\u2019s their decision, their life. Just focus on the guys we have.\u201d\n\nTyshon Fogg, junior linebacker: \u201cAt the end of the day we love those guys. We support those guys\u2019 decisions . . . I\u2019m going to support them all of the way.\u201d\n\nDaevon Robinson, sophomore receiver: \u201cWe just try to play with who we have. If that\u2019s their decision . . . we don\u2019t have too much say on it.\u201d\n\nSenior lineman Zach Venesky, who suffered a right leg injury and was in a walking boot: \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood. I support both Art and Blackshear. If you look on the sidelines they are two guys who are cheering everyone on and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nPut yourself in fans\u2019 shoes. Year after year they invest, financially and emotionally, in Rutgers. That takes a lot more dedication than investing in Alabama. Yet there was captain Jonah Jackson, skipping town in January, blowing off his senior season to join the parade at Ohio State. He didn\u2019t even leave the division.\n\nThere was Eugene Omoruyi, the captain and undisputed leader of Rutgers\u2019 improving basketball team, defecting in the wee hours of a late-May night with an Instagram post that badly misspelled his coach\u2019s name. He surfaced at Oregon, which collected a bunch of shiny new parts in the offseason.\n\nSitkowski and Blackshear haven\u2019t transferred yet, but for the invested fan the pattern is hard to stomach.\n\nThey should learn to cope, though, because this is the age of athlete empowerment and it\u2019s not changing. More than a few folks who make a living in college sports think the transfer penalty will be gone soon. A one-year sit-out is increasingly hard to justify as millionaire coaches hopscotch jobs \u2014 moves that their players sometimes find out about through media reports.\n\nBottom line: You don\u2019t have to like what Blackshear and Sitkowski did today, and don\u2019t let any NCAA-hating cultist tell you otherwise. But if you care about the future of college sports, you must understand why it happened. In 2019, the captain doesn\u2019t have to go down with the ship.", "description": "Are Rutgers players Raheem Blackshear and Art Sitkowski quitters or forward-thinking with redshirt?
