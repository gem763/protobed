In other words, the top 0.1 percent make in a year what people in the middle income bracket need to save up for more than 31 years without spending.\n\nThe average per-capita salary was W35.19 million.\n\nIn the top 10 percent, 1.8 million workers made W203 trillion in 2017, accounting for 32 percent of the total earnings. But the bottom 10 percent accounted for a mere 0.7 percent with their combined income of W4.4 trillion.\n\nThe combined yearly salaries of the top one percent amounted to W47.6 trillion, which translated into W264 million per person. But the average per-capita income of the bottom 22 percent was only W6.28 million a year.", "description": "Income Disparity Worsens Among Salaried Workers", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
