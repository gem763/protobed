The nickname stuck until her death.\n\nRaised in a prominent political family, Roberts first walked the halls of Congress as a young child, an early foreshadowing of her career covering Washington.\n\nHer father, Thomas Hale Boggs Sr, served in Congress for more than 30 years before he went missing on a campaign flight in Alaska in 1972. Her mother, Lindy Claiborne Boggs, took over for her husband, holding the seat for 17 years.\n\nRoberts graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts in 1964 with a degree in political science before being hired as a radio correspondent for CBS.

With ABC, she served as political commentator, chief congressional analyst and anchor for the Sunday morning news programme This Week.\n\nRoberts also wrote eight books, most recently Capital Dames: The Civil War and the Women of Washington, 1848-1868, which focused mostly on the role of women in American history.\n\nImage copyright Brooks Kraft/Getty Images Image caption George W Bush prepares for an interview with Cokie Roberts and Sam Donaldson in July 2000\n\nRoberts won numerous awards for her work, including three Emmys.
