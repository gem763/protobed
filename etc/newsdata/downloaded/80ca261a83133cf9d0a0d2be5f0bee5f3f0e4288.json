She also gets a chance to share information about her military spouse awareness campaign and art therapy initiative,\u201d Brooks added.\n\nIt could be the greatest political challenge Mrs. Pence has faced, as Trump gets hit from all sides during the constant drip of impeachment news and foreign policy flare-ups tied to Ukraine and Syria. The second lady\u2019s unscathed image and relatively low profile to date \u2014 her family\u2019s pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo, has 12 times more Instagram followers than she does \u2014 gives her a clean slate of sorts to make her case on behalf of Trump and her husband to voters who may be skeptical of the duo heading into 2020.\n\nKaren Pence talks about the U.S. Special Olympics World Games team in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump in July. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIt also comes as she and the vice president aim to restore their image as faithful foot soldiers for the Trump agenda following the release of separate books this summer, by journalists Tim Alberta of POLITICO and Tom LoBianco, that detailed a pair of episodes in which Mrs. Pence refused to kiss her husband on election night and vowed not to appear on the campaign trail beside him if he carried on as the president\u2019s running mate after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape emerged.\n\n\u201cOh boy. Mother is not going to like this,\u201d Pence told aides at the time, anticipating his wife\u2019s reaction to the audio recording of Trump\u2019s lewd comments, Alberta wrote in his book.\n\nBut that attitude was hardly on display last week, when Mrs. Pence hit the campaign trail for her first appearance at a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event. In fact, nowhere was her embrace of the president more palpable. The second lady, whom Trump directly apologized to after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d scandal first broke, told attendees of the event in St. Paul, Minn., she was \u201call in\u201d for the president after seeing him interact with her daughter, Charlotte.\n\nAppearing alongside presidential daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, she also urged the crowd to \u201cget on your knees\u201d to pray for the president.\n\nAsked about her remarks, one of the vice president\u2019s former House colleagues said it was characteristic of Pence\u2019s wife, who defended him through his stints as chairman of the staunchly conservative Republican Study Committee, Republican conference chair and Indiana governor before he joined the GOP presidential ticket in 2016.\n\n\u201cKaren knows a lot about campaigns, she knows a lot about politics and she knows what she\u2019s in for, and she likes to practice it at a very high level of competition,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cShe knows they\u2019re in for the fight of their life right now as part of the ticket and she does not shirk away from that responsibility.\u201d\n\nCampaign officials said the Minnesota event was the first of many appearances Mrs. Pence will make in the coming months, in addition to doing local radio and television while traveling. The second lady, whose husband hosted a conservative radio program in the 1990s, did a series of interviews on radio row ahead of Trump\u2019s June 2020 kick-off rally in Orlando, Fla., which one official described as \u201ca natural fit\u201d for her.\n\nUntil now, Mrs. Pence\u2019s solo travel has typically been linked to her art therapy initiative, an issue she has worked closely on since 2011, or support for military spouses.\n\n\u201cI want to get more people aware of art therapy, not only for children who are going through an illness, but adults as well who have gone through trauma,\u201d Mrs. Pence, a watercolorist who has illustrated two children\u2019s books with her daughter, Charlotte, told The New York Times in a 2017 interview.\n\nWith the exception of an appearance she made shortly before last year\u2019s midterm elections on behalf of congressional candidate Mark Harris (the North Carolina Republican later abandoned his effort to win the seat following revelations that his campaign had become entangled in a voter fraud operation), Mrs. Pence has mostly traveled with her husband on his diplomatic missions and domestic trade tours. Just last month, she accompanied him on his trip to Poland, where Pence met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That meeting has come under scrutiny as Democrats work to determine whether the vice president was aware of the pressure campaign that landed Trump at the center of an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mrs. Pence said she did not join her husband on Wednesday when he left for Turkey, where he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an effort to negotiate a ceasefire in northeastern Syria.\n\nOfficials familiar with the planning said the vice president\u2019s built-in team on the 2020 campaign is currently devising a messaging strategy and schedule that maximizes the couple\u2019s strengths as surrogates \u2014 including dispatching Mrs. Pence, a Kansas native, to suburban swing districts and Midwestern battleground states to tout the administration\u2019s work on healthcare, education and pro-family policies.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 staff didn\u2019t know how to utilize Karen Pence, but now there\u2019s a VP staff that knows her. You look at her experience of being a mother of three, of being a wife of someone who\u2019s been in the public eye for 30 years and you\u2019ll hear about anything from her that really goes back to family issues and stuff that\u2019s important to women,\u201d said the GOP source familiar with Trump\u2019s reelection operation.\n\nThis person added that Mrs. Pence will likely be deployed to \u201csuburban media markets\u201d and that communities outside of \u201cAtlanta, Houston, Dallas [and] Detroit would be really good for her.\u201d\n\nShe is also expected to highlight the president\u2019s track record of selecting conservative judges for appellate and circuit court appointments \u2014 an issue that resonates with the same white evangelical voters who Pence helped put at ease when he was added to the ticket in 2016.\n\n\u201cParticularly with the faith community, Karen is a very capable emissary,\u201d said the former House colleague.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if a ramped-up campaign schedule will affect Mrs. Pence\u2019s part-time teaching position at Immanuel Christian, a private K-8 school just outside of Washington. The 2020-2021 school year would likely begin next August, right after both parties host their nominating conventions and months away from the November election. Brooks declined to respond to a question about Mrs. Pence\u2019s tenure at the school, while a campaign official said there have been \u201cno discussions on whether she\u2019ll leave Immanuel Christian to make herself more available to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe anticipated increase in Mrs. Pence\u2019s campaign activity comes as the vice president faces the most significant test yet of his loyalty to Trump, whose attempt to use his relationship with a foreign leader to conjure up dirt on 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to endorse an impeachment investigation last month. Pence, who\u2019s sought to avoid being implicated in any wrongdoing by denying that he was aware of the president\u2019s overtures to Zelensky, recently launched a nationwide tour to swing districts occupied by Democrats who have endorsed the impeachment probe.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/f4/847ef8a84772b32f047598679d84/20191016-karen-mike-pence-politico-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
