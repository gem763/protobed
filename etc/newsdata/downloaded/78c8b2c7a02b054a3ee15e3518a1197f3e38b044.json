ORLY is set to beat earnings estimates when it releases third-quarter 2019 results on Oct 23, before the opening bell. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a profit of $4.78 a share on revenues of $2.64 billion.\n\nThis U.S.-based specialty retailer of automotive parts delivered weaker-than-expected results in the last reported quarter due to lower-than-anticipated comparable store sales growth. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the company has a dismal record of missing estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, the average being 0.02%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and Consensus More\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. price-consensus-chart | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Quote\n\nWhich Way are the Estimates Headed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) has been revised downward by a penny in the past 30 days to $4.78. However, the EPS reflects year-over-year increase of 6.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.64 billion, suggesting an uptick from the prior-year quarter\u2019s $2.48 billion.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Says?\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for O\u2019Reilly this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nEarnings ESP: O\u2019Reilly has an Earnings ESP of +0.23%.This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $4.80 comes in two cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nZacks Rank: O\u2019Reilly carries a Zacks Rank of 3, currently. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Setting the Tone\n\nO'Reilly is anticipated to have gained from store openings, distribution centers in profitable regions during the third quarter. The company follows a dual-market strategy by serving Do-it-Yourself (DIY) and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) customers. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the number of stores at the end of the quarter stands at 5,390, marking an increase from the 5,190 recorded in the year-ago period. The company\u2019s wide-ranging product portfolio catering to its DIY and DIFM customers will likely have driven comparable store sales growth sequentially.\n\nPer O'Reilly, normal summer weather conditions in the quarter will likely have led to a solid start for the company, with an increased demand for core underlying hard parts. The company projects third-quarter comparable store sales at 3-5%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for comps growth for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 3.82%, higher than the prior quarter\u2019s 3.40% but lower than the year-ago quarter\u2019s 3.90%.\n\nHowever, elevated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and high capex might have dampened the company\u2019s margins in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe company is likely to have recorded higher SG&A costs associated with opening stores and distribution centres, and maintaining the existing ones, along with its efforts to offer superior customer services. O'Reilly\u2019s high capital spending is likely to have weighed on its cash flows and the already-weak financials.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nO'Reilly is not the only firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies, which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the third quarter.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. AAL has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is slated to release third-quarter 2019 earnings on Oct 24.\n\nAlliance Data Systems Corporation ADS is set to report quarterly figures on Oct 24. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.34% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nAllegiant Travel Company ALGT is scheduled to report third-quarter 2019 earnings on Oct 24. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and holds a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!", "description": "O'Reilly's (ORLY) Q3 performance expected to reflect benefits from higher revenues, resulting from its store-expansion initiatives, amid high SG&A costs.", "authors": ["Zacks Equity Research"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yoFWdDmK94V18GFqMjOOjg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/1e3f7ccd2009f5214d9661b57b5fe725", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
