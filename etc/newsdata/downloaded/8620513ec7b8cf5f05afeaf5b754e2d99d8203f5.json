For it to be deemed a draw screams of injustice.\n\nWe hate to taint our sport with the word but that type of decision suggests possible corruption.\n\nTyson Fury reacts after the judges scored the fight at the Staples Center as split decision draw\n\nScoring like that of Mexican judge Alejandro Rochin, 115-111 in favour of Wilder, is just plain wrong. I\u2019m not saying he is corrupt, no one wants to get sued here, but when scoring is that far from what we have seen, eyebrows are raised and questions must be asked. For boxing to move with the times it must be policed better.\n\nThe judges should be made to sit down in front of a screen, re-watch the fight and show how they scored it with an independent adjudicator alongside them.\n\nYou can affect someone\u2019s life with these decisions. Boxers are putting their lives on the line for these fights, the least you expect from a judge is to be fair. If he is not then, tough, he should be exposed. I had the good fortune of watching the fight as a fan for once. The guys I was with said it was a fantastic fight but that\u2019s the last time they will watch boxing... because of the injustice, the ridiculous scoring makes it a farce. It turns fans off.\n\nAlejandro Rochin's score (left) had the champion winning the fight by a margin of 115-111\n\nLennox Lewis spoke afterwards about how difficult it is to go to America and get a belt. It shouldn\u2019t make any difference where you are. Just judge the fight on what you see. It\u2019s a shame for what Fury has poured into this fight that he walks away with a draw, he deserved much more.\n\nHOW IT UNFOLDED\n\nThey both started off nervously trying to find their range. Fury settled quicker and, for me, won three of the first five rounds. I said before the fight that he is so unorthodox you can\u2019t train to fight him and that\u2019s how it proved for Wilder. In frustration, he tried to force the issue but made too many mistakes, loading up for the big right all the time.\n\nHe had to wait until Fury tired and then was able to tag him later in the fight. Fury had that swagger I saw when he fought Wladimir Klitschko. The classic art of hit and not be hit. His ability to box exposed Wilder\u2019s inability and Fury ran away with the contest towards the middle rounds. Indeed, all Wilder\u2019s basics were made obsolete.\n\nThe basics \u2014 footwork, jabs \u2014 are what you build a fight on, not used in spits and spats. Fury\u2019s reach was key. Wilder couldn\u2019t manhandle his opponent like he has been used to. Even when Fury was knocked down, he clearly had the edge in the rounds.\n\nBoth fighters started off tentatively before Fury started to deliver with a number of right hands\n\nWHAT DID WE LEARN?\n\nThe way Fury came back from the knockdowns is a credit to the camp as well as his determination. Good on him. The promoter Shelly Finkel says Wilder will fight better next time and Fury won\u2019t. Wilder has to fight better but Fury will improve too. Inactivity at this level makes a big difference and the more he\u2019s in the ring the sharper he will become.\n\nWHERE DOES IT LEAVE THE DIVISION?\n\nWilder needs his next fight to be the Fury rematch. His bargaining power with Anthony Joshua is actually weaker today because he hasn\u2019t resolved whether he is better than Fury. I still believe Joshua\u2019s next fight in April will be against Dillian Whyte, so long as Whyte beats Dereck Chisora.\n\nFury and Wilder need to meet again for a rematch to settle the score after what happened in LA\n\nWHAT NEXT FOR FURY?\n\nFury has been to a dark place in his life and come through as an inspiration to others. At 30, he has age on his side and this fight will have taught him that he has to keep boxing in his life. Boxing is his crutch. Fighters need a focus and Fury needs to box regularly. That\u2019s where he will find stability.\n\nFormer cruiserweight world champion Johnny Nelson was talking to Simon Jones.", "description": "JOHNNY NELSON: For boxing to be taken seriously we have to make judges accountable for their actions.
