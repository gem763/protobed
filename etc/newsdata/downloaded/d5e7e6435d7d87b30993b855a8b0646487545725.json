Investigators seized several electronic devices that will be examined as part of the investigation. V\u00e1zquez, 28, faces extradition to Florida. Later Tuesday, four additional charges were filed against V\u00e1zquez in Westmoreland County, Pa., including statutory sexual assault stemming from an incident in August 2018. He has been denied bail.\n\nFDLE agents began investigating V\u00e1zquez in August after obtaining information that V\u00e1zquez had a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old. Authorities said the alleged victim, who is now 15, continued her relationship with V\u00e1quez over text message and in July received explicit images and a video that showed him performing a sex act.\n\nThough the photographs and video didn\u2019t show V\u00e1zquez\u2019s face, the photos showed \u201cunique and distinguishable\u201d tattoos consistent with V\u00e1zquez\u2019s, according to the arrest affidavit. The affidavit said that the alleged victim referred to the sender of the explicit messages as \u201cFelipe\u201d throughout the text message conversation. Additionally, V\u00e1zquez allegedly sent the girl text messages suggesting that they would meet for sex after the baseball season had ended. The alleged victim\u2019s mother discovered the text messages several days later.\n\nAccording to a Lee County Sheriff\u2019s Office incident report from Aug. 5, the alleged victim received a text message from V\u00e1zquez at approximately 10:30 p.m. on July 29 that said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you during the off season.\u201d The alleged victim said she originally met V\u00e1zquez at a stadium in Pennsylvania, took a photograph with him outside the bullpen and then found him on social media, which began their years-long online relationship.\n\nShe told officers of one incident where V\u00e1zquez met with her at a previous residence. At one point during the visit, V\u00e1zquez allegedly pulled her pants down while they were inside his car, placed her on his lap and \u201cattempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis, but was unsuccessful,\u201d according to the incident report.\n\nV\u00e1zquez has been charged with one count of giving obscene material to a minor and one count of soliciting a child for unlawful sexual conduct. Representatives for V\u00e1zquez didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPirates president Frank Coonelly said that the team was made aware of the investigation into V\u00e1zquez on Tuesday and informed the commissioner\u2019s office. V\u00e1zquez will be placed on administrative leave pursuant to Major League Baseball\u2019s joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy.\n\n\u201cWe take this matter, and these charges in particular, extremely seriously,\u201d Coonelly said.\n\nV\u00e1zquez was fined by the Pirates earlier this month following an altercation in the team\u2019s clubhouse that resulted in fellow pitcher Kyle Crick undergoing season-ending finger surgery. At the time, Pirates general manager Neal Huntington said that Crick and V\u00e1zquez\u2019s behavior was \u201cunacceptable, inconsistent with the standards of a major-league player and will not be tolerated by the organization.\u201d\n\nIn 56 appearances for the Pirates in 2019, V\u00e1zquez has posted a 1.65 ERA, converted 28 saves and struck out 90 batters in 60 innings. He is in the second season of a four-year contract that guarantees him $22 million contract, with club options that could increase his compensation to $41 million.\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "Felipe V\u00e1zquez, the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 All-Star closer, was arrested Tuesday on charges of child pornography and soliciting a teenage girl for sex, the Florida of Department of Law Enforcement said.", "authors": ["Jared Diamond"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107949/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
