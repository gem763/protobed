Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for her \u201cauthenticity.\u201d\n\nVERDICT: False. Doubts about Warren\u2019s latest tale were first raised by a female socialist.\n\nThomas Kaplan writes in the New York Times that Republicans and conservatives have questioned Warren\u2019s claim that she was fired from a teaching job in 1971 because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d In doing so, Kaplan writes, they have \u201cemployed a tactic \u2014 questioning a female candidate\u2019s authenticity \u2014 that is at once often a sexist trope in politics and a strategy used against Hillary Clinton in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe article appears as \u201cnews analysis,\u201d not opinion.\n\nUnfortunately, for Kaplan, there are three problems. The first is that doubts about Warren\u2019s pregnancy tale were first raised by left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nAll over the internet you can find people calling Elizabeth Warren a \u201cformer public school teacher\u201d and saying it was her \u201cfirst career.\u201d Warren was a public school teacher for one year. She immediately left the classroom, went to law school, and became a law professor. Come on https://t.co/2zeSS5OkeM \u2014 Meagan Day (@meaganmday) October 1, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s not what she says in this interview: https://t.co/5rXCR5UXha pic.twitter.com/bynQBLjNcd \u2014 Meagan Day (@meaganmday) October 1, 2019\n\nSecond, Warren has made a habit of telling false stories. For years, she falsely claimed Native American ancestry \u2014 and fundraised off (correct) efforts by critics to debunk her story, just as she is doing now with her pregnancy story.\n\nMore recently, her campaign has consistently exaggerated crowd sizes at her events, and Warren has repeatedly evaded questions \u2014 even from well-meaning liberals \u2014 about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. Warren\u2019s \u201cauthenticity\u201d is in doubt because she keeps putting it in doubt.\n\nThird, questioning a candidate\u2019s honesty is the bread-and-butter of politics. Journalists and opponents always challenge what candidates say. To claim that the normal course of politics is a \u201csexist trope\u201d is absurd. It is also an effort \u2014 arguably, a sexist one \u2014 to shield a female candidate from scrutiny, as if she could not win on the merits.\n\nJoel B.
