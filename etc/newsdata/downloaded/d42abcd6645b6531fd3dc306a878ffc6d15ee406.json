Trump later signed an executive order to end the policy, though thousands of families reportedly remain separated.\n\n\"What I do wish had worked a lot better is that the coordination and information flow are simply insufficient for that number of people coming,\" said Nielsen, who still works in an adviser role for the Trump administration. \"It's heartbreaking that any family felt at any time that they had to cross the border illegally.\"\n\nNielsen's appearance at the Fortune conference was not without controversy. A day earlier, singer Brandi Carlile announced she was dropping out of the event in protest of Nielsen's involvement.\n\n\"I don't think that human rights violators and merit-based abusers of displaced people should be given a platform to 'reimagine' history,\" Carlile said in a Twitter post.\n\nFormer Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'Outrageous' to suggest Gabbard 'is a foreign asset' Clinton attacks on Gabbard become flashpoint in presidential race Saagar Enjeti: Clinton remarks on Gabbard 'shows just how deep the rot in our system goes' MORE, who was also poised to speak at the women's summit, also reportedly bowed out because of Nielsen.\n\nBefore Nielsen spoke, Fortune Editor-in-Chief Clifton Leaf acknowledged the controversy.\n\n\"These conversations can be tough, and arguably should be tough,\" Leaf told the audience. But, he said, part of the magazine's mission \"is to provide a platform for these discussions.\"", "description": "Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says she resigned from her post earlier this year because \"it became clear that saying no\u201d to policies she disagreed with \u201cwas not going to be enough.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/nielsenkirstjen_021519upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
