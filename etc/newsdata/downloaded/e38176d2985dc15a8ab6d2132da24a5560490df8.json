What a cultural gulf between then and now.\n\nLong Lost Family Special: The Unknown Soldiers (ITV) found only one image of Private John Steele, a farmboy who was just 16 when he volunteered in 1914.\n\nLong Lost Family Special: The Unknown Soldiers (pictured, Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell at Hermies Hill British Cemetery in France) found only one image of Private John Steele\n\nPrivate Steele (pictured) was a farmboy who was just 16 when he volunteered in 1914\n\nHis three older brothers were joining up, too, and John couldn't let them go without him. He lied about his age and posed for the camera as an infantryman with the 23rd London Regiment \u2014 his tunic too big and his cap sloping sideways on his head.\n\nHe looked, said presenter Davina McCall, like a child dressed up in his dad's clothes. And by today's reckoning, a child he still was, though one who served three years in the trenches before being killed at Cambrai, northern France, in 1917. His sister kept John's picture on her mantelpiece all her life, and often kissed it. Now it's a family heirloom \u2014 will that ever be said of any of today's selfies?\n\nThis one-off edition of the history show that combines paper trails and archival research with deeply emotional stories took a new path, joining the 'war detectives' of the Ministry of Defence's Joint Casualty And Compassionate Centre.\n\nUsing DNA technology, this all-women team has identified the remains of 20 previously unknown soldiers and enabled their descendants to see them buried with full military honours.\n\nSofa sleuths of the week: With Ardal O\u2019Hanlon leaving Death In Paradise, the Beeb tweeted a challenge to viewers to guess his replacement. Within hours, fans scouring clues on social media worked out it was Royle Family star Ralf Little. Elementary!\n\nWe joined two of these moving services at the graveside. It's comforting to know that those soldiers who a century ago gave up everything are still honoured and remembered. Sadly, many have no direct heirs: they died too young to be fathers.\n\nFrustratingly for the programme, the war detectives' best efforts often lead nowhere. In their search for Private Steele, DNA tests showed that the remains they had found were not his. That brave young man still lies in an unmarked grave.\n\nIdentifying the 85 victims killed by a wildfire that swept through the town of Paradise, north of San Francisco, in 2018 took weeks \u2014 just one of a catalogue of blunders by public officials for which no one accepted the blame, as revealed in the documentary The Day California Burned (BBC2).\n\nA succession of fire prevention chiefs, police, town planners and emergency call handlers stepped forward to explain why the catastrophe, which began when an electricity cable set mountain brush alight, was unavoidable. The sheriff, who failed to use an automated evacuation alert, admitted no fault: 'People have got to be responsible for their own safety,' he said.\n\nIdentifying the 85 victims killed by a wildfire that swept through the town of Paradise, north of San Francisco, in 2018 took weeks \u2014 just one of a catalogue of blunders by public officials for which no one accepted the blame, as revealed in the documentary The Day California Burned (pictured)\n\nAnd the head fire marshal claimed that, despite dozens of deaths, the emergency plan was 'successful'. Though he did add: 'Was it flawless? Absolutely not.'\n\nThe film-makers also failed dismally, by letting officials evade awkward questions. Instead, everybody blamed climate change. The Beeb, of course, was all too ready to buy this excuse.\n\nMany details were muddled. We were told the fire advanced at '80 football fields a minute'. What does that mean?
