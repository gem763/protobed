Rosbach told Page Six that his son Josh, 42, had been off painkillers and heroin for roughly six months when he died.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been doing well,\u201d Rosbach told the New York Post column. \u201cWe thought this time was the time we turned the corner. He had a DUI conviction about 12 or 13 years ago that he finally got off his record. He\u2019d got himself a car. He was working. We thought we might have hit a milestone.\u201d\n\nIn the interview Rosbach reveals that he was the one who found his son after he\u2019d died, saying he went to Josh\u2019s house \u201cto check on\u201d him only to find that he\u2019d already passed away. \u201cI walked in and he was sitting on the sofa with his head in his hands,\u201d Rosbach said. \u201cI thought he had passed out. I felt relieved. I thought he was fine. Then I went over to give him a hug, and he was cold. He\u2019d gone.\u201d\n\nVideo: Captain Rosbach's Son Dies of Accidental Drug Overdose\n\nMedical examiners told Rosbach and his wife Mary Anne that Josh had taken what he likely believed to be opioid pills but had actually been laced with numerous other substances including heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.\n\nRosbach first announced his son\u2019s death on Instagram on July 29, writing: \u201cThis past Saturday, my beloved wife Mary Anne and I laid our youngest son, Joshua Lee Rosbach to rest. After a 20-year struggle, he finally succumbed to the demons he fought so long and so hard. Addiction is an insidious disease that knows no social status or geographic boundaries. Whether you live in a 10,000-sq. ft. mansion or a double-wide trailer, the path of death, destruction and devastation it leaves remains the same.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the CDC, nearly 400,000 Americans from opioid overdoses between 1999-2017, and nearly 130 Americans die from opioid overdoses every day. Rosbach says he plans to work toward helping fight the opioid epidemic but he wants to wait until he\u2019s feeling a little stronger.\n\nRosbach also touched on the feelings of helplessness that afflict those close to people with addiction. \u201cYou\u2019ll have them at a family function and all of a sudden, they\u2019ve gone missing and you don\u2019t see them for 10 or 15, 20 minutes, and all of a sudden they reappear. \u2018Where did you go?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I had a phone call to make.\u2019 And you know what they were doing. You\u2019re just powerless to stop it,\u201d he told Page Six.\n\nOn Saturday, Rosbach announced on his Instagram that he and his wife will be participating Sallarulo's race for Champions 5K for Special Olympics in Josh\u2019s memory.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anybody that knew him that didn\u2019t realize he had an unconditional love for life,\u201d Rosbach told Page Six about Josh. \u201cHe took a beating from a world that he never intended any harm to whatsoever, as most addicts do.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
