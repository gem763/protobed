REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nThe lawsuit deepens Trump\u2019s efforts to keep his finances under wraps, despite having promised during his 2016 White House run that he would disclose his tax returns.\n\nHis lawyers also adopted the broad position that the president is immune from being subjected to a criminal probe while in office, and the U.S. Constitution requires Vance to wait until after Trump leaves the White House.\n\nTrump accused Vance of joining \u201cthe campaign of bad-faith investigations and harassment\u201d against him by Democratic officials, including from two U.S. House of Representatives committees that have subpoenaed the Republican president\u2019s financial records.\n\nThe complaint filed in Manhattan federal court by Trump\u2019s lawyers challenges a grand jury subpoena that Vance issued on Aug. 29 to Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm, for personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018.\n\nVance issued the subpoena four weeks after issuing another subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush money payments, including to two women prior to the 2016 election who said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump said the earlier subpoena did not call for his tax records, a claim Vance\u2019s office has disputed, and accused the district attorney of trying to \u201ccircumvent\u201d him by demanding the returns from Mazars instead.\n\n\u201cBecause the Mazars subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting President, it is unconstitutional,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cThe court should declare it invalid and enjoin its enforcement until the President is no longer in office.\u201d\n\nTrump is running for re-election. His current term ends on Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nDanny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, said the district attorney will respond to the complaint in court. \u201cWe will have no further comment as this process unfolds,\u201d Frost added.\n\nMazars is also a defendant in Trump\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nIn a statement, it said it \u201cwill respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations,\u201d though as a matter of policy it does not comment on its work for clients.\n\n\u2018HOBSON\u2019S CHOICE\u2019\n\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero scheduled a Sept. 25 hearing to consider whether Vance may enforce the subpoena.\n\nVance had sought to receive much of the subpoenaed material from Mazars by Thursday, and the tax records by Sept. 23, but agreed to wait until after the hearing.\n\nTrump had argued that Mazars faced a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d of ignoring the subpoena and risking contempt, or complying with the subpoena and risking liability to him if the subpoena were voided or deemed unenforceable.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the constitutional issues at stake in this case will receive the appropriate review from the District Court,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer Jay Sekulow said in a statement.\n\nThe hush money payments were made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nMichael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer, has admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from talking about her alleged relationship with Trump in 2006, and helping arrange a payment of $150,000 to McDougal.\n\nCohen is serving a three-year prison term for campaign finance violations, including through the hush money payments, as well as tax evasion and lying to Congress.\n\nTrump is separately trying to block Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) from handing over financial records, which the bank has said include tax returns, sought by the House committees.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump walks to address the media before boarding Marine One for a trip to New Mexico, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 16, 2019.

It has yet to rule.\n\nVance is also pursuing criminal mortgage fraud case against Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman.\n\nManafort has sought a dismissal, saying he was already convicted on similar federal charges brought by the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and that trying him again would amount to double jeopardy.", "description": "Donald Trump sued Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance on Thursday, seeking to void a subpoena for eight years of tax returns related to a criminal probe into the U.S. president and his family business.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431666093&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1J1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
