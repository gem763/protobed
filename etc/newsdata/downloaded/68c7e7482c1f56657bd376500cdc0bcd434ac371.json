We tried and we failed to launch a non-fried product,\" Jenny Packwood, KFC UK and Ireland's head of brand engagement, told attendees at Public Health England's 2019 conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"We were unable to sustain sales.

For instance, a six-piece \"Bargain Bucket\" meal is 610 calories, according to the KFC UK nutrition index.\n\nThe KFC \"Fillet Box Meal\" - which contains a chicken burger, chicken drumstick, fries, side, and drink- is 1045 calories.", "description": "The healthier Rancher and Brazer chicken sandwiches \"were just not selling,\" KFC UK's Jenny Packwood told a government health conference on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9358/47b6bfe5406b45cc8941e08e620e4209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
