He added that he didn't believe the comedian should be fired from the show, and that he should be treated with forgiveness.\n\n\"Shane - I prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn't take cheap shots. But I'm happy to sit down and talk with you if you'd like,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"For the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human.\"\n\nYang, who is of Taiwanese descent, has often spoken with pride on the campaign trail about his Asian heritage. He also frequently makes use of common stereotypes, poking fun at himself as an \"Asian man who likes math\" and joking during last week's debate about knowing a lot of doctors.\n\nYang is one of three Asian-American and Pacific Islanders running for president \u2014 the others are Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" announced Thursday it hired Shane Gillis, whose recent racial slurs and disparaging remarks about Asians quickly drew backlash.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7db11b21214c47e82fd67b-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
