And if you have to present a slideshow or video to a larger group, the iPad is hardly the right screen to use.\n\nFortunately, you can connect your iPad to a projector and cast the same images seen on its small screen onto a much larger display. Here's how to do it.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to connect your iPad to a projector with an adapter cable\n\nYour projector likely has a VGA port or HDMI port, and you will need to get an adapter to connect it to your iPad. HDMI is usually the way to go, as it supports both video and audio, while VGA doesn't support sound.\n\nFortunately, it's easy to find adapters that have both VGA and HDMI inputs as well as adapters for one or the other. Just keep in mind that you will also need a VGA or HDMI cable to run between the adapter and the projector.\n\nYou should also double check your iPad port \u2014 most iPads have lightning ports (so you'd want a lightning adapter), but recent iPad Pro models have replaced the lightning port with USB-C, so you'd want a USB-C adapter for these iPads.\n\nHow to connect your iPad to a projector with Apple TV\n\nYou can also use an HDMI cable to connect your Apple TV box to a projector, but note that you may need to work with the setup menu on the projector for it to find the Apple TV.\n\nThen, with your Apple TV and iPad on the same Wi-Fi network, just swipe up from the bottom or down from the top right to open the Control Center and then tap Screen Mirroring.\n\nFor more information on how to connect your iPad to Apple TV, read our article, \"How to connect an iPad to your TV in 2 different ways.\"\n\nHow to connect your iPad to a projector with a single cable\n\nSome newer projectors, like the Bijou portable projector, can connect to your iPad with just one cable.\n\nThis projector has a USB-C port, so you'll simply need a lightning to USB-C cable to connect your iPad (unless you have the recent iPad Pro models, in which case you'd need a cable with two USB-C ends).\n\nThe Bijou portable projector connects to your iPad with one cable. Steven John/Business Insider\n\nYou can make the projection bigger by moving it further away from the surface you are projecting onto \u2014 Bissou recommends a distance of about two meters.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "It's easy to connect an iPad to a projector to stream content to a larger display.
