It says 37 other cases in which people were sickened may be linked to the suspect sausages, and most of Wilke Wurstwaren\u2019s products will be recalled.\n\nListeria usually causes mild illness but can be dangerous to people with weak immune systems.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "German authorities have halted production at a meat processing plant after two deaths that were linked to listeria in sausage products.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
