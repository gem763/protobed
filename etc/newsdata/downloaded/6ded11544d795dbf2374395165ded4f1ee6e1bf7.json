For me, I didn\u2019t even know it was possible until I read some articles online about people my age throwing in the corporate towel forever. Turns out, what it takes to retire early was way more than my husband and I bargained for \u2014 and not worth our happiness.\n\nThe fall of 2015 was a transformative time in my life. I was planning my wedding to a fabulous guy and we were under contract to finally buy that big, suburban house I had dreamed of living in since I was a kid.\n\nWith our pending nuptials consuming the bulk of my time I hadn\u2019t given our post-wedding finances a proper analysis, because let\u2019s face it, planning a wedding in an underground cavern is way more exciting than planning a budget. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t put it off any longer. Late one evening I began to dissect our future finances.\n\nMy initial exuberance about our future and the new house quickly shifted to full blown panic. The reality of a big mortgage and equally big expenses started to kick in. And I wasn\u2019t alone. My fianc\u00e9 was also experiencing the same anxious thoughts. Our anxiety manifested itself in bouts of irritability and sleepless nights. We realized that what had started out with a casual open house quickly ballooned into a serious search that resulted in a purchase agreement that wasn\u2019t well thought out.\n\nFortunately, the home inspection revealed sheets of black mold hiding in the attic and we were able to pull the plug, get our deposit back, and breathe easy once again. On the heels of that relief we both decided it was high time to get our financial act together.\n\nAs soon as we said our vows we started to focus on debt elimination and wealth accumulation. I remember spending an entire Saturday scouring the internet to see how other people approach their finances and what we could do to make better choices with our own money.\n\nEnter the FIRE movement.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with it, FIRE stands for Financial Independence/Retire Early, and it totally blew my mind. FIRE adherents are typically folks in their 20s, 30s, and 40s who are saving upward of 70% of their incomes in an effort to stash away 25x their annual living expenses. During early retirement they\u2019re pulling roughly 4% out of their nest eggs each year to live on \u2014 sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on stock market performance and the state of their investments. Once they hit their magic number, they\u2019re ditching their fluorescent-lit corporate cubicles for lives of adventure, travel, and, oftentimes, side hustles to support their flexible lifestyles and subsidize downturns in investment returns.\n\nAfter watching my parents struggle with their finances in retirement, barely scraping enough together to pay for basic expenses each month, the idea of FIRE was appealing. The fact that people just like me were retiring in their 30s and 40s was something I never even imagined. Before I knew it, I was down a virtual rabbit hole reading every single FIRE blog I could find and fantasizing about stepping away from my own corporate cubicle to live a life of freedom.\n\nI pitched the idea of FIRE to my husband and, even though we\u2019re both Gen-Xers, on the older side of the movement and with a shorter time horizon, we jumped right in. I even started my own personal finance blog, Mad Money Monster, to chronicle our journey and keep us motivated. Even though I wasn\u2019t earning a dime from my blog, sharing our financial wins and losses online was motivating and I found myself becoming entrenched in the virtual world of personal finance and the FIRE movement.\n\nBut, there was a bit of a catch. Although I had a higher than average salary, my husband\u2019s work was project based and unpredictable. That meant we needed to optimize our finances in every way if we wanted to retire early. We increased our monthly income through side hustles and committing to a lifestyle of extreme frugality in an effort to bolster our savings rate.\n\nOur extremely frugal lifestyle took shape by cutting out almost everything we ever enjoyed. We cut our cable, slashed our mobile data plan, halted our habit of going out for dinner, and even put an end to our Sunday coffee dates. You name it, we cut it. But hey, we were going to retire early so we didn\u2019t mind making necessary sacrifices to reach the FIRE finish line. But then something unexpected happened. As we watched our net worth climb higher and higher, we realized that our happiness level seemed to be in free fall.\n\nNot only were we not as happy as we used to be but I suddenly started to dread going into the office and sitting under those fluorescent lights - something that never bothered me before.\n\nI used to love watching HGTV before bed, going out for pizza on Fridays, and having coffee at our favorite downtown spot every Sunday. Sure, these things cost money and by cutting them out we were saving even more toward our early retirement goal. But cutting these things out came at the price of our day-to-day happiness.\n\nTime dragged on and after about two years of extreme frugality, my husband and I just couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of self-imposed deprivation.\n\nRead: These are the bad things about early retirement no one talks about\n\nOn top of it all, I started to experience some minor, age-related health issues. My eyesight started to wane and I begrudgingly gave in to glasses. Then, my doctor told me that if I wanted to have another child we would likely be facing (pricey) fertility treatments. After having my daughter without any issues a few years prior, it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t expect to hear and something we never budgeted for or even considered in our early retirement plan.\n\nIn addition, my mother was \u2014 and still is \u2014 in need of financial support from us to meet her basic living expenses. And, looking forward, we also want the option to pay for our daughter\u2019s college or her wedding or to travel the world in style. All of these line items were things we didn\u2019t budget into our initial FIRE number.\n\nRead: The 10 things holding you back from financial independence\n\nAround the same time, I noticed a common thread with some of the FIRE folks - the majority of FIRE bloggers writing about their early retirement adventures, weren\u2019t really retired in the traditional sense of the word. Instead, they were earning supplementary and sometimes full-time incomes from their blogs, podcasts, courses, or coaching. So, in essence, their early retirement was nothing more than a thoughtful career change. Granted, they were now working for themselves doing something they enjoyed, but in my world, work is still work and retirement means ceasing to work.\n\nAlthough I absolutely love running my own blog and making money from it on the side, I\u2019ve now been doing it long enough to know that it\u2019s still work with deadlines and deliverables. But, unlike my corporate job, it doesn\u2019t come with perks like a consistent salary and excellent benefits.\n\nRead: These people left their jobs behind to retire early \u2014 then life got in the way. Here\u2019s how they coped with FIRE plans gone wrong\n\nYes, I realize that I am one of the lucky ones and that not everyone works for a company that offers these things. And yet I also realize that I would be a fool to walk away from it in exchange for living frugally off of our savings and crossing my fingers (and toes) hoping that nothing catastrophic happens for the next few decades.\n\nIn the end, our time pursuing FIRE made us realize that we\u2019re not cut out to sustain the extreme frugality lifestyle and deprivation it would\u2019ve required to reach early retirement in a short amount of time. We also decided the risk of retiring early, considering life\u2019s unexpected curveballs, simply wasn\u2019t worth the reward.\n\nRead: These early retirees bought their \u2018disgusting\u2019 house in Montana with cash and budget less than $1 per pound for food\n\nInstead, we bailed on the idea in exchange for reaching financial independence at a leisurely and more enjoyable pace. We will reach our magic number long before traditional retirement age but we\u2019re not planning on pulling the plug on our jobs even when we do. We like the idea of being financially independent but still having the luxury of not having to live off of our savings.\n\nDitching the notion of retiring early felt like a relief because we now have the option to enjoy our lives along the way. And, yes, subscription TV, pizza Fridays, and coffee dates have been reinstated.\n\nThese days, those fluorescent lights over my cubicle don\u2019t bother me anymore. Our balanced financial approach and overall smart money moves are creating a life of options and the life we want to live both now and later and we couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\nLisa is a mother, scientist, and financial enthusiast.
