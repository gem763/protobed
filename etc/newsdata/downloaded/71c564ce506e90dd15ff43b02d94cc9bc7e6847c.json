He didn\u2019t speak the language, and he had no particular expertise in the energy industry. Oh, he did have one thing, though: his last name.\n\nI suppose, that isn\u2019t entirely fair. Hunter once ran a hedge fund with his dad\u2019s brother, James Biden, and associated with a notorious Ponzi schemer. James would go on to snag a job as executive vice president of a construction company in 2010, despite having virtually no experience in the field. And only a few months into his tenure, the company would win one of its biggest contracts in its history, a $1.5 billion deal to build affordable homes in Iraq.\n\nBy pure happenstance, Joe was also the Obama administration\u2019s point man in Iraq at the time. Funny how these things work out.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Harsanyi", "Nypost.Com Wherever-Joe-Biden-Went-Son-Hunter-Cashed-In"], "top_image": ""}
