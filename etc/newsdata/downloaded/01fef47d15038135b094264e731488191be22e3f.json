REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - Michael B. Jordan and Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx tackle the subjects of wrongful convictions and racism in \u2018Just Mercy,\u2019 which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday.\n\nJordan plays real-life U.S. civil rights attorney and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson in the film based on the latter\u2019s 2014 book \u2018Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.\u2019\n\nIt tells the story of his fight to free wrongly accused Alabama death row inmate Walter McMillian, played by Foxx.\n\n\u201cAs a black man, our communities were preyed upon and to be able to do my part and use my platform to get this story out is extremely important to me,\u201d Jordan told Reuters on the red carpet in Toronto.\n\nThe film chronicles Stevenson\u2019s efforts to wade through the legal and political morass that put McMillian, convicted of the murder of a white female store clerk, on death row for six years in Alabama, and fight the racial bias that kept him, and others like him, there. He was eventually freed when his conviction was overturned by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals in 1993.\n\n\u201cBryan Stevenson, once I met him, he really became the heart and soul of the entire production,\u201d director Destin Daniel Cretton, who also co-wrote the screenplay, said on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most incredible humans I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nBrie Larson plays Eva Ansley, operations director of Stevenson\u2019s Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nFoxx won an Oscar in 2005 for his portrayal of rhythm and blues musician Ray Charles in \u2018Ray.\u2019 Jordan\u2019s notable roles include supervillain Erik Killmonger in \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and Adonis Johnson Creed in the Rocky franchise\u2019s \u2018Creed\u2019 movies. Larson won an Oscar for her role in \u2018Room\u2019 and went on to play Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel in the \u2018Captain Marvel\u2019 and \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 films.\n\n\u2018Just Mercy\u2019 will open in U.S. movie theaters in December.", "description": "Michael B.
