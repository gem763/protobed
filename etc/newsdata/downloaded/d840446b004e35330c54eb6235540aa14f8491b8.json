But then-president Bill Clinton instead chose to pursue a diplomatic rapprochement.\n\nThe near-conflict of the 1990s could hold lessons for present-day leaders.\n\nEarly in April 1988, the U.S. Navy frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine while escorting tanker ships through the Gulf. No one died aboard the frigate, but the administration of U.S. president Ronald Reagan ordered the Navy to retaliate.\n\nOn April 18, 1988, American ships, planes and helicopters attacked Iranian forces, sinking two warships and killing scores of Iranian sailors. Two Americans died when their helicopter crashed.\n\nEight years later on June 25, 1996, the terror group Saudi Hezbollah bombed a U.S. military barracks at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Nineteen Americans died and hundreds were injured. The U.S. intelligence community suspected Saudi Hezbollah had strong ties to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps militia.\n\n\u201cFBI and other U.S. counterterrorism officials soon concluded the IRGC had played a role in selecting the target and training the perpetrators,\u201d Malcolm Byrne wrote at the website of The National Security Archive at George Washington University. \u201cHowever, for at least two years the Saudi government rebuffed U.S. demands for access to critical evidence it had collected from interrogating suspects in Saudi custody.\u201d\n\nClinton ordered U.S. Central Command to draw up strike options. The president told Richard Clarke, his counter-terrorism adviser, that he did not \u201cwant any pissant half-measures.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "\u201cThe Pentagon drew up military plans which ranged from launching cruise missiles at Iranian targets to undertaking a full-blown ground invasion of Iran.\u201d", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hXxiOVuIiV0VKzG_GEhCHw--~B/aD04Njc7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/6da902462702ce431397c9efd3fe5188", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
