Sign up here.\n\nEuropean Central Bank presidential nominee Christine Lagarde pledged to act with \u201cagility\u201d against inflation that is persistently too low, signaling that she\u2019ll follow Mario Draghi\u2019s example in finding ways to keep monetary policy exceptionally loose.\n\nIn a hearing at the European Parliament in Brussels over two and a half hours, Lagarde said the 19-nation euro zone must tackle near-term risks mainly related to external factors. At the same time, she said the ECB must be mindful of the potentially negative effects of its unconventional policies and take people\u2019s concerns about them into account.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that warrant the ECB\u2019s current policy stance have not disappeared,\u201dsaid Lagarde, who ran the International Monetary Fund for the past eight years and is due to take over at the ECB on Nov. 1. \u201cA highly accommodative policy is warranted for a prolonged period.\u201d\n\nLawmakers endorsed her bid for the ECB presidency in a vote late Wednesday.\n\nThe former French finance minister is set to inherit a deeply divided Governing Council at a time when the euro-area economy is suffering from global trade tensions and uncertainties over Brexit. Draghi is expected to unveil another interest-rate cut next week, but a number of policy makers including Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Dutch governor Klaas Knot have spoken out against any resumption of bond purchases.\n\nFrance\u2019s Francois Villeroy de Galhau joined the skeptics late Tuesday when he questioned the merits of a new round of quantitative easing, though he left open the question of whether he\u2019d still back a package that includes them.\n\nFailure to deliver sizable stimulus could hit markets, with investors pricing in at least a 10 basis-point cut in the deposit rate. Banks including Goldman Sachs, Nomura and ABN Amro have all penciled in a new round of QE.\n\nLagarde acknowledged the importance of investor expectations, but said policy makers must think more widely.\n\n\u201cThe ECB needs to listen and understand markets,\u201d she said. \u201cIt need not be guided by markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cLagarde\u2019s comments about market expectations could have important implications in the future,\u201d said Frederik Ducrozet, global strategist at Banque Pictet & Cie. \u201cShe\u2019s right in the sense that a central bank should resist market pressure, but the risk is that inflation expectations fall further, forcing the ECB to do more, which she would have to justify.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to critics who say the current suite of stimulus measures has inflated asset prices while hitting savers and weakening bank profitability, Lagarde said \u201cwe have to take the concerns of people seriously.\u201d\n\nShe repeated Draghi\u2019s frequent insistence that countries with room for spending -- such as Germany -- should use it, and called for a European-level fiscal capacity.\n\n\u201cWe need to further institutionalize cooperation rather than trust it will emerge in crisis times,\u201d she said.\n\nThe wide-ranging questions from legislators included demands for Lagarde\u2019s views on green finance and the institution\u2019s inflation goal.\n\nThe 63-year-old endorsed the idea of reviewing the institution\u2019s price-stability target, saying that the vagueness of a goal of \u201cbelow, but close to, 2% over the medium term\u201d might be appreciated by central-bank officials, but is probably unclear to the wider public.\n\nShe also wished never to be in the position that Draghi found himself in 2012, when bond yields in stressed economies were soaring and the euro zone was a risk of falling apart, and he was forced to pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the union together.\n\n\u201cI hope I never have to say something like that. I really do,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cBecause if I had, it would mean the other economic policy makers are not doing what they have to do.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Brussels vote in fourth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Kristie Pladson, Jana Randow, Carolynn Look, Catherine Bosley and Yuko Takeo.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Piotr Skolimowski in Frankfurt at pskolimowski@bloomberg.net;Alexander Weber in Brussels at aweber45@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Gordon at pgordon6@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
