I couldn\u2019t feel fully comfortable with him.\n\nTrans patients face polar struggles in seeking medical treatment: We need doctors to diagnose us with gender dysphoria in order to receive trans-related treatments that align us with who we are, while general practitioners express total ignorance of our basic health needs and mishandle our gender identities and bodies instead. Close medical scrutiny, which is supremely important in making effective individualized care possible, is still taxing, complex, and draining to navigate.\n\nI am a trans boy with chronic back and neck pain that has worsened over time. After my ability to drive to and stand at work deteriorated, I left my apartment, friends, and job to move across the country so my mom could help with my care as I sought a diagnosis. With so much lost and even more at stake, it was especially frustrating when doctors focused on the fact that I'm trans instead of my symptoms\u2014like in the visit where I had to explain my lack of reproductive organs.\n\nBy the time I turned to the healthcare abyss in search of answers, I was a veteran of the system, having undergone hormone replacement therapy and two surgeries over the prior four years. Navigating my medical transition was exhausting, expensive, and complicated, but the surgeons, therapists, and physicians I saw specialized in trans-related treatment. They gave me the na\u00efve belief that, with decent insurance, emotional support, and the willingness to complete a thousand forms, I could receive adequate care.\n\nBut needing non-trans-related care meant dealing with doctors who had little to no experience treating trans patients, who often conflated my gender with my wider health. Over the span of two years, many medical professionals immediately questioned if my gender-confirming surgeries were responsible for my pain. One doctor read my chart and cross-examined me about my genetic material. \u201cSo, if we were to test your DNA and chromosomes, you\u2019d actually be a woman?\u201d she interrogated. A rheumatologist asked me if I believed in God, which apparently would give me the strength I needed to\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014survive this appointment? I was sometimes asked when I first \u201cfelt\u201d I was trans, and whether I was considering further surgeries.\n\nAfter ruling out these concerns, providers brushed me off with a painkiller prescription and the recommendation to see a psychiatrist. I did, and she helped me understand and handle the toxic cycle of pain and stress familiar to many chronically ill folks. But my pain never went away. I wondered if doctors\u2019 suggestions for me to \u201csee a psychiatrist\u201d were informed not only by my symptoms or behavior, but by my previous medical record of gender-related therapy.\n\nI underwent countless appointments, misdiagnoses, and stressful tests in search of a cause: MRIs, CT scans, X-Rays, corticosteroid shots, antibiotics, four rounds of physical therapy. Nearly a year after the onset of my pain, I remarked to one physician\u2019s assistant that doctors didn\u2019t seem to believe I had a legitimate health problem and asked inappropriate questions about my gender. The PA told me straight out, firmly but sympathetically: \u201cYou\u2019re young, transgender, and have a mental health diagnosis,\" he said, referring to the gender dysphoria diagnosis I'd needed in order to transition. \"Most doctors will think you just want drugs or have psychological problems.\u201d\n\nHis candor was shocking. Throughout six years of working with doctors during my transition, I jumped through hoops to prove my mental stability in order to access the gender-confirming procedures I needed. Yet, regarding my chronic pain, the body I'd worked so hard to align with was used against me\u2014evidence that I was prone to \u201cpsychological problems.\u201d\n\nDoctors have always been trans people\u2019s biggest allies and biggest antagonists. Doctors made it possible for trans people to access new levels of harmony in their own bodies, and doctors helped dispel the stigma that trans people are inherently mentally disturbed. But doctors were also the very people who determined that being trans was a mental illness in the first place.\n\nIn the 1940s and 50s, during the early years of trans medicine in the U.S., doctors instituted a system of gatekeeping to sort the \u201creal\u201d trans people from the rest. They prized trans folks' ability to \u201cpass\"\u2014to move through society undetected as trans\u2014and patients needed to play the game if they wanted approval for treatment. In Julia Serano\u2019s queer classic Whipping Girl, she describes how trans women learned to \u201cshow up for their psychotherapy appointments wearing dresses and makeup,\u201d stick to a narrative about being \u201ctrapped\u201d in a man\u2019s body, and deny being sexually active.\n\nThe functions and language of this system of control linger: When I had top surgery in 2012, my insurance listed my diagnosis as \u201ctrue transsexual,\u201d a term from endocrinologist Harry Benjamin\u2019s 1966 \u201cSexual Orientation Scale.\u201d Just this May, the world\u2019s two gold-standard diagnostic tools, the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), de-categorized transness as a mental illness. Until then, trans patients were labeled as suffering from \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d (GID). The new ICD terminology is \u201cgender incongruence,\u201d and the DSM replaced GID with \u201cgender dysphoria.\u201d\n\nSusan Stryker highlighted medical science\u2019s power to \u201cregulate\u201d society in Transgender History , writing , \u201cMedical practitioners and institutions have the social power to determine what is considered sick or healthy, normal or pathological... to transform potentially neutral forms of human difference into unjust and oppressive social hierarchies.\u201d Still today, doctors play god with trans bodies, deciding who does and doesn't deserve access to care\u2014as I found out, this time around, in my experiences with general practitioners.\n\nThe doctor who cluelessly asked about my prostate was, ironically, the doctor who gave me the best advice about subjecting myself to doctor after doctor: \u201cYou have to prepare yourself to go through this for a long time.\u201d By \u201cthis,\u201d I think he meant not only physical discomfort, but the very process of seeking care itself, of dealing with the unpleasant assumptions, of being profoundly disappointed and dismissed.\n\nI finally received a diagnosis when a friend recommended a rheumatologist close to home. His office didn\u2019t take insurance, but I was desperate. The doctor himself actually received me on time from the waiting room\u2014a first. He went over my trans-related treatment briefly, but spent nearly all of the appointment directly addressing the actual symptoms I was there to discuss. He determined I have undifferentiated spondyloarthritis, an auto-inflammatory disease that affects the spine, joints, and where tendons and ligaments attach to bone. I will most likely struggle with pain for my entire life, although medications and physical therapy can help. I felt dejected, but grateful to regain a modicum of understanding and control. And I'd found a doctor who made me feel believed.\n\nThis should not have taken as long as it did, especially given the amount of specialists I saw. 2016 data suggests around 1.4 million people in the U.S. identify as trans, which means we can bust once and for all the myth that the average American (and doctor) has not met a transgender person. Trans healthcare is no longer a niche business, and with unprecedented media visibility for trans folks this decade, a lack of basic knowledge about trans identities and healthcare needs is more inexcusable than ever.\n\nMy doctor didn\u2019t specialize in trans healthcare, but he could provide tailored care for my specific body with kindness and respect. I\u2019m certain my positive experience at this practice was directly correlated to the fact that I paid out of pocket for the care, a more-lucrative exchange for doctors which subsequently incentivizes a more hands-on approach, but there are things all medical care providers can do to educate themselves and make trans patients feel more welcome.\n\nWe can\u2019t fix the outdated, for-profit healthcare system overnight, but we can start by advocating for the humanization of disenfranchised patient populations. Practices should prioritize having at least one doctor with some experience treating trans people and have all of their staff take full advantage of free resources about how to offer respectful and effective care, like the University of San Francisco\u2019s \"Guidelines for the Primary and Gender-Affirming Care of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary People.\" Healthcare professionals with an online presence can openly list their trans-friendliness in order to help clients find them (and avoid doctors who aren't aware or respectful of trans health). Even seemingly small things, like \u201csafe space\u201d stickers and LGBTQ health brochures are always appreciated. It is an anomaly for anyone to have reliable access to good healthcare in America, but for trans patients like me, especially ones seeking care for chronic issues, it's, devastatingly, even rarer.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "We need doctors to provide treatments that help align us with our bodies, but when we have broader health issues, we're often mistreated or dismissed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1bbbce71fd9008c56fbdf/lede/1571929814040-genderqueerhospitaltranshealth.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8442776735459663xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
