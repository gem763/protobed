HEXO was punished, tumbling 23.6% on Thursday. The company blamed issues in the Canadian cannabis market for the miss.\n\nHexo\u2019s Q4 Guidance Slammed Tilray Stock\n\nAs a result, multiple other marijuana stocks, including Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock, were slammed as investors reacted to the bad news. By the time the bell rang on Thursday, Tilray stock had plummeted 13.5% to $20.65. It rebounded slightly on Friday, climbing 1.5% to $20.96.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTilray made statements that indicated that the Canadian cannabis market is having huge difficulties. That triggered panic by investors who were worried that Hexo\u2019s problems are a bad sign for other cannabis producers. Specifically, TLRY reported that:\n\n\u201cSlower than expected store rollouts, a delay in government approval for cannabis derivative products and early signs of pricing pressure are being felt nationally. The delay in retail store openings in our major markets has meant that the access to a majority of the target customers has been limited. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty across the pan-Canadian system and jurisdictional decisions to limit the availability and types of cannabis derivative products have contributed to an increased level of unpredictability.\u201d\n\nInvestors hate unpredictability, so that\u2019s worrisome for many marijuana stocks, including Tilray stock. Negative pressure on cannabis sales is not good news at a time when many producers, including TLRY, are struggling to become profitable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the possibility that the coming rollout of edibles and other cannabis-infused products \u2014slated to be legalized by Canada in December \u2014 could be in trouble, is the last thing that the owners of TLRY stock and other cannabis names want to hear.\n\nOther Marijuana Stocks Were Also Hit\n\nOther cannabis producers suffered significant stock price declines as the market reacted to Hexo\u2019s guidance. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) sank 10.6%, Aphira (NYSE:APHA) lost 14.3%, Aurora (NYSE:ACB) dropped 9.5% and Chronos (NASDAQ:CRON) slid 7.2% on Thursday.\n\nProblems in the Canadian Cannabis Market\n\nThe statement by Hexo is a stark reminder of the many challenges facing the Canadian cannabis market. Leadership shakeups, production and distribution challenges, and slow retail store rollouts are among the problems that have plagued the sector. Also dragging down marijuana stocks are lower than expected public demand for recreational marijuana and the black eye of a major producer losing its license after being caught growing pot illegally. As a result of all these negative catalysts, the Canadian recreational cannabis market has not been the gold mine many had hoped for.\n\nIn the latest challenge facing marijuana stocks, sales of vaping products that incorporate cannabis extracts are now in jeopardy due to the CDC\u2019s investigation into lung injuries and deaths that may have been caused by vaping. Such vaping products are slated to be legalized by Canada in December.\n\nMost of the reported illnesses and deaths were caused by cannabis products that contain THC. Even if vape products with cannabis extracts aren\u2019t banned, the investigation is likely to scare off many potential buyers.\n\nThe Outlook of Tilray Stock\n\nConsidering that just over a year ago, TLRY stock hit $214.06, is it a buy after it closed on Friday at $20.96? The shares\u2019 performance has been underwhelming in 2019, with Tilray stock down nearly 72% in 2019.\n\nMost analysts have a \u201chold\u201d rating on Tilray stock, and their median 12-month price target on TLRY is $52.00. But those numbers don\u2019t yet reflect Thursday\u2019s panic. It\u2019s likely that TLRY stock will bounce back from its HEXO-induced loss as cooler heads prevail, but the long-term outlook of this cannabis stock remains hazy.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Tilray Stock Hammered as Investors Turn on Cannabis Producers appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "Canadian cannabis producer Hexo (NYSE:HEXO) preannounced its Q4 earnings on Thursday.
