This has led to many of the groups, including highly respected human rights organisations, closing down.\n\nThe group's director Ivan Zhdanov said the organisation and its employees \"never received foreign funding\", adding that all its activities are transparent.\n\n190730011624727\n\n\"The fund is sponsored exclusively by Russian citizens,\" he said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nZhdanov said the move on Wednesday was \"another attempt to suffocate\" the foundation, \"forcing us to stop issuing our investigations\".\n\nHe said the group's lawyers will consider and appeal once an official notice is issued by the justice ministry.\n\nThorn in Kremlin's side\n\nIn August, Russian investigators launched a money-laundering probe into Navalny's foundation, which seeks donations from the public, accusing it of taking money that was procured illegally.\n\nLast month, investigators raided dozens of Navalny's regional offices, as well as the homes of his supporters following mass opposition protests in Moscow this summer.\n\nThe 43-year-old Navalny has long been a thorn in the side of the Kremlin.\n\nSince emerging as the government's chief critic and a highly effective campaigner and organiser, Navalny has faced repeated legal action apparently aimed at hindering his activities.\n\nReacting to the announcement on Wednesday, Navalny took to Twitter with a sarcastic post.\n\n\"Putin's ministry of justice\u2019s statement that FBK receives foreign money in its veracity corresponds to the statement of \"Armenia\" restaurant: each of our clients eats 4.3 kg of meat, and Navalny prevented this,\" he wrote.\n\nNavalny, a former anti-corruption lawyer, emerged as a force in Russian politics in 2008 when he started blogging about alleged malpractice and corruption at some of the country's state-controlled corporations.\n\nIn July, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail for calling on people to demonstrate over the exclusion of opposition candidates from elections to Moscow's city parliament on September 8.", "description": "Anti-Corruption Foundation put on foreign agents' list by justice ministry in a move likely to hinder its activities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/bce63bf797004f299fbc6cedd4d07f7a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
