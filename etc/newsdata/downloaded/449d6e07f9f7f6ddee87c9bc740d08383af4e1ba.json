The lyric certainly got the attention of DWTS pro Val Chmerkovskiy, who posted a silly reaction video on his social media\n\nThen, he reminded the rapper of Kim's tenure on the show with several funny photos of her DWTS saga that he jazzed up with some hilariously spot-on Kanye GIFs.\n\nAfter the silly photos, Val wrapped the clip sitting behind the wheel and telling West: 'Yo, Kanye, keep talking that smack about Dancing with the Stars, man. You gonna catch this diss track.'\n\nThen he poked fun at his job, adding: 'With some rhinestones on it.'\n\nVal continued to poke fun at the rapper in his caption, which read: 'That new Ye album got me in my feelings...' a quick reference to Drake's 2018 track which some theorized was a diss directed at Kanye.\n\nSay what? In the clip Val is seen grooving to the song until it arrives at the line in question, prompting him to cock his head to the side\n\nKim's cha cha: He reminded the rapper of Kim's tenure on the show with several funny photos of her DWTS saga\n\nAdd-ons: Making things all the funnier, Val cleverly slapped some Kanye GIFs on top\n\nKanye was likely too busy to respond, seeing as he released his highly-anticipated ninth studio album on Friday.\n\nIt took several tries to get the Christian rap record, Jesus Is King, released.\n\nThe album was originally meant to drop on September 27, then was pushed back to September 29, a deadline that also sailed by unmet.\n\nAn October 25 date was eventually set, corresponding with the release of Kanye's accompanying Jesus Is King IMAX concert movie.\n\nJesus Is King the album includes a packed list of celebrity guests stars including Ty Dolla $ign, Kenny G, Ant Clemons, Fred Hammond and Clipse.", "description": "In the track On God from his new album Jesus Is King he throws shade at the show, rapping: 'That's why I charge the prices that I charge / I can't be out here Dancing With the Stars.'", "authors": ["Kelvera For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/04/20206062-0-image-a-39_1572058847680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
