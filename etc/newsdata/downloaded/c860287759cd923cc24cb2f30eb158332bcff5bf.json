To add to the magnitude of their accomplishment, Livingston came into the contest on a run of four successive defeats but in the knowledge that they had form in making life difficult for fancied opponents at home.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThey demonstrated as much last season by holding Celtic to a goalless draw and beating Rangers at the Tony Macaroni Stadium. On this occasion, Gary Holt\u2019s players had demonstrated their capacity for awkwardness by disrupting the champions\u2019 fluency and rhythm before the first half flashpoint occurred in the 26th minute when Ryan Christie and Scott Robinson contested a ball on the halfway line.\n\nChristie felled his opponent with a studs-up challenge into Robinson\u2019s shin and, even before the Livingston player hit the ground, Willie Collum had the red card on display. Celtic\u2019s response to the reduction in numbers was to increase their efforts proportionately and half-time arrived with the sides still level.\n\nThe situation was transformed within three minutes of the restart when Robinson, having shaken off the ill-effects of Christie\u2019s lunge, gathered possession from Robbie Crawford and struck a powerful and precise finish beyond Fraser Forster. Neil Lennon\u2019s response was to replace James Forrest with Vakoun Bayo, who linked with Odsonne Edouard in a physically imposing attacking double act, which rolled the home team back upon their own lines and seemingly in imminent risk of damage.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, the height of Celtic\u2019s endeavour came with a driven cross-cum-shot by Mohamed Elyounouss, beaten out by Matija Sarkic \u2013 who had replaced Ross Stewart, Livi\u2019s regular goalkeeper- and booted clear of the danger zone. The response of the yellow-shirted ranks was to surge to the other end of the field, where Forster had to parry a Robinson shot but was left exposed in the next Livingston thrust, which saw Lyndon Dykes delicately place a loft over the keeper and into the net.\n\nIt was a merited reward for Dykes, who had made himself a persistent nuisance to the Celtic central defenders, Christopher Jullien and Kris Ajer, while still finding time for running skirmishes with Scott Brown, who was replaced by Olivier Ntcham for the final quarter hour. During that spell, Livingston frequently looked ragged, but they did not crumple \u2013 although Keghan Jacobs was lucky, on his 300rd appearance, only to be cautioned for a reckless challenge on Ajer - and they greatly deserved the salutes of their euphoric and incredulous supporters.\n\nGary Holt praised his Livingston side's execution following victory over Celtic Credit: Graham Stuart/PA\n\n\u201cToday we executed in the right areas in the final third really well,\u201d Holt said, once the clamour had subsided. \u201cWe were better against 11 men - I really did think that.\n\n\u201cWhen they went down to 10 men, we got a wee bit disjointed, but at half-time, I told them to be patient but not slow, and it certainly bore fruit. It was a good advert for Scottish football. The battles were great.\n\n\u201cRyan Christie was sent-off but it was a bit dangerous, not malicious. The rub of the green fell on our side today with the goals we scored. I\u2019m delighted for the back line. I\u2019ve questioned them, had a go at them, asked them who wants to be hurt for us, and I thought they stood toe-to-toe and defended the box brilliantly.\u201d\n\nLennon, meanwhile, was phlegmatic about the afternoon\u2019s events and the loss of points for the second successive weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve no complaints with the red card - it\u2019s totally unlike Ryan Christie \u2013 and at half-time I thought we were okay,\u201d he said.\n\nSent marching: Celtic's Ryan Christie Credit: Graham Stuart/PA\n\n\u201cWe gave away a bad goal, too passive, lost the ball in a bad area, but we didn\u2019t press Robbie Crawford before he played the through ball and there\u2019s no excuse for that. At 1-0 we were forcing the issue and looking okay, and the second goal is really poor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s down to being down to 10 men, we should deal with that, it\u2019s a straight long ball over the top. We have to, at times, roll our sleeves up and do the nuts and bolts of the game more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to whip them for that performance but I didn\u2019t think we were anywhere near as ruthless as we could have been. It\u2019s our first defeat. We have to accept it, look where we went wrong and can\u2019t be too emotional about it.\n\n\u201cWe were too emotional in the game. It\u2019s a learning curve for some of the new ones that not everyone is going to let you play the way you want to play and that you have to earn the right.\n\n\u201cWith 11 men, it\u2019s difficult enough. With 10, it became more difficult. The game just got away from us.\u201d\n\nMatch details\n\nLivingston: (4-4-2): Sarkic; Devlin, Lamie, Guthrie, McMillan; Lawless (Odoffin 81), Bartley, Jacobs, Crawford; Robinson (Lawson 75), Dykes (Miller 87).
