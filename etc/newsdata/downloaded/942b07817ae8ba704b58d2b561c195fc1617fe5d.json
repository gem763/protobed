But you won\u2019t hear Democratic leaders acknowledging that reality.\n\nIf you watch the video above, you\u2019ll see that Democrats are clearly not on the same page about impeaching President Trump. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), has started an impeachment investigation, even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made it clear she thinks impeachment is a bad idea, politically.\n\nWhat his investigation means for Trump, or when it will be complete, is anyone\u2019s guess. The ambiguity has allowed Democrats who don\u2019t agree with an inquiry to muddy what\u2019s happening, effectively making it look like the House isn\u2019t on a potential path toward impeachment.\n\nBut the message they are sending is very confusing. And it signals trouble down the road, when Democrats could have even bigger decisions to debate, like: Do they actually vote to impeach Trump?\n\nHere's what happened this week:\n\nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee, which handles impeachment, voted Thursday to give themselves broader investigative procedures to pursue an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThat same day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) essentially told reporters there\u2019s nothing to see here; that nothing changed from Wednesday before the vote to Thursday after it. The committee has already been using the \u201ci\u201d word this summer, when Judiciary leaders described their investigations in court filings against the Trump administration as an \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLegislate, investigate, litigate \u2014 that\u2019s the path we have been on and that\u2019s the path we continue to be on,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nExcept, when you look at what the Judiciary Committee did Thursday, by definition, that\u2019s a change from the status quo. They had to vote to authorize the committee to have extra investigative authority \u2014 a rarely used procedure that is similar to what Congress did for presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. This isn\u2019t your typical congressional investigation.\n\n(For more on the basics of impeachment, check this out.)\n\nDemocrats on both sides of the debate say that journalists are making too much of their different descriptions, that we\u2019re getting caught up on semantics of whether this is an investigation or inquiry or whatever.\n\nBut what that argument misses is that much, much more difficult debates are to come for Democrats. If they can\u2019t agree on what\u2019s happening right now, how are they going to handle it when, or if, the Judiciary Committee comes up with articles of impeachment for Trump? Then Democrats will have to decide whether to impeach Trump in the months leading up to a 2020 presidential election, even though right now it\u2019s broadly unpopular.\n\nAnd if they do decide to go forward, Democrats have to decide what to impeach him for. The Washington Post's Rachael Bade reports some Democrats are privately making a list of what they might impeach Trump for. It carries some weighty topics, like: \u201cobstruction of justice, abuse of power and defiance of subpoenas, as well as violation of campaign finance law and allegations of self-enrichment.\"\n\nEven if all Democrats suddenly got on the same page, their messy messaging now about what's happening could come back to bite them, writes The Fix's JM Rieger. This is \u201cthe most serious investigation the House can consider,\u201d and they can't agree on whether it's happening.\n\nThis impeachment-inquiry-or-not debate within the Democratic Party is rooted in the divide between the practical and the aspirational. On the aspirational side, it\u2019s Congress\u2019s duty to send a message to the next president that obstructing justice is not okay. Could that cost some Democrats their seats? Maybe, but it\u2019s the right thing to do, they argue.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018political inconvenience\u2019 exception to the United States Constitution,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to come a day when we all have to answer for what we did in this moment,\u201d said Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.) in explaining why he supports impeachment despite the fact he represents a district Trump nearly won in 2016.\n\n['We all have to answer for what we did:' A compelling impeachment argument, explained]\n\n\u201cOne hundred years from now, no one\u2019s going to remember what speech Pelosi is going to give about Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d said Jens David Ohlin, a vice dean at Cornell Law School and one of the more eloquent expounders of the history-book argument I\u2019ve talked to. \u201cBut historians are certainly going to remember that Trump is going to be impeached by the House.\u201d\n\nOn the practical side, these Democrats don\u2019t see a point to impeachment if they\u2019re going to put their jobs at risk for it, or if it helps Trump get reelected. What good is a symbolic act \u2014 and with a Republican-held Senate, this would likely only be symbolic \u2014 when real lives and real policies are at stake in an actual election fast approaching?\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Look, over the next six months, I would much rather see the Democrats be the party of lowering prescription drug costs, not the party of impeachment,\u2019\" Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.) told The Post\u2019s Bade about his conversations with leaders of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats have been weighing these dueling tensions for months now, maybe even almost a year, since they won the House of Representatives last November and knew this debate was a possibility.\n\nNow that impeachment is becoming more tangible, they are nowhere close to an answer. And that\u2019s a problem for Democrats, whatever they decide going forward.\n\nJM Rieger contributed to this analysis.", "description": "The root of the issue is a disagreement over the practical and the aspirational.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vWp4zXE-r-vR9A5Z8BsW9b6C0xI=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-11-2019/t_a16e27c800934858822da678ede66d59_name_65ca7f16_8b6e_11e9_b6f4_033356502dce_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
