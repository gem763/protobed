The two are partners in business (they met at Parsons School of Design and launched their successful Badgley Mischka evening-gown line in 1988) and life (they married in 2013), and had been living in Centre Island, on Long Island\u2019s storied Gold Coast. But they\u2019ve long conducted a fair share of business in Los Angeles, where they maintain a flagship store and outfit celebrities (Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Jennifer Lopez, and Oprah Winfrey, among others) for the red carpet. So in late July of 2018, they began considering a switch. They committed to the idea in August, and moved in September.\n\n\u201cJames and I are gypsies\u2026spontaneous,\u201d Badgley admits. \u201cIt baffles our friends but for some reason it doesn\u2019t really daunt us.\u201d\n\nThat kind of decisiveness\u2014and gutsy come-what-may attitude\u2014seems to serve them well. Both 58, the designers this month are celebrating their one-year anniversary in their newest home\u2014a cozy 1940s bungalow ranch, nestled in a canyon between Beverly Hills and Bel Air.\n\nSitting beside the pool, they spoke with Penta about their five favorite things.\n\nCourtesy of Badgley Mischka\n\nA Bit of Horseplay (1)\n\nBadgley: \u201cIn the living room, mixed in with sporting art, are portraits of our horses that have meant something to us. Snowden, the white one up at the top [left], passed away. Baltimore, below\u2014he\u2019s retired in Kentucky. Brando, the big dark bay with four white socks, is retired out in the Hamptons. McKinley, below, is the one I\u2019m still currently showing.\u201d [Badgley grew up riding and took up the sport again some 20 years ago, competing as a hunter rider in horse shows across the country as a way to de-stress. And James?] \u201cJames likes to watch.\u201d\n\n\u201c James and I are gypsies\u2026spontaneous. It baffles our friends but for some reason it doesn\u2019t really daunt us. \u201d \u2014Mark Badgley\n\nMischka: [Chuckling.] \u201cI just pet the horses.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Badgley Mischka\n\nDesk Set (2)\n\nMischka: \u201cThe Casablanca desk from our first Badgley Mischka Home collection is our favorite piece in the line. It\u2019s all handmade\u2014surfboard-finished on top like glass and the base is hand-gilded mahogany.\u201d\n\nBadgley: \u201cIt\u2019s in a corner of our bedroom opposite an old brick fireplace. We initially designed [the arches] inverted, but when we chiseled out the shape, we turned it upside down and there was something much more provocative about it. Sleek, sensuous, with an Old World Hollywood look.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Badgley Mischka\n\nThe Big Reveal (3)\n\nBadgley: \u201cWe have a guest bedroom in this super-graphic Scalamandr\u00e9 print. Very Sunset Boulevard. Every time somebody opens that bedroom door, it\u2019s sort of a wow. The print climbs up and down the walls, and across the furniture.\u201d\n\nMischka: \u201cI made tablecloths for the nightstands out of linen fabric that matched the wallpaper.\u201d\n\nBadgley: \u201cIt\u2019s a great backdrop to anything. And very pet friendly. [They share their home with three dachshunds\u2014Rommel, Whiskey, and Wally.] There\u2019s something about it\u2014a puppy can walk across anything in a cheetah print and you never see the paw prints.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Badgley Mischka\n\nBirds of a Feather (4)\n\nMischka: \u201cWe bought this pair of ceramic parrots at a fabulous antiques store just south of Lexington, Ky. [where the pair once owned a horse farm]. They\u2019ve followed us around ever since. We love the glaze on them, the way they\u2019re a little bit messy, a little imperfect.\u201d\n\nBadgley: \u201cWe started collecting them in different colors. Every once in a while, they show up at an estate sale or flea market.\u201d\n\nMischka: \u201cBut only in the South. We think they\u2019re from the 1930s.\u201d\n\nBadgley: \u201cThey always work and finish off a tabletop in a fun way.\u201d\n\nPooling Their Resources\n\nMischka: \u201cThe house is actually a U-shape that wraps around the pool\u2014with the master bedroom on one side, the office on the other. All rooms look onto the pool, which is right off the back door, with this long stretch of white brick.\u201d\n\nBadgley: \u201cWe spend a lot of time here, eat our meals here...\u201d\n\nMischka: \u201cSkype to the office from here.\u201d\n\nBadgley: \u201cThe house is kind of all about the pool.\u201d", "description": "Among their favorite things are portraits of their horses, a desk set they designed, and a very impressive pool", "authors": ["Joseph V.
