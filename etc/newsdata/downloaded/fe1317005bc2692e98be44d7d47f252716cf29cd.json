Cooper Cronk will be hunting his third straight title in his final game when the Roosters take on the Raiders on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cI had one more year, but the Warriors wanted to let me go,\u201d Taukeiaho told AAP. \u201cA few times during the season because I had a lot of injuries I was carrying every year.\n\n\u201cAnd I think for them it was just time for me to move on. I couldn\u2019t do much about it. It was a business thing.\n\n\u201cAll I could do was get my manager on board and try and get me an offer. There was only one offer and it was from the Roosters.\u201d\n\nThat decision has paid off for the Tri-colours.\n\nMORE NRL NEWS\n\nIMMORTAL SEAL: Thurston backs Cronk to go down as one of the greatest of all time\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE: How Trent Robinson became an NRL super coach\n\nRETIRE BY 30: Latrell reveals long-term plan for booming rugby league career\n\nULTIMATE GUIDE: Everything you need to know about the NRL grand final\n\nFOX LEAGUE EXPERT TIPS: Clive Churchill Medal favourite emerges\n\nTaukeiaho had only played one game for the Warriors when he came across, but the 27-year-old is now a hard-working staple of the defending premiers pack. Figures from Fox Sports Stats also show he gets the more out of every run than any other prop in the competition.\n\nWhile dogged by injury for parts of 2019, Taukeiaho\u2019s average of 10.3 metres per run is the most of any big man to have taken the ball up 100 times this season. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI spoke to my wife about it this week and how far I have come to get the opportunity to play in a grand final.\n\nLISTEN!\n\nMatty Johns, Paul Kent & James Hooper dig into the highs and lows of GF week\n\nON YOUR PHONE?

Look after my family and put food on the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I took the opportunity to come here and train hard. Trent and the club have developed me personally and as a player.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to play in a few finals, won a premiership and it would be awesome to win another one.\u201d Taukeiaho is off-contract at the end of next year and technically becomes a free agent on November 1.\n\nBut in good news for Roosters fans, he has no intention on leaving the nest. \u201cI would love to stay here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I see myself anywhere else. I haven\u2019t looked into it yet.\n\n\u201cI want to win a premiership on Sunday and then we\u2019ll probably start negotiating once everything is all done.\u201d\n\nNRL\u2019S BEST RUNNING PROPS\n\nSio Siua Taukeiaho (Sydney Roosters): 10.3m per run\n\nAddin Fonua-Blake (Manly): 10.2m\n\nPayne Haas (Brisbane): 10m\n\nDavid Klemmer (Newcastle): 9.7m\n\nBunty Afoa (Warriors):9.6m\n\nIsaac Liu (Sydney Roosters): 9.6m\n\n* Min 100 runs for season (Stats: Fox Sports)", "description": "Sio Siua Taukeiaho has gone from unwanted by the underachieving Warriors to making the biggest runs of any forward in the NRL.", "authors": ["Scott Bailey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9007008e94c0340bd47186fc2b99c0f7?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
