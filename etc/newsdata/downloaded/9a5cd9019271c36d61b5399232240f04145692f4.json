Early every morning crowds of elderly people flock to public parks for their daily exercise routine, including dancing, Qiqong or even light gymnastics. Many take advantage of exercise equipment like ellipticals and pulldown machines aimed at light cardio workouts and gentle strength training. These colourful exercise machines can resemble children\u2019s playgrounds, but are targeted at seniors.\n\nAs governments around the world seek to keep ageing populations healthy for longer than ever before, \u2018senior playgrounds\u2019 are being introduced outside China. Cities including London, Berlin and Toronto all have dedicated senior playgrounds. Yet building these facilities is just one aspect of creating a culture in which pensioners feel confident exercising.", "description": "Cities around the world are adopting a long-standing feature of Chinese public parks to boost exercise among pensioners", "authors": ["Vittoria Traverso"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7s/8v/p07s8vsc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
