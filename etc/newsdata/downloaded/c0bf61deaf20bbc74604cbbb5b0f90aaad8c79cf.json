Her rationale: Women can now vote based on their fiscal conservatism because social issues are no longer a concern for anyone.\n\nValerie Ramirez Mukherjee (R) is running to challenge Rep. Brad Schneider (D) next November in the Illinois 10th Congressional District. With Republicans making up less than one-sixth of the record number of women serving in the 116th Congress, the GOP has been attempting to emphasize the women running in 2020 at various levels of government.\n\nDespite the many polls showing women now increasingly and overwhelmingly leaning Democratic, Ramirez Mukherjee said on Wednesday that \u2014 after two and a half decades \u2014 women are no longer hiding their Republican views because social issues are no longer a factor.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got involved in politics at UC Berkeley, we went into hiding. Our country fought over social issues and that divided us as a country and as a party,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOver the last 25 years, I feel we have started to resolve those social discussions and we are shifting to the fiscal side,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs a woman, as a mom, a business woman, someone who runs my household, the fiscal is what I care so deeply about, other women like me, Republican women like me finally are gonna have a chance to come out and say I am a \u2018Republican too.'\u201d\n\nSocial issues, of course, remain a huge deal. Numerous Republican-led state legislatures have enacted legislation just this year seeking to ban virtually all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.\n\nThe Trump administration has also worked tirelessly to strip rights from LGBTQ Americans, sought to impose a ban on Muslim people entering the country, fought against equal pay legislation, and shrugged at both the #MeToo movement to stop sexual predation and the troubling rise in white supremacist violence.\n\nRamirez Mukherjee\u2019s campaign website does not currently have any issues section and makes no mention of any of these topics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the interview, she echoed the popular Republican talking-point that \u201cidentity politics\u201d are a bad thing \u2014 before attempting to make her own identity a campaign selling point.\n\n\u201cI\u2018ve always, my whole life, have been careful to [n]ever play identity politics,\u201d she claimed, \u201cbecause up until, I would say I was in my low 30s, I didn\u2019t see a difference in who I was based on a woman or someone else being a man or being Mexican-American. I judged myself always on performance. But when you say why do we want more women at the table? It\u2019s because it gives a perspective.\u201d\n\nRamirez Mukherjee then contradicted her claim that social issues no longer matter, saying, \u201cThe topics we are talking about around reproductive health, around family, around education, around safety, climate \u2014 those are things that I feel someone that has a different background, a different professional background, comes from somewhere else. It gives a perspective that others don\u2019t have at the table currently.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ValerieMukherjee.jpg?w=1137&h=617&crop=1"}
