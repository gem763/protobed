French officials expect an announcement around the end of this week.\n\nFor all his grand ambitions to overhaul the European Union, the longer Macron waits to announce his new nominee, the more obvious his dearth of talent to carry out that vision becomes.\n\nHaving conquered power without an established party, he\u2019s been plagued by difficulties in finding people with the requisite competence and political experience \u2014 whether to run as candidates for the European Parliament election in May, or to fill other important jobs in the next Commission.\n\nOfficials in Macron\u2019s entourage said he has not made a final decision, and discussions continue.\n\n\"So far, all the negotiations on Cabinet appointments are done without the French,\u201d said a high-level French official with deep knowledge of the EU \u2014\u00ad despite one of them being set to join von der Leyen\u2019s cabinet. \u201cThe French candidates feel completely ignored or left out. There is a lot of discontent.\u201d\n\nThe Elys\u00e9e is keeping a tight lid on possible nominees for the commissioner post, with only a handful of people involved in the deliberations, including von der Leyen. But two guiding principles frame the search this time around, according to three French officials:\n\n\u2014 The portfolio: Macron is adamant about preserving the immense portfolio he negotiated for France's commissioner, spanning the internal market, defense and digital issues. So the candidate must have the right experience and credibility to take on that role.\n\n\u2014 Parliament's backing: Macron doesn't want to risk a second rejection. He wants to be sure his candidate will win confirmation in the European Parliament.\n\nAlthough von der Leyen has emphasized the importance of a gender-balanced Commission, nominating a woman will not be a priority this time, the officials said.\n\nOfficials in Macron\u2019s entourage said he has not made a final decision, and discussions continue. He is believed to be considering up to five potential candidates. Here are the most prominent names being discussed or floated by French and EU officials.\n\nThe Brussels favorite: Michel Barnier\n\nThe EU's Brexit negotiator meets Macron's two key criteria. \u201cSuch a portfolio would be tailor-made for Barnier, who has been a single market commissioner and Juncker\u2019s special adviser on defense,\u201d a European Commission official said. \u201cIn the European Parliament, he can easily gather a majority.\u201d Barnier has also won widespread praise for steering the European ship through three years of Brexit negotiations, while maintaining the unity of the 27 remaining member states.\n\nBut he is a 69-year-old man who has been in Brussels for a long time, which goes against Macron's desire to infuse the EU with new blood. And he is a member of the conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP), rather than Macron's centrist Renew Europe bloc. The French president is unlikely to want to do the EPP any favors as it played the leading role in sinking Goulard\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThe woman in the wings: Laurence Boone\n\nBoone has bags of economic policy experience, making her well qualified at least for the single market part of the portfolio. She is currently chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). She handled the Greek eurozone crisis of 2015 while a special adviser and G20 sherpa to then-President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 taking over from none other than Macron himself in that post. She also has private sector experience, having worked for financial giants like Merrill Lynch and AXA. She is highly regarded by some officials close to Macron.\n\nHowever, Boone has never held executive public office nor has she been a front-line politician. She also seems happy where she is, calling her OECD post a \"super job.\"\n\nThe dark horse: Thierry Breton\n\nBreton has both high-level political experience \u2014 having been minister of the economy, finance and industry from 2005 to 2007 \u2014 and a long career in the private sector, lately leading one of France's rare digital champions, Atos.\n\nA European Commission official mentioned Breton this week as a potential nominee and French weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 reported on Tuesday that he was Macron's favorite to replace Goulard.\n\nBreton has had a good relationship with Macron for some time. He came out in support of Macron's presidential candidacy during the 2017 presidential election, and was part of the official delegation that accompanied the president on his state visit to Washington in April 2018.\n\nHowever, he is widely seen as an old-school right-wing politician, who first came to politics through the late President Jacques Chirac\u2019s RPR party, and its successor the UMP \u2014 the forerunners of today's main French conservative party, Les R\u00e9publicains. His long business career would also come under close scrutiny during any confirmation process in the European Parliament.\n\nThe refuseniks\n\nBruno Le Maire: France's finance minister is an obvious fit. He is fluent in German, has an established political track record and has the right background for the portfolio. He wrote a book earlier this year conspicuously entitled \"The New Empire: Europe of the Twenty-First Century.\"\n\nBut he's said he's not interested in the Brussels post. \"No I am not a candidate for the European Commission,\" he told French radio on October 14. \u201cI clearly indicated my preference to stay finance minister.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is convinced. \"He is ambitious and is among those who think about [the commissioner job],\" said the high-level French official.\n\nFlorence Parly: France's defense minister was on the three-name shortlist Macron presented to von der Leyen first time around, according to three French officials familiar with the process. She has long-standing experience in the political world, with a special expertise in budget policy, having been junior minister for the budget between 2000 and 2002. She also has solid managerial experience in the corporate world, having held leadership positions at the French national railway company SNCF before becoming defense minister.\n\nBut she twice declined to be considered for the Commission post over the summer, according to officials, and Goulard's rough ride in the European Parliament may have reduced her appetite for the post still further.\n\nThe too-soon twosome\n\nAm\u00e9lie de Montchalin: France's junior minister for European affairs has only been in office for six months but she's a rising star of Macron's party and has already impressed some senior Commission officials, who have suggested her as a potential nominee. However, at 34 and with only two years of political experience, she does not appear to have the credentials to lead the vast portfolio \u2014 and would struggle to convince the European Parliament otherwise.\n\nCl\u00e9ment Beaune: Macron's Europe adviser is another figure to keep an eye on. Along with the president himself, he is the brain behind Macron's landmark Sorbonne speech on European policy, and his open letter to European citizens ahead of the European Parliament election in May. But, at 38 years old , Beaune is likely too young and lacking in political experience to take on a commissioner post this time around.\n\nThe wannabes\n\nGuillaume Klossa: A former special adviser to Andrus Ansip when he was Commission vice president for the digital single market and also an ex-aide to a previous French minister for European affairs, Klossa told France's BFM Business TV this month he \"has a profile\" for the portfolio. But he lacks front-line political experience and is not part of the Macron circle.\n\nS\u00e9bastien Soriano: After Goulard's rejection, France's tech ecosystem started pushing its own champion in national media: S\u00e9bastien Soriano, the current head of the French telecom regulator Arcep. His supporters argued that Macron should send a tech expert to Brussels to handle a huge portfolio that includes the digital single market. He's an engineer by training who was chief of staff to a former minister for SMEs, innovation and digital affairs. But his lack of front-line political experience makes him a highly unlikely nominee.\n\nLaura Kayali contributed reporting.", "description": "A guide to the names in the frame after the rejection of French president\u2019s first candidate.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "David M.
