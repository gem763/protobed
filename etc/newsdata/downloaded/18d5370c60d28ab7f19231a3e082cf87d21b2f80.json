Video", "language": "en", "text": "Country crooner Cameron Hawthorn gets both his literal and figurative kicks on the dance floor in his latest video, depicting a Tennessee fantasy that\u2019s both inclusive and sexy.\n\nHuffPost got an exclusive first look at \u201cOh Hot Damn!\u201d \u2014 the follow-up to Hawthorn\u2019s March breakout, \u201cDancing in the Living Room.\u201d In the new video, the Nashville-based singer-songwriter wanders into a saloon, where he exchanges flirtatious glances with a mysterious cowboy.\n\nAs Hawthorn joins the object of his affection in a hip-swiveling line dance, the video suggests a rush of physical chemistry as it transitions from black and white to vibrant color. (Catch \u201cOh Hot Damn!\u201d above.)\n\n\u201cTo be frank, it\u2019s the first song I wrote about sex,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI was thinking about line dancing and how people \u2014 when they go to line dance, they own it, you know? They don\u2019t care what anybody thinks. So it\u2019s about being turned on by somebody and finding the freedom to express it.\u201d\n\nThe Tuesday release of \u201cOh Hot Damn!\u201d comes months after \u201cDancing in the Living Room\u201d positioned Hawthorn as the latest member in a small but vocal group of openly LGBTQ artists in country music.\n\nFredrik Brod\u00e9n \u201cTo be frank, it\u2019s the first song I wrote about sex,\u201d Cameron Hawthorn told HuffPost of his latest track, \"Oh Hot Damn!\"\n\nThough Hawthorn announced that he was gay in an Instagram post last year, \u201cDancing in the Living Room\u201d was widely interpreted as a coming out moment, capturing him and a boyfriend (among other couples) sharing a sweet embrace. The cinematic video struck a chord among viewers, garnering coverage in People and The Advocate as well as on the country music network CMT.\n\nPrior to relocating to Nashville, the Kansas-born Hawthorn had spent years in Los Angeles recording tracks for film and television, and in 2017, he released a self-titled, three-song EP. Even so, he views \u201cDancing in the Living Room\u201d as a life-changer and the first video to reflect his authentic self.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been doing music for a while and I wasn\u2019t out,\u201d he recalled. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Who is Cameron Hawthorn? What do you want to say as an artist?\u2019 And I knew what I wanted to say, but I was scared to say it. I sat on [the video] for so long, and I thought a lot about whether I wanted [my sexuality] to be a part of my story. But I\u2019m inspired by other artists who are true to who they are, so I saw it as my chance to go out there on a limb and just do it with no regrets.\u201d\n\nThe positive response to \u201cDancing in the Living Room\u201d encouraged Hawthorn to move forward with \u201cOh Hot Damn!\u201d \u2014 the narrative of which takes a few cues from his own journey as an artist.\n\nFredrik Brod\u00e9n \"I knew what I wanted to say, but I was scared to say it,\" Hawthorn said of his early recordings. He began emphasizing LGBTQ themes in his work this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about seeing where I want to be, taking that leap of faith and joining the dance, in a way,\u201d he said. Hopeful that his fans will also want to partake in that dance, he has also created a tutorial video that breaks down the moves in the \u201cOh Hot Damn!\u201d video.\n\nThe number of visible LGBTQ personalities in country music has gradually increased over the years. In comparison to pop and rock, however, the genre continues to be viewed as an unfriendly place for both queer artists and fans.\n\nKacey Musgraves acknowledged that stodgy image in a 2018 HuffPost interview, saying she was \u201cdreaming of the day when we have a gay country music icon that is loud and proud and really, like, a hero for country music fans.\u201d\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Hawthorn \u2015 who cites Musgraves, Tim McGraw and Dierks Bentley as musical influences \u2015 would like his shot at becoming that icon.\n\nAcknowledging that he would love to \u201csell out stadiums and win Grammys\u201d one day, Hawthorn said he\u2019s nonetheless grateful to be carving out a space where he can \u201cput out music that I\u2019m proud of and connect with people who like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting to be creative and put my heart into what I love right now,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Nashville musician, who is gay, shows off his line-dancing skills and nods to his artistic evolution on his sexy new track.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d926acc220000c104e050fe.png?cache=312qegmjce&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
