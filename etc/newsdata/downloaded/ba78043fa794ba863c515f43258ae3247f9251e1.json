Based on everything Mark knew, he thought the real plane was safe.\u201d\n\nThe messages \u2014 which Boeing knew about for months before sharing with the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 raised fresh questions about the company\u2019s knowledge of problems with the MAX long before the crashes and about whether it has been transparent with regulators during investigations.\n\nShares tumbled Friday as aviation experts said the revelations could further delay the plane\u2019s return to service.\n\nThe crashes and the FAA\u2019s certification of the MAX are under investigation from a number of authorities, including the Department of Justice and congressional committees that have scheduled hearings with Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg later this month.\n\nIn both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, the MCAS pointed the plane sharply downward based on a faulty sensor reading, hindering the pilots\u2019 ability to control the aircraft after takeoff, according to preliminary crash investigations.\n\nThe FAA, based on its interactions with Forkner and others at Boeing, believed during certification that the MCAS system would activate only in rare cases and did not pose a threat to plane safety.\n\nThe FAA criticized Boeing for learning of the messages \u201csome months ago,\u201d but not disclosing them to safety regulators until Thursday.\n\n\u201cLast night, I reviewed a concerning document that Boeing provided late yesterday to the Department of Transportation,\u201d FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a letter to Muilenburg.\n\n\u201cI understand that Boeing discovered the document in its files months ago. I expect your explanation immediately regarding the content of this document and Boeing\u2019s delay in disclosing the document to its safety regulator.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Further delays? \u2013\n\nThe FAA said it flagged its concerns to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the Department of Transportation\u2019s inspector general.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said Muilenburg called Dickson to respond to \u201cthe concerns raised in his letter\u201d and to assure the agency that the company is \u201ctaking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service.\u201d\n\nBoeing furnished the messages earlier in the year to \u201cthe appropriate investigating authority,\u201d the company\u2019s spokesman said.\n\n\u201cBoeing has also been voluntarily cooperating with the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee\u2019s investigation into the 737 MAX. As part of that cooperation, today we brought that document to the Committee\u2019s attention as well. We will continue to cooperate with the Committee, and all other authorities, as they move forward with their investigations.\u201d\n\nMaria Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said regulators \u201cmust receive full cooperation and all relevant documents so a full and thorough investigation can take place,\u201d adding that the reports about the messages and the lack of timely disclosure are \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nNews of the messages comes as the FAA has taken the lead among international regulators in overseeing the recertification of the MAX in a process that has dragged on much longer than originally expected.\n\nThe messages add to the pressure on Muilenburg ahead of an October 30 congressional hearing. Boeing last week stripped Muilenburg of his title as chairman, a move that analysts said could be a precursor to his removal as chief executive.\n\nIn recent days, American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have pushed back their target dates for returning the MAX to service, with the three carriers pulling all flights for the aircraft through January or February 2020.\n\nMichel Merluzeau at AirInsight Research said the latest disclosures could lead to further delays.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s disclosure is potentially going to impact return to service again and likely to lead to prolonged uncertainty for the program and lead to consequences at the enterprise level,\u201d Merluzeau said. \u201cThis is frankly sobering news.\u201d\n\nShares of Boeing tumbled 6.8 percent to finish at $344.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 A Boeing pilot behind the 737 MAX certification in 2016 told a colleague a key flight handling system was \u201crunning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/b71c14_us-aviation-regulators-criticized-boeing-not-immediately-disclosing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
