This week Fast Company published a story on stress and made a few great suggestions for dealing with it, one: navigate stress like a pilot.\n\nThe advice comes from Terry Lyles, who coaches professional athletes and people like NASCAR drivers on how to handle stress.\n\nHe argues that stress itself isn\u2019t bad, instead it all comes down to how you interpret it.\n\nFor athletes, instead of \u201cstress\u201d he says they see \u201ccompetition.\u201d As for the pilot analogy, Lyles told Fast Company \u201cA pilot takes off even if there are chances that the wind direction might change.
