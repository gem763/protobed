For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nOne of the biggest blows in the decade-plus case of Jeffrey Epstein came on Friday when a federal court unsealed documents from a lawsuit by one of Epstein\u2019s accusers against his mysterious girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Virginia Giuffre accused Maxwell of procuring young girls for sexual abuse by Epstein and his powerful friends. (The two sides settled in 2017.) The more than 2,000 pages of documents provide the greatest details yet on allegations against Epstein, including eye-popping claims involving some of the world\u2019s most famous men, allegations of sex slaves, and more.\n\nHere are some of the major revelations:\n\nDirected to Have Sex With World\u2019s Most Powerful Men\n\nGiuffre said in several depositions that Maxwell and Epstein trafficked her to powerful men for sex. In 2016, she said Maxwell specifically instructed her to serve former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, wealthy financier Glenn Dubin, former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, and scientist Marvin Minsky. She also says Maxwell and Epstein directed her to have sex with \u201canother prince,\u201d a \"foreign president,\" a well-known prime minister\" and the owner of a \u201clarge hotel chain.\u201d None of the men named have been charged with a crime and all have denied inappropriate behavior.\n\nEpstein \u2018Needed\u2019 Three Orgasms a Day\n\nA woman once employed to be Epstein\u2019s personal masseuse testified that he said he needed \u201cat least three orgasms\u201d every day day. \u201cIt was biological, like eating,\u201d said Johanna Sjoberg. \u201cI thought it was a little crazy.\u201d\n\nSjoberg said Maxwell approached her in 2001 a Florida college to be Epsein\u2019s personal assistant. After one day of clerical work, Sjoberg said another woman described as Maxwell\u2019s \u201csex slave\u201d took her into the his bathroom to give him a massage. Sjoberg said Epstein and the other girl then performed a massage on her while she was naked. While Maxwell admitted in her 2016 deposition that she did employ massage therapists on Epstein\u2019s behest, she had denied the visits were sexual in nature.\n\nEpstein Used \u201cOver 100\u201d Girls and Sex Toys\n\nJuan Alessi, Epstein\u2019s former house manager, testified he saw \u201cprobably over 100\u201d girls serve Epstein at his Palm Beach home over 10 years. After each encounter, Alessi said, he would clean up the home\u2019s upstairs massage room. In multiple occasions, he said, he found \u201cvibrators or sex toys\u201d and put them in Maxwell\u2019s closet because he \u201cknew that\u2019s where they kept\u201d such items, along with a \u201cshiny black costume.\u201d Tony Figueroa, Giuffre\u2019s ex-boyfriend, also testified Giuffre said she participated in threesomes with Maxwell and Epstein, usually involving \u201cstrap-ons.\u201d He says that Maxwell also asked him to find girls for Epstein. Maxwell has denied anything sexual took place during Epstein\u2019s massages.\n\nAccuser Shopped Short Story \u201cThe Billionaire's Playboy Club\u201d\n\nGiuffre wrote and shopped around a fictionalized story about her alleged experiences with Epstein, naming him and Maxwell in the manuscript. The story describes a world where only a \u201cselective clientele\u201d had access to girls \u201ctrained to fulfill every sexual desire asked of them, no matter how bizarre the requests might be.\u201d In one passage, she writes, \u201cJeffrey made his appearance. It was strange seeing him in clothes for the first time. He wasn\u2019t wearing what you\u2019d expect your typical billionaire\u2019s attire to be. He was wearing a pair of sweatpants and a Harvard sweatshirt, which he began to remove immediately.\u201d\n\nDershowitz\u2019s Name Suggested by Journalist\n\nIn 2011, Giuffre was working on her book proposal regarding Epstein when she received an email from journalist Sharon Churcher of the Mail on Sunday, a right-wing UK newspaper: \u201cDon\u2019t forget Alan Dershowitz, JE\u2019s buddy and lawyer,\u201d Churcher wrote. \u201cGood name for your pitch as he repped Claus von Bulow and a movie was made about that case\u2026. We all suspect Alan is a pedo and tho no proof on that, you probably met him when he was hanging out with JE.\u201d\n\nDershowitz has long denied Giuffre\u2019s allegations that he had sex with her. In the unsealed court documents, Giuffre once again claims that she had intercourse with Dershowitz at several of Epstein\u2019s mansions, and says that she once gave him oral sex in the back of a limousine on the way to his house in Massachusetts while Epstein and another young woman watched.\n\nSwedish Girl Said She Was Held Hostage on Epstein\u2019s Island\n\nRinaldo Rizzo, a former house manager for Epstein friends Glenn Dubin and Eva Andersson-Dubin, testified that a \u201cdistraught\u201d 15-year-old girl told him in 2005 she was pressured to have sex on Epstein\u2019s private island. The butler said the girl, who identified herself as Epstein\u2019s personal assistant, refused and that Epstein\u2019s assistant Sarah Kellen took her passport and phone away and gave them to Maxwell. \u201cShe says, \u2018I\u2019m not supposed to talk about this,\u2019\u201d he recalled. Maxwell has denied these allegations.\n\nAccuser\u2019s Dad Honored as Mar-a-Lago MVP in Signed Trump Letter\n\nGiuffre\u2019s father, Sky Roberts, was named as Mar-a-Lago\u2019s \u201cmost valuable employee\u201d in a letter signed by Donald Trump in April 2000. Roberts worked on the Trump club\u2019s maintenance crew and was relocating to Colorado for a new job. \u201cShould he ever return to Florida, he would be eligible for rehire,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter. Trump and Epstein were friendly for years until the now-president supposedly kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately with girls.\n\nIn a deposition, Giuffre says that Epstein told her that he was friends with Trump, but that she never witnessed the president and Epstein together. \u201cDonald Trump never flirted with me,\u201d she testified, and added that she didn\u2019t see him have sex with girls at Epstein\u2019s homes.\n\nMaxwell Allegedly Had Her Own Sex Slaves\n\nWhen Maxwell wasn\u2019t allegedly ordering girls to service Epstein and his friends, she abused them herself, according to at least three people. Giuffre said she, Maxwell, and Epstein \u201cwere all intimate together on multiple occasions,\u201d her ex-boyfriend Tony Figueroa testified. Johanna Sjoberg testified that Maxwell called a girl who was giving massages to Epstein \u201cher slave.\u201d A former house manager testified that Maxwell received massages from girls, as well. Maxwell denies these claims.\n\nPrince Andrew Allegedly Used a Puppet to Act Out Groping\n\nEpstein and Maxwell allegedly trafficked Giuffre to Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew. One day at Epstein\u2019s mansion in Manhattan, Sjoberg testified she sat on his lap with Giuffre sitting next to him. The prince touched Sjoberg\u2019s breast, she testified, and used a puppet to touch Giuffre\u2019s breast, showing what he would do to her. Prince Andrew has vehemently denied inappropriate behavior with underage women around Epstein.\n\nLead Detective Had No Evidence Against Maxwell\n\nEpstein\u2019s accusers weren\u2019t the only ones to lob bombs. Attorneys for Maxwell deposed retired Palm Beach police detective Joseph Recarey, who they say \u201cfailed to uncover any evidence\u201d against Maxwell. When Recarey was asked to describe \u201ceverything that you believe you know about Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s sexual trafficking conduct,\u201d he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d But Giuffre\u2019s lawyers fired back that Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in illegal sexual activities, that he wanted to speak to her but she didn\u2019t return his calls, and that he concluded her role was to procure girls for Epstein.\n\nEpstein Used \u201cHuman ATM Machine\u201d to Pay Girls\n\nFormer house manager of the Palm Beach estate, Alfredo Rodriguez, called himself a \u201chuman ATM machine\u201d tasked with paying out Epstein\u2019s alleged victims. Girls would come by cab and he was \u201ctold to pay them cash\u201d after they finished servicing Epstein and others. Epstein\u2019s assistant Sarah Kellen would tell Rodriguez to call cabs to send the girls back, he testified.\n\nEpstein Ordered Books About How To Use Sex Slaves on Amazon\n\nPalm Beach police recovered receipts from Epstein\u2019s trash that showed he ordered books on Amazon about sadomasochism and how to use sex slaves. A photograph of an Amazon receipt under Epstein\u2019s name showed several titles, including SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, and SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude.\n\nEpstein Computers Removed From Home Before Police Raid\n\nAround the time Epstein was under investigation in Florida in 2005, Maxwell\u2019s assistant Adriana Ross and a man removed three computers from the Palm Beach residence, a former house manager testified. When police later turned up at the home, the computers\u2014which allegedly contained nude pictures of underage girls\u2014were gone.\n\nFeds Had Evidence of Child Pornography in Epstein\u2019s Florida Mansion\n\nGiuffre\u2019s lawyers claimed that Maxwell kept photos of underage girls on her computers, and two of Epstein\u2019s housekeepers also testified that they saw photos of young nude females on Maxwell\u2019s devices. Detective Recarey also \u201cfound a collage of nude photos of young females in Epstein\u2019s closet [in his Palm Beach mansion], and turned the photos over to the FBI and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 office.\u201d The lawyers also note that a police video disclosed through a FOIA request shows naked images of women throughout the Florida house, including a full nude of Giuffre.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to press serious charges against Epstein in 2007 and instead he pleaded guilty to two minor state prostitution charges.", "description": "Over 2,000 pages were released Friday about the notorious sex offender and his girlfriend, who is accused of procuring young girls for his abuse.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez", "Justin Miller", "Katie Baker", "National Editor", "Managing Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565389548/190809-melendez-epstein-unsealed-docs-tease_cavzl7", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
