You may want to think twice about how you use online travel booking sites like Expedia and Orbitz.\n\nRecently, the hotel industry has all but declared war on online travel agencies, which charge high commissions when they book rooms on behalf of hotel companies. To woo customers, hotels are offering lower deals and better perks to members of their loyalty programs that book directly. Meanwhile, Expedia Inc. EXPE, +0.17% and Priceline Group Inc. US:PCLN have rendered the online third-party travel industry into something of a duopoly. Expedia\u2019s holdings include CheapTickets, Hotels.com, Hotwire Group, Orbitz, Trivago and Travelocity, while Priceline Group owns Booking.com and Kayak.\n\nFor consumers, the choice between booking directly with an airline or hotel and going through a third-party remains a generational one, said Mark Blutstein, a research analyst with travel research firm Phocuswright. Older travelers and those who have racked up loyalty or reward points are more likely to buy airline tickets or reserve a hotel room directly. Younger travelers, meanwhile, are obsessed about price. As a result, they tend to flock to sites like Kayak or Travelocity in order to comparison shop. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for the best deal they can get,\u201d Blutstein said.\n\nIn many cases, booking directly with an airline or hotel can yield significant benefits over booking with a third-party site like Orbitz. But the latter can remain an important tool for all types of travelers, when used properly. MarketWatch breaks it down:\n\nWhy you should book directly through a hotel or airline\n\nWhen booking with a hotel directly, consumers often choose from among three different rates, said Bjorn Hanson, a professor with the New York University Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. These include a public rate with no discounts, a discounted rate for members of loyalty programs, and a discounted non-refundable rate. \u201cAlmost always, one of those three will be as low or lower than the rate through an online travel agency for a similar arrangement,\u201d Hanson said.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because many sites like Expedia charge hotels a commission for the booking they get, which is 15% on average, Hanson said. (Expedia would not disclose its commission. A spokeswoman for Priceline Group said that Booking.com does not charge a commission to hotels, but did not comment on other sites owned by the company.)\n\nAs a result, hotels often don\u2019t offer up their best deals on these sites, since they are already taking a hit on the booking. \u201cThere\u2019s some price cutting we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace to drive direct bookings,\u201d said Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Expedia.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Move over New York and London, these unlikely foreign locales have seen a spike in interest from tourists this summer\n\nSimilarly with air travel, travelers will usually save by booking directly with an airline. In recent years, airlines have begun levying a fee when customers book through sites like Expedia, making those prices less competitive.\n\nLower prices aren\u2019t the only reason to book directly with a hotel or airline. People who go straight to the hotel or airline for their reservations can receive preferential treatment in many cases, such as upgrades or free services like internet. There\u2019s also a greater chance that special requests made at booking will be honored when it is done directly. \u201cChances are you\u2019ll be treated a little better, but sometimes you do need to call it out to them,\u201d said Gautum Lulla, president of Travel Tripper, a hotel booking technology provider.\n\nBooking directly also proves useful in emergencies, such as when a traveler misses a flight or needs to cancel a reservation, according to Scott Mackenzie, founder and editor-in-chief of Travel Codex, a website that covers news about travel loyalty programs. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a delay or cancellation, it makes it a lot easier to re-book the ticket,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cThere also may be more flexibility with the rules.\u201d\n\nThird-party sites like Expedia are aware of concerns related to the post-booking customer experience, Khosrowshahi said, noting recent efforts to expand the inventory on Expedia\u2019s sites that is cancelable. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair criticism of Expedia 10 years ago, but the Expedia today is much better than it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThese features were not on the site even four years ago.\u201d\n\nThese policies can vary from one third-party site to another. For instance, Booking.com uses a \u201cpay-when-you-stay\u201d model, Priceline Group head of global communications Leslie Cafferty said in an email. \u201cSo most bookings are cancellable (via one click on the site) up until close to the time of booking,\u201d she added.\n\nWhen to use third-party travel sites\n\nThe main reason to visit websites like Expedia when booking a vacation in spite of some drawbacks is the obvious one: They are great search tools. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the only way to compare prices,\u201d Mackenzie said. Even travelers who are inclined to choose a particular hotel or airline can benefit from researching on these sites, especially in instances where a preferred chain or carrier is not available at their destination.\n\nMore bad news for travel sites: They can also be used for \u201cshowrooming.\u201d A search on Booking.com, for instance, can help a traveler figure out which hotel or airline has the best deal, and then they can book directly. Consumers should also differentiate the sites that operate like travel agencies (Expedia or Priceline.com) from sites that simply perform searches. On Kayak, consumers can research their options, but the actual bookings go through the company promoting the deal in question (which can be a hotel or air carrier or another online travel agency like Priceline.)\n\nAlso see: This is the most Instagrammed place in the world\n\nBut the unparalleled search functions aren\u2019t online travel agencies\u2019 only benefits. For consumers who aren\u2019t devoted to a particular brand, the hotel rewards offered through some online travel agencies can be worth 5% or 10% more than those provided by hotel chains, Mackenzie said. (Airlines\u2019 membership programs still beat sites like Expedia, though.)\n\nFor instance, the rewards program through Hotels.com provides members with a free night for every 10 nights they book through the site. And through the Orbitz Rewards program, consumers can earn points toward discounts on hotels by booking through the site, eating at participating restaurants or using the affiliated Visa card.\n\nAnd booking travel through a third-party site can occasionally be cheaper. For instance, online travel agencies can sometimes afford to layer on their own discounts, offering potential savings. \u201cBecause they have such high margins, sometimes they take a few dollars out of the rate they\u2019re supposed to charge the consumer,\u201d Lulla said.\n\nBooking combination packages that include airfare or car rentals is another way that the savings can add up on third-party sites. And so-called \u201chacker fares\u201d through sites like Kayak.com that involve flights from multiple airlines for a given itinerary can be cheaper than booking through a single carrier.\n\nBut consumers should still research to see if they can recreate the savings offered through such packages on their own, Mackenzie said. \u201cThe mistake people make is not searching anymore once they find something,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get out of it what you put into it.\u201d", "description": "Travel sites are no longer being used for their intended purpose.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FN601_expedi_ZG_20170601150112.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-01"}
