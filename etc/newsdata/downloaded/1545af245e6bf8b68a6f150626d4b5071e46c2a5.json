Politicians in the UK are being told that it\u2019s a \u201ctop priority\u201d and that the information is needed to prepare for Brexit, the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union, which is still scheduled for November 1.\n\nBuzzFeed obtained two top secret government directives from August directed at members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet about an \u201caccelerated implementation plan\u201d for tracking \u201cdigital identity.\u201d A UK government spokesperson in contact with Buzzfeed denied that it was collecting personal data and insisted that \u201call activity is fully compliant with our legal and ethical obligations.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s main web portal, Gov.UK, is used for a wide range of online services from health care to passports to taxes, and also includes services that would typically be handled by individual states in the U.S., including renewing your driver\u2019s licence. Thus, any attempt to politicise the kind of information collected is highly controversial in the UK.\n\nFrom BuzzFeed:\n\nAt present, usage of GOV.UK is tracked by individual departments, not collected centrally. According to the documents seen by BuzzFeed News, the Cabinet Office\u2019s digital unit, the government digital service (GDS), will add an additional layer of tracking that \u201cwill enable GDS to have data for the entire journey of a user as they land on GOV.UK from a Google advert or an email link, read content on GOV.UK, click on a link taking them from GOV.UK to a service and then onwards through the service journey to completion\u201d.\n\nOne of the memos was from Prime Minister Johnson himself telling staff that the information would \u201csupport key decision making\u201d for Brexit, though it\u2019s not clear what that means in practice.\n\nBritish citizens are rightly sceptical of any massive digital data collection programs, especially as we learn more about how Big Data was used to manipulate the British people before the public referendum in 2016 on whether or not to leave the EU.\n\nThe campaigners who wanted people to vote \u201cLeave\u201d used the disgraced political data firm Cambridge Analytica, best known in the U.S. for misusing Facebook data in an effort to get Donald Trump elected.\n\nThe UK is currently in the middle of a self-imposed crisis as the deadline for Brexit is less than two months away. And while no one knows for sure what Boris Johnson and his government will do with a new centralised data collection plan, you can see why people would think that\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nBut much like President Trump\u2019s attitude in the U.S., it may not matter what the people think \u2014 Johnson suspended parliament this week, sending politicians home until October 15, and he\u2019s going to do whatever he feels he needs to do to make Brexit happen.", "description": "The UK government is planning to collect \u201ctargeted and personalised information,\u201d on anyone who visits the government\u2019s various websites, according to a new report from BuzzFeed News.
