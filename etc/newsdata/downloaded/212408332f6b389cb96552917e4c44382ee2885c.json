Yet the movie works as well as it does thanks largely to its human component -- specifically, Brad Pitt as the intrepid, emotionally aloof astronaut who braves facing his past to try saving humanity's future.\n\nTonally, the movie falls into the realm of \"Contact,\" with its search for alien life, and \"Interstellar,\" which used space travel as a means of exploring deeper issues of connection and humanity. There's even a touch of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" in the vision of Earth in \"the near future,\" only here, conquering space hasn't eradicated warring over resources.\n\nPitt's Roy McBride is as astronaut in good standing, even if his commitment to the craft has cost him dearly in terms of personal bonds. He's nevertheless surprised when approached by his bosses to undertake a top-secret mission, seeking out his father (Tommy Lee Jones), who disappeared 29 years earlier, on his own quest to discover if there's intelligent life out in the universe.\n\nEvidence leads toward that mission, in concert with strange energy surges and an antimatter drive system. So Roy is tasked with finding dad somewhere in the vicinity of Neptune, with the very real possibility that he might need to neutralize the old man -- assuming he's still around -- in order to safeguard Earth.\n\nThat plot -- co-written by director James Gray with Ethan Gross -- creates two inherent mysteries -- namely, what happened to the original project, and did it bear fruit in terms of contacting aliens.\n\nRead More", "description": "Brad Pitt vehicle launches into brainy sci-fi realm", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911141033-ad-astra-brad-pitt-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
