This is also a stock market that\u2019s well-seasoned when it comes to political headlines.\n\nStill, there is risk that the process gets more worrying for investors, possibly even delaying a trade deal if China uses the upheaval to bargain harder.\n\nRead: How the top U.S. newspapers are covering the impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nDiving right in, our call of the day, from Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, warns investors may get hurt even if the moves towards impeachment fizzle out.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is unlikely to work as it needs both Houses to align,\u201d Dwane told MarketWatch in an interview. \u201cBut this ruins any civility into the next election, so we should expect POTUS to fight ugly through 2020 as well.\u201d\n\nSuch partisanship could \u201cundermine executive and investor confidence in the U.S. economy,\u201d at least for now, hurting investments and employment, he said. And if you\u2019ve got Washington gridlock, then chances of a U.S. recession are higher, which may not be saved by lower interest rates, Dwane warned.\n\nAmid the fallout, international investors might get rattled and become less keen on U.S. assets such as the dollar and U.S. Treasurys. Impeachment talk also may hurt the long running U.S.-China trade negotiations as he said that country \u201cwill not bother to do a trade deal as it does not know who to deal with.\u201d\n\nInvestors can also expect to see a more \u201cpolarized electorate\u2019 similar to what we are seeing in the U.K., and with that \u201cexpect more volatility as sentiment swings to and fro with the politicians and the polls\u201d warns Dwane.\n\nThe strategist hasn\u2019t been a fan of equities, notably U.S. stocks since gains in the first quarter, due to concerns over Trump and trade negotiations and fears of a possible recession. \u201cWe think you still have to take some risk on returns, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a risk-on environment and certainly not with the Fed reluctantly lowering rates,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the S&P 500, Dwane thinks the roughly 18% year-to-date gain is \u201cpretty much as good as it gets.\n\nRead: How Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump could be a plus for one stock sector\n\nThe tweet\n\nUS stock mkt ...Investors / PMs / Analysts......\u201dkeep calm and carry on\u201d \u2014 Mario Gabelli (@MarioGabelli) September 24, 2019\n\nThe market\n\nThe S&P SPX, +0.14%, Dow DJIA, +0.28% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.06% have opened slightly firmer.
