They like their bacon somewhat or very crispy. They like their bread lightly toasted, and they like their eggs scrambled or over easy.\n\nThese are the results of a new YouGov survey that asked 1,295 U.S. adults how they prefer their breakfast foods. Our preferences are less surprising, perhaps, than the foods that were included in the survey, a combo plate of bacon, eggs and toast that makes it look as if America eats as if it were 1929, not 2019. Where\u2019s the avocado toast? Where\u2019s the heaping bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch? Where\u2019s the cold slice of pizza? Where\u2019s the Sausage, Egg and Cheese Blueberry McGriddles?\n\n[McDonald\u2019s new Blueberry McGriddles sandwich is an HOV lane to a sugar crash]\n\nFor that matter, who has time for breakfast anymore? A recent poll showed that the typical American eats breakfast only three times a week, while 13 percent rarely eat in the morning at all. Where\u2019s the YouGov breakfast survey that says 20 percent of Americans like their morning coffee extra quiet, because they\u2019re hung over?\n\nI asked the friendly folks at YouGov why the survey was limited to bacon, eggs, toast and coffee. I was told, basically, that each food had to accommodate a range of potential answers. So when participants were asked about bacon, for example, they could select one of five responses that ranged from \u201cvery chewy\u201d to \u201cburnt.\u201d Or when asked about coffee, they could select one of four answers that ranged from \u201cblack\u201d to \u201cwith a lot of milk, almost white.\u201d (There was no option, alas, for butter in your coffee.)\n\n\u201cOne could say why not include pancakes?\u201d wrote YouGov public relations manager Jennifer Abreu in an email. \u201cBut there is no scale on pancakes from well done to not.\u201d\n\nAbreu said the breakfast survey is part of a larger one on food. Last month, for instance, YouGov released the results of a steaks-and-hamburgers survey. When Americans were shown images of steak, from blue rare to well-done, their preferences proved just how divided this country is: 24 percent said they like their meat well-done, and 23 percent said they like it medium-rare. As if to confuse the issue even more, Democrats were 6 percentage points more likely to order a well-done steak than their Republican counterparts. This may be the only thing Democrats have in common with President Trump.\n\n[Trump Steaks are so rare, we can\u2019t even find one]\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what conclusions to draw from the YouGov breakfast survey, other than Americans still insist on drowning their coffee in milk, which only makes sense, to my mind, if you\u2019re knocking back blackened sludge brewed from dark-roasted beans. I guess it\u2019s interesting that 1 percent of the population can\u2019t eat bacon or toast without incinerating it first. They must like ashes for breakfast.\n\nBut mostly, I find the survey interesting for the featured breakfast itself: the kind of hearty diner meal that was foisted on America in the 1920s when Edward Bernays, that master of propaganda and public relations, convinced the public that no breakfast plate was complete without a few strips of bacon (no matter how crispy they were). Would it surprise you to learn that Bernays was, at the time, working for the Beech-Nut Packing Co., which was trying to sell more bacon?\n\n\u201cWe carried out a letter to 5,000 physicians,\u201d Bernays said in an old, undated interview. \u201cWe got about 4,500 answers. All of them concurred that a heavy breakfast was better for the health of the American people than a light breakfast. That was publicized in the newspapers. Many of them stated that bacon and eggs should be embodied with the breakfast and, as a result, the sale of bacon went up.\u201d\n\n[No, bacon does not make everything better]\n\nBernays, it should be noted, was the puppet master behind a massive public relations campaign \u2014 others would call it political propaganda \u2014 for United Fruits, an effort that would help topple the government in Guatemala in the 1950s.\n\nIt would seem that, nearly a century after Bernays changed how we ate the first meal of the day, we still view the classic American breakfast as a plate of bacon, eggs, toast and coffee.\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nOvi O\u2019s is a nod to an era when cold cereal was the \u2018breakfast of champions\u2019\n\nTo David Chang, the \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisle is racist. Others say it\u2019s convenient.\n\nImpossible vs. Beyond: We tested cook-at-home versions to see who makes a better vegan burger", "description": "A YouGov poll featured a couple of breakfast foods that entered the American diet via a PR campaign in the 1920s.", "authors": ["Tim Carman", "Reporter Focusing On National Food Issues", "Critic Covering Affordable", "Under-The-Radar Restaurants In The D.C.
