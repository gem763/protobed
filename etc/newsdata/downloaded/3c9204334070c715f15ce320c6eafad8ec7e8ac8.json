Only after I got married was I like, 'Mollie, I\u2019m sorry, but we have to get nontraditional here.' To her credit, instead of saying 'F\u2014k you, I\u2019m out,' she was like, 'Let\u2019s figure this out,'\" he said. \"To be honest, swinging has saved our marriage. We have different speeds, and we argue over it constantly, but it\u2019s better than feeling unheard and alone and that you have to scurry in the shadows.\"\n\nFLORIDA SWINGERS CLUB ORDERED TO PAY MODELS NEARLY $1 MILLION FOR ALLEGEDLY SWIPING PHOTOS\n\nMiddleditch said he thought his urges to sleep with other people would end once he got married, but they didn't. Once he and Gates agreed to be \"part of the lifestyle,\" he says it sometimes gets tricky because he's a celebrity and has women throwing themselves at him fairly regularly.\n\nEUROPE'S BIGGEST SEX FESTIVAL HITS ENGLAND\n\n'SWINGLAND': HOLLYWOOD WRITER'S SWINGING LIFESTYLE RESULTS IN REJECTION, INJURY AND LOTS OF SEX\n\n\"Personally, that\u2019s one of the trickier elements of it all, because Mollie doesn\u2019t get that and yet she has to witness it. I\u2019m like, 'Come on, what about this chick who\u2019s obviously really into me?' And Mollie will say,'Yeah, she\u2019s into you. Where do I fit in?' That question comes up,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a lot of negotiation, and adding fame sometimes makes it easier and sometimes complicates things.\"\n\nMICHIGAN COUPLE SUES TOWNSHIP OVER SWINGERS CLUB OPENING\n\nThe \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\" star explained that his first priority is his wife, whom he adores, and that their methods for finding partners vary: They've done sex parties, but social media can make hookups more difficult, if more available, because of the trust involved.\n\nSWINGERS CLUB IN FLORIDA SUED IN CONNECTION TO CAR CRASH\n\n\"That\u2019s the forever-changing landscape in our relationship, because it\u2019s about everybody feeling safe. The internet is a possibility for meeting people, but Instagram f\u2014ks up marriages,\" he continued. \"If your partner brings this very forward person from Instagram to you, you\u2019ll be like, 'Do you guys have a thing?' Whereas if your partner bumps into someone and they start a conversation, it all happens in front of you.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It\u2019s a game of inches on a minefield to try to predict who\u2019s going to feel safe,\" he said. \"My first concern is Mollie.
