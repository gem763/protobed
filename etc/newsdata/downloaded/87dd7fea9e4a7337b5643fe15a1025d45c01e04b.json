They have obviously been listening to their defence coach here, the former England flanker Joe Worsley and leave the tournament with heads held high. They even scored a stunning 71st minute try from inside their own half from wing Alexander Todua.\n\nThe Australians had plenty ball but could not find a way through in and it took them until the 60th minute to score a second try when win Marika Koroibete went route one and ran in from 40 metres.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The suspended wing Reece Hodge, captain Michael Hooper and the rested prop Allan Alaalatoa appear to be some of the few not on display who would have claims to play against England.\n\nAnd Cheika rotated his half backs, again, starting with Nic White and Matt Toomua, the third combination he has used din five games.\n\nThe Wallabies ran up against a resolute Georgian defence in the early exchanges and by the half hour the underdogs had made a staggering 105 tackles.\n\nBy then White had opened the scoring after the Wallabies had been kept at bay for 23 minutes with the scrum-half burrowing over when the Georgians finally folded on their line.\n\nBut that was not the signal for a white flag moment from the Georgians and they were next to score when Soso Matiaschvili knocked over a penalty from in front after 28 minutes before Toomua added one his own.\n\nNaisarani was then carded five minutes before the break where Georgia ran in just 10-3 down and the crowd on their side.\n\nBut then came Koroibete\u2019s score which gave the Aussies a 14-point cushion before Todua\u2019s wonder score narrowed the gap but the unconvincing Wallabies held on with a late driving maul try from Jack Dempsey and Will Genia\u2019s run in.", "description": "Michael Cheika\u2019s Australia\u00a0warmed up for their potential World Cup\u00a0quarter-final with England\u00a0with a stuttering display against Georgia\u00a0that would not have caused Eddie Jones any sleepless nights.
