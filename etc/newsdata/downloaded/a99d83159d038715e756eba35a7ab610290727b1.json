I gave her a script and she delivered scripted lines, but if she wanted to make something her own, she could. There were moments I\u2019d just have her yell at someone, there were moments where it\u2019s a locker room scene with 15 women and they\u2019re all playing characters, and Cardi is [right there with] them,\u201d Scafaria observed of Cardi, who plays a foul-mouthed stripper named Diamond, a character the artist based on a real woman she knew from her days working in the New York City sex industry. \u201cShe\u2019s an incredibly gifted and talented person who came from a lot. What she\u2019s made of herself is an inspiration, and I am so grateful that she was in this film [and] read the script and felt it was an authentic enough to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThough Scafaria helmed the film, she admitted Lopez had \u201cmore to do\u201d with courting Cardi for the project than she did, and that it created an electric dynamic of diverse energy during production.\n\n\u201cHaving that group of different women from different kinds of entertainment was incredible to see them coexist in a scene together,\u201d Scafaria said. \u2018To their credit, people like Cardi and Lizzo not just improvised, but read scripted lines and played characters. Cardi based Diamond on someone she used to know. To everybody\u2019s credit, they were just actors in the same film.\u201d\n\nHustlers \u2014 which notched the highest live-action opening of Lopez\u2019s career with $33.2 million \u2014 is now playing in theaters nationwide.
