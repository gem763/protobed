She is a bisexual adult with the right to be polyamorous if she pleases. The House Ethics Committee is investigating the affair claims, and until it\u2019s complete, there is nothing of substance for the media to share.\n\nThe most regrettable aspect of the ordeal is that Hill was in a position of power at the time of her relationship with her campaign staffer. According to the New York Times, \u2018Some male Democrats said privately on Tuesday that if Ms Hill had been a man, there would have been an immediate uproar that would most likely have ended in a forced resignation.\u2019 Ultimately, though, the relationship was consensual.\n\nHill is a victim of the media spreading falsehoods and private photos of her \u2014 egregious actions that tell us more about the publications partaking than Hill herself. Even though some voter may blush at her private life, unless her actions impact the policy decisions she makes, it\u2019s truly none of their business.", "description": "", "authors": ["Molly Davis", "Spectator.Us Defense-Katie-Hill"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
