Now, with the announcement of Airlink\u2019s tender success, it will be so much easier to explore the island\u2019s natural wonders, culture and intriguing history. Mantis is delighted to offer world-class hospitality to those visiting this unique destination, as well as employment opportunities to the islanders.\u201d\n\nSEE: St Helena chooses SA Airlink to service the island\n\nThe Mantis St Helena, will comprise 30 en-suite bedrooms, eight of which will be \u201cheritage rooms\u201d in the original buildings, built circa 1744, and 22 newly constructed \u201ccontemporary rooms\u201d. Two terrace areas will cater for al fresco dining and cocktails, while a 60-seater dining room will serve cuisine of international standards. The hotel is wheel-chair friendly.\n\nSt Helena is 2000 kilometres from Africa, the nearest landmass, and boasts a variety of landscapes for tourists to discover.\n\n#scliving #beach #sunset #pluffmud #coastalliving #naturesbeauty #saltlife #paintedsky #happiness #myhappyplace A post shared by Amy Beveridge (@amma718) on Jun 1, 2017 at 9:11am PDT\n\nSt Helena\u2019s mild, tropical climate, friendly people and unique culture are attractive to those looking for a unique, \u201cunplugged\u201d escape.\n\nA variety of walks allows visitors to explore the island\u2019s ecosystems, which range from cloud forest to desert. There are also good diving and sport-fishing opportunities.\n\nWith hundreds of endemic species and impressive marine biodiversity, St Helena is on the United Kingdom\u2019s list as a possible future UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nSt Helena is part of the British Overseas Territories and inhabitants of the 16km-by-8km volcanic island are English speaking; Jamestown is quintessentially British, with Georgian architecture, English-style Bobbies and red post boxes. The island boasts the world\u2019s most remote golf course and most remote distillery.\n\nIt is also of important historical significance, being the place to which Napoleon, King Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo and 6000 Boer prisoners of war were banished.\n\nSEE: WATCH: Remembering Napoleon on the island of Saints\n\nNew airport\n\nWhile St Helena\u2019s new airport on Prosperous Bay Plain has been open since mid-2016 for private aircraft and medical evacuations, the anticipated launch of regular commercial flights was delayed in order to establish which aircraft would be suitable for the airstrip.\n\nComair, winner of the original tender, had to re-evaluate its position after test flights with an 737-800 aircraft raised wind-shear and turbulence concerns for larger aircraft. As a result the tender process was reopened.\n\nSEE: Delays drag on as St Helena opens tenders for commercial flights again\n\nIn January 2017, Airlink acquired Embraer E-Jets and entered their tender bid with a proposal for direct flights to St Helena.\n\nAn Airlink charter flight landed on the island, in May 2017, with 60 passengers who had been stranded in Cape Town due to HMS St Helena undergoing repairs. The Avro aircraft used for this flight had to refuel in Angola on the outward leg, and in Namibia on its return to Cape Town.\n\nSEE: RMS St Helena to sail for yet another year\n\n\u201cThis is a significant vote of confidence in Airlink and we look forward to the next step in the process leading to the formalisation of an agreement for what will be a historic step in St Helena\u2019s development,\u201d said Airlink CEO, Rodger Foster.\n\nAirlink\u2019s selection follows a demonstration of the capability of its newly acquired Embraer E-190 to land and take off from the recently built airport on St Helena island. In April, Airlink also operated a special charter flight from Cape Town to St Helena.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate being able to share details of the air service upon finalisation of negotiations with the St Helena Government,\u201d says Foster.\n\nAirlink\u2019s new Embraer E-Jets are also suited to conditions at St Helena and, with a greater range than the Avros, present the option of supplying direct flights from South Africa to the island, and possibly to Ascension and the Falklands Islands too.\n\n\n\nApart from its South African destinations, Airlink already flies to Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nWhat to read next on Traveller24:\n\n- Saints look to weather-data gathering on southern approach of hazardous St Helena Airport\n\n- #ShockWildlifeTruths: Outraged at planned export of baby elephants from Namibia\n\n- UPDATE: Extensive #Knysnafires damage to exceed R4bn, relief efforts continue", "description": "Anticipating the boost in tourism, a new luxury hotel is being developed in St Helena after Airlink was announced the preferred bidder for the air route between SA and the island.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3977/6d2075e11ec048d78f69f00a57404a0a.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-13"}
