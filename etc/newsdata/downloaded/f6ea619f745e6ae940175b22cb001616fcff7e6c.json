ALMA is able to spot the ripples and gaps in protoplanetary disks, hinting at the presence of an object. A simulation is shown\n\nYoung planets eventually emerge from these protoplanetary disks surrounding stars.\n\nAccording to the researchers, observing these processes in distant solar systems could shed light on Earth\u2019s formation, too.\n\n\u2018Understanding planet formation is related to understanding our origin,\u2019 Zhu said.\n\nFinding young planets in the disk, however, is a difficult task that the researchers liken to looking for a pebble in a pond.\n\n\u2018It is very challenging,\u2019 Zhu says.\n\n\u2018But, when we drop the pebble into the pond, it will lead to ripples in the pond, which are more visible.\n\n\u2018Similarly, when young planets are present in its water pond (the protoplanetary disk), it will excite waves too.\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EARTH WHEN THE SUN DIES? Five billion years from now, it's said the sun will have grown into a red giant star, more than a hundred times larger than its current size. Eventually, it will eject gas and dust to create an 'envelope' accounting for as much as half its mass. The core will become a tiny white dwarf star. This will shine for thousands of years, illuminating the envelope to create a ring-shaped planetary nebula. Five billion years from now, it's said the sun will have grown into a red giant star, more than a hundred times larger than its current size (file photo) While this metamorphosis will change the solar system, scientists are unsure what will happen to the third rock from the sun. We already know that our sun will be bigger and brighter, so that it will probably destroy any form of life on our planet. But whether the Earth's rocky core will survive is uncertain.\n\n\u2018If the planet is massive enough, these waves become a tsunami and cause damages to the disk, forming a gap along the planet\u2019s orbit in the disk.\u2019\n\nBut, the researchers now have no shortage of data; the team analyzed a total of 540 images from the simulations to determine the correlation between the width of the gap and planet mass.\n\nALMA is able to spot the ripples and gaps in protoplanetary disks, hinting at the presence of an object.\n\nThe team then applied the relationships to their observations to weed out potential planets within.\n\nAccording to graduate student Shangjia Zhang, \u2018If these distant stars have young analogs of our Jupiter or Saturn, we have definitely caught them.\u2019", "description": "The study has revealed new insight on the potential abundance of Jupiter-sized young planets in other corners of the Milky Way, and suggests our solar system may not be unique.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/13/21/7393308-0-image-a-63_1544735400051.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-13"}
