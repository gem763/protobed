It took decades of persistence and courageous women showing the world a new kind of beauty,\" attorney Cheslie Kryst (Miss USA 2019) told Essence.\n\nThe article was also accompanied by three photos of Cheslie, opera singer, Nia (Miss America 2019) and activist Kaleigh (Miss Teen USA 2019), donning three different headdresses.\n\n\"Welcome to the era where Black women reign supreme,\" Essence captioned a photo of the cover on Instagram.\n\nTo help clear up any confusion, Miss America and Miss USA are two separate organisations with different scoring priorities and age requirement.\n\nMiss USA is part of a larger circuit where winners go on to compete worldwide in the Miss Universe pageant, meaning Cheslie will go on to compete against Miss South Africa 2019 Zozibini Tunzi for the Miss Universe title in December.\n\nSources: New York Time, MSN, Essence\n\nCompiled by Graye Morkel\n\nshare this", "description": "Breaking racial barriers, for the first time in American history three black women reign concurrently as Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9437/a1b734e582af4a3d819862c2deda5acc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
