Abe said the resolution of problems involving compensation of Korean forced labor victims \"is top priority\" and added that Korea needs to uphold its agreements with Japan, according to NHK.\n\nEarlier, Lee said in meetings with government and ruling party officials that Seoul is willing to reconsider scrapping the intelligence pact if Japan puts Korea back on its \"whitelist\" of preferential trading partners.\n\nMeanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said the Korean Embassy in Tokyo received a parcel last Tuesday containing what appeared to be a bullet with a threatening message. \"I've got a rifle and I'm hunting Koreans,\" the massage said. It was addressed to the former Korean ambassador to Japan, Lee Su-hoon. The sender has not been identified.\n\nThe Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the message made no mention of compensation for forced labor victims, making it \"unclear\" if it was related to the current bilateral spat.", "description": "PM Meets Japanese Lawmaker to Solve Bilateral Dispute", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
