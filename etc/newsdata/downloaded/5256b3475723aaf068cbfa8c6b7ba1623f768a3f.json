His posting does not represent the view of the MLBUA or reflect those of the umpires we represent.\u201d\n\nMr. Drake, who has been an MLB umpire since 1999, deleted the tweet and deactivated his Twitter account amid the backlash. On Thursday, he issued a statement apologizing for appearing to make light of gun violence.\n\n\u201cI want to personally apologize to everyone that my words made feel less safe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI especially want to apologize to every person who has been affected by gun violence in our country.\n\n\u201cI also acknowledge and apologize for the controversy this has brought to Major League Baseball, my fellow umpires and my family. I never intended to diminish the threat of violence from assault weapons, or violence of any kind,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m going to learn from this. Once I read what I had tweeted I realized the violence in those words and have since deleted it. I know that I cannot unsay the words, but please accept my sincerest apologies.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
