He does not sit on any one of the six committees that are investigating the president. Nor was he among the group of freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds who had dramatically announced their support for impeachment in an op-ed the night before.\n\nInstead, Van Drew\u2019s claim to fame is that he\u2019s the guy standing athwart the impeachment train, yelling stop\u2014even though the train has left the station.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasize again, impeachment is an extremely serious issue,\u201d Van Drew explained to a different group of reporters last Friday, his cadence firm, friendly, and doused in a thick Jersey accent. \u201cIt is not something to be taken lightly. You're disenfranchising voters, you're removing an executive from office. That usually only happens in third-world countries.\u201d\n\nHis opposition to impeachment has earned him recognition from more than the Capitol press corps. On Sunday, Van Drew appeared on Fox and Friends to air his opposition to impeachment. \u201cThank you,\u201d tweeted Trump in a thread approvingly quoting the congressman\u2019s remarks. \u201cJust another witch hunt by Nancy Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats!\u201d\n\nTo this point, Van Drew\u2019s most indelible impact on the U.S. Capitol may be sartorial: his impressive collection of patterned suits and bright pocket squares stands out among his more staid colleagues.\n\nBeyond that, however, he suffers from the anonymity that most freshmen members confront when they find themselves one of 435 members of a chamber. \u201cHe\u2019s a member from New Jersey, right?\u201d asked one senior House aide, when offered the opportunity to assess what role Van Drew has played in the impeachment proceedings.\n\nNow, the first-year lawmaker\u2014a former state senator and longtime dentist\u2014has found his role. While his moderate, purple-district colleagues have largely ducked the press on impeachment in a tortured political balancing act, Van Drew has done the opposite.\n\nImprobably, this district-flipping Blue Dog with some of the unsexiest committee assignments in Congress has emerged as the only Democrat willing to talk\u2014and talk, and talk\u2014about why impeachment would be a disaster for Democrats and for the country more broadly.\n\n\u201cIt's the price of leadership,\u201d he told The Daily Beast after a lengthy discussion with reporters. \u201cI think I have a responsibility, when I can\u2014it's hard time-wise sometimes\u2014to have a conversation with you and to be fair and candid.\u201d\n\nVan Drew has, in fact, long been a source of cold water for his party\u2019s impeachment push. After the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, he all but declared that Democrats needed to give up on impeachment unless explosive new evidence about Trump\u2019s conduct emerged. When that explosive evidence did emerge\u2014in the form of an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s credible allegation that Trump asked Ukraine to dig up dirt on his rival former vice president Joe Biden\u2014Van Drew didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cUnless we have something that without a doubt is an impeachable offense, which we know is treason, high crimes and misdemeanors, we don't have any positive proof of that,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cWe have some unseemly, you know, statements, some things that we don't really like or enjoy.\u201d\n\nAs the Ukraine revelations push moderate-minded freshman Democrats toward impeachment in droves, Van Drew sticks out even more, the political equivalent of a turquoise pocket square in a sea of black and blue suits.\n\nAsked to respond to Trump\u2019s approving tweets about him, Van Drew said via a spokesperson on Monday that his position \u201cwas not requested by or made for President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy position on impeachment has always been consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would split the country, hurt both Democrat and Republican constituents at the end of the day, and reduce or negate any work accomplished by this Congress.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Van Drew\u2019s position\u2014consistent, if nothing else\u2014earned him little more than the occasional eyebrow-raise from his fellow Democrats, among whom he keeps somewhat of a low profile. \u201cHe\u2019s a dentist,\u201d said one House Democrat when asked about Van Drew. \u201cSome of my family are dentists. We talk about that.\u201d (Indeed, Van Drew recently retired from a successful dentistry practice he operated for 30 years just outside Atlantic City, the largest city in his district. On his lapel, beside his gold member of Congress pin, Van Drew dutifully wears a stars-and-stripes pin in the shape of a tooth.)\n\nLately, however, some Democrats have met Van Drew and his anti-impeachment media campaign with more of an eye-roll than an eyebrow raise. The fact that he\u2019ll talk to anyone, anytime, for as much time as they\u2014or, usually, he\u2014wants is nothing new, to those who know him.\n\n\u201cJeff never says no to any reporter,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe is a very confident man. He has really high self-esteem, and that\u2019s a good thing, but that\u2019s also what makes him unique on all this. He firmly believes what he believes, he\u2019s not going to lie to you about that and he will back up what he believes, and stick with it.\u201d\n\nThe aide added, Van Drew takes pains to be in lockstep with his district, which he flipped after decades of GOP control. Trump won it by four points in 2016. He says his constituents would rather see him focus on issues like health care and infrastructure\u2014the things that Democrats like him say won them the majority in 2018\u2014and not impeachment.\n\nThe folks back in South Jersey, Van Drew says, worry \u201cwe're not going to be able to fix them because it's going to get so partisan, so dark, so intense, that Republicans and Democrats, we really are not going to work together.\u201d\n\nPlenty of other Democrats clung to that line for most of the year, too, but they\u2019ve shifted in recent days, saying the recent evidence of Trump\u2019s misconduct is simply too powerful to ignore. Public opinion about impeachment, too, appears to be inching in that direction.\n\nWhat political consequences, if any, the freshman may see from his impeachment stand is unclear. Progressives are unlikely to devote a whole lot of energy to unseating him in a purple district, and Van Drew notes that he handily won a 2018 primary before defeating a Republican by a comfortable margin in this seat. He does admit to getting calls from constituents who wish he\u2019d back impeachment; on Capitol Hill, he says his colleagues are largely fine with where he\u2019s at on the issue.\n\n\u201cBy and large, they know I come from a different place,\u201d Van Drew said. \u201cI would rather see a methodical, careful, factual investigation, which is\u2014for God\u2019s sake, we\u2019re congressmen!\u201d\n\nHe paused for a moment, reporters surrounding him in a circle. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a big deal!\u201d\n\n\u2014with reporting from Sam Stein", "description": "\u201cIt is not something to be taken lightly.
