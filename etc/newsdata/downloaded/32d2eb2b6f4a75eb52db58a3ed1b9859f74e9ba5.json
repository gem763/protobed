Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nBen Hart: Have Julian Castro\u2019s multiple attacks on Joe Biden tonight \u2014 he accused Biden of forgetting what he said two minutes prior and accused him of tying himself too closely to President Obama \u2014 been effective at all? And if not, do they at least provide a blueprint for how others might try to take the wind out of his sails?\n\nJonathan Chait: I think they backfired. That\u2019s my guess.\n\nEd Kilgore: I think the attack on his memory will backfire. The jibe about Obama? Not so much. Though if the take on the debate is \u201cCastro calls Biden senile,\u201d everything he said will be suspect.\n\nBen: And has Biden\u2019s \u201cI love Obama\u201d thing looked strained tonight, or is it working fine?\n\nMargaret Hartmann: I think it\u2019s probably working for the people already digging that message.\n\nJon: I think it\u2019s been Biden\u2019s strongest debate so far but last debate he was stronger in the first half than the second, and this one is longer.\n\nMargaret: I was excited to see someone sort of go after Biden on age (or uh, his gaffes), but Castro didn\u2019t do it very elegantly. As in turns out he was wrong.\n\nEric Levitz: I have a very hard time analyzing what works for Biden and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nMatt Stieb: It certainly wasn\u2019t as effective as the Harris cornering in June.\n\nMargaret: In retrospect just seems like he was bullying him.\n\nBen: Agree, Eric. given that we\u2019ve all basically been wrong about what will or won\u2019t wound him, it\u2019s hard to be confident about predictions.\n\nEric: His first two debate performances struck me as just awful, and they cost him approximately no support. So hard for me to believe forcing Obama into a sentence a couple too many times will do what Joe3030 or whatever didn\u2019t. I agree debate 2 was better than 1. I think this is actually his strongest debate so far.\n\nMargaret: I actually thought Biden was okay in both (at least one?) of those debates. I wasn\u2019t into it personally, but he had some messages that I thought could get through to his people.\n\nEd: So is the idea that anything short of a disaster is good for Biden?\n\nBen: Well, it\u2019s hard to think differently at this point.\n\nEd: Yeah, he was fine in the second debate, Margaret.\n\nBen: I think he\u2019s been perfectly fine. As they say in sports, he\u2019s doing what he needs to do.\n\nMargaret: I think he\u2019s doing pretty poorly but that may be because I\u2019ve personally had it with him, haha.\n\nEric: Coming out for releasing every American incarcerated for a nonviolent crime might backfire in the general but\u2026\n\nBen: We discussed this beforehand: it was sort of inevitable that someone would do the \u201cBiden\u2019s old\u201d thing. but Castro was a bit clumsy.\n\nJeb Reid: Especially given that it was a bad hit.\n\nEric: Yeah, he should have waited for a genuine gaffe to do it. Chris Christie didn\u2019t accuse Rubio of repeating himself when he hadn\u2019t.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
