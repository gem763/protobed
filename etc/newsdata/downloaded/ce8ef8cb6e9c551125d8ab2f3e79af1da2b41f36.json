One of them you may know, actress Jane Fonda.\n\nJane Fonda was among 16 persons USCP arrested today during climate change protest on Capitol steps. Fonda says she will demonstrate at the Capitol against climate change every Friday between now and January. USCP charged those arrested with \u201ccrowding, obstructing or incommoding.\u201d \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) October 11, 2019\n\nApparently she has similar plans for next Friday, and the Friday after that. She shared her schedule with The Washington Post in a recent feature.\n\nBut this week, Fonda takes on the role of climate activist and brings it to a new stage: the Capitol, where she will demonstrate until she is arrested. And she will do the same thing for 14 Fridays \u2014 until she has to film another season of the television drama \u201cGrace and Frankie.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to take my body, which is kind of famous and popular right now because of the [television] series and I\u2019m going to go to D.C. and I\u2019m going to have a rally every Friday,\u201d Fonda said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019ll be called \u2018Fire Drill Friday.\u2019 And we\u2019re going to engage in civil disobedience and we\u2019re going to get arrested every Friday.\u201d\n\nThe WaPo has deemed her \"the Greta Thunberg of the octogenarian set.\" And she credits the teenage climate activist with her new call to action in the nation's capital. When she first heard Thunberg talking about climate change, \"the urgency\" to act \"came into my DNA the way it hadn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\nThunberg's activism reached all the way to the United Nations this year, where she lectured world leaders for not treating climate change like a crisis. \"How dare you!,\" she said once or twice. It was a bit much for some critics, including President Trump, who mocked her on Twitter.\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nWhile Fonda is an accomplished actress with multiple Oscars and Golden Globes, her career has also been followed by controversy. In 1972 she became the face of political controversy when she posed on top of a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. It earned her the nickname that's stuck ever since, \"Hanoi Jane.\"", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:17:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/342/5c7974d4-53e3-4df0-9fc4-16c0aea1915e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
