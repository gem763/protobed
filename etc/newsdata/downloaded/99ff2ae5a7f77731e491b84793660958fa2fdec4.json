The first \"L\" is pronounced, unlike the silent \"L\" in salmon, the fish.\n\nApproximately 450 people die each year due to Salmonella.\n\nSalmonella lives in the intestinal tracts of animals, including birds, and people.\n\nPeople become infected by eating foods contaminated with animal feces.\n\nFoods contaminated with Salmonella are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk or eggs, but any food may become contaminated.\n\nIt rarely affects the taste, smell or appearance of food.\n\nSalmonella includes over 2,300 serotypes (species) of bacteria. Salmonella serotypes typhimurium and enteritidis are the most common in the United States and account for half of all human infections.\n\nS. typhimurium is most commonly found in food of an animal origin.\n\nS. enteritidis is mainly associated with poultry and eggs.\n\nMost recently, a specific type of Salmonella Typhimurium, DT104, has emerged that is resistant to many antibiotics. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 can be found in a broad range of foods.\n\nSalmonella was discovered by American veterinarian Daniel Elmer Salmon.\n\nSymptoms and Treatment:\n\nTypical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever. Most people experience symptoms within eight to 72 hours after contaminated food is ingested.\n\nInfections usually resolve in three to seven days, and mild cases often do not require professional treatment. More severe cases require antibiotics.\n\nSalmonella infections can be life-threatening especially for young children, pregnant women and their fetuses, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. The Salmonella infection can spread from the intestines to the blood stream and cause death if not treated early.\n\nA small number of persons infected with Salmonella may develop Reiter's syndrome which causes painful urination, joint pain and eye irritation. This condition can last for months or years and can lead to chronic arthritis.\n\nPrevention:\n\nAvoid cross-contamination of food. Keep uncooked meats separate from other food.\n\nPeople infected with Salmonella should not prepare food for others.\n\nProper storage and handling of food helps prevent the growth of Salmonella and thorough cooking destroys the bacteria. Raw or undercooked meat or eggs and raw or unpasteurized dairy products should not be consumed. Produce should be washed thoroughly.\n\nWash hands with soap after changing diapers or using the restroom.\n\nWash hands after handling pets. Reptiles are especially likely to carry Salmonella, since it can contaminate their skin. Salmonella is also often found in the intestines of chicks and young birds.\n\nA total of 137 persons in 10 states were infected.\n\nMexican soft cheese and ground beef, 2018-2019\n\nMultistate outbreak of Salmonella Newport from ground beef and cheese.\n\nJune 2018 - The CDC begins investigating a deadly strain of salmonella that may not respond to antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat foodborne infection.\n\nSeptember 2018 - The outbreak strain is traced back beef from a slaughter and processing plant in Texas.
