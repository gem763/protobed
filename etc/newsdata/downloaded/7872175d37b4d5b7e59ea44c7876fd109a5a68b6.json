But big satellites are dying out \u2014 and smaller, nimbler satellites are all the rage.\n\nSpaceX announced a new business strategy on Monday that indicates the company wants to adapt: It's establishing a \"rideshare program\" for small satellites. Under the new initiative, SpaceX will dedicate \"regularly scheduled\" launches of its mighty Falcon 9 rocket to carrying large batches of smallsats, rather than focusing on one large, primary payload.\n\n\"SpaceX is committed to serving the commercial market as it grows and changes, and we believe we can address the needs of small satellite operators,\" the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nSmallsats have seen a meteoric rise in popularity over the past few years. They range in size from as small as a smartphone to as large as a kitchen refrigerator. And as they've grown more advanced, hoards of businesses have entered the market promising to deliver services using new smallsat technologies.\n\nSpaceX itself plans to create a broadband network using thousands of smallsats in low-Earth orbit. The company hopes the project, called Starlink , will bring cheap high-speed internet to communities all over the globe.\n\nRead More", "description": "Enormous communications and military satellites are the bread and butter of SpaceX's launch business.
