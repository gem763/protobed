To start: Is the 7-year-old transgender? It\u2019s a question that has divided the Coppell, Tex., parents \u2014 on how Luna, who was named James at birth, should be dressed to school and wear their hair. On whether the child should receive gender-affirming care, which could eventually lead to medical treatment to delay puberty. On which parent should get to live with the twins, and who should have a say in decisions over their health.\n\n\u201cAt least one of those conflicts was resolved on Tuesday, as a jury in Dallas effectively granted Georgulas sole custody of Luna in a deeply personal case of gender identity, family conflict and viral misinformation that has lit conservative circles aflame,\u201d WaPo stated.\n\nJames is at the center of a high-conflict custody battle between Younger and his ex-wife, Dr. Anne Georgulas, a pediatrician who reportedly diagnosed James with \u201cgender-dysphoria,\u201d a psychological disorder that is characterized by a child\u2019s \u201cpersistent, consistent, and insistent\u201d assertion of \u201ctheir cross-gender statements and behaviors.\u201d\n\nIn a video shared by Younger on his website Save James, at three years of age, James said, \u201cMommy tells me I\u2019m a girl.\u201d\n\nA jury in Dallas decided Monday against Younger\u2019s attempt to block his ex-wife\u2019s plan to start their seven-year-old son on puberty blockers and ultimately continue with cross-sex hormones in order to facilitate gender transition.\n\nThe case has created a firestorm as more evidence is revealing the psychological and physical damage that is done to young children when their parents consent to puberty blockers before the children are capable of understanding the consequences.\n\nThe jury decided Georgulas has full authority to continue to \u201ctransition\u201d James, who is being renamed \u201cLuna,\u201d reported LifeSiteNews.\n\nAccording to the report, a consensus of 11 of 12 jurors decided the current joint managing conservatorship over the twin sons of Georgulas and Younger should be replaced by sole managing conservatorship by Georgulas.\n\nThe battle between Younger and Georgulas intensified last year when James\u2019s mother threatened Younger with a child abuse charge because he would not affirm their son is a transgender child.\n\nGeorgulas petitioned to modify the parent-child relationship while referring to James as a \u201cgender expansive or transgender child\u201d who \u201cby choice, now goes by the name Luna.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019s mother sought to terminate Younger\u2019s parental rights because James behaved as a boy when he was with his father. Georgulas also wanted Younger to pay for their son\u2019s counseling with a therapist who will affirm his transgender identity and his need for transgender hormonal treatments, which may begin at age eight.\n\nThe court prohibited Younger from dressing him as a boy or from sharing faith-based or biologically-based scientific teachings on sexuality, even though family friends who have observed James when he is in his father\u2019s care reportedly affirm he dresses and behaves as a boy by his own choosing.\n\nJames\u2019s \u201ctransition therapist\u201d reportedly continued to identify him as \u201cLuna\u201d and to place him on track for gender transition.\n\nGeorgulas has reportedly said James began to imitate female characters from the Disney film Frozen. He asked for a girls\u2019 toy at McDonald\u2019s and asked to wear dresses.\n\nThe mother reportedly said she contacted the GENecis clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Center. She was then referred to Rebekka Ouer for counseling, who recommended a process of \u201caffirmation\u201d and suggested a \u201csocial transition\u201d for James should begin with the young child going to school dressed as a girl named \u201cLuna.\u201d\n\nThe battle reportedly escalated between the two parents when Younger learned Georgulas was \u201csocially transitioning\u201d James.", "description": "The Washington Post referred to 7-year-old boy James Younger as \u201cLuna\u201d in a story about the child embroiled in a custody case.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/James-Younger1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
