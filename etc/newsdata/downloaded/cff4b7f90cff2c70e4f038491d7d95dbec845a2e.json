But he also noted that rates are \u201cclose to neutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy base case scenario is not a recession,\u201d Kashkari said in an interview at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit on Oct. 10. \u201cBut the risks have increased to the downside.\u201d\n\nKashkari has been among the more outspoken members of the central bank in calling for more aggressive rate cuts, arguing that the Fed ought to be taking insurance against a possible downturn. The former Goldman Sachs banker and Californian gubernatorial candidate advocated for cutting by 50 basis points in June, shortly before the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points in July and then by another 25 basis points in September.\n\nOn Thursday, he characterized rates as being \u201cclose to neutral\u201d but also \u201cslightly contractionary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm glad that we're easing,\u201d Kashkari said. \u201cBut I want to watch the data.\u201d\n\nAs the unemployment rate continues to fall past economists\u2019 expectations, Kashkari has argued that the Fed has more room to ease rates to allow the labor market to pull in more workers off of the sidelines.\n\nKashkari\u2019s commentary comes a day after the Fed released minutes from its September meeting, which saw a record number of dissents since President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee, Jay Powell, began heading the central bank.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speaks during an interview at Reuters in New York, United States on February 17, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo More\n\nThat meeting detailed a sharp divide among the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s members on what the next steps should be. Five of the 17 members on the committee telegraphed that they would have preferred holding rates steady in that meeting, while seven of the 17 members forecast one additional rate cut by the end of the year.\n\nAs the Fed pivoted from hiking rates last year (which Kashkari opposed) to cutting rates this year, members of the Fed have been split on the degree to which the Fed should be easing policy in the wake of geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against both rate cuts this year - the complete opposite of Kashkari\u2019s viewpoint - told Yahoo Finance Oct. 5 that the diverging viewpoints at the Fed are healthy.\n\n\u201cSometimes we have contentious meetings, sometimes they\u2019re not so contentious,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cTurning points in the economy are times when people are going to disagree.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s next policy-setting meeting will take place Oct. 29-30, where markets are expecting a 25 basis point rate cut.\n\nKashkari is not a voting member of this year\u2019s committee but will rotate into a voting role in 2020, per the Fed\u2019s rules.\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\nBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.
