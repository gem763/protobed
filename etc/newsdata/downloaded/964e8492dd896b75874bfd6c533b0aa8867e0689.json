We\u2019ve overslept, or woken late, depending how you wish to frame it.\n\n\u2018We are just checking to see if you\u2019ll be joining us for breakfast,\u2019 says the man who had taken our dinner order the night before. In other words: get down here now or go without.\n\nOld-fashioned courtesy \u2014 and it goes a long way at Talland Bay Hotel, a much-loved institution down a narrow lane just above pretty Talland Bay on the south Cornish coast.\n\nThe Talland Bay Hotel, pictured, is located above Talland Bay on the south Cornish coast\n\nThe word \u2018eclectic\u2019 gets badly abused, but here it hardly does the place justice. On a bench near the car park is sprawled an old man \u2014 made of plaster; a pig with zebra stripes sits at the end of the drive next to a row of wooden parrots, and one of those Alice In Wonderland highchairs stands in the garden.\n\nInside, the art \u2014 mainly inherited from the previous owners \u2014 has no rhyme or reason to it.\n\nMetal fairies hang from rafters; a Lego board is mounted on a wall and you are invited to add to it; a grandfather clock has a human face and there\u2019s a Bob Dylan lithograph painting from his Drawn Blank series.\n\nDespite the chaos on the walls, life at the hotel is orderly. That means canapes with pre-dinner drinks, an amuse-bouche, crisp white tablecloths and polite questions such as: \u2018How would you like your beef presented?\u2019 rather than, \u2018medium rare?\u2019\n\nThe dining room at the Talland Bay Hotel. The Inspector says that the food was top-notch\n\nThe food is top-notch, too, thanks to head chef Nick Hawke. My roe deer is superb and my wife\u2019s fancy sirloin wins rave reviews.\n\nOur room has a sea view over the pretty garden. Two armchairs are positioned by the large window and there\u2019s a nautical feel with blue and white striped curtains, white bed and a Seventies-style dressing table.\n\nWe get the impression that some of the more elderly guests have been coming here for years, probably booking the exact same room and eating at the exact same time.\n\nCertainly, they wouldn\u2019t need prompting about making it down for breakfast before the 10am curfew.", "description": "The Talland Bay Hotel is a much-loved institution down a narrow lane on the south Cornish coast.
