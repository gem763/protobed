Tulsi Gabbard, a long-shot 2020 White House candidate, ripped Hillary Clinton on Friday as the \u201cembodiment of corruption\u201d after the former secretary of state seemingly cast her as a would-be Russian asset.\n\nMrs. Clinton drew the Hawaii Democrat\u2019s ire with her comments during an appearance Friday on \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast with David Plouffe, in which she seemingly suggested Ms. Gabbard is being groomed by Russia as a third-party candidate.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said while not mentioning Ms. Gabbard by name. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset. She\u2019s a Russian asset! I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Mrs. Clinton was referring to Ms. Gabbard, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, \u201cif the nesting doll fits,\u201d NBC News reported.\n\nThe 2020 presidential hopeful fired back via Twitter.\n\n\u201cGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cYou, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a \u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and \u2026 \u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a shame HRC is peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016. You can slander progressives as \u201cRussian assets\u201d, but you can\u2019t hide the fact that the DNC sabotaged Sanders & elevated Trump to set the stage for HRC. https://t.co/ImGDnL1451 \u2014 Dr. Jill Stein\ud83c\udf3b (@DrJillStein) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly,\u201d Ms. Gabbard concluded.\n\nMs. Stein, who was the 2016 Green Party presidential candidate, also responded on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame HRC is peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016,\u201d Ms. Stein said.\n\nGreat!
