However, the designer and manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines has experienced a total comprehensive income loss of $45.8 million in 2019.\n\nCanaan competitor opens the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d mining farm\n\nCanaan\u2019s biggest competitor Bitmain opened what it claimed to be the world\u2019s largest facility for Bitcoin (BTC) mining in Rockdale, Texas, which was completed thanks to a collaboration with the Rockdale Municipal Development District and Canadian technology firm DMG Blockchain Solutions.\n\nClinton Brown, Rockdale lead project manager for Bitmain, said that the facility\u2019s launch is \u201csignificant to Bitmain's global expansion plans\u201d and that the state\u2019s stable and efficient energy resources will be fundamental to supporting what he believes is set to be the inevitable scale of growth of the mining industry.", "description": "Chinese cryptocurrency mining giant Canaan Creative has filed for an initial public offering with the U.S SEC to raise $400 million", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kODQwNTM0ZDA5MGE1Zjc2YzlhMzM2OTliMjg4MjU4YS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
