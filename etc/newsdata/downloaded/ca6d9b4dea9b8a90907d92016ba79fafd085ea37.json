You had weeks to make sure this system is robust.'\n\nFurious Thomas Cook customers took to Twitter to slam the CAA after the refund site crashed shortly after going live this morning\n\nAnother frustrated customer described the claims portal as 'pointless and frustrating' before urging the regulator to 'address this asap'.\n\nOne Twitter user said: 'Tried to enter details 3 times just now to get a Thomas Cook refund. \"Due to unprecedented demand\".........etc. Unprecedented ? They know how many claims will be made. How come the website can't cope?'\n\nA second said: 'Where do you find the form? This is one nightmare after another.'\n\nWhile a third added: 'You would think that it would have been taken into account how many people will be trying the site and have been built robust enough to cope! Tried ten times now and same error message!'\n\nCAA chief executive Richard Moriarty said: 'The largest peacetime repatriation ever required an extraordinary effort from all involved.\n\n'I want to thank everyone who has played their part in delivering this enormous undertaking, including the passengers we flew home for bearing with us as we undertook this complex operation.\n\nThe regulator has had to refund 360,000 bookings, which is three times larger than any previous refund programme\n\n'I also want to pay tribute to the many amazing former Thomas Cook employees who worked with us to make this operation a success.\n\n'It needed an unprecedented team effort from our commercial partners, our friends across Government and my colleagues at the CAA.'\n\nIt comes as a union leader stepped up criticism of the Government's handling of the collapse of Thomas Cook by calling for ministers to be held to account for the loss of thousands of jobs and chaos for holidaymakers.\n\nManuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, will hold a meeting on Monday with Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee, to discuss the demise of the travel giant.\n\nMr Cortes, who has called for the resignation of Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom over her handling of the crisis, said the Business Committee should question ministers and former Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser.\n\nCommenting ahead of the meeting in Parliament, Mr Cortes said: 'Everything points to negligence on the part of this Tory government and Andrea Leadsom in particular. She has admitted failing to hold a single meeting with Thomas Cook bosses in the days leading to the collapse.'\n\nA Government spokesman said: 'When a large company faces difficulties, it is standard procedure for one department to act as a single Government contact. In this instance it was the Department for Transport.'\n\nTaxpayers will have to stump up \u00a360 million to fund unpaid wages, holiday pay and redundancy costs for Thomas Cook's 9,500 staff following the travel firm's collapse, according to early estimates.\n\nThe cost is in addition to the Government's own \u00a3100 million estimates for the biggest repatriation in living memory of 150,000 holidaymakers when the business went bust last month.\n\nLast week, a former Thomas Cook cabin crew member walked 200 miles to hand in a letter to the Prime Minister today calling for an investigation into the travel giant's collapse.\n\nRachel Murrell, 41, a member of the Unite union, set out from Devon walking 25 miles a day to highlight the plight of the 9,000 workers who lost their jobs.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Boris Johnson, Ms Murrell, who had worked for Thomas Cook for 20 years, is critical of the lack of communication she and her colleagues received from the company.", "description": "The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which operates the dedicated website for Thomas Cook customers, apologised and said it had experienced 'unprecedented demand'.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390400-0-image-a-33_1570443972997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
