The Bubble Nebula, also known as NGC 7635, is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star which is between 7,100 and 11,000 light years from Earth. It measures about 10 light years across, according to NASA, and the star in the centre of it is about 44 times as heavy as our Sun. It gets its name from the bubble-shaped cloud of gas around it, which glows because of radiation coming from the star.\n\n'Winter is the best time because the nights are darker for longer, but then you have issues with the weather.\n\n'The other night I had to have a word with my neighbour because he\u2019d left his security light on and it lit me up like a Christmas tree whenever I moved, which was quite funny. Though when I told him he was so apologetic.'\n\nMr Smyth is so enamoured by the cosmos he has recently completed a Master's degree in aerospace engineering.\n\nAnd his love for astronomy developed around 40 years ago while he was still a young man.\n\n'When I was a young lad I became obsessed with the programme \u2018The Sky at Night\u2019 with Patrick Moore,' he said.\n\n'I then tortured my mum and dad for a telescope and in those days telescopes were expensive, rare and hard to source.\n\n'But bless them, one Christmas when I was about 12, I got my first telescope and I was over the moon.\n\n'As I got older the stars were put on a back-burner for life commitments and then for my 40th birthday I got a new telescope and that fired it all up again.\n\n'I think as time has gone on and with the advent of electronics and technology, the stars and space have become more available to a lot more people.'", "description": "Ralph Smyth, from County Antrim in Northern Ireland, took the photograph over two days with six hours of camera exposure.
