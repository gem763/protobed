This one, though, has been met with fatigue and skepticism. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking joke,\u201d the Houston Astros pitcher and Cy Young candidate Justin Verlander said of the hitter-friendly baseball during the All-Star break. \u201cMajor League Baseball\u2019s turning this game into a joke.\u201d In April, the Orioles pitcher Alex Cobb told the Washington Post, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my craft with a certain type of ball my entire big league career, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s changed. It\u2019s hard to talk about it because as pitchers, it just sounds like sour grapes.\u201d Even beneficiaries of the increase look at it askance. After the Dodgers broke the National League record for home runs in early September, the manager Dave Roberts puzzled over the accomplishment: \u201cMore times than not, I don\u2019t think the ball has a chance to go out and it ends up being a homer.\u201d\n\nFans\u2019 tastes are varied, and some surely enjoy baseball\u2019s newfound video-game aspect. Many, though, have expressed distaste for a version of the sport that has seen much of its variety\u2014triples, double-plays, infield singles, timely throws from short\u2014cede the stage to repetitive displays of homer and strikeout. The commissioner Rob Manfred, whose professional focus has been shaping the game to fit the contemporary fan\u2019s taste, recognizes the sentiment. \u201cThere is no desire on the part of ownership to increase the number of home runs in the game,\u201d Manfred said after Verlander\u2019s All-Star comments. \u201cTo the contrary, they\u2019re concerned about how many we have.\u201d\n\nAs playoff matchups solidified last week, Manfred spoke with Forbes about the era of peak home run. \u201cI do think that we need to see if we can make some changes that gives us a more predictable, consistent performance from the baseball,\u201d he said. MLB-appointed scientists have started looking into the ball; Manfred says that their findings will be announced shortly after the World Series.\n\nIt is possible that a tamped-down ball, if it arrives next season, will prove a corrective, restoring some measure of the game\u2019s long-standing proportions. It is also possible that the trend will last, that it owes more to hitters\u2019 adjustments than to flukes in equipment. In the meantime, players and fans prepare for an even more concentrated version of the phenomenon: the Postseason of the Home Run. This year\u2019s champion will likely be decided the way so many of this season\u2019s games were, by which team can pile up their own homers and find ways to mitigate the opponent\u2019s. It\u2019s a new sport, spectacular and simple. \u201cMy goal is to try to miss as many bats as I can,\u201d Verlander said after a mid-July win, his first outing in more than a month without giving up at least one home run. \u201cThat\u2019s what the game\u2019s turned into.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
