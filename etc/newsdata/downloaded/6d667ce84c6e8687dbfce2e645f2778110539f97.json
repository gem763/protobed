A financial institution facing trouble growing its user base, for example, may opt to automate initial customer interactions to cut costs.\n\nTo vet your own AI narrative, you might want to consider the below factors:\n\nWeigh the tech investments you've made so far and what return you are hoping to get by implementing applications that rely on AI.\n\nFor Kanioura, the first step in considering investing in AI is determining the appropriate return you are seeking and whether it will complement other tech priorities, like cloud computing or data analytics.\n\n\"Any investment in AI is incremental to existing investments,\" Kanioura said. \"Every company should assess what investments they have made so far \u2026 and then see what is needed on top of that to drive a specific mindset change within the enterprise.\"\n\nOne limitation she urges firms to consider is the large up-front cost, particularly since profits will likely not come until after the first year, given most of that time is used to recoup the initial investment. Kanioura also advises companies to decide whether being an early adopter of the technology is critical.\n\nWhile there can be value in capturing the \"first-mover\" label \u2014 namely differentiating yourself from competitors \u2014 there are also pitfalls. A hasty switch to AI can disrupt global operations that may be centralized in one location but are used in many different markets, Kanioura said. Global corporations also tend to have very long business processes and are not as agile as smaller rivals, which can make implementation across the organization all at once more difficult.\n\nInstead, she advises companies to identify areas of the business that are considered \"no-regret\" moves, meaning there is room for experimentation without fear of any significant losses. One consumer brand that Kanioura worked with, for example, wanted to use AI to increase its market share in a specific category to 15%. It was fine with losing a portion of those sales initially in hopes of eventually reaching that goal.\n\nPick a section of the business to deploy AI that can provide easily testable results.\n\nIt's best to select areas that are more likely to produce tangible outcomes, Kanioura said.\n\nConsider customer service: Companies like AT&T and LG Electronics use so-called conversational AI to address user inquiries through automated responses. Human agents can be looped in to the conversation when necessary, allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks. The hope is that the use of the technology will reduce response times and ultimately cut costs.\n\n\"You can get a lot of value by reducing costs because now you deflect clients to the online channels and use that to fuel your growth,\" she said.\n\nAnother early-use case, according to Kanioura, is using AI to better target prospective customers, a tactic she argues produces clients that are more likely to purchase a specific product.\n\nThe technology, for example, gives companies the ability to tailor discounts to specific clients by quickly analyzing mounds of behavioral data, including what type of purchases they make and at what time of day. In one example that Accenture was not involved in, Best Western used information from an ad campaign that asked users to respond to specific questions to provide more catered travel recommendations.\n\nRoll out the technology in a staged approach and rely on both external and internal experts.\n\nAutomating operations like customer-service centers will have a profound day-to-day impact. For one, it can displace the daily job requirements of many workers. To manage that, Kanioura said companies needed to hire experts who guide corporations through periods of major change that understand the implications, as well as make sure they have in-house employees who are knowledgeable about the specific technology being implemented.\n\n\"That protects the company from massive losses in technology investments. It also protects the business stakeholders from making any decision that could be fatal,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nMonitor results on a monthly basis, but aim to recoup the investments after one year.\n\nMonthly costs are likely to change once artificial-intelligence-backed services are introduced. More tailored advertising, for example, could gradually reduce the overall marketing spend by eliminating those users that are unlikely to purchase a given product.\n\n\"If you don't start getting results within the year,\" Kanioura said, \"then there's a problem.\"\n\nBut the annual evaluation doesn't have to focus solely on direct financial improvements. Reducing how many people are focused on customer-service issues, for example, can allow employees to pursue initiatives that in the long run result in revenue and profit boosts.\n\nTo Kanioura, the return on investment for artificial intelligence is twofold: achieving cost reductions through automation and creating new growth opportunities by freeing employees up to focus on higher-value initiatives.\n\nThose benefits have the potential to grow significantly as AI matures and newer applications are able to replace more tasks done by human workers. It remains to be seen, however, how companies will respond to that from a workforce perspective. But it's likely Accenture \u2014 which is one of the world's largest firms consulting on the technology \u2014 will play a role in figuring that out.", "description": "Athina Kanioura said firms shouldn't pursue a tech upgrade as a solution for every problem.
