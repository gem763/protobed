Buzzard is the main contributor to the Forties crude stream, the largest of the five North Sea oil grades that underpin Brent crude futures.\n\nMeanwhile Libya\u2019s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday it will close the Faregh oil field at Zueitina port for scheduled maintenance from Monday until Oct. 14.\n\nThe current Brent price is about 23% down from the 2019 peak of $75.60 a barrel recorded in April.\n\nStill, it is too early for OPEC to discuss deeper oil output cuts despite the decline in oil prices, its Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS on Monday.", "description": "Oil prices were mixed on Monday with traders pegging cautious hopes for a rebound from last week's losses on progress in talks on ending the U.S.-China trade war, against a backdrop of global economic slowdown weighing on future oil demand.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437898235&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9601T", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
