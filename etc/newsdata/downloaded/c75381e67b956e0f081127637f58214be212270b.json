(Aaron Josefczyk/Reuters)\n\nGod works even through a politician\u2019s tweets.\n\nCory Booker recently tweeted something he couldn\u2019t possibly have read. It was a link to a Glamour magazine piece about men and abortion, and he wrote: \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t be solely responsible for sharing their personal stories as evidence of their humanity. When reproductive rights are in danger, it\u2019s on all of us to join the fight. Thanks to these men for sharing how abortion has impacted their lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, the wording: \u201cevidence of their humanity.\u201d It was a little like an Elizabeth Warren tweet around the same time, in which she said, \u201cAccess to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right. Every time we deny access to safe, legal abortion, we put lives in danger.\u201d Note that she drops the word \u201crare.\u201d Bill Clinton made it a part of our political rhetoric, even while vetoing a ban on partial-birth abortion, saying that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d The phrase captured most Americans\u2019 discomfort with abortion and was an acknowledgment that it is not a good.\n\nAnd of course, in abortion, there is no question that we are dealing with people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s Planned Parenthood, with abortion as a business model and a chokehold on politicians, that dehumanizes. It\u2019s our coarse politics that pours salt on open wounds. It should be an unwritten campaign rule that if you\u2019re not going to say something life-giving about abortion \u2014 something that acknowledges pain and touches on hope and healing \u2014 then don\u2019t say anything at all. It\u2019s simply not a humane reaction to reading that Glamour piece to say \u201cWhen reproductive rights are in danger, it\u2019s on all of us to join the fight.\u201d Michael Wear, who did faith-based outreach in the Barack Obama administration, has written that the Democratic party needs to express some moral lament about abortion. Tweets like Booker\u2019s and Warren\u2019s seem to do the very opposite.\n\nBecause abortion has become so core to the Democrats, it probably was a little brave for Booker even to acknowledge the existence of men in the scenario \u2014 and some responses to the tweet expressed outrage that he, without a uterus, would share an article that included testimony from a man who wished his girlfriend had consulted him before getting an abortion. There was some real human misery revealed in the Glamour piece.\n\nThe testimonies in the piece run the gamut. One man even expressed his belief that \u201cabortion is wrong.\u201d He regretted that his girlfriend didn\u2019t talk to him before getting an abortion. He said, in part:\n\nI\u2019m hurt that that baby never had a chance. I\u2019m hurt that my girlfriend thought that was the right decision to make, especially without consulting with me. Because even though America says this is a women\u2019s issue, it\u2019s as much a man\u2019s issue because it takes a man and a woman to make a baby. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re both going to carry the rest of our lives, the memory of what could have happened. I think about that baby \u2014 not, like, every day or every week \u2014 but I think about that baby a lot.\n\nAnd there\u2019s also this in the feature:\n\nIt was so scary through the whole process. Getting the sonogram and seeing that she was actually pregnant, [I was] more sentimental than I thought I would get about it. Seeing that life that\u2019s there, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier than we thought it was going to be. A lot of old-school tropes really came into play, like, Are we killing this kid?\n\nAnd:\n\nOne of the little things that starts to get to you is all the thoughts of what could have been with the baby. In your brain, you know this isn\u2019t the right time. In your heart, you start imagining and dreaming about what could have been.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a description of a child who was delivered and left to die. It\u2019s an excruciating story to read. A woman who identifies as a man tells of being gang-raped \u2014 what was called a \u201ccorrective\u201d rape by the cruel perpetrators. The point is that these are piercing stories, some of them. Even the shortest reflection, a seemingly callous remark, appeared to betray an impact the speaker couldn\u2019t quite communicate.\n\nIt is not only politically unwise to ignore this, but it\u2019s as if we\u2019ve aborted our human compassion, any sense of empathy, and any reverence for human life to read those stories and simply go on as is, with our same old miserable, intractable abortion politics. George Mason University law professor Helen Alvar\u00e9 uses the word \u201cimmiseration\u201d to describe what abortion has done to women; it\u2019s also a cultural condition. And so, of course, we would see it on social media, which has been known to exacerbate some of our worst tendencies. But we can and need to do better. And even if Cory Booker \u2014 or his staff person who thought that tweet was a good idea \u2014 missed the humanity bleeding all over the Glamour piece, he managed to prompt a much-needed reflection.\n\nThis column is based on one available through Andrews McMeel Universal\u2019s Newspaper Enterprise Association.", "description": "In his party-line tweet about an article in Glamour magazine, Cory Booker managed to prompt a much needed reflection.", "authors": ["Kathryn Jean Lopez", "Matthew Continetti", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Rich Lowry", "Ben Shapiro", "Dan Mclaughlin", "Kevin D.
