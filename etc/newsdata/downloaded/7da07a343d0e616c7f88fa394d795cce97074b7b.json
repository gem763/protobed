Only a few hours earlier everything had been perfect.\n\n\"I can just remember my mum turning to me and saying to me 'you do understand what they are saying don\u2019t you?'.\n\n\"But I was 20 and a first-time mum. I thought I would give birth to him and they would work on him to make sure he was okay.\n\n\"Then we would go home and start our life together as a family.\"\n\nOn May 14, 2011, Francesca gave birth to Franklynn at 2am. He weighed eight pounds and eight ounces.\n\nShe said: \"I stayed in the Snowdrop Suite with my mum and my sister and my ex-husband Chris. The nurses were amazing and took handprints and footprints of Franklynn for us to keep and gave us a memory box.\n\n\"They were brilliant, caring and compassionate and just trying to make the best out of a bad situation.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\n\"It was all such a blur but they were so good and explained to me what had happened.\n\n\"I was eight days overdue and the placenta had started to come away from the wall. Where blood would normally trickle down, mine had clotted and my placenta had stopped working.\n\n\"When I told the doctors I was still feeling movements they think it was him passing away that sent me into labour.\"\n\nThe tragedy had a shattering impact on Francesca and her whole family.\n\nShe said: \"My sister took it really hard. It was tough on her because she was a midwife at the hospital but she was on maternity leave with her own baby.\n\n\"When she went back to work she found it really difficult to be near the snowdrop suite.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t know anything about the suite before but it was invaluable and so precious to us at that time.\n\n\"All our family was able to come and meet Franklynn and we had a vicar who came and blessed him. It was nice to have our own space when so much was going on.\n\n\"We have since raised money for a cuddle cot (a special basket that preserves stillborns) at the hospital, as our way of saying thank you.\"\n\nFrancesca said she purposely stayed away from her family home for weeks after Franklynn\u2019s death, taking up her mum's offer to stay with her and have a holiday away while she tried to come to terms with her grief.\n\nShe said: \"We stayed with Franklynn for as long as we could, but he was deteriorating and we didn\u2019t want to remember him like that.\n\n\"Leaving him was the hardest part. I visited him every day at the funeral directors and sat with my little baby boy.\n\n\"They wanted to give him a post-mortem but I couldn\u2019t bear to put him through that, not after everything.\n\n\"He was perfect. There was nothing wrong with him except that he had been starved of oxygen.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t go home for a few weeks. It was just too painful.\n\nWhere to get help If this story has affected you, please reach out for help from the following organisations.

When we left for the hospital we put his steriliser out on the side and his bottles were ready for when we bought him home.\n\n\"Luckily by the time I got home from holiday someone had moved all the baby stuff from the house, which I am glad about because I know I couldn't face it.\n\n\"One of the most shocking things was that, even though I was 20, I was lucky enough to have never really experienced death, so having to plan my own son's funeral was so hard.\n\n\"We asked everyone to wear blue and yellow and we made it a celebration in honour of all the birthday parties he would never have.\"\n\nFrancesca, who now lives in Nottingham with her husband Robert and daughter Anise, six, has recently found out she is expecting another son - a thought which filled her with both happiness and worry.\n\nShe said: \"My husband Rob and I have been trying for years to have a baby and we were starting to give up hope.\n\n\"We got married in May, came back from our honeymoon and got a nice surprise.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\n\"It has been a scary time as I have been diagnosed with type-one diabetes, but since I found out I was having a boy I have been fraught with worry.\n\n\"What happened with Franklynn stays with me every day, but it makes it so hard to enjoy pregnancy. You just want everything to be okay.\n\n\"I had reduced movements with my daughter and I knew I was becoming unwell. I can remember crying in the hospital saying 'please, don\u2019t make me leave until she is here and she was delivered at 37 weeks'.\n\n\"She was perfect but I wouldn\u2019t believe it until she was in my arms.\n\n\"Franklynn will always be my first baby and I will never get over it, how can I? But I will always remember him, love him and treasure the time I had with him, thanks to the Snowdrop Suite.\"", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Francesca Arnold, 29, was desperate to welcome her first child into the world but her pregnancy ended in heartache", "authors": ["Rhea Turner", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737884.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196859567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
