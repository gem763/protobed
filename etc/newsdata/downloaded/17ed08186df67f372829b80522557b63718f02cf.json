The Buccaneers, with a timeout in hand, were then penalized 5 yards for delay of game before Gay's narrow miss to the right.\n\nPATRIOTS RECEIVER JULIAN EDELMAN LEAVES WITH CHEST INJURY\n\nBuccaneers coach Bruce Arians explained afterward that he deliberately took the penalty, making Gay attempt the would-be game-winning field goal from 34 yards instead of 29.\n\n\u201cI just took it on purpose. He\u2019s better back there. That field goal is easier back 5 yards,\u201d Arians told reporters. \u201cWe wanted to move the ball, put it in the middle and make it easier.\u201d\n\nGay was 4-for-5 on field goals and 1-for-3 on extra-point attempts.\n\nELI MANNING'S REACTION TO REPLACEMENT QUARTERBACK DANIEL JONES GOES VIRAL\n\nThe Giants got the win behind Daniel Jones\u2019 gutsy first start. He was 23-for-36 with 336 passing yards and two touchdown passes. He added two rushing touchdowns as well.\n\nTampa Bay\u2019s Jameis Winston had three touchdown passes of his own \u2013 all to wide receiver Mike Evans.\n\nThe Buccaneers fell to 1-2 on the season with the loss.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Giants improved to 1-2 with the win.", "description": "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were narrowly defeated by the New York Giants after kicker Matt Gay missed a long field goal that would have won them the game.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
