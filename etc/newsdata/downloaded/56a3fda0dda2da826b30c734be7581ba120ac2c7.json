His wife, Jane Sanders, says he is doing \u201creally well,\u201d and there is no indication that more serious health problems are involved. But this is obviously news his supporters don\u2019t want to hear. Do you have an initial sense of how the incident will affect his campaign?\n\nGabriel: We have no idea how this will affect the campaign, and I\u2019m not sure the campaign does yet, either. In terms of the short-term mechanics, we know Sanders has canceled his upcoming events, and his campaign has postponed its big recent ad buy in Iowa, which was supposed to be a big moment for it. Obviously this isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019d caution against drawing too many conclusions here.\n\nPurely in terms of political momentum, you clearly don\u2019t want your candidate off the trail and off the air at an important moment. But I\u2019m pretty sure most Democratic voters understand the circumstances.\n\nBen: Voters may understand that Bernie is old, but Joe Biden is the candidate whose age has been more front and center as a possible drawback. Bernie, while older than Biden, has maintained a breakneck campaign schedule and has appeared not to lose a step in the process. Won\u2019t this put a pretty major dent in that image?\n\nGabriel: What I meant isn\u2019t that voters understand his age, but that they understand there\u2019s a completely understandable reason for his absence from the trail. I don\u2019t want to speculate too much on the potential political fallout here because we just don\u2019t have any idea what the prognosis is, what Sanders\u2019s plan is, or, really, anything. I\u2019d love more information, but clearly the people around him are being very cautious, and that\u2019s extremely understandable. I\u2019m happy to engage more directly with part of the question, though. Not only has Sanders had a breakneck campaign schedule in 2019, he\u2019s had a basically insane schedule since late 2015. He\u2019s been traveling the country more or less nonstop, and his stamina on the trail has always impressed his aides and the reporters who follow him.\n\nBen: Indeed, I\u2019ve seen some testaments to that on Twitter.\n\nGabriel: I can attest to it personally!\n\nBen: Elizabeth Warren tweeted: \u201cMy friend @sensanders has always been a strong partner in the Senate. Wishing him a speedy recovery so he can get back in the fight.\u201d Presumably rival candidates will tread extremely carefully around this news.\n\nGabriel: Of course. I\u2019ve seen similar tweets or statements from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Yang, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tom Steyer, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, Tim Ryan, Joe Sestak, Tulsi Gabbard, and John Delaney. And, by the way, Trump\u2019s reelection communications director Tim Murtaugh, too. There\u2019s no realistic world in which candidates try to make political hay out of this moment.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss the possible ramifications of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s heart procedure and temporary campaign suspension.", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti", "Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/02/02-bernie-sanders-2.w1200.h630.jpg"}
