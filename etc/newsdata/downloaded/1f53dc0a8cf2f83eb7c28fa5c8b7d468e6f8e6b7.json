I thought that was fantastic from England.'\n\nAccording to World Rugby rules, teams must stand at least 10 metres apart during the Haka performance. However, this was introduced as a safeguard after several attempts to unnerve the All Blacks in years gone by.\n\nOwen Farrell smiling at the haka will age brilliantly.

However, other international commentators at the Rugby World Cup said England should have been allowed to express themselves however they wanted in response to the All Blacks' traditional war cry challenge.\n\nWhile New Zealand were the favourites to retain the World Cup in Japan this year, England's bullish display before the Haka appears to have had an immediate impact, as they made a lightning-fast start in Yokohama.\n\nEddie Jones' men made a stunning start to the semi-final as Manu Tuilagi raced through a horde of Kiwi bodies after a ruck to score a try after 98 seconds, with Owen Farrell converting to set England up for a 7-0 lead. A penalty from George Ford put England in command at the break to lead 10-0, before extending their advantage with another shortly after.\n\nArdie Savea eventually broke England's resistance with a try minutes later to give the Kiwis hope, but further heroics from Ford from the tee gave New Zealand a tough task as England held on for a famous win.\n\nThe haka tactic came just days after Irish fans caused a stir during the pre-game shenanigans.\n\nAs the All Blacks began their ceremonial war cry, Irish fans were heard blaring the lyrics to folk ballad The Fields Of Athenry.\n\nFans had a mixed reaction to the move and took to Twitter saying the English should have either moved or didn't.\n\nGo back over the halfway line England. Don\u2019t be silly. #haka #ENGvNZ \u2014 Ceri Gould Thomas (@CeriGould) October 26, 2019\n\nWhy were the officials asking the @EnglandRugby boys to back off during the Haka?? As long as they\u2019re not wading in and throwing fists they can stand how and where they want surely? #NZLvENG #RWC19 \u2014 Mike White (@mikewhitesport) October 26, 2019\n\nThere's no way the officials should be telling England where to stand. In just the same way they don't tell New Zealand - \"you can't start the Haka yet - we aren't ready\". \u2014 Matthew Pinsent (@matthewcpinsent) October 26, 2019\n\nThis is class, love teams engaging with the Haka.
