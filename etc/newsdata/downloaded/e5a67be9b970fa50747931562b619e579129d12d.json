Speaking to IGN, the film\u2019s songwriter Kiristen Anderson-Lopez said that Elsa won\u2019t be romantically linked to any character in the sequel.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The 30 best Disney films Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 30 best Disney films 1/30 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. 2/30 29. Bambi (1942) Bambi isn\u2019t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it\u2019s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to \u201cApril Showers\u201d. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi\u2019s mother? Rex Features 3/30 28. Pocahontas (1995) Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney\u2019s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. Rex Features 4/30 27. The Aristocats (1971) The film may be relatively light on story (it\u2019s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there\u2019s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It\u2019s true what they say: \u201cEverybody wants to be a cat.\u201d Rex Features 5/30 26. Robin Hood (1973) In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It\u2019s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that\u2019s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book. Rex Features 6/30 25. Zootopia (2016) It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn\u2019t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it\u2019s as funny as you\u2019d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted. Rex Features 7/30 24. Dumbo (1941) Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There\u2019s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in \u201cBaby Mine\u201d (a scene that\u2019s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there\u2019s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary \u201cPink Elephants on Parade\u201d sequence. 8/30 23. Tangled (2010) Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what\u2019s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: \u201cI See the Light\u201d, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It\u2019s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. Rex Features 9/30 22. Princess and the Frog (2009) Disney\u2019s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There\u2019s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number \u201cAlmost There\u201d. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That\u2019s something to celebrate. Rex Features 10/30 21. Cinderella (1950) Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn\u2019t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There\u2019s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella\u2019s magical soiree. Rex Features 11/30 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there\u2019s still something irresistibly delightful about her \u201cPatsy from Ab Fab\u201d combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d with the line: \"Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.\u201d Rex Features 12/30 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955) One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn\u2019t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous \u201cBella Notte\u201d scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime. Rex Features 13/30 18. Moana (2016) Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa'i helped create the soundtrack\u2019s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour \u2013 more of this in the future please, Disney. Rex Features 14/30 17. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) The Emperor\u2019s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo & Stitch, it\u2019s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor\u2019s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (\u201cPull the lever, Kronk!\u201d) Disney film that \u2013 most importantly \u2013 finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. Disney 15/30 16. Frozen (2013) It may be every modern parent\u2019s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you\u2019ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel\u2019s rendition of \u201cLet it Go\u201d is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. Rex Features 16/30 15. Peter Pan (1953) A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and divorce don\u2019t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn\u2019t quite speak our language. 17/30 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) It\u2019s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There\u2019s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White\u2019s aid during \u201cWhistle While You Work\u201d, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: \u201cMagic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.\u201d Rex Features 18/30 13. Hercules (1997) A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy \u201cZero to Hero\u201d. That said, Megara\u2019s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her \u201cI\u2019m a damsel. I\u2019m in distress. I can handle this\u201d routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Rex Features 19/30 12. Mulan (1998) Let them deny it all they want, but you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn\u2019t secretly put \u201cI\u2019ll Make a Man Out of You\u201d on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan\u2019s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. Rex Features 20/30 11. The Jungle Book (1967) As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney\u2019s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into \u201cThe Bear Necessities\u201d, it feels very much like someone\u2019s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything\u2019s going to be alright. Rex Features 21/30 10. Aladdin (1992) Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams\u2019s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. Rex Features 22/30 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951) Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney\u2019s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn\u2019t get lost in Lewis Caroll\u2019s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn\u2019s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there\u2019s no denying its status as a cult classic now. Rex Features 23/30 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There\u2019s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption \u2013 take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it\u2019s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film\u2019s PG rating. Rex Features 24/30 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002) Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo & Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch\u2019s more unusual characteristics, and you\u2019ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It\u2019s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. Rex Features 25/30 6. Pinocchio (1940) This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting \u201cWhen You Wish Upon a Star\u201d \u2013 the song that best captures Walt Disney\u2019s dream \u2013 aside for a moment, let\u2019s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. \u201cBe virtuous or you\u2019ll be turned into a literal donkey,\u201d was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It\u2019s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney\u2019s early years. Rex Features 26/30 5. The Little Mermaid (1989) We\u2019re free to question Ariel\u2019s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel\u2019s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d is such a party tune. Rex Features 27/30 4. Sleeping Beauty (1959) Sleeping Beauty is Disney\u2019s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it\u2019s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? Rex Features 28/30 3. Fantasia (1940) One of Disney\u2019s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey\u2019s appearance in The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them \u2013 the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. Rex Features 29/30 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991) If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly \u201ca tale as old as time\u201d, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Rex Features 30/30 1. The Lion King (1994) Produced at the height of Disney\u2019s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to \u201cCircle of Life\u201d, you can\u2019t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there\u2019s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 1/30 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. 2/30 29. Bambi (1942) Bambi isn\u2019t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it\u2019s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to \u201cApril Showers\u201d. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi\u2019s mother? Rex Features 3/30 28. Pocahontas (1995) Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney\u2019s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. Rex Features 4/30 27.

A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey\u2019s appearance in The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them \u2013 the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. Rex Features 29/30 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991) If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly \u201ca tale as old as time\u201d, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Rex Features 30/30 1. The Lion King (1994) Produced at the height of Disney\u2019s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to \u201cCircle of Life\u201d, you can\u2019t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there\u2019s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time.\n\nWhile this suggests that Disney might reveal Elsa to be openly lesbian in a future instalment, it won\u2019t be happening in the new film.\n\nThe campaign to make Elsa Disney\u2019s first LGBTQ+ princess began in 2016. Named #GiveElsaAGirlfriend, it hoped to encourage the studio to improve representation in its movies.\n\n\u201cI love everything people are saying and people are thinking about with our film,\u201d co-director Jennifer Lee said in response.\n\nFrozen was widely praised as being one of the studio\u2019s most LGBT-friendly productions yet. Mindhunter star Jonathan Groff is Disney Animation\u2019s first openly gay actor to play the protagonist\u2019s love interest, while character Oaken (Chris Williams) is arguably the studio\u2019s most visible LGBT character, thanks to a brief shot in the film of what appears to be his husband and children.\n\nFrozen 2 arrives in UK cinemas on 27 November 2019.", "description": "Following the release of Frozen 2\u2018s trailer earlier this year, many believed that a mysterious new female character could have been Disney\u2019s response to the fan campaign to make Elsa\u00a0the studio\u2019s first LGBTQ+\u00a0princess.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/09/frozen-elsa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
