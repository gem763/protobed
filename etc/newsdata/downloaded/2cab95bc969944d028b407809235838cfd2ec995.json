Newton's 2019 debut looked a lot like 2018 finish", "language": "en", "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Cam Newton admitted he was a \u201clittle rusty\u201d coming off a shoulder injury that ended last season early.\n\nBut Newton\u2019s season debut Sunday raised questions about whether this was rust or a carryover from 2018, when the shoulder problem turned the 2015 league MVP into a shell of his former self.\n\nLos Angeles linebacker Clay Matthews said the Rams came into the game expecting \u201cMVP Cam.\u201d\n\nInstead, they got the watered-down version.\n\nSimilar to the second half of last season, Newton didn\u2019t throw the ball downfield much in Carolina\u2019s 30-27 loss to the Rams. His longest completion went for 17 yards. His one attempt at a semi-deep pass - about 30 yards through the air - sailed over the head of wide receiver Curtis Samuel.\n\nAnd Newton the runner was nonexistent.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s third all-time leading rusher among QBs was held to a career-low minus-2 yards on three carries. The Panthers only called one designed run for the 30-year-old Newton, a quarterback draw. That\u2019s uncharacteristic for a player who has made a living off the zone read option and who has more touchdowns rushing than any QB in NFL history.\n\nHe didn\u2019t scramble much and was sacked three times, losing 23 yards.\n\nNewton said after the game he never thought about his surgically repaired right shoulder during the game. He practiced all last week and was not listed on the injury report after suffering a mid-foot sprain in the team\u2019s third preseason game, so that was believed to be a non-factor, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get on the same page with everybody,\u201d Newton said. \u201cBut, all in all, we had our opportunities today. I think that\u2019s the most frustrating part. Because you feel this is your time.\u201d\n\nNewton hadn\u2019t played since Dec. 17, sitting out the final two games when it became apparent he couldn\u2019t throw the ball more than 20 yards downfield.\n\nHe showed he could air it out in training camp with a handful of 40- and 50-yard passes, but that was without pass rushers racing his way. Despite having a speedy crop of young wide receivers that includes D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel, Newton elected not to test the deep waters, although coaches insist he has that opportunity if he wants it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into no philosophical discussion about throwing the ball downfield because that\u2019s not what this game is about,\u201d Newton said. \u201cI took what the defense gives me. I go through the specific reads in a timely manner. You don\u2019t call plays. You don\u2019t say to coach, \u2018Hey coach, let\u2019s throw the ball deep and see where that gets us.\u2019 That\u2019s not our mentality.\u201d\n\nNewton finished 25 of 38 for 239 yards against the Rams, but he had a backward pass to Moore that resulted in a fumble inside the Panthers 10-yard line, and an ill-timed interception with 5:55 left in the game on a pass attempt to tight end Greg Olsen. The defender on the play, linebacker Cory Littleton, called Newton \u201creadable\u201d - and that he read him well.\n\nPanthers coach Ron Rivera said Newton \u201chad his moments.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day when you get opportunities you have to capitalize,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nCarolina\u2019s loss overshadowed an impressive outing from Christian McCaffrey, who looked extremely fast while racking up 128 yards rushing and two touchdowns on 19 carries and 81 yards on 10 receptions.\n\n\u201cI think offensively as a group, outside of Christian, we have a lot of work to do,\u201d tight end Greg Olsen said.\n\nNewton remains confident he will bounce back Thursday night against Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cI have to settle in,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of first-game jitters, so to speak. All in all, we know what we have to do, and for it to be so fresh on our minds, I know exactly we\u2019ll be better from it.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s not, the Panthers could be in for a difficult season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cam Newton admitted he was a \"little rusty\" coming off a shoulder injury that ended last season early.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/rams_panthers_football_66706_c0-98-2345-1465_s1770x1032.jpg?f72c27f83b611650d85fc9d674cc83ff0aba4299", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
