The two leaders had previously been expected to meet in Washington sometime in the coming weeks.\n\nDespite Trump's praise for Turkey's contribution to the F-35, the White House on July 17 decided to expel Turkey from the program after Ankara bought and received a Russian air defense system. Washington had warned Turkey for months that the S-400 system was incompatible with the stealth jet.\n\nThe president\u2019s ardent defense of the U.S.-Turkey partnership came after the White House late Sunday announced that Trump had spoken by phone with Erdogan about the planned Turkish incursion into northern Syria, which prominent lawmakers of both parties pilloried Monday.\n\nBut Trump has so far stood behind the administration\u2019s plan of action, citing his campaign trail pledge to extricate American soldiers from \u201cendless wars\u201d and threatening to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Erdogan\u2019s government \u201cdoes anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits.\u201d\n\nThe president insisted Tuesday that America\u2019s support for its Kurdish allies would continue as U.S. troops withdraw from Syria, and again cautioned Turkey against instigating conflict in the region.\n\n\u201cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters. Likewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and Trading partner, has been very good,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cTurkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully \u2026 understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\u201d\n\nDavid Brown contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b6/8f/b6f10ce0466d88ec0e289cab9da8/191008-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
