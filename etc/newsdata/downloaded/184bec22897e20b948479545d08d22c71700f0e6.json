He said both sides needed to \u201cde-escalate, de-conflict ... Extinguish the fire\u201d and \u201cmake peace\u201d.\n\nWhen the news broke he warned Mr Netanyahu\u2019s action would constitute a war crime.\n\n\u201cIf Prime Minister Netanyahu is allowed to implement his plans of annexation, he would have succeeded in burying even any chance of peace between Palestinians and Israelis,\u201d Mr Erekat said.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s unprecedented culture of impunity, enabled by international inaction, is the only explanation for Mr Netanyahu\u2019s audacity in using annexation as an election ploy,\u201d he added, calling on the international community to block the Israeli leader\u2019s plan.\n\nMr Netanyahu\u2019s announcement was rejected by his political opponents in the upcoming elections who accused him of trying to secure last-minute votes.\n\nThe Blue and White party, the toughest rivals to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, criticised him for dragging the residents of the Jordan Valley into a \u201cpropaganda\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cBlue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley is a part of Israel forever. Netanyahu drafted a plan to cede the Jordan Valley in 2014. We are happy that Netanyahu has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognise the Jordan Valley. The relationship between Israel and the United States is founded upon common interests and values and it is stronger than any prime minister.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s spin to the people of Israel will end on 17 September.\u201d\n\nAvigdor Leiberman, head of the Yisrael Beiteinu party and Mr Netanyahu\u2019s former defence minister, meanwhile tweeted \u201cdramatic announcement\u201d with two laughing emoticons.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0has promised to\u00a0annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank if he is elected next week, an explosive move that he hinted was supported by Donald Trump.
