Read more\n\nThe revelation has further intensified demand among Democrats for the president to be impeached.\n\nAs news of Trump\u2019s personal intervention broke, an influential group of seven Democrats, all first-term members of Congress with military or national security backgrounds, said that \u201cif true\u201d, the president\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine, Joe Biden and the former vice-president\u2019s son Hunter would \u201crepresent an impeachable offense\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday the Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, a member of the foreign relations committee, also backed impeachment for the first time.\n\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has previously resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings, will hold meetings with key committee chairs on Tuesday.\n\nTrump will address the United Nations General Assembly in New York but his remarks \u2013 which he has said will include a focus on Iran \u2013 are likely to be overshadowed by the roiling scandal.\n\nIf a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did \u2026 they\u2019d be getting the electric chair by right Donald Trump\n\nThe Washington Post first reported Trump\u2019s freezing of $391m in aid to Ukraine. Trump ordered acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, it said, to suspend the almost $400m payment \u201cat least a week\u201d before the 25 July call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens \u2013 eight times, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBiden is the frontrunner to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The president has confirmed that he discussed corruption during the call, and said he mentioned Biden, but denies applying pressure.\n\nHe has also said there was no quid pro quo, although at the UN on Monday he told reporters: \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nIt emerged recently that a US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump\u2019s behaviour in the matter.\n\nThe White House is refusing to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a showdown with Congress.\n\nThe chairs of three House committees are threatening to subpoena Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, if he does not produce information about whether Trump and his personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, inappropriately tried to influence the government of Ukraine.\n\nThe committees first asked for the documents two weeks ago. Joseph Maguire, Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence, is refusing to release the whistleblower complaint.\n\nGiuliani has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens.\n\nBefore the Post reported Trump\u2019s orders regarding aid to Ukraine, the president was defiant, lashing out at media coverage of the scandal.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn\u2019t want to report it because they\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cIf a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair by right. Look at the double standards \u2026 You\u2019ve got a lot of crooked journalists. You\u2019re crooked as hell.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of corruption in the Ukraine by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nThe US began providing military aid to Ukraine shortly after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. With Ukraine\u2019s new president still grappling with separatist rebels in the east, the aid has long been viewed as a measure of Washington\u2019s determination to push back against Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nOur fundamental duty is to make sure we\u2019re doing what we need to do to defend the country Jason Crow\n\nTrump has denied that any requests for help in procuring damaging information about Biden were tied to the aid freeze.\n\nTrump\u2019s vague claims of wrongdoing, echoed by rightwing media, concern Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. As vice-president, Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire its prosecutor general, seen by many as too soft on corruption. Trump has asserted without basis that the prosecutor, who had led an investigation into the company\u2019s owner, \u201cwas after\u201d Hunter Biden.\n\nThe seven new Democrats, all with military and national security backgrounds, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed: \u201cThese allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.\u201d\n\nThe representatives are centrists who won previously Republican-held districts where Trump has been popular, victories key to the Democrats retaking the House last year. They are therefore influential with party leadership.\n\nThe Trump-Ukraine scandal is a taste of how dirty the US elections will get | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\n\u201cOur fundamental duty is to make sure we\u2019re doing what we need to do to defend the country,\u201d Jason Crow, a Colorado congressman, former army ranger and a co-signatory to the column, told CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe need to see the complaint. The intelligence community has to give it out.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Murphy said he \u201chad resisted calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, choosing instead to allow the House to consider its options free from senatorial advice.\n\n\u201cBut circumstances have changed, and the seriousness of the moment requires all of us to speak out in order to preserve our nation\u2019s commitment to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nAnother sign of building momentum for impeachment came on Sunday, from the chair of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff. He told CNN: \u201cWe may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s committee will host Maguire in an open hearing on Thursday.\n\nIf Democrats do go ahead, there is virtually no prospect of the Republican-controlled Senate convicting and removing the president before the 2020 election.", "description": "President ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid days before he pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt", "David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aebc5309c188a4c38c1d21647c6553b00501c4f7/0_0_4406_2643/master/4406.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4acdb8db3f8b50ce4187d0f81040e680", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
