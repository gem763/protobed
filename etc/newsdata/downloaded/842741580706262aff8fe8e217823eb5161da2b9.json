Lawrence Culp, Jr., chairman and CEO of GE, told FOX Business in an emailed statement. \u201cBut this is market manipulation \u2013 pure and simple. Mr. Markopolos\u2019s report contains false statements of fact, and these claims could have been corrected if he had checked them with GE before publishing the report.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg GE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY 8.25 +0.14 +1.73%\n\n\u201cThe fact that he wrote a 170-page paper but never talked to company officials goes to show that he is not interested in accurate financial analysis, but solely in generating downward volatility in GE stock so that he and his undisclosed hedge fund partner can personally profit,\u201d Culp added. After the closing bell, Culp shelled out nearly $2 million for 252,000 shares of GE stock.\n\nHarry Markopolos alleged Thursday in a more than 170-page report posted online that the battered American industrial icon has hidden its problems through fraudulent financial filings with regulators, The Wall Street Journal reports. GE shares tumbled in morning trading.\n\nMarkopolos -- who flagged Bernie Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme to authorities two years before it came crashing down, but was ignored -- believes GE\u2019s accounting missteps total $38 billion, or 40 percent of the company\u2019s market value, according to the WSJ. In February, he said he was investigating three multibillion-dollar schemes, one of which was bigger than Madoff's.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeslie Seidman, GE Director and chair of Audit Committee also told FOX Business in an emailed statement that Markopolos\u2019 accusations aren\u2019t accurate.\n\n\u201cThe report contains numerous novel interpretations and downright mistakes about the actual accounting requirements, making his conclusions about GE\u2019s reporting questionable at best,\u201d Seidman said. \u201cIn his own words, he stands to personally financially benefit from today\u2019s significant market reaction to his report, and he is selectively front-running widely reported regulatory processes and rigorous investigations without the benefit of any access to GE\u2019s books and records. I urge readers to carefully consider the motivation behind this report as well as the reliability of the analysis underlying his opinions.\u201d\n\nMarkopolos did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe battered company, once an industrial icon, is in the midst of trying to engineer a turnaround after last year shares lost more than half their value amid a slew of problems.\n\nGE's Troubled Timeline:\n\n2018:\n\n2019:\n\nJanuary: GE altered its agreement with the rail-transport company Wabtec in order to receive $2.9 billion of cash in exchange for giving up more equity.\n\nMarch: Warns it could have a negative free cash flow of up to $2 billion this year.\n\nJune: Reports strong first-quarter results, bolstered by its aviation unit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nGE shares have gained 24 percent this year.\n\n*The story was updated to reflect Culp's stock purchase.", "description": "The man who took down Madoff believes GE\u2019s accounting missteps total $38 billion, or 40 percent of the company\u2019s market value", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/GE-Markopolos-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
