It\u2019s a crowded field full of big names, and it\u2019s going to take real work and creativity if anyone wants to stand out from the melee. But luckily Pete Buttigieg knows exactly how to do this: by targeting his campaign hard towards fans of Rebel Wilson.\n\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Buttigieg laid out his pop culture favourites for all the world to see. He watches Rick and Morty to fall asleep, for example, and he\u2019s trying to get on board with Succession, except \u201cI haven\u2019t decided if any of them are good people\u201d. But when asked about the last film he saw theatrically, he stalled before eventually admitting it was Isn\u2019t It Romantic or, as he called it, \u201cThat movie where the lady wakes up and she\u2019s in a romantic comedy\u201d.\n\n'A brutal dinner': celebrities talk about meeting Donald Trump Read more\n\nSee, Rebel Wilson fans? Pete Buttigieg is just like you. Sure, he might not have known Rebel Wilson\u2019s name, or the film\u2019s name. And he may not have expressed any sort of opinion about the content of the film. But, really, who has? By half-remembering that he went to see a mediocre Rebel Wilson film eight months ago, Buttigieg has only managed to align with himself with the general public. Maybe we all saw Isn\u2019t It Romantic in February and can\u2019t really remember anything about it? How would he know?\n\nSo know that we know as much about Pete Buttigieg as we could ever hope to know, what about the other candidates? What do their pop culture preferences tell us about them? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nIn 2016, Joe Biden dropped a Spotify playlist that is full of exactly the sort of music you\u2019d pick if you didn\u2019t actually like music but wanted the world to think that you did. Bruce Springsteen is on there. The Beatles are on there. The Best by Tina Turner is on there. My Way is on there. It\u2019s less a curated playlist and more the results you\u2019d get if you spent half an hour Shazaming in the world\u2019s most dismal karaoke bar. He also once told reporters that he tried to keep up with Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, so clearly the man is not to be trusted.\n\nCory Booker\n\nCory Booker describes himself as \u201ca movie addict\u201d, so it only goes without saying that two of his favourite films are little-known gems Rocky and Star Wars. In other media, Booker earns points for expressing his fondness for Black Mirror \u2013 which he watched with Rosario Dawson \u2013 but then loses twice as many for putting Michael Jackson songs on a publicly available Spotify playlist in the year 2019.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nIn January, Harris made a web-only video for Stephen Colbert\u2019s late night show, where she claimed that she loved to dance to Check the Rhime by A Tribe called Quest. To prove this, she then danced even though the song wasn\u2019t actually playing, which is something a sociopath would do. She also once claimed that she listened to Tupac at college, and says that My Cousin Vinny is her favourite film. All her choices, in all media, come from between 1991 and 1993. The woman lives in the past. She\u2019s the Uncle Rico of the 2020 presidential race.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Robert F Bukaty/AP\n\nBeto\u2019s music we all know about, because he never shuts up about it. He was in a band with one of At the Drive-In, and once made a widely respected DC Hardcore playlist. But what of his other pop culture touchstones? This is much harder to ascertain. In a TV interview in June, he said that he preferred Ryan Gosling to Ryan Reynolds, so let\u2019s assume he\u2019s a big fan of The Notebook.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nThe good thing about Bernie having progressed to the latter stages of a leadership race once before is that he\u2019s already been run through the pop culture mill. There isn\u2019t a thing about his tastes that we don\u2019t already know. Favourite music? He has all of Beethoven\u2019s symphonies on his iPad, but he also likes Abba. He claims that he likes Modern Family and in 2016 called The Big Short an \u201cexcellent film\u201d which isn\u2019t much of a surprise, at least.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nElizabeth Warren likes Ballers. Doesn\u2019t matter about anything else \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter about the music she listens to or the books she reads or the policies she endorses \u2013 because she likes Ballers. She\u2019s spoken on podcasts about her love of Ballers. She commented on the 2017 WGA negotiations by telling everyone how much she likes Ballers. She tweets to The Rock about her love of Ballers. Warren has no political motivation to say that she likes Ballers. There isn\u2019t a hidden army of Ballers fans who\u2019ll carry her to the White House if she panders to them enough. She just likes Ballers. She\u2019s the only person in the world who likes Ballers. A woman who can stick up for something as patently rubbish as Ballers deserves to be given the world on a plate. Long may she reign.", "description": "After Pete Buttigieg revealed his affection for Rebel Wilson comedies, what can we learn from the film, music and TV choices of the other presidential possibilities?", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213a425efabf0bf1637b010ceebf4d95bc5a384f/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ceaeceaf5b9f8d6475d93a0e011f0e5"}
