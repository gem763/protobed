Members can set up monitoring traps to catch them and trace their nest.\u201d\n\nAs well as bees, Asian hornets can be a danger to humans who are intolerant to hornet venom.\n\nLast year a resident on Jersey nearly died from anaphylactic shock when the vibration caused by him pruning a hedge disturbed a nest and led to him being stung.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIvor Kemp, from East Dorset Be Keepers Association, said: \u201cWe re asking all our members must take proactive steps now. At the moment the hornets are extremely interested in the ivy that is now in season.\n\n\u201cIf people have ivy in their garden they should play close attention and watch what is flying around it.\n\n\u201cMembers can set up monitoring traps to catch them and trace their nest.\n\n\u201cWe strongly advise that action is taken all over.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are huge risks associated with Asian hornets which have been demonstrated in France where they have devastated the honey bee population.\u201d", "description": "The hornets, which decapitate up to 50 bees a day then take the bodies back to their nests, have been causing chaos in Britain since 2004", "authors": ["Josh Layton", "Image", "Jersey Evening Post", "Swns", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524921.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SWNS_JERSEY_HORNETS_05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
