The most important thing is prevention.\"\n\nFour corporations were also being investigated, he added.\n\nLast week, Indonesia sealed off dozens of plantations where smog-belching fires were blazing, and warned that owners -- including Malaysia and Singapore-based firms -- could face criminal charges if there was evidence of illegal burning.\n\nSome of the most serious fires occur in peatlands, which are highly combustible when drained of water to be converted into agricultural plantations.\n\nThick haze in Borneo -- where air quality levels have plummeted to \"dangerous\" levels in some areas -- caused the cancellation of about a dozen flights Sunday, national airline Garuda said.\n\nRival Lion Air said about 160 Borneo flights had been affected at the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 150,000 people have been treated for acute respiratory infections linked to the haze in recent months, according to Indonesian health authorities.\n\nWhile forest fires are an annual problem, the situation this year has been worsened by drier weather in Indonesia, with diplomatic tensions soaring as toxic smog drifts over to neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nThe haze pushed Singapore's air quality to unhealthy levels for the first time in three years at the weekend.\n\nIn 2015, Indonesia suffered its worst forest fires for almost two decades, which dramatically increased its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHuge fires tearing through the Amazon are also compounding concerns about the long-term impact of such blazes on keeping global temperature levels stable.", "description": "Indonesia has arrested nearly 200 people over vast forest fires ripping across the archipelago, police said Monday, as toxic haze sends air quality levels plummeting and sparks flight cancellations.
