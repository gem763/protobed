It would not be right for us to forget it.\"\n\nThe October 9 letter demanded that Erdo\u011fan call off his invasion of northern Syria, warning that he would be viewed as \u201cthe devil\u201d in history if \u201cgood things don\u2019t happen.\u201d It came after Trump had already received bipartisan and widespread backlash for pulling U.S. troops out of the region, smoothing the way for the incursion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d Trump penned. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s threats referred to sanctions the Treasury Department previously imposed on senior Turkish officials for the detention of an American evangelical clergyman.\n\nErdo\u011fan reportedly threw the letter in the trash upon receiving it.\n\n\u201cFor our relationship, there's no point to dwell on this letter,\u201d Erdo\u011fan told reporters on Friday. \"This is not a priority for us, but when the time comes, we would like it to be known that we will take the necessary steps.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on what those steps would be.\n\n\u201cI hope history will not record this letter,\u201d Serdar Kili\u00e7, Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., said on Thursday\u2019s PBS NewsHour. He maintained the letter should never have been sent because \u201cit lacks all the niceties, and it\u2019s void of any established practices in that regard.\u201d", "description": "Trump had warned Turkey\u2019s leader to not be a \u201cfool\u201d or \u201ctough guy.\u201d", "authors": ["Abbey Marshall", "Jake Sherman", "Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174224464-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
