The ADL said it also helped authorities in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, identify a white supremacist accused of using aliases to post threatening messages, including a digital image of himself pointing an AR-15 rifle at a group of praying Jewish men.\n\nIn August, an FBI-led anti-terrorism task force arrested a Las Vegas man accused of plotting to firebomb a synagogue or other targets, including a bar catering to LGTBQ customers and the ADL\u2019s Las Vegas office. The ADL said it warned law enforcement officials about the man\u2019s online threats.\n\n\u201cWe cannot and will not rest easy knowing the threat posed by white supremacists and other extremists against the Jewish community is clear and present,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, said in a statement.\n\nThe ADL said it counted at least 30 additional incidents in which people with an \u201cunknown ideology\u201d targeted Jewish institutions with acts of arson, vandalism or propaganda distribution that the group deemed to be anti-Semitic or \u201cgenerally hateful,\u201d but not explicitly white supremacist.\n\n\u201cThese incidents include the shooting of an elderly man outside a synagogue in Miami, fires set at multiple Jewish institutions in New York and Massachusetts, Molotov cocktails thrown at synagogue windows in Chicago, damaged menorahs in Georgia and New Jersey, as well as a wide range of anti-Semitic graffiti,\u201d an ADL report said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Jonathan Greenblatt Of The Anti-Defamation League"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a9/94/a4ecc90f4e73a74608cb319bed6e/20191020-synagogue-memorial-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
