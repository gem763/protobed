USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 When Sen. Mitt Romney met with constituents this month in his home state of Utah, he didn\u2019t shy away from the topic that has put him in the national spotlight: his tensions with President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, battling an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives over the Ukraine scandal, was furious when Romney called it \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d for the president to urge foreign governments to investigate Joe Biden, his political rival. That prompted Trump to blast Romney as a \u201cpompous ass\u201d and tool of the Democratic party.\n\nRomney told USA TODAY that during a series of town halls in heavily Republican Utah, he asked constituents for their own views on his criticisms of Trump over Ukraine, Syria and other matters.\n\n\u201cHow many of you in the room think I'm being too tough on the president?\" he asked as about half of those in the audience raised their hands. \"And how many think I\u2019m not being tough enough?\u201d leading the other half to do so.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) during the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on Assessing the Impact of Turkey's Offensive in Northeast Syria on Tuesday, October 22, 2019. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USAT)\n\nRomney said he didn\u2019t conduct the impromptu poll because he was having second thoughts about voicing his opinions, but, instead, to show constituents that they can respectfully disagree with one another.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to associate with people of like mind, and they assume everyone thinks the way they do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, our town hall meetings have been quite civil.\u201d\n\nCivility has been in short supply in the nation's capital, where Trump is fighting an impeachment investigation he says is an illegitimate \"witch hunt.\"\n\nA Q&A with Mitt Romney: Utah senator talks impeachment inquiry, legacy and his relationship with Trump\n\nIf the House adopts articles of impeachment against Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would then have to weigh whether to remove the president from office. Removal would require a vote by two-thirds of the Senate, meaning at least 20 of the 53 Republicans would have to defy Trump if every Democrat supported conviction.\n\nAre there other Mitt Romneys?\n\nAs Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critic in Congress, Romney has become a focus of attention, even though he has made clear he is nowhere near a decision on how he would vote should the impeachment issue land in the Senate.\n\nRomney\u2019s willingness to discuss his differences with Trump stands in contrast to many other Senate Republicans who have batted away questions about Ukraine and other controversies involving Trump. During the recent Senate recess, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Cory Gardner of Colorado were among several senators who appeared visibly uncomfortable when pressed by reporters on Trump and Ukraine.\n\nFor the most part, Republicans have steered away from crossing Trump. When they have, the clashes have been short lived or came from conservatives set to retire from Congress or who left the party entirely, such as Michigan Rep. Justin Amash.\n\nPierre Delecto: Mitt Romney explains how he came up with the Pierre Delecto Twitter name, says his son made the fake account\n\nBut Romney is a senator with stature as the former presidential nominee with a national following who represents a state where polls show him considerably more popular than Trump. And he is generally well liked by his colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\nAll this makes Romney a bigger threat to Trump because of the possibility his criticisms could embolden other Republicans to break with the president.\n\nAlex Conant, a Republican strategist, said that may help to explain why Trump has so fiercely lashed back at Romney.\n\n\"Trump can\u2019t afford to have a lot of Mitt Romneys in the Senate so he\u2019s going to push back very hard on the one that\u2019s there right now in hope of discouraging his colleagues from joining him,\" said Conant, a former aide to Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nIf the 72-year-old freshman senator is rattled by the backlash, he is not showing it.\n\n\"I try and do what I think is right,\u201d Romney, the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee, told USA TODAY in a 30-minute interview in his Washington office.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 29: (L to R) President-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney dine at Jean Georges restaurant, November 29, 2016 in New York City.

And a Utah Political Trends survey released earlier this month found only 41% of voters said they would vote for Trump in 2020.\n\nRomney won his Senate race in 2018 with the support of nearly two-thirds of the state\u2019s voters.\n\n\"Mitt Romney has a long electoral leash with this constituency here because he remains incredibly popular in Utah,\" Cann said. \"The fact that he's been willing to take on Trump has not caused any problems with his constituency.\"\n\n'Light the fire within'\n\nWhen visitors walk into Romney\u2019s personal office, they are greeted by a torch from the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City that hangs on the wall near his desk.\n\nIt bears the inscription: \u201cLight the fire within.\u201d\n\nAs the leader of the organizing committee for the 2002 Olympics, Romney was widely credited with turning the event around after it was shrouded in controversy because of an international bribery scandal.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney shows off the Olympic torch in his Senate office (Photo: Ledyard King)\n\nRelaxing in one of his office's mahogany chairs, Romney spoke about his family, his favorite sports figures and recalled the hunt for a good cheeseburger during his time as a missionary in Paris in the 1960s. At the time, he could only find the American classic in the U.S. embassy cafeteria.\n\nHis easy-going banter ran counter to the formal and distant image he had during the 2012 presidential election.\n\nAs he spoke, the TV in his outer office was carrying a Trump speech about Syria \u2013 another issue on which Romney has pointedly criticized the president.\n\nIn his Senate bid last year, Romney promised to bring \u201cUtah values\u201d to Washington by pushing efforts to welcome immigrants, open up more federal lands for recreation, grazing and mining, expand water rights for the state, and reduce the federal debt, which he said would be addressed in a soon-to-be-unveiled bipartisan bill to curtail \u201cexcess spending.\u201d\n\nAfter the president denounced Romney as a \u201cpompous ass\u201d earlier this month, the senator heard from his 2012 running mate \u2013 former House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nA Republican aide familiar with the pair\u2019s communication said the former Wisconsin lawmaker offered words of empathy and encouragement.\n\nRomney offered similar support over the years as Ryan, in his role as speaker, became a prime target of the president's ire himself.\n\n'Hang in there'\n\n\"Hang in there,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re doing the right thing\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t be deterred\u201d by \u201cattacks on Twitter,\u201d were just some of the texts Romney would send his former running mate, the aide told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Mitt Romney is a man of integrity and unassailable character,\" Ryan said in a statement for this story to USA TODAY. \"I know Mitt will continue to speak loudly and clearly on the issues that matter most, advancing conservative principles and making crystal clear what America\u2019s role in the world should be.\"\n\nThe pair are far from the only ones slammed as disloyal by Trump. Both of Arizona\u2019s former GOP senators \u2014 the late John McCain and Jeff Flake \u2014 also sparred with the president. Trump has not abandoned the feuds, even though Flake has retired from the Senate and McCain passed away last year.\n\nGoing alone: 'I'm the team': Trump dismisses need for impeachment response team\n\nFlake told USA TODAY he and Romney stay in touch and had lunch recently. He said he wasn\u2019t surprised that Romney is being as vocal as he is against Trump, noting that the Utah senator came in \u201cwith significant gravitas\u201d and had promised to be a check on the president.\n\n\"He knows where I am,\" Flake said when asked if he was encouraging Romney to speak out. \"I had hoped he would stand up as he has, and he is. But I don\u2019t want to suggest that I\u2019m advising him to do anything.\"\n\nSenator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) talking to the media following the Senate rejecting a pair of dueling bills Thursday to fund the federal government and end the longest partial government shutdown in history. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nMost Republicans currently serving in the Senate did not want to wade into the dispute between Romney and Trump.\n\n\"I don't want to get in the middle of it,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, one of several GOP senators who declined to comment.\n\nOf more than a dozen Republican senators interviewed by USA TODAY, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only one who took issue with Trump\u2019s attacks on Romney.\n\nImpeachment shadow: Trump, AOC and McConnell: the personalities that could determine who wins the Senate in 2020\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate at all,\u201d Collins said. \"Senator Romney has served the country very well in a variety of capacities and he\u2019s an excellent senator and my friend.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s criticism of Trump did not start with the Ukraine scandal. During the 2016 campaign, Romney lambasted the then-Republican frontrunner, calling him a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d But Trump ultimately endorsed Romney during his 2018 Senate run.\n\nLunch with Trump at the White House\n\nLast March, the two discussed China trade policy during a lunch arranged by fellow Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Romney said he told the president he agreed with pushing back against China but not on the tariffs the administration imposed on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like tariffs on our friends,\u201d Romney recalled. \u201cSo we had a discussion about that.\u201d\n\nRomney downplayed the friction with Trump, telling USA TODAY they've had social get-togethers long ago and that, even in the midst of a Twitter spat, he and the president \"get along just fine on a personal basis.\u201d\n\nBut when asked whom he would vote for in 2020, Romney declined to say.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to be weighing in on endorsements or who I would vote for in the presidential campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nThen-President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with Mitt Romney after their meeting at the clubhouse of Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Jan. 1, 2019. (Photo: Don Emmert, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRomney\u2019s criticism of Trump has stirred speculation that he might influence other Republicans to make a break with Trump amid the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRomney bristled at the suggestion, saying he hasn't even discussed the issue of impeachment with any member of Congress, Democrat or Republican.\n\nRather, he said he sees his goal as strengthening Republican values that will live on for the next generation \u2014 and for the future beyond Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nWhile he has criticized Trump\u2019s role in pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations helpful to him politically, Romney has repeatedly emphasized that he has not come to any conclusion.\n\nAn 'open mind' on impeachment\n\nWhen asked what he was doing to prepare for a possible impeachment trial in the Senate, Romney said, \"I am making sure that I do everything I can to be unbiased and to keep an open mind.\"\n\nHe added that he has not begun the legal analysis to determine whether the president committed an impeachable offense and should be removed from office.\n\nFlorida GOP Rep. Francis Rooney, a long-time Romney friend, said it's hard to imagine the senator's words are not making Republicans on Capitol Hill reassess the president's conduct concerning Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s got to have some people thinking, don\u2019t you think?\" said Rooney, who announced last week he would not seek a third term after saying he would not rule out impeaching the president. \"You may disagree with him, and I\u2019m sure a lot of (GOP) people do \u2013 certainly in the White House \u2013 but you can\u2019t say he\u2019s not a leader. You can\u2019t say he\u2019s not speaking from his position with integrity.\u201d\n\nImpeachment aside, Romney said some of Trump\u2019s policies have repelled minorities, young voters and suburban women and could harm the Republican brand longer term.\n\nFrancis Rooney: Florida GOP lawmaker who's undecided on impeaching Trump decides not to seek re-election\n\n\"I know there are people who are saying, 'Hey Mitt, don't say anything critical or don't disagree with the president on anything because that hurts us' and my view is no, it helps us because it's important for young people, for instance, to see that there are Republicans who have different points of view,\" Romney said. \"You don't have to all think exactly the same as the leader of our party to be a member of our party.\"\n\nOne thing Romney says he won't do is run for president a third time or try to be a spoiler by running as an independent.\n\n\"I've had my two strikes,\" he said.\n\nRomney said he\u2019s made peace with the fact that he won\u2019t be the leader of the GOP but he still wants to serve as its conscience.\n\n\u201cI think people who are on their way up have other considerations they're thinking about. I'm not on my way up. All right? I've had my life,\u201d he says. \u201cMy career, my family, my faith: Those define who I am. And so, I'm really entirely free emotionally\u2026 to do entirely what I believe is absolutely right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to my kids, my future is behind me.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/28/mitt-romney-trump-republican-critic-congress-impeachment/4065346002/", "description": "Mitt Romney sat down to reflect on his legacy, the state of Utah and what he calls a false assumption he's recruiting Republicans to turn on Trump.", "authors": ["Ledyard King", "Christal Hayes", "Published A.M.
