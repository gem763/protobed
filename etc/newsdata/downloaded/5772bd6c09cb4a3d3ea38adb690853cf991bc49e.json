Fairfax\n\nAirwallex president Lucy Liu had little hesitation in signing up for the scheme.\n\n\"I quickly jumped on board. I thought it was a really good idea,\" Ms Liu said, adding that she received 20 to 30 meeting requests a week from would-be suppliers.\n\nMr Matuszczak said he received more than 40 vendor requests for lunch, coffee or dinner every day, so it made sense for him to schedule a few meetings this way.\n\nMr Carnegie said: \" I thought he [Mr Gough] was a good guy trying to do a good thing. Our office gets hundreds of calls a month.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Liu said she had pledged one meeting and would wait to see the quality of suppliers that came on board. But she was optimistic.\n\n\"I think the quality of the people should be fairly good compared to what you normally get, because they are paying.\" She said she was frustrated by templated messages sent by suppliers, with no thought given to the nature of her business.\n\nMr Gough originally set up Meetmagic in 2017, at the time distributing money to several charities. He ran out of cash and went into full-time employment, but six months ago Paul Keen, the head of software engineering at Qantas, offered to put him in touch with Starlight to see if they could use the Meetmagic platform together to raise funds for the charity.", "description": "The aim is to raise $350,000 to help children with cancer by connecting executives with service providers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f0030c4eec45cbfd1484faf16ee9076d381fcc8", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
