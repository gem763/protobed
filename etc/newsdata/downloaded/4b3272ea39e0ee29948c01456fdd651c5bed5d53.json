Eventually the lies had to stop,' Crawford told the Star-Telegram on Friday regarding Bowen's plea.\n\n'Now hopefully those who thought a mother could never do this to their child will see evil does exist.'\n\nAuthorities said Bowen appeared to show traits of of Munchhausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological condition where a caregiver lies about, exaggerates or makes up medical conditions in a child as a way of getting attention.\n\nChristopher, pictured with his mother, has since recovered from the abuse, is doing well at school\n\nChild Protective Services officials determined Christopher made 323 visits to doctors in Dallas and Houston and underwent 13 major surgeries between 2009 and 2016.\n\nAuthorities say the mom made up stories to some people about Christopher dying from a rare genetic disorder, while she told others he had cancer.\n\nShe also was accused of holding fundraisers for Christopher and having a feeding tube inserted into his body that caused him to suffer life-threatening blood infections.\n\nAuthorities said she even tried to get him a lung transplant and had the boy admitted to hospice.\n\nCrawford, who was denied visits with his son when he was 3 by a judge who believed the mother's lies, told the Star-Telegram that he wants to call more attention to cases of medical child abuse.", "description": "Kaylene Bowen, 35, of Dallas, was sentenced to six years in a Texas state prison on Friday for medically abusing her young son, Christopher.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber", "Ralph R.
