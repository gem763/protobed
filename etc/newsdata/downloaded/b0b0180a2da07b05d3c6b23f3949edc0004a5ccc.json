The DA\u2019s attorneys were set to give oral arguments before California\u2019s 2nd Appellate District Court last Thursday, contending that these protections for immigrants were unconstitutional.\n\nOn Tuesday, 16 hours after being contacted for this story, Lacey sent a letter withdrawing the opinion and the request for oral arguments.\n\nAt issue is California Penal Code 1203.43, a law which took effect at the beginning of 2016 to address a legal quirk that had been letting noncitizens be denied status and deported over criminal convictions that had already been vacated by the state as part of a Deferred Entry of Judgement (DEJ) program. This pretrial diversion let minor offenders avoid jail time and a record if they complete court-mandated treatment, like drug rehab. Prior to 2018, California only let drug defendants enter such programs if they pleaded guilty first, with the understanding that charges would be dropped if they followed the rules.\n\nThe catch was that while successful completion of a program would essentially nullify a conviction for state purposes, federal authorities still considered it a conviction for immigration purposes. Even minor drug crimes can make a noncitizen inadmissible or deportable under federal law, meaning that they may be unable to adjust their status or could even be stripped of legal status and deported by ICE. The new law created a standard process for immigrants who\u2019d taken these diversion deals without being informed of the possible immigration consequences to have their guilty pleas declared legally deficient and thrown out altogether, shielding them from immigration consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how many immigrants in the state took DEJ pleas between the program\u2019s start in 1997 and reform in 2018 (immigration status is not recorded during criminal proceedings). A 2015 advisory on 1203.43 by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimated a number in the tens of thousands.\n\nDavid Angel, assistant district attorney and third in command at the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s office, said \u201cthousands and thousands of people\u201d had been able to void their guilty pleas in that county since the law went into effect. Santa Clara DA Jeffrey Rosen had supported its passage. \u201cWe want people to seek treatment, we don\u2019t want the fact that they\u2019re seeking treatment to be used against them in immigration court,\u201d said Angel.\n\nRose Cahn, a senior staff attorney at the center, said that petitions under the law had been routinely granted in LA County before and after the DA\u2019s office decided to challenge its legality. \u201cLA DA is a huge office with over 800 prosecutors, and every day these motions are getting filed and granted in LA [Superior Court].\u201d\n\nThe hubbub began with one such motion, filed in LA Superior Court on October 2018 on behalf of a man named Luis Roberto Villegas, who had completed a DEJ program in March of 2014. According to Villegas\u2019 attorney, Patrick Obioha, his client is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and was attempting to adjust his status to permanent resident. Obioha had filed many such petitions before, and said he expected this one to be no different. \u201cIt is normally granted by the judge. It\u2019s \u2018he\u2019s qualified, she\u2019s qualified,\u2019 and they just sign it\u2026 It\u2019s not my first rodeo on this 1203.43.\u201d", "description": "Jason Merritt/GettyMonths after Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey abruptly delivered a legal opinion that could have dismantled key protections from deportation for nonviolent drug offenders in California, her office reversed course and dropped its effort Tuesday, just after The Daily", "authors": ["Felipe De La Hoz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IIIjF6FL3DjekLhd1eMWJQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/9911f20a77c982f405be34a07d4c9eee", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
