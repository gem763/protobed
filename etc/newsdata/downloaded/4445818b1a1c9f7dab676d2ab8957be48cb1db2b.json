There were nearly as many ties and lead changes in the first half alone as in the first four games combined.\n\nIt\u2019s the first title for two-time MVP Elena Delle Donne and head coach/general manager Mike Thibault, the winningest coach in WNBA history. He won most of those during a decade with the Sun and took them to their last final appearance in 2005.\n\nCoach Mike Thibault is awarded the \ud83c\udfc6 and rejoices with the @WashMystics crowd! #WNBAFinals pic.twitter.com/zK7S7r3OZ6 \u2014 WNBA (@WNBA) October 11, 2019\n\nDelle Donne, named the 2019 regular season MVP last month after she became the first WNBA player in the 50/40/90 club, was in her third finals appearance following the 2018 finals sweep and her 2014 appearance with the Chicago Sky.\n\n\u201cA lot of people question why I went to a team that hadn\u2019t been to the playoffs in a while and I saw it in coach,\u201d Delle Donne told ESPN sideline reporter Holly Rowe. \u201cI knew he was building something special. It\u2019s why it means so much to get this for him.\u201d\n\nKristi Toliver was the only player on the floor Thursday night who had won a championship previously. The Sun were also looking for their first trophy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe best two teams in the regular season played a back-and-forth battle with few large runs that defined the series. The Sun went on a 10-2 break in the third for a nine-point lead, but faced more foul trouble in a choppy, whistle-happy 40 minutes.\n\nThe Mystics, led by Emma Meesseman in the third quarter, cut the deficit with Sun star Jonquel Jones on the bench and took the lead early in the fourth behind 3-pointers by Natasha Cloud.\n\nThe Sun missed shots in the final four minutes and could never eat into the slim lead Washington continued to build with free throws.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Washington Mystics broke away in the fourth quarter of a showcase game.", "authors": ["Cassandra Negley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r0xADqlnbnYaAfFroPpzIA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fNF4skP3fQpOLicZ01M98w--~B/aD0yMjQ3O3c9MzM3MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8a0eb630-ebc7-11e9-bbff-7e4344a310f7", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
