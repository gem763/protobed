Funds were told to expect an announcement on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision came only one day after the IPO was repriced to $1.78 a share, or 11-times forecast cash profit, from $2 a share or 12.4-times profit.", "description": "Sanity is expected to prevail at Latitude Financial Group.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
