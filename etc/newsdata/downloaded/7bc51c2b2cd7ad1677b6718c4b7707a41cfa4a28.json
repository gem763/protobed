These protestors climbed on top of certain SUV models at the show and showed posters labeled \"Klimakiller,\" or \"Climate Killer.\"\n\nUPDATE 9/9/19: Greenpeace and a German climate-change activist group, Deutsche Umwelthilfe, issued a statement demanding a ban on sport-utility vehicles. The Greenpeace International website declared: \"What we are witnessing is a 'SUVization' of the model ranges being offered\" and called today's auto industry \"truly grotesque.\" Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess will meet with the activists on Monday night for a debate about these issues, the New York Times reported today.\n\n\n\nAs the automotive industry gets ready to shift its attention to the Frankfurt auto show in Germany, a group of activists is organizing a massive demonstration that calls for an immediate phase-out of internal-combustion engines, a dramatic slowing of speed limits, and climate-neutral mobility by 2035.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Bodo Marks/Getty Images More\n\nEarlier this month, protesters sat down in front of trains carrying new Volkswagen vehicles to dealers. The BBC reported that the activists \"chained themselves to tracks to stop a train transporting cars\" from the Wolfsburg plant in Germany.\n\nThe protest will take place September 14 at the Frankfurt auto show and will include marchers and bikers converging outside the convention center as well as smaller events. The organizers say that the auto show is a place where \"crooked car companies celebrate their powerful SUVs and gas guzzlers while the German government applauds . . . But we the citizens are sick and tired of transport policies fixated on cars.\" IAA organizers say that security will be tightened for this year's event.\n\nThe groups involved in the protest are demanding a robust Climate Protection Law by late 2019, improved streets for pedestrians and cyclists along with \"a massive increase in bus and train services,\" lower speed limits on the autobahn (to a maximum of 75 mph) and in residential areas (down to 19 mph in cities and 50 mph in outlying areas), and that the auto industry provide \"efficient electro mobility instead of big electric SUVs.\"", "description": "Enough!
