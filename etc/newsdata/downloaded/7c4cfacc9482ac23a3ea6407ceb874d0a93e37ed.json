Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nWho shaped U.S. policy on Ukraine?\n\nA phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 during which President Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into collecting information he could use against political rivals \u2014 came as the country\u2019s regional adversaries, Russia and Hungary, were urging the president to adopt a hostile view of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn closed-door testimony, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told House committees that Trump\u2019s conversations with Viktor Orban, the hard-right prime minister of Hungary, and Russian President Vladimir Putin reinforced Trump\u2019s perception of Ukraine as a corrupt country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPutin has done everything to undermine and reform the prospects for democracy in Ukraine,\u201d says intelligence reporter Greg Miller . \u201cHe is in Trump\u2019s ear, in their conversations telling him how corrupt it is and how worthless it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA U.S. official told The Post that while American policy has for years been \u201cbuilt around containing malign Russian influence\u201d in Eastern Europe, Trump\u2019s apparent susceptibility to the arguments he hears from Putin and Orban is \u201can example of the president himself under malign influence \u2013 being steered by it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter detention in the South Pacific, a new life in Texas\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s three-year campaign to reshape the government\u2019s approach toward refugees and immigration has encompassed walls, travel bans and the forced separation of children from their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut one of his first attempts failed \u2014 an effort to block the arrival of refugees who had been detained by the Australian government on remote islands in the South Pacific. Now, more than 600 of those refugees are in the United States, building new lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational correspondent Griff Witte met with two such refugees who, after enduring years in geopolitical limbo, are making the most of their second chance at freedom. The two young men, Ali Reza Ataie and Ali Hesar \u2014 \u201cthe Alis,\u201d as their friends call them \u2014 set out to seek asylum in Australia but were rerouted to a remote island when policy changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still wrapping their mind around the idea that they set off to go to Australia and now they\u2019re living in Texas,\u201d Witte says. \u201cIt\u2019s an odyssey that they\u2019ve been on for years now and it\u2019s unbelievably unlikely, but they say: Texas has welcomed us. Nowhere else would welcome us. But Texas has.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals make their first-ever World Series appearance\n\nThe best-of-seven World Series gets started Tuesday night in Houston, coming to Washington on Friday for Game 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany D.C. residents \u2014 such as an Uber driver host Martine Powers rode with last week \u2014 are thrilled that their beloved Nationals have made it through to the World Series, even if they\u2019re not favored to win.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn earlier version of this episode incorrectly said the Washington Nationals defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to advance to the World Series.
