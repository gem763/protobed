The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the 'BB+' rating on XJZT's USD380 million 7.0% senior unsecured notes due 2022. The bond was issued directly by XJZT and hence rated at the same level as the company's IDR. XJZT was established in 2012 and is wholly owned by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It is positioned as a strategic investment-holding company, with the key mission of optimising the value of state-owned assets and promoting Xinjiang's main policy objectives of economic development and employment. Key Rating Drivers 'Very Strong' Status, Ownership and Control: Fitch believes the Xinjiang government's direct ownership, via the region's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), and oversight should reinforce its incentive to provide extraordinary support to the company. The local government has ultimate control over the appointment of XJZT's board members and senior management. The Xinjiang SASAC supervises XJZT's operational and financial management, while all major decisions require government approval. 'Moderate' Support Track Record and Expectations: The government has provided support mostly through injecting the assets of significant state-owned enterprises into the company, which receives dividend payments. The asset injections are in line with the company's role as an asset manager of crucial state-owned assets. The irregularity of the injections and the non-material recurring support were the main constraints against an attribute strength higher than 'Moderate'. 'Moderate' Socio-Political Implications of Default: Fitch expects XJZT's policy role to gradually expand as the government is likely to inject other significant state-owned assets, increasing its importance to Xinjiang. A XJZT default could also potentially change its controlling stake in Zhongtai Chemical, a strategic asset and a large employer in the province. Nevertheless, XJZT's policy role can be substituted by the province's other state-owned asset manager, which caps the attribute strength at 'Moderate'. 'Moderate' Financial Implications of Default: XJZT remained the largest government-related entity (GRE) under the direct control of Xinjiang SASAC by consolidated revenue and assets as of end-2018, which means a default could potentially affect the financing of the province's smaller GREs. However, the company may not be regarded by investors as a proxy funding vehicle for the province due to its smaller parent-level debt relative to the province. 'b-' Standalone Profile: Fitch has assessed XJZT's parent-level Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) based on its role as a strategic-holding company. XJZT has a weak financial profile due to limited dividend income relative to its debt level, with a parent-level net debt to adjusted EBITDA (including dividends) of close to 150x at end-2018. Fitch does not expect any material improvement to the SCP over the next three years in the absence of capital injections. XJZT's revenue defensibility was assessed at 'Weaker', considering its high investment concentration in the chemical industry and the volatility of its dividend income. The operating risk was assessed at 'Midrange' as the parent-level operations have limited costs other than financial expenses. Derivation Summary XJZT's IDRs are derived from our assessment of the four factors under Fitch's GRE rating criteria, reflecting the government's ownership and control, as well as the company's policy role. XJZT's SCP was assessed under our Public Sector, Revenue-Supported Entities Rating Criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES XJZT's ratings would be affected by a change in Fitch's perception of Xinjiang's ability to provide support. Any changes in the province's strength of linkage or incentive to provide support, including changes to shareholding and control and the company's policy role, could result in a revision in the attributes under the GRE criteria.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
