Interesting? It\u2019s interesting.\n\nThe film is hardly sexy, with the Todd Phillips-directed take on the backstory of Batman\u2019s antagonist painting the picture of a terribly tortured human being.\n\nThe film acts as an origin story for the Clown Prince Of Crime, set in 1981, as it follows failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck, who turns to a violent life in Gotham City as retribution for his horrible treatment.\n\nNot something that you\u2019d search on porn sites, just saying.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nStill, for some reason enthusiastic punters want more than just the film apparently, with TMZ reporting Pornhub\u2019s search metrics have taken a, er, beating from Joker fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe website claimed there were more than 741,000 searches involving the word \u2018joker\u2019 in the first four days following the film\u2019s release last week.\n\nBut\u2026why? This is why we can\u2019t have nice things.\n\nPundits have claimed the biggest surge came Sunday when the adult site saw 291,628 searches for clowns.\n\nNot sure why we\u2019re surprised, the same thing happened with 2016\u2019s release of Suicide Squad seeing a bunch of people searching for Harley Quinn.\n\nPeople are also searching for Harley (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\nThe searching proclivities of people on porn sites really is intriguing, right? (Hey, no judgement how you want to get down, as long as it\u2019s legal and not hurting anyone, do your bad thing.)\n\nWith around 10million searches going to Margot Robbie (who plays Harley, may we add) last year, apparently Cristiano Ronaldo was the most-searched-for footballer, leaving David Beckham for dust.\n\nThat and Area 51 searches took a massive spike earlier this year.\n\nBack to Joker though, the film might be making a dent online but it\u2019s also raging through the box office, smashing all sorts of records over the weekend for its opening.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Joker raked in an impressive \u00a393.5million (\u00a375,849,000) on its debut \u2013 smashing box office records to become the highest October launch of all time.\n\nThe record was previously held by 2018 thriller Venom that brought in $80million (\u00a364,898,800).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoker is in cinemas now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
