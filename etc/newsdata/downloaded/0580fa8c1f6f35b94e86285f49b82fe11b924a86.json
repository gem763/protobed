He was actually charged with a blown save after allowing a game-tying home run to Jay Bruce, but was put in line to win after Jose Iglesias homered a half-inning later.\n\nIn the eighth inning, Lorenzen pitched a scoreless frame before padding Cincinnati\u2019s lead with a two-run home run against veteran reliever Blake Parker.\n\nThough it was Lorenzen\u2019s first home run in this season, it was far from a surprise to see him go yard. In fact, Hall of Fame broadcaster Marty Brennaman even predicted Lorenzen was due for a home run.\n\nIn 31 at-bats last season, Lorenzen hit four home runs. For his career, he now has eight.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs he\u2019s frequently done this season, Reds manager David Bell moved Lorenzen to the outfield as a defensive upgrade after his pitching stint was over. Lorenzen played the entire ninth inning in center field as closer Raisel Iglesias secured the save and his place in history.\n\nNational League\u2019s best kept secret\n\nCincinnati Reds pitcher Michael Lorenzen is now in the same company as Babe Ruth after historic all-around performance against the Philadelphia Phillies. (AP Photo/Gary Landers)\n\nWhile Shohei Ohtani has received endless hype as a two-way star in the American League, Michael Lorenzen has been carving out a similar role in the National League to much less fanfare over the last two seasons.\n\nGranted, Lorenzen\u2019s skills as both a pitcher and hitter might not be considered elite like Ohtani\u2019s are when he\u2019s at full strength. Yet still, Lorenzen is putting his own spin on it by actually playing a position other than pitcher in the field. That\u2019s something Ohtani has not yet done, and might never do after undergoing Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt takes unique talent and undeniable dedication to excel in what is essentially three different roles when you add playing the outfield into the mix. That Lorenzen is now trusted to do so regularly confirms he is talented enough and is dedicated to making it work.\n\nThat he made history in the process is just icing on the cake.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Cincinnati Reds pitcher Michael Lorenzen is now in the same company as Babe Ruth after historic all-around performance against the Philadelphia Phillies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HmnnUITP8XQq9NyNrk_f8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODMuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GrykA2W1g2phVBlOz.DOHQ--~B/aD0zMDI0O3c9NDM4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/421e3760-cf84-11e9-9fff-868d5896d581"}
