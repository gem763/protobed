Julian Castro lost support from Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez on Sunday to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Texas Democrat, who endorsed Mr. Castro back in March, said noted that he wasn\u2019t performing well in the polls.\n\n\u201cI think at this point in time we need to narrow the field and unite as Democrats to defeat Trump in November 2020,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was one of Mr. Castro\u2019s three congressional endorsements, along with Reps. Colin Allred and Joaquin Castro, his brother.\n\n\u201cI know firsthand his passion for expanding opportunity for the Latino community, people of color and historically disenfranchised communities, as well as his unparalleled dedication to building a bench of dynamic Democratic candidates in Texas and nationally,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez wrote in his endorsement.\n\nMr. Castro sparred with Mr. Biden during Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, calling the older politician\u2019s memory into question while discussing healthcare.\n\nWhen Mr. Biden appeared to contradict himself on whether people would have to buy into his health care plan, Mr. Castro prodded the issue.\n\nThe former HUD Secretary also pushed back on the former VP\u2019s claim to the Obama administration\u2019s successes.\n\n\u201cI am fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you are not,\u201d Mr. Castro said.\n\nThe spat prompted a wave of backlash against Mr. Castro, who turned to fundraising off the criticisms.\n\nHeading into Thursday\u2019s debate, polls showed Mr. Biden leading the pack of presidential contenders while Mr. Castro rounded out the bottom with single-digit figures.\n\nThe Castro team responded to the news, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, \u201cGonzalez is entitled to endorse whichever candidate he feels represents his values.\u201d\n\nCastro spox: \u201cGonz\u00e1lez is entitled to endorse whichever candidate he feels represents his values. Secretary Castro will continue to fight for a better future for all Americans, including a health care system that ensures all Americans have access to quality coverage.\u201d https://t.co/SK6ZKyfc8g \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 15, 2019\n\n\u2022 Seth McLaughlin and S.A.
