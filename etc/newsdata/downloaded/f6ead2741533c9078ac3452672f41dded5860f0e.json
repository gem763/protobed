That was really nice of them, but I feel just mostly stunned right now, I just can\u2019t believe we did it.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the route that Thomas swam should have been 80 miles (130 km) long, but due to strong currents in the Channel she in fact swam 130 miles (210 km). She said she saw lots of fish and jellyfish along the way.\n\nPreviously, four swimmers had crossed the water between England and France three times without stopping.\n\nThomas consumed only a liquid diet during her swim. Her support crew, following her in a boat, would throw her a bottle containing a mix of carbohydrates, electrolytes and some caffeine, with a little apple juice to improve the flavor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I ate most of the way,\u201d she said.\n\nUpon arrival, she tried to celebrate with champagne but found it did not go down well. She did manage to eat some M&M chocolates.\n\n\u201cHopefully I can sleep the rest of the day. I\u2019m pretty out of it and pretty tired right now, for sure,\u201d she said.", "description": "U.S. endurance swimmer Sarah Thomas has become the first person to swim across the English Channel four times without stopping, refueling only on a liquid formula during her 54-hour feat.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
