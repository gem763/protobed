USA TODAY\n\nFelicity Huffman's \"Desperate Housewives\" co-star Ricardo Chavira slammed her lenient prison sentence as \"white privilege.\"\n\nOn Sept. 13, Huffman was sentenced to 14 days behind bars for her involvement in the college admissions scandal, in addition to a $30,000 fine, supervised release for one year and 250 hours of community service for paying $15,000 to have someone correct her oldest daughter's SAT exam.\n\nChavira \u2013 who starred on the ABC series as Carlos Solis, the husband to Eva Longoria's Gabrielle \u2013 shared his disdain for her light sentencing in a series of tweets, unearthed by Page Six.\n\n\"White Privilege. And I saw Eight years worth of it, so I know what I\u2019m talking about,\" he tweeted on Sept. 13, the same day as Huffman's sentencing. \"Accountability and Responsibility don\u2019t mean (expletive) to these people.\" He called it a \"slap on the wrist.\"\n\nMore: College admissions scandal gets a sexy Halloween costume that you have to see to believe\n\n\"Desperate Housewives\" alums Felicity Huffman (left) and Ricardo Chavira (right).

His character frequently interacted with Huffman's Lynette Scavo in later seasons.\n\n\"I\u2019ve seen a lifetime of it being a halfbreed,\" added Chavira, who identifies as a second-generation Mexican-American. \"I\u2019ve struggled (with) the intricacies of it on a daily basis (with) all the cultural bias I\u2019ve received on both ends.\"\n\nChavira told his critics that in order to understand bias, they have to experience it firsthand. \"It\u2019s not about race. Tired of stupid people and their stupid arguments. If you haven\u2019t lived it, you really have no say. Stay in your lane,\" he added.\n\nFollowing news of his unearthed comments, Chavira tweeted Wednesday, \"La verdad no peca, pero incomoda,\" which roughly translates to: \"The truth does not sin, but it is uncomfortable.\"\n\nFelicity Huffman sentenced:2 weeks in prison, $30,000 fine for college admissions scandal\n\nThe cast of ABC's \"Desperate Housewives.\" (Photo: MOSHE BRAKHA, XXX ABC)\n\nChavira's onscreen wife, however, recalled a different experience with Huffman on the set of the hit show and defended Huffman's integrity ahead of the actress' sentencing.\n\nLongoria praised Huffman, recalling how her \"Desperate\" co-star continually stood up for her against bullies and supported her in situations from pay disparity to award snubs. \"I know I would not have survived those 10 years it wasn't for the friendship of Felicity,\" Longoria wrote in a star-studded sentencing memo to the judge.\n\nHuffman will start her two-week prison sentence Oct. 25.\n\nWhile Chavira believes that Huffman got off easy, \"Full House\" star Lori Loughlin is expected to receive a \"substantially higher\" prison sentence if convicted.\n\nShe stopped an on-set bully:Eva Longoria defends 'Desperate' co-star Felicity Huffman\n\nMore:Lori Loughlin faces 'substantially higher' prison sentence than Felicity Huffman if convicted\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/09/felicity-huffmans-co-star-ricardo-chavira-slams-her-white-privilege/3925422002/", "description": "Felicity Huffman's \"Desperate Housewives\" co-star Ricardo Chavira slammed her lenient sentence in the\u00a0college admissions\u00a0scandal as \"white privilege.\"", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
