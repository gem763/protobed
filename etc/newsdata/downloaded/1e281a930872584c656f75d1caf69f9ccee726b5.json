REUTERS/Sankalp Phartiyal\n\nMore than 10,000 Taiwanese companies, including Apple suppliers Foxconn and Wistron have massive operations in China, thanks to its tax incentives, organised supply chain and logistics, efficient business parks as well its cultural ties to the island.\n\nBut a trade war between Washington and Beijing has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs.\n\n\u201cThis trade war has encouraged more Taiwanese companies to figure out other options. So India and also other ASEAN countries are the alternative markets,\u201d Shih-Chung Liu, vice chairman of Taiwan External Trade Development Council, told reporters.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional block comprising ten nations in Southeast Asia, which promotes economic, political and military ties between members.\n\nBeijing maintains that Taiwan, an island 110 miles (177 km) off the Chinese mainland, does not qualify for formal diplomatic ties with any country. And though India has no formal relation with Taiwan, Taipei runs an Economic and Cultural Center in capital New Delhi, which operates as a de facto embassy.\n\nTaiwanese firms are looking to invest in India\u2019s technology, renewable energy, electric vehicle and farm sectors, Liu said.\n\n\u201cIndia is among the most important markets, among those 18 new southbound policy countries.\u201d.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s southbound policy focuses on strengthening ties in the areas of culture, tourism, education and trade with 18 southeast and south Asian countries.\n\nIt has opened four trade offices in India in the last few years and bilateral trade with Asia\u2019s third-biggest economy stood at $7 billion in 2018.\n\nTrade between India and Taiwan will likely touch $10 billion over the next few years, said Chung-Kwang Tien, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre.\n\nHelping that trade are about 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms, which are setting up operations in India\u2019s southern technology hub Bengaluru, Tien said.\n\n\u201cThese companies have already put in $100 million,\u201d he added.", "description": "Taiwan is pitching India as a potential business destination to its tech, auto, renewable energy and farm sector firms as the United States' trade war with China has pushed its companies to look for newer markets, two officials said on Friday.", "authors": ["Neha Dasgupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432019297&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1HZ", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
