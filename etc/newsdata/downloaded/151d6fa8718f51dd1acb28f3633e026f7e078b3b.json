Another project is a virtual shutter button to focus a phone's camera, similar to the way a physical shutter button works on dedicated digital cameras, Lee said.\n\nSan Jose, California-based Sentons has about 50 employees and has raised $37.7 million in funding from New Enterprise Associates and Northern Light Venture Capital.\n\nBeyond smartphones, Lee said the company hopes to add touch interactions to devices where screen space is either extremely limited, such as the frames of smart glasses or the bands of smartwatches, or where there are no screens at all, like the steering wheels of cars.\n\nIn cars, \"there are lots of luxurious materials - woods and leathers and metals,\" he said. \"We can make all of that active.\"", "description": "Startup headed by ex-Apple engineer aims to eliminate smartphone buttons", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G1RF-OCATC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
