The brothers' companies obtained about a quarter of the housing and hydraulic projects in the city. The officials supported the gang's use of threats and violence against competitors, and later mediated the incidents.\n\nThe three officials were all expelled from the Party and public office and sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, according to the statement.\n\n\"Thunder-like\" measures should be taken to root out such \"protective umbrellas\" and networks, so as to purify the political atmosphere and extend full and strict governance over the Party to grassroots levels, the CCDI and the NSC said.\n\nThey also called for a thorough investigation into and stronger action against gang-related cases, further cooperation with political and legal organs and combined efforts to mitigate formalism and bureaucratism.\n\nIn January last year, the Communist Party of China's Central Committee and the State Council, China's Cabinet, launched a three-year campaign against gangs to improve the public's sense of security.\n\nChina Daily - Xinhua", "description": "The Communist Party of China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission on Wednesday made public six cases on gang-related corruption and \"protective umbrellas\" that shelter gangs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/11/5d9fd96fa310cf3e97a095fa.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
