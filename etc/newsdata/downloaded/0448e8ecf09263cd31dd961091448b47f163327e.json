Affected banks will also be allowed to submit \u201cliving wills\u201d \u2014 documents detailing how a bank would wind itself down in the event of failure \u2014 less frequently.\n\nBanks with $250 billion to $700 billion in total assets, including firms like Capital One and PNC Financial, will now have to submit a resolution plan every three years, alternating between full and partial filings. They are currently required to submit a full report annually, though in practice they have usually received extensions because the process is so complex.
