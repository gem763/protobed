They would then vote on whether to continue with those arrangements every four yeas.\n\nWhile the EU Commission has not rejected Johnson's proposals outright, many senior figures have indicated that they are unworkable and perhaps even dead on arrival, because it would involve customs checks on the island of Ireland, which would appear to contravene the terms of the Good Friday peace agreement.\n\nDonald Tusk, European Council President, said the EU would stand \"fully behind\" the Irish government, which is against the proposals.\n\n\"My message to Boris Johnson: we remain open but still unconvinced,\" he said, following a phone call with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\nVaradkar questioned Johnson's pledge that there would not be \"any new physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland linked to customs or customs checks.\"\n\nHe said that commitment \"is actually in contradiction to the papers presented by the UK government.\"\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator, said the new proposals were a \"repackaging of bad ideas that have already been floated\" and \"nearly impossible\" to implement.\n\nRead more: The European Parliament has 'grave concerns' about Boris Johnson's 'nearly impossible' Brexit deal\n\nRead more: Johnson's claim there won't be new Northern Irish border checks is 'nonsense' say business leaders\n\nAnd Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chair of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee and a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Johnson would not have time to secure a deal before October 31.\n\n\"One thing is clear: Johnson's Brexit plan can't be negotiated [before] October 31. If UK is serious about this, it must seek extension,\" he tweeted on Thursday.", "description": "The warning means there will almost certainly not be time to reach a deal by the \"do-or-die\" October 31 deadline.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9701e1ec72bd06dc05f09d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
