Italian police were not impressed by his actions and neither were easyJet.'\n\nMeanwhile, Collins was forced to call 999 on Sunday evening out of concern for Argent's welfare amid fears he had overdosed.\n\nNo entry: The TV star, from Essex, arrived late to the airport and was reportedly told he wouldn't be able to board\n\nTwo police cars and two ambulance crews made their way to Arg's \u00a31.3million home over concerns he had collapsed.\n\nAccording to the publication, Gemma dialled 999 after Arg's parents were unable to get into his house where he lives by himself.\n\nMedics examined the reality star, 31, and his parents reportedly insisted that they could look after him.\n\nHowever, three hours later they are said to have raised the alarm again over 'further concerns for his welfare'.\n\nIn a statement given to The Sun, James insisted he was fine and the reason he did not answer his phone was because he 'wasn't speaking to a certain person'.\n\nHe said: \u2018I wasn\u2019t speaking to a certain person so I didn\u2019t reply. \u2018They became concerned and called the police and ambulance.\n\n'They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\u2019\n\nTroubled times: A source said it was the 'beginning of the end' for Arg and Gemma, (right) who have had on-again off-again relationships for the last six years\n\nThe ambulance crew reportedly arrived to his home in South Woodford, North East London, shortly before 1pm with the police arriving soon after.\n\nWhen the police got inside, they assessed Arg but then got a second call at 4:20pm before a third ambulance arrived.\n\nArg said his parents were already in his home checking up on him when 'this person' called the emergency services again.\n\nAfter the ambulance arrived at his house after 4pm, Arg said he had a quick chat with them on his doorstep, adding the police and paramedics were only at his house for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe reality star added that he was 'slightly embarassed' by the incident and apologised for any wasted police time as he was 'absolutely fine'.\n\nA source said: 'He has become more and more reclusive and his loved ones are worried about what is going on behind closed doors, away from watchful eyes' (pictured in May 2019)\n\nA source had told The Sun: 'James\u2019 friends are beyond worried. Their concern is that if this behaviour keeps on happening that one day soon they will go around to find him dead.\n\n'He has become more and more reclusive and his loved ones are worried about what is going on behind closed doors, away from watchful eyes.\n\n'It took the quick thinking of police to smash through the glass panel on his front door to undo the bolt and get in. Arg needs a wake-up call and hopefully this will be it.'\n\nThe source added that Gemma called the emergency services after hearing from Arg's parents and immediately thought the worst.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said in a statement: \u2018Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant.\n\n'Officers attended with LAS (London Ambulance Service). The male, in his 30s, was spoken to. He was left in the company of family. Officers were called at 16.21hrs to the same address, again due to concerns for the same male\u2019s welfare. The male declined assistance.\u2019\n\nArg was said to have been sacked from TOWIE after failing a routine drug test, leaving his friends worried about his health.\n\nA source told The Sun that Arg voluntarily agreed to the routine test before he returned to filming because of concerns over his previous issues with drugs and alcohol.\n\nThe insider added that the production crew of TOWIE are very fond of him and hope he can overcome his issues.\n\nDuring a previous appearance on This Morning, James spoke about his weight, saying he believes he replaces substance abuse with food.\n\nHe said: 'I'm proud at myself I've been able to do really well career wise in the last nine months, I\u2019ve stayed sober but instead of me going out with mates doing drugs... I\u2019m probably acting out on food.'\n\nIn August last year, Arg returned to rehab following a split from Gemma in a brave bid to tackle his demons.\n\nThe TV star spent three months in a facility in Thailand over the festive season in 2016 in a bid to curb his wild ways and revealed that he checked himself in to a programme in order to get the 'ongoing support' he needed.\n\nHe also spent time in The Priory for alleged drink and drug issues in 2014.\n\n'I wasn't speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn't answering the phone.'\n\n'I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures,' he added.\n\n'The police and paramedics were only here for about 10 minutes. I'm slightly embarrassed really. I apologise for any wasted police time as I was absolutely fine.'\n\nThe Metropolitan Police added: 'Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant.
