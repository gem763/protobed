While all had generally become more concerned with risks associated with the Trump administration's escalating trade wars, particularly with China, slowing global growth and other developments such as Brexit, they differed on what that meant for the U.S. economy.\n\nSeveral policymakers felt it would be prudent for the Fed to cut rates now to guard against risks while several others said the current U.S. economic outlook did not justify a rate cut.\n\n\"They contended that the key uncertainties were unlikely to be resolved soon. Furthermore, as they did not believe that these uncertainties would derail the expansion, they did not see further policy accommodation as needed at this time.\"\n\nSeveral policymakers noted that statistical models suggested the likelihood of a recession over the medium term had increased in recent months and a number warned that the labor market coming into 2019 may have been less strong than previously thought, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary revisions.\n\nThe Fed has lowered borrowing costs twice this year after having raised interest rates nine times since 2015 and the minutes tally with projections that accompanied the September statement, which showed discord among policymakers on the path forward.\n\nSeven of the Fed's 17 policymakers last month indicated they forecast one more rate cut this year. Five policymakers did not see any more cuts needed and the other five projected a rate rise by end of 2019. Investors overwhelmingly expect another rate cut at the next meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and some other policymakers are in the camp that view rate cuts that have occurred as necessary insurance in order to keep the longest U.S. economic expansion on record going.\n\nOn Tuesday, Powell flagged openness to more rate cuts to mitigate against such risks, repeating that the central bank will act \"as appropriate.\"\n\nBut others, such as Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, do not see the need for rate cuts when the economy is growing moderately and unemployment is near a 50-year low.\n\nThe Fed has been near-continuously pilloried in recent months by President Donald Trump who called them \"boneheads\" ahead of the September meeting for not cutting interest rates more. On Wednesday Trump criticized the central bank again. \"The USA is doing great despite the Fed!\" he tweeted.\n\nSince the meeting, economic data has increased fears that trade tensions are spilling over to the broader economy. U.S. manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low and service sector activity fell to a three-year low in September.\n\nConsumer spending, which has been driving U.S. growth, has also begun to moderate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBALANCE SHEET EXPANSION\n\nElsewhere in the minutes, policymakers discussed recent volatility in U.S. short-term funding markets. Rates in the $2.2 trillion market for repurchase agreements, a key measure of liquidity, spiked to 10% on Sept. 17 to levels not seen since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 as demand for overnight cash from companies, banks and other borrowers exceeded supply.\n\nIn order to calm markets, the New York Fed has since been holding daily repo operations to inject extra cash into the system and will do so through Nov. 4 in order to help maintain the federal funds rate within its current target range.\n\nSome investors and former Fed officials have been calling on the central bank to deliver a long-term fix, such as creating a standing repo facility, which would allow firms to borrow cash as needed at a fixed rate, or expanding the Fed's balance sheet.", "description": "Most Federal Reserve policymakers supported the need for an interest rate cut in September, minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting showed, but they remain increasingly divided on the path ahead for monetary policy.
