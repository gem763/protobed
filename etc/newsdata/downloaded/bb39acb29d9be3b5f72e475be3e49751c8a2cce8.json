Strong labor market conditions, consumer confidence, and 3-year low mortgage rates have continued to provide support to the sector. The numbers would need to be quite dire to raise any red flags.\n\nOn Thursday, September\u2019s Philly FED Manufacturing Index will also influence\n\nWe would expect the weekly jobless claims figures and existing home sales on Thursday to have a muted impact on the Dollar.\n\nThe main event of the week for the Greenback, however, is the FED interest rate decision on Wednesday.\n\nA 25 basis point rate cut is priced in. It will boil down to the economic projections and the press conference\u2026\n\nThe Dollar Spot Index ended the week down 0.14% to $98.257.\n\nFor the EUR:\n\nIt\u2019s a quieter week ahead on the economic data front.\n\nEconomic sentiment figures out of Germany and the Eurozone on Tuesday will influence. Forecasts are EUR positive, with sentiment towards Brexit and trade likely to provide support.\n\nThe market focus will then shift to finalized August inflation figures for the Eurozone. The numbers are unlikely to have a material impact on the EUR, however, barring a deviation from prelims.\n\nAt the end of the week, Eurozone consumer confidence figures will influence, however. With the manufacturing sector in the doldrums, consumer consumption remains a key contributor to the economy.\n\nFinalized Italian inflation figures on Monday and wholesale inflation figures out of Germany on Friday will likely have a muted impact on the EUR.\n\nOutside of the stats, economic data out of China will influence market risk sentiment and the EUR, as will Brexit chatter.\n\nThe EUR/USD ended the week up by 0.40% to $1.1073.\n\nFor the Pound:\n\nIt\u2019s another busy week ahead on the economic calendar.\n\nAugust inflation figures due out on Wednesday will influence the Pound ahead of the BoE\u2019s monetary policy decision on Thursday.\n\nAhead of the Thursday MPC vote, August retail sales are also due out on Thursday and will likely influence messaging from the BoE.\n\nThe UK economy may have avoided a contraction in the 2nd quarter, but economic data through the 3rd quarter has been negative. Retail sales will need to hold up to support the Pound.\n\nFor the Pound, the BoE is expected to leave rates unchanged. Key will be the vote split, with any dissenters likely to weigh on the Pound.\n\nUltimately, the BoE has been holding out for Brexit. If there is an extension to January next year, it may be too long for the BoE to wait\u2026\n\nWhile the BoE will have a material influence, Brexit and British politics will likely continue to be the key driver.\n\nThe GBP/USD ended the week up by 1.77% to $1.2501.\n\nFor the Loonie:\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively busy week ahead on the data front.\n\nJuly manufacturing sales figures on Tuesday, August inflation figures on Wednesday and July retail sales on Friday will influence.\n\nWith the Canadian economy performing well, a pickup in inflationary pressures and rise in retail sales would support the BoC\u2019s latest outlook on policy, which remains Loonie positive.\n\nFrom elsewhere, industrial production figures out of China on Monday will also be of influence at the start of the week.\n\nThe Loonie ended the week down by 0.87% to C$1.3288 against the U.S Dollar.\n\nOut of Asia\n\nFor the Aussie Dollar:\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively quiet week ahead on the Economic data.\n\n2nd quarter house price figures on Tuesday and August employment figures on Thursday will provide direction.\n\nWe can expect the Aussie Dollar to be particularly sensitive to the employment figures\u2026\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the RBA minutes due out on Tuesday will also get some attention. The RBA is holding steady following 2 consecutive rate cuts in the summer.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s moves by both the U.S and China on trade, hopes of an end to the trade war would likely dilute the influence of any dovish chatter.\n\nFrom elsewhere, industrial production figures out of China on Monday will also provide direction.", "description": "It\u2019s a big week ahead for the markets.
