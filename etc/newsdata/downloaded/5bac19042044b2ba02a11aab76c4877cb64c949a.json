He entered the building by shooting through a glass door.\n\nThe boy then engaged in a shootout with officers in the stairwell, firing his rifle six times before turning the gun on himself.\n\nYork told investigators that her son had suffered from depression issues for four or five years prior to the December shooting, which ended with him committing suicide\n\nYork said that there weren't any warning signs and she was shocked that her son could carry out such an act\n\nPolice said more lives could have been lost if York hadn't made the 'gut-wrenching decision' to call police.\n\nOn Monday, York said that there weren't any warning signs and she was shocked that her son could carry out such an act.\n\n'I tried everything I could to stop him,' she said.\n\nThe mother said the guns belonged to her then-boyfriend and had been locked up in the home.\n\nInvestigators determined that the bullying the boy endured at the school was not relevant to the incident, Indiana State Police Captain David Bursten said.\n\nBursten said the boy was not targeting specific individuals but intended to 'cause maximum damage and harm'.\n\nYork, however, claimed that the bullying was the driving force behind the attack. She also pointed the finger at the mental health facility, saying that they shouldn't have allowed her to remove him if he wasn't ready.\n\n'They're blaming me and my son, but they need to be blaming the school system and this medical facility that let me take him out,' York said.\n\nShe described her son as a caring boy who was failed by 'so many people'.\n\n'I can't ever see him again now. I just feel like everything was not done right,' she told WISH-TV.\n\nRichmond Mayor David Snow encouraged members of the community to seek necessary aid for mental illness at a news conference in April.\n\n'It is so important as a community that we remove the stigma of mental health and to make mental health resources both available and affordable,' Snow said.", "description": "Mary York, 43, called police on the morning of December 13, 2018, and said her son was threatening to carry out a shooting at David W Dennis Intermediate School in Richmond.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/13/19787682-0-image-a-29_1571230724466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
