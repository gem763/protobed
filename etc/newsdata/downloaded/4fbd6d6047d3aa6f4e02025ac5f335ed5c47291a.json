The pound is already 17% cheaper than before the 2016 referendum on leaving the EU at $1.2224 and U.K. equity markets have consistently underperformed.\n\n\u201cIn short, equity markets would drop, with the U.K. bearing the largest impact,\u201d MSCI analysts Aniko Maraz and Thomas Verbraken said. \u201cSovereign yields would decrease in the U.K. and Europe, while corporate spreads would widen. Both the pound and euro would lose value relative to the dollar.\u201d\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.K. government bond TMBMKGB-10Y, +10.92% would also fall by 30 basis points and the EURUSD, +0.1643% euro would skid 5%, they said.\n\nHowever, a deal, leading to an orderly and well-managed exit, could have a rebound effect on markets.\n\n\u201cEquity markets could rebound, with the U.K. outperforming European and U.S. equity markets; the pound and euro could strengthen against the dollar; and corporate spreads could,\u201d Maraz and Verbraken said.\n\n\u201cWe further assume that\u2014along with the positive surprise to future expected growth\u2014sovereign bonds may lose, as rates go slightly up.\n\nU.S. equity markets would enjoy a 2% boost from a deal, while German stocks would climb 6%.\n\nIn the event of another Brexit delay, the same market impacts could materialize later than Oct. 31, the report added.", "description": "A no-deal Brexit could weaken the U.K. stock market by 15% and send the pound plunging a further 10% against the U.S. dollar, index provider MSCI has warned.", "authors": ["Callum Keown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS954_UKEUfl_ZG_20191009110220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
