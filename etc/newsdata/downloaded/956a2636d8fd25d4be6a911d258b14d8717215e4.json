He said we have a deal so we don\u2019t need one \u2014 Beth Rigby (@BethRigby) October 17, 2019\n\nJuncker tells me there \u2018must be no prolongation- it has to happen now\u2019 \u2013 has Johnson persuaded EU to say it\u2019s genuinely this deal or no deal \u2013 no delay? \u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cI agree with Boris Johnson and I was saying half an hour ago \u2013 I rule out there being any kind of prolongation\u201d #StandUp4Brexit pic.twitter.com/EtNa3V8BJw \u2014 #StandUp4Brexit (@StandUp4Brexit) October 17, 2019\n\nWhy President Juncker appears to be attempting to bounce the Remain majority in the House of Commons into backing Borish Johnson\u2019s new deal with Brussels \u2014 which appears to be all but indistinguishable from the \u201csurrender treaty\u201d negotiated by Theresa May \u2014 is unclear, especially considering MPs now seem emboldened to block no-deal deal Brexit or the calling of an election which might alter the parliamentary arithmetic in the Brexiteers\u2019 favour in perpetuity.\n\nIt is possible that he has reason to believe that even if Boris Johnson does comply with the aforementioned legislation requiring him to ask for another delay \u2014 which he has somewhat confusingly vowed he will not do, while also insisting his government will follow the law \u2014 it may not be agreed by the European Council, comprised of executive states and government from the EU\u2019s 28 member-states (minus the United Kingdom, in the context of the Brexit negotiations).\n\nIt should be noted that the decision to accept or reject another extension of the Brexit deadline is in the Council\u2019s gift, and not the Commission\u2019s \u2014 although it seems unlikely he Juncker would rule it out in the presence of chief negotiator Barnier if he did not have the Council\u2019s tacit backing.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa Where there is a will, there is a #deal \u2013 we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that #EUCO endorses this deal. pic.twitter.com/7AfKyCZ6k9 \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) October 17, 2019\n\nSo far not a fan of these little \u2018commitments\u2019 in the Political Declaration \u2013 albeit non-binding \u2013 but staying in step with EU tax schedules and handing them our fishing waters ain\u2019t in any version of Brexit I voted for pic.twitter.com/a5QMpyVRL6 \u2014 Alexandra Phillips MEP (@BrexitAlex) October 17, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters Brexit \"has to happen now\"\u00a0\u2013 MPs must accept Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal or leave without one.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/juncker-barnier-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
