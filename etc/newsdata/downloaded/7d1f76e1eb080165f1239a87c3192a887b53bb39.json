For both Fidelity and Hilton, adding simulated scenarios provided a step up to help employees better understand each other, as well as the customers they serve.\n\nEmotional intelligence, that umbrella term that encompasses empathy, is actually high in 90% of top performers. Using VR in empathy training resulted in better overall outcomes for both companies, they told Business Insider.\n\nVR lets workers see the impact of the service they provide\n\nFidelity's VR training virtually transported workers from call center to the homes of the customer in the mock interaction. The workers address the problem while seeing it play out, so they're connected to a real-life experience they may not have felt personally.\n\nThey then virtually see the impact of the service they provide, whether positive or negative. This all underscores the bottom line of helping associates understand what the customer is going through, and why they're acting a certain way, to better serve them.\n\nThe VR training replaced more formal instruction within a classroom. Previously, select staff would enact a role-playing exercise while other new employees watched. With VR, everyone gets to go through every experience as many times as they want.\n\n\"It changes the dynamics of learning,\" Schouela said. \"It changes from one person being active and everybody else being passive to almost the whole process being an active learning process.\"\n\nSchouela tracked the customer satisfaction scores of associates who went through the VR pilot training versus those who didn't. The team found enough of a difference to expand the pilot and think about scaling the program.\n\n\"We've probably built 30, 40 different virtual reality experiences in order to understand all of this stuff and really, truly see where we can apply these technologies internally within Fidelity and have it make a difference,\" Schouela said.\n\nCorporate hires at Hilton 'virtually sweat'\n\nVR made a difference within Hilton by exposing corporate hires to an indispensable part of Hilton's business: hotel operations. Most of Hilton's corporate hires (80%) don't have direct hospitality experience, but they are tasked with supporting operations. The company looked for something that would build empathy, but not take corporate employees out of their roles for too long (or cause operational difficulties).\n\nThat's where the VR Business Immersion program came in.\n\n\"The experience allows Team Members to move through different hotel departments including housekeeping, engineering, kitchens and front desk,\" Gretchen Stroud, VP of talent development and team member engagement at Hilton told Business Insider. \"They complete modules and 'virtually sweat' as they work through tasks like setting up a room service tray or cleaning a room.\"\n\nNearly everyone who completed the pilot program last year said they had more empathy and appreciation for operations workers. The pilot was so successful that the VR-based program is now part of Hilton's six global corporate offices, and is required for all team members within their first year, Stroud said.\n\nSince the program officially launched, more than 1,200 people have participated in the training, 87% of whom said the experience gave them more empathy and appreciation for the experiences of direct hotel staff.\n\nInstead of further detaching people from the real world, VR appears to help people better understand it.", "description": "Virtual reality has become a key part of onboarding for select employees at Fidelity and Hilton, where the tech is used for empathy training.", "authors": ["Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7fece22e22af1f47538443?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
