And if there wasn\u2019t room, he would kind of make a hole.\u201d\n\nTalladega president Grant Lynch initially reached out to Childress, who this year is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Richard Childress Racing, to want to do something special to commemorate the special day.\n\n\u201cGrant Lynch called me and says, \u2018What do you think about bringing Dale\u2019s car down here that he won the race with in 2000?\u2019\u201d Childress said during a press conference at the track. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 But how do you say no to your best friend on something like this. So I said, \u2018alright, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be running that car leading the field, which is going to be a great honor. That car hasn\u2019t been out of our museum since we opened the doors of it, so this will be the first time we took it down, put it on the shop floor, got it all fixed, got the engine running \u2013 same engine that he had in the car that day. It\u2019s the exact car just like the day when it left the winner\u2019s circle here. \u2026 That\u2019s going to be the coolest thing. It gives me cold chills just thinking about it.\u201d\n\nChildress then joked, \u201cI asked my guys could I run it 200 mph.\u201d\n\nTalladega was where Childress made his first career Cup start as a race car driver on Sept. 14, 1969. He finished 23rd in a 36-driver field. He would go on to make 285 career starts between 1969 and 1981, collecting zero wins, six top-five and 76 top-10 finishes.\n\nNEWS: Richard Childress will pace the field at @TalladegaSuperS in the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet that Dale Earnhardt drove at Talladega in 2000, his last NASCAR victory. #RCR50 pic.twitter.com/ZBWugsdkiW \u2014 RCR (@RCRracing) September 18, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nLynch surprised Childress with the old CRC Chemicals helmet that Childress used to wear during his own racing days before becoming solely a full-time team owner.", "description": "The cool factor will be through the stratosphere when Richard Childress drives the car the late Dale Earnhardt drove to the last Cup win of his career.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RjsfyIgN253UKZxCJZkcvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTEuNDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EgOW5Pd0fDZ7BmUYUzwAtA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTc0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/3302fcd73dd6b1f4b90c39416874410d", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
