He said his parents thought a seizure he suffered in September 2018 was tied to vaping, and they sent him away for treatment.\n\n'It wasn't until then that my parents recognized, ''Hey, this is really an issue,''' he told the first lady.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nMelania Trump said Wednesday that she is glad some stores are pulling electronic cigarettes off the shelves\n\n'We need to be proactive before it gets out of control,' she said at a White House 'listening session' with a small group of teens from around the country\n\nAlly Harrison, 18, said she suffered from physical and mental ailments, including heart palpitations and panic attacks.\n\nThe first lady, who has a 13-year-old son, Barron, has been public with her concerns about youth vaping\n\nFriends in her hometown of Baytown, Texas, encouraged her to vape, assuring her it would ''calm you down.'''\n\nBut it had the opposite effect. 'I had worse panic attacks. The fear was always there,' Ally said.\n\nAsked by Mrs. Trump how he obtained e-cigarettes, Luka said he got them from friends or by hanging around outside smoke shops or gas stations and enlisting strangers to get the products for him.\n\nAmid an increased focus on vaping by young people, a few big-name retailers have said they will no longer sell those products.\n\nWalmart, the nation's largest retailer, said last month that it will stop selling electronic cigarettes at its namesake stores and Sam's Clubs in the U.S. when it sells out its current inventory.\n\nSupermarket chain Kroger and drugstore chain Walgreens announced Monday they will follow Walmart's lead.\n\nJuul Labs Inc., the nation's largest maker of electronic cigarettes, is ending advertising in the U.S.\n\nThe teens shared their experiences using e-cigarettes, telling the first lady of rehab stints and seizures suffered\n\nCounselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway was also present and spoke at the listening session\n\nIn response to a surge in vaping by young people, President Donald Trump recently announced that the federal government will act to ban thousands of flavors used in e-cigarettes, mostly the fruity flavors that are believed to entice young people to start vaping.\n\nThe first lady, who has a 13-year-old son, Barron, went public with her concerns about youth vaping in a tweet last month.\n\nShe sat with Trump when he announced the proposed ban, and Wednesday's roundtable was the second time she highlighted youth vaping this week.\n\nFederal statistics show a significant increase in vaping among teens between 2017 and 2018.\n\nMore than 1 in 4 high school students reported vaping in the past month, up from 1 in 5 students in 2018, according to the latest statistics.\n\nSupermarket chains Kroger and Walgreens joined with Walmart and other retail giants by discontinuing its sale of e-cigarettes in its stores and fuel centers\n\nHealth authorities are also investigating hundreds of vaping-related lung illnesses.\n\nThe Truth Initiative, a nonprofit, anti-tobacco organization that brought the group of nine students to meet with the first lady in the ornate White House Blue Room, wants the federal government to ban all flavors used in vaping, including mint and menthol, among other steps.\n\nIndustry groups, such as the American Vaping Association, which represents makers and retailers of e-cigarettes and vaping solutions, oppose a ban.\n\nThey argue that it could create a 'black market' for vaping products and push adults who vape - as an alternative to traditional cigarettes - to resume smoking.\n\nE-cigarettes work by heating a liquid to produce an aerosol that users inhale.", "description": "Melania Trump said Wednesday\u00a0that she is glad stores are pulling electronic cigarettes off the shelves.
