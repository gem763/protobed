We pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation,\u201d Esper said.\n\nEven some of Trump\u2019s staunchest Republican supporters have sharply criticized the decision, which some regard it as a betrayal of the US-armed Kurdish fighters who partnered with US forces against the Islamic State, at great cost.\n\nEsper insisted the Kurds remain a viable partner.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces, and US troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President [Recep Tayyip] Erdo\u011fan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe Turkish invasion also has raised the prospect of losing control of thousands of captured Islamic State fighters.\n\nEsper called on the Turks to halt their operation, but told reporters that he has no indication they are willing to do so. He lamented \u201cthe dramatic harm\u201d done to the two nations\u2019 relationship.\n\nSpeaking alongside Esper, Gen Mark Milley said the US-backed Syrian Kurdish military known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), is still guarding camps holding Isis prisoners.\n\nMilley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the Turkish military operations across the border into Syria were still \u201crelatively limited\u201d.\n\nHe said the operations have been carried out near two Syrian villages by about 1,000 members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and hundreds of Turkish commando forces. The distance they have penetrated into Syria ranges from a kilometer or two (about 1 mile) in one area to about 10km (6.2 miles) in another.\n\nTrump defends Syria decision by saying Kurds 'didn't help us with Normandy' Read more\n\nMilley emphasized that US forces are still working with Kurdish forces. He said US policy is to continue with a counter-Isis campaign except in one area of the incursion.\n\nHe said the Turks \u201cknow exactly where American forces are\u201d throughout Syria and in the invasion zone. They have been told that US troops will defend themselves if needed, he said.\n\nMilley said leaders of the Kurdish force have told some of their fighters to move north to defend what they consider to be their territory. But he said the US is \u201cencouraging them to not overreact at this point and to try to tamp things down in order to allow some sort of diplomatic resolution\u201d.", "description": "All US troops accounted for after explosion near outpost where Turkey knew American forces were present, official says", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c08b733cc0e7461bcbf7d9b1f9363bafc6e5eb8b/0_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f57258f0f73362daa118987f99d5129b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
