Sam Graves, put down your burger, straw and look at realities of climate change\n\nLast week, hundreds of thousands of young people around the world - including in Kansas City - demanded action on climate change.\n\nRep. Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, decided to mock their concerns with a press release.\n\n\u201cBurgers and Straws Aren\u2019t the Problem,\u201d the headline read. The essay attacks the Green New Deal, the ambitious package of environmental and economic reforms offered by progressives in the Democratic Party and others.\n\n\u201cThe Green New Deal isn\u2019t about the environment at all,\u201d Graves wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about making America a socialist country.\u201d\n\nFor a congressman representing an agricultural district, the word \u201csocialist\u201d is an interesting choice. Taxpayers have already sent the nation\u2019s farmers $28 billion in emergency subsidies under President Donald Trump, twice the cost of the car makers\u2019 bailout a decade ago.\n\nReasonable people can disagree over the breadth of the Green New Deal, and the cost. Some of its provisions - moving toward clean, renewable energy sources, for example - make sense. Other parts, including job and wage guarantees, are longer-term projects.\n\nBut the changing climate is a real phenomenon, with real-world consequences. And Graves\u2019 screed isn\u2019t really about the Green New Deal; it\u2019s about trying to make America safe for polluters and carbon-based energy providers.\n\nGraves\u2019 record on environmental matters is clear. In June, he supported an amendment aimed at limiting enforcement of methane emissions. He supports drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Alaska, and off the coast of Florida.\n\nHe opposed the Clean Power Plan. He supported the Keystone XL pipeline. He has a lifetime rating of four from the League of Conservation Voters.\n\nGraves\u2019 answer to climate change? Let the private sector do its work. \u201cWe don\u2019t need sweeping mandates that ignore economic reality and the differing needs of our communities,\u201d he said in February.\n\nYet he is not above using the power of the federal government to protect some constituents. He\u2019s offered legislation, for example, to remove fish and wildlife protection from the management manual for the Missouri River.\n\nGraves suggests, falsely, that protecting wildlife leads to flooding. \u201cFlood control must be the top priority for the Corps of Engineers, along with navigation,\u201d he said in April.\n\nThe congressman seems blissfully unaware that climate change will make extreme weather events, like flooding, worse. Reducing pollution from cars and aircraft will do more to protect Missourians than killing fish or other wildlife.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are telling Rep. Graves and his colleagues that the future is about a planet our children and grandchildren can inhabit. Perhaps he can put down his hamburger and soft drink long enough to listen.\n\n_____\n\nThe St. Joseph News-Press, Sept. 25\n\nThe climate change debate should revolve around science.\n\nHow much is the world\u2019s temperature rising? What\u2019s causing it? Most importantly, how fast should we address this problem and how much should be sacrificed in short-term economic gains?\n\nThe reason a solution remains elusive isn\u2019t because old people live in a fairy-tale world, as 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg suggests at her now-famous United Nations speech. It\u2019s because climate change is viewed as a political problem, with all the baggage that entails, rather than one with a scientific or technological answer.\n\nPerhaps this was inevitable ever since Al Gore got involved after losing the 2000 race for president. Maybe there\u2019s an alternate universe where Gore wins Florida and Texas Gov. George W. Bush leads a crusade to save the planet.\n\nThat\u2019s not the world we inhabit right now.\n\nWe live in a world where a teenager takes the microphone and tells an older generation: \u201cHow dare you. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money. You are failing us.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another inconvenient truth: Despite fawning worldwide media coverage, Thunberg\u2019s speech does not belong with great oratory of the past.\n\nImagine a world where Martin Luther King Jr. stands in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Instead of saying, \u201cLet us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred,\u201d he points a finger at white America and says, \u201cYou have failed us.\u201d\n\nImagine that Winston Churchill, instead of invoking \u201cOur Finest Hour\u201d after the Dunkirk evacuations, tells the House of Commons, \u201cWe are on the brink of extinction.\u201d\n\nWhat if Americans suffering through the Great Depression turned on the radio and heard President Roosevelt say that their dreams of future prosperity were nothing more than a fairy tale?\n\nMaybe Thunberg got the science right, though some will debate whether mass extinction is imminent. But she did little to advance the cause of rolling back climate change. In fact, she set the movement back, not because of what she had to say but because of how she said it.\n\nAn inability to uplift and offer hope, while still outlining a critical problem, means both sides retreat to their rhetorical corners. Now, she\u2019s added a generational wedge to go along with the one between the political left and right.\n\nIn terms of tone, Thunberg\u2019s performance brought up memories of a tantrum at a U.N. General Assembly nearly 60 years ago. At least she didn\u2019t pound a shoe on a desk, but she did imply that capitalism would be swamped instead of buried this time.\n\nTime proved Khrushchev wrong. We\u2019ll see how it goes for Thunberg. Climate change is a problem that must be taken seriously, but it might be time for a new spokesperson.\n\n____\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Sept. 26.\n\nMissouri won\u2019t track opioids or restrict guns. Death rates surge accordingly.\n\nMissourians\u2019 average life expectancy dropped by about one-tenth of a year in 2018, says a new state report. It sounds insignificant but for this detail: Virtually all that change comes from deaths among young people. For Missourians 15 to 44, life expectancy has dropped by an astounding 30% since 2012 - with the bulk of it attributable to opioid overdoses and firearms. In all, Missouri\u2019s life-expectancy rate is fully 1\u00bd years shorter than the national average.\n\nIn the dry language of data, the report by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services\u2019 Bureau of Vital Records presents an alarming portrait of a state in which people die too young from drugs and gun violence run amok. Might this have something to do with Missouri\u2019s notably lax policies regarding prescription drug monitoring and gun safety? It\u2019s a fair question.\n\nIn the decade between 2008 and 2018, opioid-related deaths in Missouri spiked almost 250%, from 468 to 1,132. The report attributes that spike overwhelmingly to fentanyl, an especially powerful opioid that has worked its way into the heroin market in both prescription and illicit forms. \u201cThe use of fentanyl is a particular problem in the St. Louis area,\u201d the report notes.\n\nThe same could be said of gun deaths, of course, as St. Louis faces an epidemic of fatal shootings, with more than a dozen children among the victims.Statewide, according to the report, firearms-related deaths - homicides, suicides and accidents - rose from 811 to 1,312 between 2008 and 2018, a more than 60% increase.\n\nWhy is Missouri seeing more of these kinds of deaths, and more than the national average? Two factors should be considered - both tied to a state government controlled by a Republican supermajority that has substituted hard-right ideology for serious drug and firearms policies.\n\nMissouri remains the only state without a statewide system to monitor drug prescriptions to ensure opioids aren\u2019t being harvested from pharmacies for illicit use. St. Louis County has established its own, more limited monitoring system, which other counties have joined. But a statewide system has been consistently blocked by right-wingers obsessed with the scourge of government intrusion from such a database - as if Missouri isn\u2019t facing an actual scourge of overdose deaths.\n\nSimilarly, on guns, Missouri lawmakers have stripped out regulations to the point that St. Louis police have virtually no tools to use against people walking around the city fully armed, with no permit required. Even felons who aren\u2019t supposed to have guns can easily get them through private sellers since Missouri refuses to require universal background checks on all purchasers.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know how much of this is cause and effect. But given these ideologically driven policies (or lack thereof), it would be surprising if Missouri wasn\u2019t awash in shootings and opioid deaths.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Kansas City Star, Sept. 26", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
