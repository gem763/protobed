Not only have they been narrowing; the two key prices have crossed, with crude in Midland now priced higher than that at Cushing, as the chart below using data from S&P Global Platts shows.\n\nThose two new pipelines are the Cactus II and the EPIC line, both of which take oil out of the Permian and directly to the Gulf Coast. Another new pipeline, the Gray Oak, is coming on line next year. And that's where there's a problem for truckers.\n\nThe spreads were so wide in the past that the economics of moving crude by truck \u2013 which are usually terrible \u2013 could make sense. \"At times, trucking is treated as a necessary evil in the crude oil business. It can be expensive, and it takes a lot of communication and coordination among the producer, trader and trucking company to execute correctly,\" the RBN report said. \"But in the right environment, such as in a takeaway-constrained, highly prolific producing region, trucking can be a welcome fix for all involved.\"\n\nAs the report notes, at the sort of spreads that existed previously because there wasn't enough pipeline takeaway capacity, putting crude oil on a truck and driving it potentially many miles to the nearest injection point on a pipeline could work economically. If the crude was eventually going to make its way on that pipeline to the Gulf Coast, it would ultimately fetch a price that was tied to the Gulf Coast market, which by extension is the world market. But at the original delivery point \u2013 the Midland/Odessa area \u2013 the spread would not reflect that.\n\nThat proved to be lucrative for drivers. During the time of a wide spread, \"trucking outfits were going like gangbusters,\" the RBN report said. Not only that, but capital was pouring into the Permian and production was soaring, even for producing areas that had no obvious way of easily getting to a major market.\n\n\"The producer/trader and his or her trucking group would be left to find another pipeline option \u2013 one that's close by, ideally,\" the RBN report said. \"In this way, the market relied on trucks to ensure that wells and production sites didn't get backed up with crude, and that oil could reach a variety of pipeline destinations.\"\n\nThere will always be some trucking of crude. The kind of pipeline connections that the report refers to are major interstate pipelines. But not every well is hooked up to a pipeline that takes the oil to a gathering facility for further processing and shipment on the big lines. Many of those wells, if they're small, need to have their output trucked. That's not new. What had been new is the amount of crude being moved by truck from the gathering facilities to pipelines.\n\nStory continues", "description": "While the statements from Stevens said that a loss of business hauling frac sand was a major reason for the division's closure next week, an analysis from RBN Energy said it is the pending completion of a significant amount of pipeline capacity in the region that will further squeeze drivers who", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
