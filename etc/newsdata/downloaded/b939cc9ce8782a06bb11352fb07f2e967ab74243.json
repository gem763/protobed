REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo\n\nVivendi has been a hostile Mediaset shareholder since the tycoons who control them, Vincent Bollore and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, fell out in 2016 over an aborted pay TV deal. They have been in a legal war ever since.\n\nVivendi said it wanted to vote against Mediaset\u2019s plan because a bylaw of the new group\u2019s structure would exclude it from voting at shareholder meetings.\n\nThe ruling only applies to the 9.6% stake Vivendi directly holds in Mediaset, as two-thirds of the French group\u2019s 29% total stake is currently held by an arms-length trust called Simon Fiduciaria, which has so far been barred from voting by an Italian court.\n\nThat leaves the French group with 9.99% direct voting rights.\n\nMediaset said in a statement on Saturday it was satisfied with the decision of the Milan court.\n\nIt added that the ruling explicitly barred Simon Fiduciaria to take part to Mediaset\u2019s Sept. 4 meeting, where its shareholders will be asked to approve the creation of a new Dutch holding company, dubbed Media for Europe (MFE), which will carry out a reverse takeover of Mediaset and Mediaset Espana (TL5.MC).\n\nVivendi blamed Mediaset for attempting to illegally seize control and suggested further legal action could be taken.\n\n\u201cIf Mediaset prevents Simon from voting then the EGM will be severely tainted by serious irregularities,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. \u201cA complaint would then be lodged with the Court.\u201d\n\nSimon Fiduciaria has registered to vote at Mediaset\u2019s Sept. 4 shareholders\u2019 meeting, a source said on Friday.\n\nThe trust declined to comment.", "description": "An Italian court ruled in favor of a petition filed by French media giant Vivendi to vote against Mediaset's reorganization plan, the two companies said on Saturday, although the decision was not enough to scupper the deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190831&t=2&i=1424732405&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7U0D5"}
