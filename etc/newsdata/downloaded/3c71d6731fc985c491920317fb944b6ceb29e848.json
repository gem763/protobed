Now, Variety reports that Paul Dano will fill the role in director Matt Reeves\u2019s upcoming The Batman. Robert Pattinson is of course playing the Dark Knight, and it was recently announced that Zo\u00eb Kravitz will be cracking the whip as Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright will play Commissioner Gordon, which is good, and Jonah Hill, despite the rumors, will not be in the movie at all. There\u2019s no doubt Dano has the dynamic acting chops to pull of an unhinged supervillain, so the big question becomes, will he get some jazzy bodysuits of his own and a big, gaudy cane to flounce around with? Let us hope.", "description": "Paul Dano will play the Riddler opposite Robert Pattinson in Matt Reeve\u2019s \u201cThe Batman\u201d movie, which also stars Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Catwoman.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-paul-dano.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
