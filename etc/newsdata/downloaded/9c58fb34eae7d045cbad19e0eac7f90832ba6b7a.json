And then counting on the world being both infinitely thirsty and that its purchasing power will never be dented by recession.\n\nFor what WeWork has undertaken, as disclosed in the prospectus for its erstwhile IPO, is in fact $34 billion (yes, that's billions) of rent obligations to landlords around the world over the next 15 years, highly concentrated in centers of commerce such as New York and London.\n\nIt had to shell out $1.2 billion in 2018 alone, when it was still in wildly rapid growth \u2014 and in the first six months of 2019, on an annualized basis, was paying rent of $2.5 billion per annum, and still rising.\n\nIt has also taken on $1.4 billion of corporate indebtedness (a daunting sum for a startup to be sure, but a drop in the bucket compared to its lease liabilities). This for a company that grossed less than $2.6 billion in sales for the 12 months through June, and in that period had only $232 million \u2014 after other cash operating expenses \u2014 before paying its rent bills of $2.1 billion.\n\nThe second bit of nonsense emanates from the business in which WeWork is engaged in the first place \u2014 leasing other people's real estate to tenant \"members\" with essentially no credit capacity and in a business with minimal barriers to entry, other than a willingness to pay rent.\n\nEssentially, to revert to the lemonade-stand analogy, WeWork is trading from the curb \u2014 albeit with a very expensive permit. The problem is, everyone in commercial office real estate has a curb of its own. The very landlords who actually own the space from which WeWork is plying its wares can set up, and are setting up, their own \"lemonade stands\" in the form of short-term, flexible occupancy coworking space with copious support services and tie-ins.\n\nWeWork is, to its customers, the Uber of commercial real estate (it has tried residential too, which has proved disappointing), the Johnny-on-the-spot solution that avoids one having to work out of their home or neighborhood Starbucks, or setting up costly support services.\n\nThe problem is that this form of \"Uber\" is one that has guaranteed all its drivers' pay and leased multiple fleets of cars for the next decade and a half, and then some. Long-term liabilities against short-term income streams would make no more sense to the ride-hail industry than they do to commercial real estate, even less so for the latter as real estate is far more expensive and rigid a commodity than cars and, yes, people. Landlords can provide a small fraction of their inventory for coworking, short occupancy without burying their business model in risk.\n\nFor WeWork, apparently, undertaking risk IS the business model.\n\nWeWork poses risks for the real-estate industry\n\nSo far I have expressed my dismay in terms of relevant to existing and potential shareholders of, and lenders to, WeWork. But there is more at stake here.\n\nWeWork has become a dominant player in the office market in many major cities. In New York and London, WeWork is the largest private sector office tenant, something they actually crow about. In Manhattan, the company has over 5.3 million square feet of office space, more than the entire enclosed space of the Mall of America, the largest mall in the US.\n\nNow this is, to be fair, only about 1% of the total market. But that is not the relevant metric where WeWork is concerned.\n\nBy my calculations, two years ago, in mid-2017, WeWork had about 2.4 million of space in Manhattan (2.8 million in all of New York City), and therefore added nearly 3 million square feet in Manhattan over the past 24 months.\n\nTotal leasing volume in Manhattan during that period was about 55 million square feet, the vast majority of which were lease rollovers or tenants moving from one space to another, as opposed to net new absorption (the difference between space coming to market and newly leased space). Even so, WeWork was itself 5.5% of gross leasing volume, an enormous amount for a single tenant.\n\nBut, in terms of net absorption, according to data from industry sources and my calculations, if WeWork were removed from the equation, the Manhattan market would have experienced negative absorption of roughly -700,000 square feet of leased space, as opposed to the just over 2.3 million square feet of net absorption that it experienced over the 24 months ended June. This, folks, means that at the margin WeWork is moving markets \u2014 bigly.\n\nTherefore, the precarious nature of the firm's business model not only endangers the landlords that are directly exposed to the company, but the market at large.\n\nWere the demand represented by WeWork to disappear (either in a recession, a collapse of \"tech bubble 2.0,\" and/or because other landlords move in to service such coworking demand as remains after others return to their homes or Starbucks), rents across the commercial office market would be negatively impacted, to the detriment of all participants therein (except, of course, tenants).\n\nSo, yes, Adam Neumann showed incredible chutzpah with his clowning about and his self-dealing (buying and leasing space to the company, concentration of voting rights, even claiming personal trademark rights to the word \"WE\"). But don't let all that be a distraction from what is really going on behind the curtain (wall). The business model itself defies both common sense and market realities.\n\nDan Alpert is an adjunct professor at Cornell Law School, a senior fellow in macroeconomics and finance at the school's Jack C.
