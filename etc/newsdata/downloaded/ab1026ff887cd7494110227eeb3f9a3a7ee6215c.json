The new show will be adapted from New York Times reporter Mike Isaac\u2019s recent book, Super Pumped, and it will focus on former Uber CEO and founder Travis Kalanick.\n\nIf the series roughly traces the arc of the book, Billions showrunners Brian Koppelman and David Levien could follow the famously pugnacious founder\u2019s path from serial entrepreneur to his horrid final year of running Uber in 2017, which was marked by ceaseless scandal. Kalanick\u2019s final act as CEO of Uber also seems like fodder for Koppelman and Levien, as it involved the kind of boardroom drama the showrunning duo have indulged in across four seasons of Billions.\n\nhi im really excited for this@briankoppelman and @DavidLevien are singular talents and i can\u2019t believe i get to work with them and @Showtime to make SUPER PUMPED a show! pic.twitter.com/I9sjaBWnBK \u2014 rat king (@MikeIsaac) October 16, 2019\n\nShowtime Entertainment president Jana Winograde said as much to The Hollywood Reporter, framing the story of Uber as one \u201crich in plot twists, one-of-a-kind personalities and important implications for corporate America,\u201d and calling it \u201ca case study of ingenuity and insanity.\u201d\n\nDetails of the project are still being worked out before it heads into pre-production. It\u2019s not the only Uber project in the works, either. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler\u2019s infamous 2017 blog post, which detailed some of the company\u2019s discriminatory and misogynistic exploits, is being developed for the big screen.\n\nShould Koppelman and Levien\u2019s adaptation get picked up by Showtime, it will also be interesting to see if it touches on Isaac\u2019s own involvement in the final act of Super Pumped. Without giving too much away, Isaac became something of an unwitting pawn in the corporate drama surrounding Kalanick\u2019s ouster, which he details in his book. If they do include this part of Super Pumped, one can only hope Showtime casts the Charmin bear for the role of Isaac.", "description": "The story of Uber\u2019s messy, meteoric transformation from tech startup to dominant player in the global transportation industry is being developed into a limited television series by the co-creators and showrunners of Showtime\u2019s Billions.
