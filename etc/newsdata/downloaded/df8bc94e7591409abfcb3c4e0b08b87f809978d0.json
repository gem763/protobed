The burial with full military honours is the culmination of the 'Dig Hill 80' project that discovered the remains of the soldiers in 2018\n\nThe service was held at the Wytschaete Military Cemetery where 13 unknown soldiers who died fighting in Belgium in the First World War were given full military burials\n\n'Even though we do not know their names, we remember their humanity and courage and that even in the hell of battle they were there for each other even to death.\n\n'So in prayer and celebration, we place these men together in this consecrated and special ground, so that they rest in peace and we learn and make sure humanity endures in its fullness.\n\n'As we commit the remains of our brothers to the deep, grant them peace and tranquillity.'\n\nAfter the burial, shots from the traditional four-gun salute to the fallen echoed across the quiet clearing.\n\nThe Exhortation was read out, with guests repeating the famous promise: 'We will remember them.'\n\nMusic was performed by a joint venture between British and German schoolchildren, to symbolise peace and co-operation.\n\nPupils from Mildenhall College Academy in Bury St Edmunds and St Joseph's College, Ipswich, formed the contribution from the UK.\n\nThe service came as a result of the hard work of those at the Dig Hill 80 project, who excavated Hill 80 \u2013 the site of a German gun emplacement where many UK and Commonwealth soldiers fell.\n\nThe project led a 1.1-hectare crowdfunded archaeological excavation, which took place at the former site of Hill 80 in Wytschaete, on land that had been allocated for future housing development.\n\nCoffins arriving for a burial service at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Wytschaete Military Cemetery, near Ypres, Belgium, for thirteen unknown soldiers who died fighting in Belgium in the First World War\n\nThe project excavated 550 metres of trenches and 430 bomb craters, with the remains of 110 soldiers discovered, including British, French, German and South African personnel.\n\nDig Hill 80 was highly publicised at the time, attracting international media attention and celebrity patronage from comedian Al Murray and support from military historian Dan Snow.\n\nIt has not been possible to identify the 13 unknown soldiers who were buried today, but at least two are believed to be British.\n\nThree Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstones will mark their collective final resting places, which will be cared for by the commission in perpetuity.\n\nIn keeping with burial tradition, the casualties were interred together, ensuring that those who served and died together are buried and commemorated together.\n\nHill 80 was the site of a windmill before the First World War, but became an entrenched German gun position following the capture of the village of Wytschaete in 1914.\n\nThe location afforded observational advantage to the Germans as it overlooked the town of Ypres and formed part of the Messines Ridge.\n\nThe site remained in German hands until the Battle of Messines in June 1917, when it was recaptured.\n\nIn 1918, Hill 80 was again taken by the Germans during the Battle of the Lys, before finally returning to Allied hands in September 1918.\n\nDig Hill 80 head archaeologist Simon Verdegem said: 'It is now about a year since the investigation into the soldiers of Hill 80 was completed.\n\n'Thanks to massive international support from individuals and organisations, enough money was raised through crowdfunding to make a detailed excavation possible.\n\nCoffins arriving for the burial service today. The Dig Hill 80 project excavated 550 metres of trenches and 430 bomb craters, with the remains of 110 soldiers discovered, including British, French, German and South African personnel\n\n'The aim was not only to excavate the trenches but also to recover the soldiers. Now, the British and German soldiers will finally be given a definitive and dignified resting place along with their comrades. I dare to believe that it gives them peace, knowing that people from all over the world have joined forces to recover their mortal remains.\n\n'In my opinion, this can count as a symbol of peace and reconciliation.'\n\nCWGC director general Victoria Wallace said: 'It is always moving and a real privilege to attend reburials.\n\n'And it's a credit to the team who excavated Hill 80 that they have recovered these men at last, who will now be laid to rest with former comrades, and cared for in perpetuity by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\n'It is sad that the men cannot be identified individually, but they will never be forgotten, by their nation, or by the people of Flanders who always show such respect for our war dead.'\n\nThe German soldiers discovered on Hill 80 will be laid to rest on Friday at the German war cemetery in Langemark.", "description": "The 13 unidentified WWI dead - all from the UK and Commonwealth nations - were buried side-by-side with full military honours near Ypres in Belgium.
