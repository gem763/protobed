And that is the worst and most dangerous thing he could do because it gives some people the impression that this is exclusively about politics, when what it\u2019s about is the soul and the heart of this country.\u201d\n\nThere is little indication that Nadler, a 26-year congressional veteran who represents New York\u2019s 10th District, is ready to take public note of Boylan\u2019s challenge, much less appear on a debate stage with her. (His spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.) But there are plenty of signs that Boylan, who has been touted by some political observers as the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and reported raising an unexpected $264,657 last July, has already had a huge impact on Nadler, pushing him to launch a long-shot impeachment inquiry.\n\nAll through 2018 and well into this year, Nadler consistently downplayed the idea of trying to prematurely remove Trump from office, taking his cues from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a partisan impeachment vote would only be doomed to failure in the Senate and could backfire on Democrats politically. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like we\u2019re heading for impeachment \u2014 probably we\u2019re not,\u201d Nadler said at a press breakfast on May 15, nearly a month after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to cover it up.\n\nBut then \u2014 as a number of commentators have noted \u2014 Nadler appeared to start hearing Boylan\u2019s footsteps. Pronouncing herself a proud progressive, she announced her candidacy in April and began releasing videos that mocked Nadler for his failure to stand up to Pelosi and aggressively go after Trump, such as one titled \u201cImpeachment Now.\u201d\n\nWith memories still fresh of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stunning 2018 upset of veteran New York Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley, Nadler began to change his tune. On July 26, the week after Boylan reported her healthy fundraising haul, he told reporters the Judiciary Committee would go to court in an attempt to obtain records and demand testimony so it could consider \u201cwhether we should recommend articles of impeachment to the House.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, on July 28, he told CNN that Trump \u201crichly deserves impeachment.\u201d\n\nNadler\u2019s shift drew notice. \u201cCould concerns about a primary challenger be behind Nadler\u2019s impeachment posturing?\u201d ran the headline in the Washington Post on a column by veteran Republican consultant Ed Rogers, who compared Boylan to a \u201cmore experienced version of Ocasio-Cortez.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, no question,\u201d Boylan replied when asked if she thought her primary challenge is what prompted Nadler to initiate what has now become a formal impeachment inquiry. Her challenge, she said, \u201chas clearly piqued him. I wished it piqued him more \u2014 and I wished it piqued him earlier because we should be impeaching this president.\u201d\n\nBoylan spoke to \u201cSkullduggery\u201d on a day when former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was appearing before the House Judiciary Committee, refusing time and again to answer any questions and clearly frustrating Nadler\u2019s efforts to build on the evidence of obstruction contained in Mueller\u2019s report. It was, Boylan said, a further indication that Nadler\u2019s impeachment efforts had become a \u201ccharade.\u201d", "description": "Lindsey Boylan has mounted a surprisingly strong bid to unseat Rep.
