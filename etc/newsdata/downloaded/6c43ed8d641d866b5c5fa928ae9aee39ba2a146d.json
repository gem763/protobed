They have been holding thousands of captured IS fighters in prisons and tens of thousands of their relatives in detention.\n\nSDF forces were still in control of all prisons with Islamic State captives, a senior U.S. State Department official said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe United States has received a high-level commitment from Turkey on taking responsibility for Islamic State captives but has not yet had detailed discussions, the official said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers and media have said Trump essentially gave Erdogan the green light for Turkey\u2019s military to go into northeast Syria but the official disputed that. \u201cWe gave them a very clear red light, I\u2019ve been involved in those red lights and I know the President did that on Sunday,\u201d the official said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said 228 militants had been killed so far in the offensive. Kurds said they were resisting the assault. At least 23 fighters with the SDF and six fighters with a Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group had been killed, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.\n\nAIR STRIKES\n\nThe SDF said Turkish air strikes and shelling had also killed nine civilians. In an apparent retaliation by Kurdish-led forces, six people including a 9-month-old baby were killed by mortar and rocket fire into Turkish border towns, officials in southeastern Turkey said.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee said 64,000 people in Syria have fled since the campaign began. The towns of Ras al-Ain and Darbasiya, some 60 km (37 miles) to the east, have become largely deserted.\n\nThe Observatory said Turkish forces had seized two villages near Ras al-Ain and five near the town of Tel Abyad, while a spokesman for Syrian rebel forces said the towns were surrounded after fighters seized the villages around them.\n\nAccording to a senior Turkish security official, the armed forces struck weapons and ammunition depots, gun and sniper positions, tunnels and military bases.\n\nJets flew operations up to 30 km (18 miles) into Syria - a limit which Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said Turkish forces would not go beyond. A Reuters journalist saw shells exploding just outside Tel Abyad.\n\nAnkara brands the YPG militia as terrorists because of their ties to militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey. On Thursday, Turkish police began criminal investigations of several Kurdish lawmakers and detained scores of people in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, accusing them of criticizing the military\u2019s incursion into Syria, state media reported.\n\nLate on Thursday, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar spoke by phone with his French, British and U.S. counterparts, the defense ministry said. It said Akar and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper discussed defense and security issues, and added that Akar briefed Esper on the aims and progress of the incursion.\n\nGeneral view of fire burning and smoke billowing out in distance in border town Tel Abyad in Syria seen from Akcakale, Turkey October 10, 2019. REUTERS/ReutersTV\n\nTRUMP CRITICIZED\n\nTrump has faced rare criticism from senior figures in his own Republican Party who accuse him of deserting loyal U.S. allies. Trump has called the Turkish assault a \u201cbad idea\u201d and said he did not endorse it.\n\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who usually backs Trump, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. He unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\n\u201cIf there is any measure taken against us, we will retaliate and respond in kind,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, adding that \u201cnothing will come of these sanctions.\u201d\n\nAfter the U.N. Security Council met to discuss the fighting, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Turkey faced unspecified \u201cconsequences\u201d if it did not meet its pledge to protect vulnerable populations or contain Islamic State fighters.\n\nLater, the U.S. State Department official said the United States would penalize Turkey if it engages in any \u201cinhumane and disproportionate\u201d moves against civilians. That would include \u201cethnic cleansing, it would include in particular indiscriminate artillery, air and other fires directed at civilian population,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at right now, we haven\u2019t seen significant examples of that so far.\u201d\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for an emergency meeting of the coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Islamic State. The coalition \u201cneeds to say today what are we going do, how do you, Turkey, want to proceed and how do we ensure the security of places where fighters are held? Everything needs to be on the table so that we are clear,\u201d Le Drian said on France 2 television.\n\nErdogan said militants from Islamic State would not be allowed to rebuild a presence in the region.\n\nThe Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria said a prison that holds \u201cthe most dangerous criminals from more than 60 nationalities\u201d had been struck by Turkish shelling, and Turkey\u2019s attacks on its prisons risked \u201ca catastrophe\u201d.\n\nNATO member Turkey has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for the return of millions of refugees to Syria.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nErdogan threatened to permit Syrian refugees in Turkey to move to Europe if EU countries described his forces\u2019 move as an occupation. Turkey hosts around 3.6 million people who have fled the Syrian war.\n\nThe European Union should have a dialogue with Turkey despite Ankara\u2019s offensive against the Kurds, in order to avoid a fresh wave of migrants coming to Europe, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Thursday.\n\nRussia, the main international backer of Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad, said it planned to push for dialogue between the Syrian and Turkish governments following the incursion.", "description": "Turkey pounded Kurdish militia in northeast Syria for a second day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee and killing at least dozens of people in a cross-border assault on U.S. allies that has turned the Washington establishment against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439430249&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9929E", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
