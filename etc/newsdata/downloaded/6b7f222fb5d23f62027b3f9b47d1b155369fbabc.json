Photographers stories of capturing extreme weather 1/8 \"I stumbled on the firefighter in front of the burning home on the second day of the Camp Fire in a town called Magalia which is about five miles from Paradise, California. There were about five or six homes burning and firefighters were trying to save the houses near to those that were on fire. The heat from the fire was so intense that the firefighter could only stand near the burning building for 10-15 seconds before having to move away\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 2/8 \"This was only one of several large-scale forest fires in Brandenburg state in Germany last year, following droughts which left the forests in the region extremely dry. The year set a new record for fires that burned over 400 hectares. As a photojournalist covering the region for over 15 years, I now have to assume either drought or floods will very likely be a part of the news we will be covering every summer\" - Sean Gallup Getty 3/8 \"This photograph was taken at a sunflower field at Goersdorf near Golssen in Germany. The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue\" - Sean Gallup Getty 4/8 \"On the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills. I captured this photo in Big Bend, as the story was shifting away from the fire itself and focusing on trying to locate missing persons and recover remains of those who had perished\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 5/8 \"You can see the Belchatow power plant and the rising steam and smoke from over 20km away. I went there the day before the start of the United Nations\u2019 climate conference in Katowice, which took place in a region where coal has a long history and coal mining is woven into local tradition. Poland has made some strides with renewables, such as with wind turbines that now dot portions of the western Polish countryside. However, given how heavily Poland still relies on coal, it is unlikely that Belchatow will close anytime soon. According to a recent study by the European Commission Belchatow is Europe\u2019s biggest single emitter of CO2\" - Sean Gallup Getty 6/8 \"I stayed the night at an alpine hut near the Waxeggkees glacier in Austria. An employee I talked to at night said, sometimes (this was August) she heard the sounds of ice breaking off the glacier and crashing across rocks. 100 years ago the glacier would have filled the photo. Now it takes over an hour to walk up to where the glacier begins\" - Sean Gallup, photographer Getty Images 7/8 \"I came across Mr. Helmut Kujat, 78, by chance after I photographed a parched farm nearby. He\u2019s actually pouring the water into a tube that helps to better let the water reach the roots of the tree. He waters the trees in front of his house almost daily throughout spring and summer due to droughts and heat waves\" - Sean Gallup Getty 8/8 \"I took this photo about a week after the Camp Fire tore through the town of Paradise, California in November last year. It was the first opportunity to use a DJI Mavic Pro 2 drone to view the widespread devastation since the air space around the burn zone had been closed\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 1/8 \"I stumbled on the firefighter in front of the burning home on the second day of the Camp Fire in a town called Magalia which is about five miles from Paradise, California.

The heavy rain will be accompanied by hail, thunderstorms and gusty winds, leading to flooding and difficult driving conditions.\u201d\n\nMr Armstrong said the weather would clear later in the evening though there would still be patches of significant rain over the coming days.\n\n\u201cThis system will clear eastwards later on Tuesday, however low-pressure will stay in charge for the rest of the week, with largely bright and breezy weather and some showers or longer spells of rain at times,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Armstrong said the weather was unlikely to clear in time for the weekend, with more rain bringing further risk of flooding.", "description": "Heavy rain, gusty winds, hail, thunder, and lightning are on the cards for much of England and Wales this week, bringing with it the threat of flooding that could pose a \u201cdanger to life\u201d.
