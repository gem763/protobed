As it happened, the 49ers\u2019 first regular-season game was scheduled for Raymond James Stadium against Alexander\u2019s former team.\n\nAlexander\u2019s return, and any hopes of being a hero for his new team against the Buccaneers, were short-lived.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith just over a minute left in the first quarter, Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston dropped back, then decided to scramble up the middle.\n\nAt the end of his 5-yard gain, Winston slid in front of Alexander. While he was sliding, Alexander came in and drilled him helmet-to-helmet.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers linebacker Kwon Alexander (56) hits Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston. Alexander was ejected for the head-to-head hit. (AP)\n\nNot only was Alexander flagged 15 yards, putting Tampa Bay well into San Francisco territory, the one-time Pro Bowler was ejected from the game.\n\nContinuing the drive, Tampa Bay had a touchdown taken off the board twice because of holding penalties, and then came away empty-handed when tight end O.J. Howard was stripped at the 49ers\u2019 8-yard line by linebacker Fred Warner; defensive end Ronald Blair got the loose ball.\n\nA fourth-round pick out of LSU in 2015, Alexander was playing his first game in almost 11 months, having torn his ACL in the Buccaneers\u2019 Week 7 game against Cleveland last year.\n\nThe 49ers won, 31-17.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Alexander was booted before the first quarter had ended.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tT2seK9kK7sS_9Ed.7oOgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JmByRwXrARlRls2lwqTKFQ--~B/aD0yMjU2O3c9MzM4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/32cfa7a0-d27f-11e9-b48e-cc5b41601541", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
