The company said it will roll out to other devices later \"this year.\"\n\nPerhaps the most highly anticipated new feature for the world's most popular smartphone operating system is gesture navigation that lets users seamlessly swipe between apps and the home screen. Similar to the iPhone X, users of Android 10 can swipe up to return home. Google also replaced the bottom bar with left or right arrows with the ability to swipe between apps.\n\nAndroid 10 also has a new dark theme, which reverts the screen to \"true black\" that promises to help prolong battery life and be more appealing to the eyes. It also comes with new designs for 65 emoji, including gender-inclusive designs. Previously, the police officer emoji was displayed as male and the \"person getting haircut\" was a female. The new default options for those emoji, and others, will have a gender-ambigious design.\n\nOther features include Focus Mode, which disables apps from annoying users when they want to concentrate, and Live Caption, which automatically captions video and podcasts. Both of these tools are currently in beta.\n\nRead More", "description": "Google has officially released Android 10, its new mobile operating system with several new features, including dark mode and gesture navigation.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190904081005-google-pixel-phone---stock-super-tease.jpg"}
