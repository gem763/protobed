Dries Mertens converted the spot kick and an uncharacteristic mistake from Virgil van Dijk enabled Fernando Llorente to seal victory in the final seconds. Andy Felix Brych\u2019s decision to award a penalty against Robertson was not deemed a clear and obvious error by VAR, however, leaving Klopp to lament the regulations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there are different views on that situation,\u201d the Liverpool manager said of the penalty. \u201cBut when the player jumps before there is contact then there can not be a penalty. That was the game-changer. It was very decisive in the moment. I could say a lot of things about it but I\u2019m not a bad loser. I\u2019m not the best loser, but I\u2019m not bad.\u201d\n\nAs for VAR\u2019s involvement, Klopp added: \u201cIt\u2019s a decision made by human beings. The rules say if it is not a clear mistake and it\u2019s still humans who decide if it\u2019s a mistake. I think it (VAR) will help in the long-term but as long as human beings make the decision there is still potential for failure. We are all like this. What can I say?\n\n\u201cThe rules are like this, and they\u2019d have to adjust the rules. The German (refereeing) team, they do it for a while already, the VAR was also German, they have been using it longer than others. They will find an explanation about why they did the right thing, that\u2019s how it is. If he didn\u2019t whistle for the penalty he wouldn\u2019t have been overruled by VAR. We all wanted to have more clarification in these things, now we don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nNapoli coach Carlo Ancelotti refused to be drawn into the controversy. He said: \u201cIt looked like a penalty from where I was sat but I haven\u2019t seen a replay and I don\u2019t want to get drawn into that.\u201d", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp claimed Liverpool were undone by a dive and that Video Assistant Referees remain at the mercy of human error after their Champions League defence started with defeat in Napoli", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aac52641c4be9d9cb30b564f477861cc8e4b110/0_0_3689_2213/master/3689.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30943ba57954bde67da79504d0767a92", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
