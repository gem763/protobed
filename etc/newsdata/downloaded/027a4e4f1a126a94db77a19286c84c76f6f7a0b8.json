Clarke replaced original actress Tamzin Merchant in the role of Daenerys after HBO allowed showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss to re-shoot and re-cast their disastrous first pilot.\n\nHowever, it seems that for now at least, Bloodmoon will not be granted a similar fate and is dead in the water. Westeros fans shouldn\u2019t worry, however, as another prequel \u2013 this time focusing on House Targaryen \u2013 was commissioned for a full series just hours after the Watts-starring show was axed.\n\nHouse of the Dragon will adapt author Martin\u2019s quasi-historical fiction Fire and Blood, which tracks the Targaryen\u2019s arrival in Westeros, the establishment of their royal dynasty and the massive battle caused by an inter-family civil war known as The Dance of the Dragons.\n\nThe news of Bloodmoon\u2019s axing also comes just a day after former Game of Thrones bosses Benioff and Weiss dropped out of writing a new trilogy of Star Wars films.\n\nGame of Thrones seasons 1-8 are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
