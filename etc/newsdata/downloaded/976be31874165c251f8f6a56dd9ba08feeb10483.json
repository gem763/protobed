We\u2019re scared", "language": "en", "text": "Will Daryl and Carol leaver The Walking Dead together? (Picture: AMC)\n\nEveryone\u2019s favourite zombie-fighting buddies, Daryl and Carol, finally got reunited in the premiere of The Walking Dead season 10. But is the show\u2019s endgame on the way, and could the two survivors actually leave together?\n\nCarol (Melissa McBride) finally returned to the zombie apocalypse after months away at sea, and it was pretty clear from the off that both she and Daryl (Norman Reedus) are now tired of fighting.\n\nAfter the loss of Henry, who was murdered by the Whisperers leader Alpha (Samantha Morton), we saw the series stalwart consider running away, with her best friend joining her.\n\nThe besties reunited in the premiere for The Walking Dead season 10 (Picture: AMC)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You ever wonder if this is all there is?\u2019 Carol asked Daryl. \u2018Just run into people, kill each other until whoever\u2019s left says enough?\u2019\n\n\u2018No more fighting,\u2019 Daryl replied. \u2018Just get on the bike and go. See who\u2019s left.\u2019\n\nIf audiences are wondering if the two could actually leave the show, they maybe should be legitimately worried. In the past few seasons, the AMC hit hasn\u2019t held back when it comes to the exits of its main stars. Andrew Lincoln\u2019s Rick Grimes \u2013 The Walking Dead\u2019s head honcho \u2013 has left to kickstart his own movie series and we\u2019re coming ever closer to Danai Gurira\u2019s last scenes as Michonne, which will apparently come with \u2018massive\u2019 consequences.\n\nThe duo have been pulled back into conflict with The Whisperers (Picture: AMC)\n\nNorman has already spoken out on the possibility of Daryl and Carol leaving the road, especially now since the war-weary duo have been pulled back into conflict with the Whisperers.\n\nThe actor told Entertainment Weekly: \u2018Life is so hard sometimes, especially on that show for those characters. They say, \u201cWhat if we did this?\u201d They\u2019re kind of daydreaming about stuff. We\u2019re kind of window-shopping opportunities. I think it\u2019s what you would do. You\u2019d be, \u201cMeh, I just wish things would be different right now.\u201d So it\u2019s two friends doing that. Sparking a little openness to them.\u2019\n\nAlthough as they say, when one door closes another must open and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) is definitely returning for the new season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Walking Dead airs in the UK every Monday on Fox.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
