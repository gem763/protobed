Its initial public offering has had several false starts.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, wants a valuation of $2tn (\u00a31.55tn) for the firm.\n\nHowever, bankers have put the valuation at between $1.2tn and $1.5tn.\n\nSome investors are concerned about the future for oil prices which, while fluctuating wildly, have fallen over the past five years due to stable demand and oversupply.\n\nIn addition, markets were shaken by drone attacks on 14 September which initially halved Aramco's output.\n\nSome foreign investors have been wary of putting money into Saudi Arabia due to concern over its human rights record and the commercial viability of some projects.\n\nBut attendees on Tuesday said the turnout was impressive and reflected reforms to modernise the largest Arab economy.\n\nPrince Mohammed in 2016 launched a plan to transform the economy of the world's largest crude exporter in part by developing non-energy industries.\n\nBut state oil giant Aramco remains a big draw for some investors.\n\nTiming\n\nSaudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said on Tuesday that Aramco will start investor subscription on 4 December, citing sources.\n\nThe transaction price will be announced on 17 November, and Aramco will start trading on 11 December, the broadcaster reported.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed first flagged the prospect of an Aramco flotation three years ago.\n\n'Desert Davos'\n\nSaudi Arabia has attracted high-profile business and political figures to its \"Davos in the Desert\" event, including some who stayed away last year over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nOn 2 October 2018 Mr Khashoggi, a journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nUN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, who led an investigation into his death, concluded that the State of Saudi Arabia was responsible for a \"premeditated extrajudicial execution\".\n\nThe investor event, under way in Riyadh, features US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who pulled out last time.\n\nMr Mnuchin said the Aramco listing will be a \"great opportunity for developing Saudi capital markets\".\n\nIn 2017 Donald Trump made a pitch for Aramco to be listed in America, saying it was \"important\" to the US.\n\nOthers who have changed their minds about staying away from the conference include the bosses of Credit Suisse, Blackstone and BlackRock.\n\nHSBC's John Flint dropped out in 2018, but interim boss Noel Quinn is there.\n\nThe event, officially known as the Future Investment Initiative, is being held for the third time and is viewed as the kingdom's key annual investment event.\n\nIt is organised by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and despite its nickname, has no connection with the World Economic Forum's annual event in the Swiss resort of Davos.", "description": "Stock market flotation of one of the world's most profitable firms 'soon' says energy minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0C48/production/_109444130_desertdavos_rtr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
