Here's How to Know", "language": "en", "text": "Is It Time to Refinance Your Mortgage? Here's How to Know\n\nHave you been paying attention to mortgage rates? They're the lowest in years, and they've fallen so far in a relatively short time that it might make sense to refinance to a lower rate and cut your monthly payment \u2014 even if your current home loan is only a year old.\n\nRefinancing also is a great way to tap into a home's rising value. Multiple studies indicate that home values nationwide have recovered so well that they're now higher than they were before the Great Recession.\n\nYou may be ripe for a refi. Ask yourself these questions to know if it's the right move.\n\nWhy do you want to refinance?\n\nSam Wordley / Shutterstock\n\nA refinance can be a great way to cut your monthly mortgage payment.\n\nMore\n\nWe've already mentioned two excellent reasons: 1) You want to take advantage of today's low mortgage rates; and 2) You want to cut your monthly mortgage payment.\n\nThanks to falling rates, homeowners who refinanced in the spring of 2019 are saving an average $1,700 a year, or about $140 a month, says Freddie Mac.\n\nAnother great reason to refi is if you have a variable-rate mortgage and can lock in a low fixed rate.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages \u2014 or ARMs \u2014 often have attractive rates to start, but your interest rate can rise after the introductory years are over. With a fixed-rate mortgage, there are none of those sorts of surprises.\n\nBe careful about refinancing if your goal is to cash out some equity to pay other bills. If you have as much trouble with the refi as you did with the other debt, you could wind up losing your house.\n\nPlus, under the 2017 tax law, the interest on the cash-out portion of the loan probably isn't deductible if you use the money to pay down other debt.\n\nCan you dump your current loan?\n\nwavebreakmedia / Shutterstock\n\nMake sure your lender will let you out of your existing mortgage.\n\nMore\n\nYour existing mortgage loan may carry a penalty if you pay it off early, like during the first few years.\n\nThese prepayment penalties aren't common, though you might find them with interest-only mortgages and other unconventional loans. The cost could make you decide quickly against a refinance.\n\nAlso, some local government grant programs, such as for fixer-uppers or first-time homebuyers, carry special terms that can make refinacing difficult.\n\nYou might have to jump through lots of legal hoops that are in place to prevent house flippers from using the grants to buy properties they intend to resell quickly.\n\nRead your loan documents carefully to find out if you have a prepayment penalty or other refi restrictions.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Tempted by lower mortgage rates?
