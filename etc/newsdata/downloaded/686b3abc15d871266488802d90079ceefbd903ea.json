It\u2019s the startling opening of Everything I See I Swallow, a show that won a Fringe First at the Edinburgh festival this summer, a two-hander devised by actors and aerialists Maisy Taylor (the suspended woman) and Tamsin Shasha with director Helen Tennison.\n\nWhat Taylor is demonstrating is the art of shibari, the centuries-old practice of Japanese rope bondage, which began as an elaborate way for samurai to restrain their captives and has evolved into an erotic art. Your first thoughts might be: this seems like a niche interest. But it\u2019s the spark for a piece of theatre that speaks to something universal and pressing, about the rights of women over their own bodies, the ramifications of digital life, and that knotty old question: can it ever be empowering for a woman to take her clothes off in public?\n\nShasha plays Miranda, a woman appalled to discover her artist daughter Olivia (Taylor) has been posting semi-naked pictures of herself online. Their ensuing standoff is a primer on contemporary feminism and navigating sexuality in the internet age. That the pair have done their homework is evident (thinkers from Andrea Dworkin to Beyonc\u00e9 are namechecked) and the occasionally heavy-handed script can be self-consciously learned, but the fact is it\u2019s fascinating territory, constantly evolving and full of complexity.\n\nThe pair act out an unusually frank but believable mother-daughter bond, the calm self-possession of Taylor, 25, versus the fraught energy of Shasha, 53. The aerialism is contemplative and illustrative, the umbilical attachment of mother and daughter stretching as the girl grows up, or Miranda tying herself in literal as well as figurative knots with the argument at hand. Different modes of text layer up: conventional scenes, direct address to the audience, quotes from feminist theory and naturalistic voiceovers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Contemplative and illustrative aerialism ... Everything I See I Swallow. Photograph: Claire Clifton Coles\n\nTaylor\u2019s monologues are some of the most authentic-feeling sections and her character is semi-autobiographical. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been exploring in my life anyway,\u201d she says of the show\u2019s subject matter when we speak after a sold-out performance at London\u2019s Jacksons Lane arts centre. \u201cI spent three years at circus school and when I left I started working as a cabaret performer in a strip club. I was performing rope shows, mostly naked, and I was trying to explore why people have such strong views on women in sex work and women posting nude photos online. And whether that behaviour can be empowered or whether it\u2019s always part of the problem.\u201d\n\nSome of the things Taylor speaks about in Swallow raise important questions about how we bring up girls. As a child she was always told how pretty she was, to the point where she began to resent the assessment of a quality that seemed nothing to do with who she was. It drove her to dissociate from her body, she tells us, and the unexpected way she reconnected was through shibari, finding complete peace in deliberately giving up control.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating personal history, but incorporated into the show\u2019s narrative it raises plenty of questions: Who holds the power when you put an image into the public realm? How do you manage the gap between intention and reception? After all, one person\u2019s art may be another\u2019s porn; you may feel empowered but you can still be objectified.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In knots ...

Photograph: Ambar Dandrea Photography\n\nOlivia\u2019s fourth-wave feminism jars with her mother\u2019s outlook, with Miranda struggling to protect her daughter and her generation\u2019s hard-won gains in equality. Shasha feels similarly. \u201cBut we do need to talk about these things,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to have that conversation. I\u2019ve become very woke making the show.\u201d\n\nI ask Taylor about her own mum\u2019s reaction to what she does. \u201cMy mum\u2019s great, she\u2019s very supportive,\u201d she says. Taylor\u2019s parents were part of the new age traveller movement and very open-minded. \u201cMy family trust that I have really good reasons for doing what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she says. There\u2019s a condescension towards women who are \u201coutwardly sexual\u201d, she thinks. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018They can\u2019t possibly know what they\u2019re doing, they need to be helped.\u2019 And no one who knows me would ever think that.\u201d\n\nFor Taylor, all her work, whether shibari or circus or strip-club shows, is a form of research, and Swallow is a vehicle for discussion, not a conclusion. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know where we sit is part of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI know there\u2019s something wrong with the sexualised imagery we see of women every day, but I don\u2019t think the answer is to totally strip sex out of life \u2013 it won\u2019t work. We need to normalise sexual desire and expression rather than having it as this secret everyone carries around with them and is terrified of because it\u2019s somehow anti-feminist.\u201d\n\nChallenging, provocative and funny, too, Swallow is a brave dissection of the intergenerational divide where the personal is undeniably political.\n\n\u2022 Everything I See I Swallow is at Arena theatre, Wolverhampton, 9 October; Cornerstone Arts Centre, Didcot, 10 October; and Lakeside theatre, Colchester, 6-7 November.", "description": "Everything I See I Swallow raises challenging questions about how we bring up girls.
