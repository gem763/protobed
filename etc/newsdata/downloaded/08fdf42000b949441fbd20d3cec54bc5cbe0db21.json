Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.\n\nThe two Democratic congresswomen, part of \u201cThe Squad,\u201d urged supporters on Twitter to contribute to the bail fund for counter-protesters who tangled with law enforcement at the Saturday melee.\n\nBoston police arrested 36 people, charging nine with assault and battery on a police officer. Four officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries as they attempted to prevent the antifa-fueled crowd of about 1,000 counter-protesters from mixing it up with an estimated 200 parade participants.\n\nIt was unclear how many of those arrested were affiliated with antifa, but photos posted online showed a black-clad antifa activist being carried off by police. Antifa protesters attempting to block a road scuffled with officers, as shown on video.\n\nOthers arrested were charged with crimes including resisting arrest; disorderly conduct; assault; carrying a dangerous weapon, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon, according to a police log posted by the Boston Herald.\n\nFortunately for counter-protesters facing charges, the first-term congresswomen had their backs.\n\nThe Democrats posted tweets in support of a crowdfunding campaign on FundRazr to cover legal fees and jail support for those arrested. The campaign closed after raising $24,652, surpassing its $15,000 goal.\n\nOne way to support the local LGBTQ community impacted by Boston\u2019s white supremacist parade?\n\n\n\nContribute to the Bail Fund for the activists who put themselves on the line protecting the Boston community:https://t.co/z2NRSqHMve\n\n\n\n(Any $ left over goes to @MassBailFund+@Boston_GLASS) https://t.co/G9xhIda6sF \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 1, 2019\n\n\u201cJoin me right now in making a contribution,\u201d tweeted Ms. Pressley. \u201cTY to the allies & accomplices who stood in the gap & laid their bodies on the line today in affront #LGBT hate march.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez chimed in by encouraging donations to aid \u201cthe activists who put themselves on the line protecting the Boston community.\u201d\n\nShe called it \u201cBoston\u2019s white supremacist parade,\u201d although the event, sponsored by the group Super Happy Fun America, featured several black speakers, according to the website.\n\nThe FundRazr page said that \u201cfascists and white supremacists, under the front organization Super Happy Fun America, are descending on Boston,\u201d vowing that \u201cBoston will repel them with beautiful and bold direct action!\u201d\n\nBoston PD has released log of arrested individuals from Saturday\u2019s antifa counter-protest against the Straight Pride.
