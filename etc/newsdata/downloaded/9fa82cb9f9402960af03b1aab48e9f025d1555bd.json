The black population grew from 2,000 to 20,000 during the war, and the majority of the new residents lived in a place called Vanport, a city of houses nestled between Portland and Vancouver, Washington, constructed for the new residents. Yet after the war, blacks were encouraged to leave Oregon, Millner said, with the mayor of Portland commenting in a newspaper article that black people were not welcome. The Housing Authority of Portland mulled dismantling Vanport, and jobs for black people disappeared as white soldiers returned from war and displaced the men and women who had found jobs in the shipyards.\n\nDismantling Vanport proved unnecessary. In May of 1948, the Columbia River flooded, wiping out Vanport in a single day. Residents had been assured that the dikes protecting the housing were safe, and some lost everything in the flood. At least 15 residents died, though some locals formulated a theory that the housing authority had quietly disposed of hundreds more bodies to cover up its slow response. The 18,500 residents of Vanport\u20146,300 of whom were black\u2014had to find somewhere else to live.\n\nFor black residents, the only choice, if they wanted to stay in Portland, was a neighborhood called Albina that had emerged as a popular place to live for the black porters who worked in nearby Union Station. It was the only place black people were allowed to buy homes, after, in 1919, the Realty Board of Portland had approved a Code of Ethics forbidding realtors and bankers from selling or giving loans to minorities for properties located in white neighborhoods.\n\nAs black people moved into Albina, whites moved out; by the end of the 1950s, there were 23,000 fewer white residents and 7,000 more black residents than there had been at the beginning of the decade.\n\nThe neighborhood of Albina began to be the center of black life in Portland. But for outsiders, it was something else: a blighted slum in need of repair.\n\n* * *\n\nToday, North Williams Avenue, which cuts through the heart of what was once Albina, is emblematic of the \u201cnew\u201d Portland. Fancy condos with balconies line the street, next to juice stores and hipster bars with shuffleboard courts. Ed Washington remembers when this was a majority black neighborhood more than a half a century ago, when his parents moved their family to Portland during the war in order to get jobs in the shipyard. He says every house on his street, save one, was owned by black families.\n\n\u201cAll these people on the streets, they used to be black people,\u201d he told me, gesturing at a couple with sleeve tattoos, white people pushing baby strollers up the street.\n\nSince the postwar population boom, Albina has been the target of a decades of \u201crenewal\u201d and redevelopment plans, like many black neighborhoods across the country.\n\nIn 1956, voters approved the construction of an arena in the area, which destroyed 476 homes, half of them inhabited by black people, according to \u201cBleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000,\u201d a paper by the Portland State scholar Karen J. Gibson. This forced many people to move from what was considered \u201clower Albina\u201d to \u201cupper Albina.\u201d But upper Albina was soon targeted for development, too, first when the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided funds for Portland to build Interstate 5 and Highway 99. Then a local hospital expansion was approved, clearing 76 acres, including 300 African American-owned homes and businesses and many shops at the junction of North Williams Avenue and Russell Street, the black \u201cMain Street.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s known as a modern-day hub of progressivism, but its past is one of exclusion.", "authors": ["Alana Semuels"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/07/kkk_ohs/facebook.jpg?1522792715", "published_at": "2016-07-22"}
