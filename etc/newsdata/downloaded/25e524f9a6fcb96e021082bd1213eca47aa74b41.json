In reality, Ukraine was still largely in the hands of powerful oligarchs, and a new president in Petro Poroshenko who sold himself as something different. Ultimately, Poroshenko slow-walked reforms and empowered NABU\u2019s main competition: the office of the prosecutor general, which was headed at the time by a man named Viktor Shokin.\n\nThat name might sound familiar. Shokin is the guy who in 2016 was forced out of office, something then-Vice President Joe Biden later bragged about making happen.\n\nBut Shokin was also one of NABU\u2019s main antagonists. His removal was called for by most international donor organizations, including the EU, the World Bank, even Republican senators \u2014 and celebrated as a major victory for the fight against corruption.\n\nRead: Your guide to the cast of Trump's Ukraine scandal.\n\n\n\nBut Shokin\u2019s successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, a close ally of Poroshenko with no prior legal experience, didn\u2019t immediately make things better.\n\nIn late 2017, Lutsenko\u2019s office broke up a joint NABU-FBI investigation into a passports-for-cash scheme at the state migration office, arresting half a dozen agents and revealing the name of an undercover operative. Lutsenko said NABU had been conducting an illegal operation.\n\nThat put Lutsenko on a collision course with Trump\u2019s own State Department.\n\n\u201cLutsenko hated the National Anti-corruption Bureau of Ukraine,\u201d Kaleniuk says. \u201cPrecisely because NABU was independent, because NABU was trying to investigate untouchable people in Ukraine, like members of parliament, heads of state-owned companies. Lutsenko didn\u2019t like that, so he tried to undermine NABU.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How Ukrainians are still fighting corruption after a failed revolution.\n\nEarlier this year, Lutsenko seemed to find another way to remake his name: he started meeting with Giuliani about the possibility of reopening the investigation into the Bidens. He also spoke out in the American press, telling a conservative columnist to look into the links between Biden\u2019s role in the firing of Shokin and the Burisma investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s that version of events \u2014 one sympathetic to Ukraine\u2019s controversial prosecutors general \u2014 that trickled up to Trump.\n\nCOVER: Ukrainian activists at the Prosecutor General's office in 2016, to protest its pressure on the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU.
