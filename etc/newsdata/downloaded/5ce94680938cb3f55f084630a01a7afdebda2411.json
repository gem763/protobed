After the formalities and a celebratory glass of champagne, it\u2019s time to make a financial decision that will set you up for success.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAll too often when people get a raise, they either direct that new money untouched and unprotected directly into their checking accounts without thinking twice, or fall into the behavioral phenomenon called, \u201cMental Accounting.\u201d\n\nPut simply, this is when someone treats money differently depending on the source. For example, someone who receives an unexpected bonus has a tendency to spend that money more frivolously than regular income.\n\nSo, let\u2019s avoid falling into that trap and use this as an opportunity to make your raise work as hard as you did for it. Here are some strategies you can adopt to turn your new hard-earned cash into a liquid asset.\n\nSet up a direct deposit into your savings account or IRA\n\nIf all your salary goes directly into a checking account, you are missing out on opportunities for higher returns through a savings account or IRA account, for example. Don\u2019t let your new cash increase go with the bulk of your salary straight into your regular checking account.\n\nInstead, put your money to work. By depositing your raise into a savings account, your money will work harder and earn interest. If you choose to put the extra money into a tax-exempt IRA, you\u2019re keeping more and earning interest for your retirement through tax-free growth (but cannot withdraw without penalties).\n\nOnce you determine which option is best for you, calculate your paycheck increase and set up a direct deposit so it\u2019s automatically routed from each paycheck and you\u2019re not tempted to spend the money.\n\nPay down debt\n\nWhether it\u2019s credit card debt, student loan debt, or personal loan debt, your raise income can be an opportunity to pay those off so you can continue to move forward financially. Factoring your raise income into your debt plan can help you make your payments on time, avoid additional interest and build or rebuild your credit, while maintaining your budget.\n\nStart an emergency fund\n\nKeeping a stash of money under your mattress may not be as common anymore, but the premise of a \u201crainy day fund\u201d remains. Your monthly raise income could be put into an emergency fund for everything from an unexpected medical bill to last-minute travel.\n\nI always recommend that everyone should have enough money to cover three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses in case of a financial emergency.\n\nBump up your savings rate to your employer sponsored plan\n\nLastly, most people understand that saving for retirement in any form from an early stage is a good financial move. However, despite this, people often neglect their employer sponsored retirement plans like 401(k), 403(b) and IRA, due to a lack of awareness of the benefits, or not fully understanding the rules.\n\nWhat makes this a highly profitable route is the tax deferred growth. No taxes are taken until you\u2019re ready to make a withdrawal, which allows for greater control when paying taxes on those earnings further down the road.\n\nDon\u2019t overlook the opportunity and benefit your employer offers by matching contributions to 401(k) plans. It\u2019s plain and simple \u2013 you\u2019re receiving free money. Just like your own tax deferred contributions, an employer\u2019s match will accrue earnings on a tax deferred basis, and also won\u2019t be taxed until withdrawing from the account.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nReceiving a raise is a great high-five and appreciation of all your hard work. With raises often comes opportunity, but don\u2019t let your raise money lose its own opportunity to work harder and grow.\n\nJason Friday is head of wealth management planning at Citizens Bank Wealth Management.", "description": "Here are some strategies you can adopt to turn your new hard-earned cash into a liquid asset.", "authors": ["Jason Friday"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/money-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
