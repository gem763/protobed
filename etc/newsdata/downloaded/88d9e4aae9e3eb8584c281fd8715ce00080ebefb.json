Nanny put Princess Anne into the bridesmaid dress and then out of the blue the Queen appeared.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I went backwards to make a bow and walked into this corgi bowl full of watch which upset all over my shoes.\n\n\u201cThe Queen pulled a cord by the side of the fireplace and a page appeared and wiped my shoes.\"\n\nLater during the visit, when the Queen was looking at the dress, she asked a surprisingly relatable question.\n\nDavid explains: \u201cThe Queen looked at bridesmaid dress and said \u2018will it wash\u2019. She was very concerned that it would wash.\u201d\n\nThis is a concern any parent of a little girl who has performed bridesmaid duties will understand, as we all know those gorgeous dresses don't always stay nice and clean!", "description": "The Queen was at Buckingham Palace to supervise when her daughter Princess Anne was being fitted for a bridesmaid dress, but she had a very relatable question for the designers making the frock", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9541204.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-ROYALS-CHRISTMAS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
