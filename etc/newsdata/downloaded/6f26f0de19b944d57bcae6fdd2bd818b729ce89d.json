The cancellation is the latest fallout from a recent tweet by Rockets GM Daryl Morey that showed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe NBA said the cancellation off the Lakers event, which was supposed to benefit the Special Olympics, was not its decision.\n\nThis came a day after the Chinese government canceled the Nets\u2019 NBA Cares event.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ny Post", "Nypost.Com Lakers-Nba-Event-In-China-Canceled"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
