Can\u2019t you picture him doing that? And also Michael Scott on Instagram and the thirsty comments he would leave on celebrities\u2019 pages,\u201d said Kaling. \u201cThose to me are what like come to mind.\u201d\n\nCheck out the interview here:\n\nKaling wrote the screenplay for and starred in the recent comedy-drama movie \u201cLate Night\u201d about a female late-night TV host, played by Emma Thompson, a fact she discussed with Singh.\n\nIn January, Kaling predicted where her own character from \u201cThe Office,\u201d Kelly Kapoor, could be in 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s not an insignificant part of me that thinks that Kelly might be in jail, a crime of passion,\u201d she told Variety.\n\n\u201cThe character just kept getting a little bit more and more unhinged,\u201d she noted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that she murdered Ryan, but like, I\u2019m also not convinced that he\u2019s still alive in the world of \u2018The Office.\u2019\u201d", "description": "It involves Instagram.
