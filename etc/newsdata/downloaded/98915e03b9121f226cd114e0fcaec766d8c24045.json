Some characterized the process as an attempted \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are running scared. Why? Because you are America, and you have the president\u2019s back,\u201d Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump aide, told the crowd. \u201cThis fake impeachment has one purpose \u2014 to nullify the votes of 63 million Americans: white, brown, yellow, all Americans together. Enough of the swamp!\u201d\n\nFlags and banners whipped in the blustery weather as other speakers and demonstrators attacked what they called a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy involving Democrats, federal bureaucrats and the media to undermine Trump.\n\nPeople wore \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps and T-shirts saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like Trump, you probably won\u2019t like me. And I\u2019m ok with that.\u201d A moment of silence was observed for Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who died Thursday at the age of 68 in a Baltimore hospice center, before several speakers took turns venting about Trump\u2019s opponents, characterizing them as socialists or communists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI call them Dumbycrats,\u201d said Kerry-Ann O\u2019Connor, 54, who said she took time away from being her mother\u2019s caretaker (with her mother\u2019s blessing) to travel from Chicago. \u201cWhen I\u2019m really mad, I call them \u2018Damnocrats.\u2019 These people, they want to destroy the country.\u201d\n\nMany slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for failing to hold a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry and overseeing a process that has so far involved taking closed-door testimony about Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine into investigating former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden (D) and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Trump and his supporters have accused the Bidens of corruption \u2014 in tweets, at a profanity-laced campaign rally in Minneapolis and in an ad blitz worth millions of dollars \u2014 without offering evidence to support those claims.\n\nSome spoke in conspiratorial tones, alleging opponents had harassed them or attempted to silence them through social media. They implied that dirty tricks of some kind were behind the cancellation of at least six chartered buses from Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. James Lyle, an organizer, said it was not clear why the rides had been canceled.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral times, the crowd broke into chants of \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d and \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d There were no counterdemonstrators in sight, though several supporters of the late conspiracy theorist Lyndon A. LaRouche Jr. worked the fringes of the peaceful, if sometimes raucous demonstration on the Capitol\u2019s west lawn.\n\nJauna Valezquez, a New York resident whose family legally immigrated from the Dominican Republic to the United States when she was a child, said she supported the president\u2019s crackdown on people who try to do the same thing illegally.\n\n\u201cThey are definitely stepping over the people who are here already,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is the first president who talks about America first.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeg Fisher, 64, who owns a landscaping business in Chicago, said Trump has said things that seemed shocking or offensive to her since taking office, but that outrageous and unrestrained style was also why she and many supporters liked him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a normal person. People say offensive things to me all the time. I don\u2019t attack them. I turn the other cheek. He\u2019s not politically correct \u2014 he\u2019s just correct,\u201d Fisher said. She credited Trump administration policies for a strong economy that has allowed her to take home more pay and pay her workers more while excusing his inability to carry through on some promises \u2014 such as building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 as the fault of opponents.\n\n\u201cIf he had Congress on his side, he\u2019d have the wall done,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nAD", "description": "Hundreds of Trump supporters gathered on the west lawn of the Capitol to denounce the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry. Many characterized the fast-paced inquiry -- into whether President Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden (D), a possible rival in next year's presidential election -- as a \"coup.\"", "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PgZsV4udmWrL3QYCy4SrdR1YgCE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4NP5BWXRAII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
