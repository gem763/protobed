Both pretty strong figures given the circumstances and the fact 47 of the club\u2019s 102 off-course betting branches were shut.\n\nWhile the fans stayed away, the Jockey Club looked after its employees who turned up for duty, handing out a HK$200 hardship payment to help them get to and from the track. A nice gesture given the current environment.\n\nWho\u2019s Horse? Eric Tsang\u2019s horse\n\nWhile most rank-and-file punters opted to stay at home, one famous face in Eric Tsang Chi-wai was certainly the centre of attention.\n\nTsang is a big name in Hong Kong \u2013 an actor, director, producer and comedian who has been a regular presence in movies and television shows for decades.\n\nHe is one of the owners in the Jimmy Ting Koon-ho-trained Who\u2019s Horse, who competed in the Class Four Lung Fu Shan Handicap (1,400m).\n\nTsang was given the full paparazzi treatment from the local press, other owners in the parade ring asked for photos and jockey Umberto Rispoli met him with a big hug.\n\nUnfortunately for the 66-year-old, Who\u2019s Horse couldn\u2019t fire in his second race start, finishing 12th.\n\nGibson and Moreira enjoy rare success\n\nRichard Gibson and Joao Moreira combined for their first winner as a combination since 2015 as they both enjoyed fruitful afternoons at Sha Tin on Sunday.\n\nThe pair saluted with Colorado High and My Winner after only teaming up 40 times previously, with their only other trip to the winner\u2019s circle thanks to Sugar City back in February 2015.\n\nGibson landed his first double since February 17 to take his total for the term to four and Moreira backed up his four-timer on Tuesday with another three winners to take his 2019-20 haul to 17.\n\nGibson was nearing a month between trips to the winner\u2019s circle before Colorado High came to the fore in the Class Four Kennedy Town Handicap (1,200m) and he was full of praise for the Magic Man\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cHe was a little bit fierce on his first run of the season but with the draw today we were very confident and as usual lovely execution from the champion,\u201d Gibson said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a horse with a future, he\u2019s a very good physical specimen and like a lot of horses, I think in his second season he\u2019ll get even better.\u201d\n\nGibson\u2019s appreciation for Moreira reached new levels after the very next race, with the Brazilian producing a gem of a ride to weave My Winner through traffic in the Class Four Lung Fu Shan Handicap (1,400m) and grab favourite Sprint Forward in the shadows of the post.\n\nSecond last on the turn... Enter Joao Moreira for a magical Gibson double! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OXm4Mu1TnY \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 6, 2019\n\n\u201cFantastic ride. It\u2019s rare that we can get our hands on Joao,\u201d Gibson said.\n\n\u201cFrom an awkward draw to get in that winning position was an excellent effort. My gut feeling was the horse had improved since we got him, he was more relaxed and I think there\u2019s more to come.\u201d\n\nMoreira completed a running treble aboard the Danny Shum Chap-shing-trained Good Runners Way in the Class Four Mount Davis Handicap (1,650m).", "description": "Given the transport difficulties, the poor weather and general chaos in Hong Kong, it was no surprise that just 12,016 made the trek to Sha Tin on Sunday for what would generously be described as an average meeting....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/06/4e8922b0-e836-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293e_image_hires_210612.JPG?itok=iIfEMzBg&v=1570367181", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
