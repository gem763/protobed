The proclamation represents the latest attempt to separate families and undermine due process solely on the basis of cultural and national origin-based bias. It\u2019s as unAmerican as the public charge rule,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe White House earlier this month issued the seeking to halt entry for people pursuing visas who \u201cwill financially burden the United States healthcare system.\"\n\nUnder the policy, a migrant would be considered a \u201cburden\u201d if they are not covered by approved health insurance within 30 days of their arrival unless they have enough money to \"pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.\"\n\n\"While our healthcare system grapples with the challenges caused by uncompensated care, the United States Government is making the problem worse by admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs,\" the proclamation said.\n\nImmigrant rights groups pushed back on the proclamation at the time, arguing that it targeted low-income migrants.\n\nThe move is the latest by the Trump administration to limit both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nThe administration had previously attempted to create a \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule that would have made people using designated public benefits less likely to receive green cards. The rule was temporarily blocked this month by a federal judge.", "description": "Immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging a new", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/naturilzationceremony_immigrants_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
