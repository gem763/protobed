Add Climate Change as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Climate Change news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBut first, young climate activists from around the world are coming together to challenge adults during the Global Climate Strike. Here are five leaders you should know:\n\nGreta Thunberg\n\nOne of the most-recognizable youth climate activists is 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. In August of last year, the Swedish activist protested in front of Swedish Parliament, skipping school for a month to call for action on the climate crisis. She chronicled her efforts on social media and made headlines across the world, becoming the face of the youth climate activism movement.\n\nSince then, Thunberg\u2019s personal project has become a weekly ritual called #FridaysForFuture. Every week, students all over the world can join her in spending part of their Fridays out of school, protesting climate change.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAnd students aren\u2019t the only ones to have caught on.\n\nThis week, Thunberg, who has been nominated for the Nobel Prize, scored a meeting with former President Barack Obama and testified in front of Congress about the science that shows the danger of climate change.\n\nHer efforts have inspired the global climate strike, an event that will have 4,638 events in 139 countries, according to Thunberg.\n\nBenji Backer\n\nBenji Backer breaks the mold of youth climate activist -- he\u2019s a conservative. Backer would like to change climate activism from not being associated with the GOP. To him, climate change is a bipartisan issue.\n\nIn his testimony submitted to Congress, he said, \"The health of the environment affects all of us, regardless of where we live, our background or political affiliation.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\"It will take all of us to find solutions to climate change and protect our planet for generations to come,\" he said.\n\nBut as president of the American Conservative Coalition, he doesn\u2019t see legislation proposed by Democrats, such as the Green New Deal, as the solution. To him, this policy \"inhibits innovation\" and is \"not [the] most effective way to reduce emissions on a global scale.\"\n\nVarshini Prakash\n\nVarshini found her passion for environmental activism in college, but she took her advocacy to a new level when she helped organize a sit-in of 150 youth environment activists outside of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez showed up, and it made national headlines.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only accomplishment Prakash has under her belt. She co-founded Sunrise, an environmental movement that is currently advocating for the Green New Deal.\n\nAnd she isn\u2019t afraid to call out politicians. Prakash uses her Twitter account to call out Democrats like Sen. Kamala Harris and former Gov. John Hickenlooper for not doing what she considers enough for environmental causes.\n\nDisappointing news from @KamalaHarris' campaign this morning -- she's choosing to attend a mega fundraiser over a scheduled @CNN climate forum.\n\n\n\nChoosing big donors over our futures is what got us into this mess to begin with.\n\n\n\nHere are my thoughts --#DemDebates pic.twitter.com/PIAt2RMvv0 \u2014 Varshini Prakash \ud83c\udf05 (@VarshPrakash) August 19, 2019\n\nXiuhtexcatl Martinez\n\nXiuhtexcatl Martinez is a 19-year-old musician and environmental activist who just launched NOW, a subscription service that allows people to donate monthly to planting trees. The app is still in development, and hopes to incorporate musicians and athletes.\n\nMartinez is also a plaintiff in Juliana v. Unites States, a lawsuit filed by 21 young Americans who claim the federal government hasn\u2019t protected Americans from climate change.\n\nCurrently, the lawsuit awaits the ruling of the Ninth Circuit court.\n\nThis week, Martinez spoke at a press event in front of the Supreme Court and appeared on the Daily Show, bringing awareness for next week\u2019s activities that will raise awareness of the climate crisis.\n\nGreta & Xiuhtezcatl Join Forces to Address the Nation! - https://t.co/0Tvvcla5P4 pic.twitter.com/NQ7GWPUGbJ \u2014 Earth Guardians (@earthguardianz) August 29, 2019\n\nIsra Hirsi\n\nThis 16-year-old has already been in VICE, Essence and the CUT -- but not because her mother is Rep. Ilhan Omar. It\u2019s because she helped co-found the U.S. Youth Climate Strike, the U.S. branch of Thunberg\u2019s movement.\n\nIn a blog post, she acknowledged her rare position.\n\n\"My reality is a little different from other[s] \u2026 because I\u2019m involved in organizing and advocacy work where I\u2019m creating my own platform, while also having a mom who has a massive platform.\"\n\nHirsi is as equally passionate about the environment as she is about diversity awareness.\n\nOn the biography of her website for Youth Climate Strike, she wrote, \"As a black Muslim woman, it is important to me to have intersectionality be brought into this fight.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
