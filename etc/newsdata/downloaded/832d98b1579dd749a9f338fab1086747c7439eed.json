The story claimed the spy was taken out because President Trump couldn't be trusted with the Russian government.\n\nIn a previously undisclosed secret mission in 2017, the United States successfully extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government, multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge told CNN. A person directly involved in the discussions said that the removal of the Russian was driven, in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.\n\nBut according to the CIA, which usually doesn't comment on media, the story is bogus. Not only was CNN contradicted by the CIA, but The New York Times also found major holes in their \"exclusive\" story.\n\nThe extraordinary CIA rebuke came as The New York Times published a bombshell piece late in the evening, which largely contradicted CNN's reporting. According to the Times, CIA officials \"made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia\" \u2014 weeks before Trump even took office. Concerns about media reporting on Russian election interference drove the decision, according to the Times, which described the source as \"the American government\u2019s best insight into the thinking of and orders\u201d from Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Former intelligence officials said there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source, and other current American officials insisted that media scrutiny of the agency\u2019s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction,\" the Times wrote.\n\nDuring the time the spy was pulled in 2016, before President Trump took office, John Brennan was CIA Director. Brennan was a major driver of the false Russia narrative, called President Trump treasonous and lied to the American people about Trump's \"Russian associates\" for years.\n\nJohn Brennan has a lot to answer for\u2014going before the American public for months, cloaked with CIA authority and openly suggesting he\u2019s got secret info, and repeatedly turning in performances like this. pic.twitter.com/EziCxy9FVQ \u2014 Terry Moran (@TerryMoran) March 25, 2019\n\nLast year President Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance.", "description": ".09/10/2019 19:24:14PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/308/4b201bf7-ceeb-4531-9a73-752c4a192031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
