It\u2019s funny. But more disgusting and disgraceful. Give this a watch. @realDonaldTrump is a clown and a traitor. https://t.co/dbLiiPjvcI \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even laugh at this. It\u2019s funny. But more disgusting and disgraceful. Give this a watch. @realDonaldTrump is a clown and a traitor,\u201d tweeted DuVernay on Wednesday.\n\nThe filmmaker was not the only individual in Hollywood who reacted to Kimmel\u2019s video. Actress Bette Midler also chimed in, thanking the TV host for the parody video attempting to downplay the president\u2019s announcement of the ISIS leader\u2019s death.\n\nTHANKS, JIMMY. WE NEEDED THIS.

WE NEEDED THIS,\u201d proclaimed the actress.\n\nDuVernay is an avid and outspoken opponent of the president, claiming that the United States of America is a \u201cleaderless country\u201d and that Trump\u2019s presidency has \u201cdevastated me in many ways, but each of those ways has made me more determined than before.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood director has also been working on her upcoming HBO series, which is expected to join the coterie of leftist celebrities and Democrat Party leadership in the suggestion that the United States, as a nation, is on the brink of a civil war.\n\nThe new series, entitled DMZ, will depict the United States in the grips of a second American Civil War, with the federal government battling secessionist forces called the Free State armies.\n\nLast year, another of DuVernay\u2019s film projects, Red Line, was focused on a white father who was widowed after a police officer killed his black husband.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Hollywood director Ava DuVernay took offense to a parody video posted by TV host Jimmy Kimmel of Trump announcing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/08/DuVernay.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
