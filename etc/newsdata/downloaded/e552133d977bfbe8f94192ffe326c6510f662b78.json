Lamela works a shot away and the ball goes past the keeper but Dunk is there to clear the ball away. Fantastic defending.\n\n1:12PM\n\n41 min: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0\n\nMooy and Connolly have been the standout players for the home side so far.\n\nBrighton attack once again with a throw-in by Spurs penalty area. Burn whips a cross in which is only half dealt with. Spurs fail to clear and the ball falls to Mooy who shots from range. Not a great effort that goes well wide.\n\n1:09PM\n\n38 min: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0\n\nAlderweireld plays an awkward ball back to Gazzaniga who the chips the ball out for a throw-in by accident. Sloppy and haphazard from the north London side.\n\nTottenham try to counter and win a free kick. Eriksen plays it forward but Dunk deals with it.

This time down the right.\n\nThe ball falls to Connolly in the box who gets a shot away but it goes wide. That was a decent chance. What a performance by the Seagulls so far!\n\n1:04PM\n\n34 min: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0\n\nBrighton well and truly deserve their lead. Pochettino needs to do something sharpish. That goal felt somewhat inevitable.\n\nBrighton attack again. Grob shoots and the ball is deflected just wide. Corner.\n\n1:03PM\n\n32 min: GOAL! Connolly Brighton 2 Tottenham 0\n\nWell Brighton have definitely been the better side in the opening 30 minutes or so. They look dangerous.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrighton score again!

Brighton look the more dangerous of the sides so far.\n\n12:51PM\n\nHugo Lloris breaks his own record...\n\n8 - Subbed off after eight minutes against Brighton, Hugo Lloris is the quickest a keeper has been replaced in a Premier League match since the Frenchman himself against Leicester in March 2015 (4 minutes). Misfortune. \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 5, 2019\n\n12:50PM\n\n20 min: Brighton 1 Tottenham 0\n\nSpurs build slowly in attack with Eriksen starting to get his foot on the ball before Mooy disrupts the play.\n\nThe ball goes forward and Vertonghen and Maupay clash heads.

Brighton attack again but the ball runs off the pitch.\n\nSpurs regain some possession passing the ball on the half-way line. The ball comes left to Davies who tries to finds Eriksen in the middle.

It hits Vertonghen in the head who goes down - he's okay.\n\nAnother corner to Brighton but nothing comes of it. Tottenham need some control in this game.\n\n12:39PM\n\n7 min: Brighton 1 Tottenham 0\n\nGazzaniga is coming on. Looks like some serious damage has been done to Lloris' arm as he landed. Kane takes the arm band.\n\n12:37PM\n\n4 min: Brighton 1 Tottenham 0\n\nLloris has stayed down injured after that incident. Worrying signs for Tottenham in all senses.

He has been brought into the midfield today and starts alongside Tanguy Ndombele which gives Spurs' midfield a very solid look. Big opportunity for Dier today.\n\nEric Dier could offer more solidity to a Tottenham side that conceded seven goals midweek Credit: Reuters\n\n12:13PM\n\nOminous stat for Brighton fans...\n\n1983 - Spurs haven\u2019t lost against Brighton since April 1983 when they were beaten 2-1 in a top-flight fixture \u2013 they\u2019ve won five and drawn one of six matches against the Seagulls in all competitions since then. Routine. pic.twitter.com/hBwExBMKvf \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 5, 2019\n\n12:08PM\n\nBrighton have been lacking in front of goal\n\nThe home side have only managed to score five goals in seven Premier League games so far this season. Neal Maupay is the only player to have scored more than one goal, netting twice.\n\nAaron Connolly starts today but he has yet to score in five Premier League appearances this season. The pressure is on Brighton's attacking weapons to find the net today or it could be a long afternoon for the Seagulls.\n\n12:01PM\n\nKeep up to date with our Football Nerd newsletter\n\n11:56AM\n\nSpurs have freshened up selection\n\nFour changes have been made from the hammering sustained at the hands of Bayern Munich. Eric Dier, Ben Davies, Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen all return to the starting XI as Pochettino looks to solidify his midfield.\n\n11:51AM\n\nTottenham's right back woes\n\nWith Kieran Trippier's summer move to Atletico Madrid, Serge Aurier's suspension and Kyle Walker-Peters fall from favour, the right back position has opened up for Moussa Sissoko in today's match.\n\nWalker-Peters had a promising start to his Spurs career but has failed to even make the bench for the match against Brighton.\n\nSissoko is a versatile player and certainly has the athleticism to thrive in the full back role. It will be fascinating to see how the midfielder goes today.\n\nMoussa Sissoko has a chance to stake a claim as a right back in what has become an area of weakness for Tottenham Credit: Getty Images\n\n11:39AM\n\nHere is the team news:\n\nDavy Propper is out with a hamstring injury and Shane Duffy remains out. Bernardo and Leandro Trossard are also still unavailable.\n\nSpurs are without right-back Serge Aurier, who is suspended after being sent off in last weekend's match.\n\nTeams in full:\n\nBrighton:\n\nRyan, Webster, Dunk, Burn, Montoya, Gross, Stephens, Mooy, Alzate, Maupay, Connolly\n\nSubs: Bong, Bissouma, Balogun, Jahanbakhsh, Murray, March, Button\n\nTottenham Hotspur:\n\nLloris, Sissoko, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies, Dier, Ndombele, Eriksen, Lamela, Son, Kane\n\nSubs: Sanchez, Winks, Alli, Foyth, Gazzaniga, Lucas Moura, Skipp\n\nReferee: Jonathan Moss\n\n11:33AM\n\nMatch Preview\n\nThe big question for today\u2019s match is can Tottenham bounce back from their midweek humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich?\n\nMauricio Pochettino has urged his players to turn the 7-2 defeat into a galvanising force for the rest of the season going forward.\n\nThe hammering in the Champions League was the first time Spurs have conceded seven goals at home in their 137-year history which has sparked rumours about the Argentinian\u2019s future.\n\nIn the build-up to today\u2019s match Pochettino said the defeat was \u201cso painful. You cannot be happy with that defeat. And we are trying to move on.\n\n\"They want another opportunity to play and to replay and rebuild the confidence we need to win games.\n\n\"But most important is that we know that for 30 to 35 minutes in the first half was our best period in the season.\u201d\n\nBrighton started well this season picking up four points from their first two matches but in their last five games have only picked up two points. They sit just above the relegation zone but will look at Tottenham as vulnerable given the midweek result.\n\nHowever Brighton have won just one of their previous 16 top-flight fixtures going back into last season, losing nine times and conceding 28 goals.\n\nBrighton manager Graham Potter praised Tottenham\u2019s attacking options before the game.\n\n\"The challenge is not just Harry Kane - I'm sure Mauricio Pochettino would say the same.\n\n\"There's not a one-person team and a one-person attacking unit with Tottenham.\n\n\"You don't reach the Champions League final with just one guy, they've got others: Son (Heung-min), (Erik) Lamela, (Christian) Eriksen, (Lucas) Moura to name a few.\n\n\"So it's about, as a unit, defending well against an attacking unit that's really, really impressive.\"\n\nSeveral Tottenham players spoke of their embarrassment after the Bayern Munich game, with Jan Vertonghen saying he was \"ashamed\".\n\nWill the embarrassment make Tottenham vulnerable, or are they a wounded beast who will play with extra motivation?", "description": "Connolly works a shooting opportunity but it is blocked and Spurs break.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u8yd6TvD87DZqbrjcE4bVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lIiNw7rMI768BnRhwkuwxA--~B/aD0xMzU2O3c9MjE2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/e18270daf49a2542f4473f37ae3417f1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
