Not only is the episode almost entirely devoted to savory dishes \u2014 which is definitely not the reason I watch this show \u2014 but it\u2019s often the place where great bakers trip up and okay bakers finally shine. Why, you may ask? Because bread is part science and part intuition. And without both parts, you\u2019re screwed.\n\nTo start off the show\u2019s most topsy-turvy week, Paul and Prue ask the bakers to create tear-and-share loaves, which for most Americans means monkey bread. But not so in this week\u2019s episode. Most of the bakers assume that because this is Bread Week, they need to go straight for savory flavors.\n\nAmelia\u2019s Chorizo Brunch features bread stuffed with pepper, onions, and garlic that she says will give it a kick, a comment that will later prove to be the understatement of the century. Sophisticated Toddler Henry opts for pesto and chicken, which sends Steph \u2014 who apparently works THREE part-time jobs \u2014 into a bit of a huff because she\u2019s using pesto, too! Or rather \u201cbaa-sil\u201d sauce, which is another word for pesto. Michelle and Phil both decide to put pancetta and cheese into their loaves. Priya skips the meat, but joins in on the cheese train with a jalape\u00f1o and Red Leicester loaf, as does Rosie, who doesn\u2019t much care for meat and thinks chili and manchego in a brioche-style bread is just the ticket. Michael rounds out the savory group with Keralan Star Bread, an original recipe, with coconut chutney, paprika, and not as much chili as he used last week, thank goodness.\n\nThree bakers dare to take the candied road less traveled, however. Alice decides to create a bread version of baklava, which she thinks originated in Turkey. (Actually the Ottoman Empire, but let\u2019s not split hairs.) Helena and David both make cinnamon rolls, but very, very different takes. David\u2019s fancy cinnamon swirls with brandied fruit are topped with vanilla buttercream, which Paul gags at. (Why are you the way that you are, Paul?) But Helena, who I think has really grown on all of us, makes cinnamon rolls American-style: Drizzled with globs of sugar glaze and toasted pecans. U-S-A! U-S-A-!\n\nUnfortunately for the producers, all the bakers manage to use their time efficiently, meaning there\u2019s very little footage they can cut together to induce a sense of panic. But the panic is still there, inside the soul of each baker who knows fuck-all about bread. Henry\u2019s overpowering chicken and pesto bread sorely disappoints the judges, as does Steph\u2019s Sun-Dried Tomato and Pesto Star that, while beautifully shaped, comes out \u201cbone dry.\u201d David rounds out the group with cinnamon rolls that are too doughy.\n\nHelena, meanwhile, notches another win for America with her over-the-top cinnamon rolls even if they\u2019re a bit overbaked. Alice\u2019s baklava? Great flavor mixture, but overbaked. And Amelia sends Prue into a coughing fit with her Chorizo Brunch. Prue chokes out that it\u2019s still delicious and Paul says everything in the roll could have been much smaller. Priya, Rosie, Phil, and Michelle get positive feedback as well, but who cares because Michael \u201cThe Specs\u201d Chakraverty and his out-of-this-world Keralan Star Bread gets THE FIRST PAUL HOLLYWOOD HANDSHAKE OF THE SEASON. Ooh, it\u2019s on now, folks.\n\nMichael pushes his immense joy deep down and manages to play it pretty cool in the aftermath because this is only the first challenge and men are made in the Technical. The manliest Technical of all time, in fact: The bakers are asked to make eight burger baps, which through context clues we learn is what Britons call \u201cbuns.\u201d (This is precisely why we had the Revolutionary War, people.) On top of that, they must make veggie burgers, which Paul insists will only account for about 10 percent of the judging process after last week\u2019s Fig-gate.\n\nThe bakers aren\u2019t given much in the way of instructions and must follow their bread-making instincts to create eight perfect buns, which means proving for 30-40 minutes and doing \u201cmaths,\u201d as Steph points out. The veggie burgers involve a little mashing and smashing, but nothing too bad. Phil refuses to be emasculated by these meatless atrocities, however, and make his extra chunky \u2026 which promptly lands him in the bottom three between Rosie and Amelia. The latter woman attempts to kill Prue again by putting too much chili in her \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d burgers. (Big patty, small bun.) Henry, David and Steph take the top three spots.\n\nAfter a brief break, the bakers prepare for their five-hour, bread-scoring Showstopper Challenge. A challenge this long is often a mixed bag. It\u2019s great because the best breads take at least two hours to prove, but the drawback is that with five hours, the bakers feel the need to not only create spectacular scoring, but to do so on three to four different types of bread.\n\nThere are so many different types of breads and flavors going on throughout the Showstopper Challenge that it\u2019s hard to keep up with all of them. Instead, we\u2019ll cover the designs: Amelia, Henry, Michelle, Rosie, Priya, and Steph all make some take on animals or plants. David and Alice \u2014 two people who studied abroad and never got over it \u2014 create travel-inspired loaves while Phill creates a Winners\u2019 Wreath. And Michael makes a Mediterranean Camp Fire loaf, which as someone who lived through last year\u2019s disastrous pita final I find triggering.\n\nEven with 11 contestants in the race this is, unfortunately, one of those episodes where you\u2019re fairly certain who\u2019s going home by the start of the third challenge, and we suspected (correctly) that that person might be Amelia. It\u2019s sad because she had great energy and a very interesting accent and said \u201csod it off\u201d a lot. But we\u2019re entering Week Four, and while Paul and Prue aren\u2019t demanding \u201csheer perfection\u201d quite yet, it\u2019s time to be detail-oriented, something Amelia, and Jamie and Dan before her, lacked.\n\nScoring, or cutting delicate lines into pieces of bread at a depth that\u2019s just deep enough to make an impression, is the epitome of being detail-oriented. Phil, Rosie, Steph, and Michael (who gets crowned Star Baker) prove themselves capable of doing that. Alice, Michelle, and Priya also get either the scoring or the flavors right, though it\u2019s time for Priya to Step. Up. As for the rest of the group \u2014 David, Henry, and Helena \u2014 they\u2019ve all had their moments of brilliance. How all these dynamics will play out for the show\u2019s first-ever DAIRY WEEK, though, is anyone\u2019s guess.", "description": "The show\u2019s most topsy-turvy week gives us a marathon Showstopper and the season\u2019s first Hollywood Handshake.
