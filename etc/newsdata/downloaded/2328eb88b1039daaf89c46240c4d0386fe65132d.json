He had worked for the agency 14 years prior as assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nAD\n\nIn between, Brouillette was a top lobbyist for Ford Motor Co. and then the head of public policy for USAA, a financial institution for military families.\n\nAD\n\nPerry is embroiled in Trump\u2019s Ukraine controversy because he urged the president to call the new Ukrainian president over the summer. Perry said his departure has nothing to do with that.\n\nPerry said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d true that he pushed Trump to make the call to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI pushed on him a lot to make that phone call because I became convinced that Zelensky, the people around him, were legitimately trying to get rid of the corruption and get off the Russian gas,\u201d Perry said during an interview Friday morning on Fox News.\n\nAD\n\nHouse investigators have subpoenaed Perry for documents related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, which has triggered an impeachment inquiry into whether the president abused his power when he asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political opponent, and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nPerry said he did not know whether he will comply or appear if called to testify.\n\nPerry has been a globe-trotting energy secretary, hawking energy policy and American products in trips to Europe, the Middle East and, several times, Kyiv.\n\nAlthough he is from energy-rich Texas, the Energy Department seemed an unlikely place for Perry to land. As a presidential candidate in 2012, he could not recall the name of the department, one of three departments he said he would abolish if elected. \u201cOops,\u201d he said when he couldn\u2019t remember the name.\n\nAs secretary, Perry has traveled to Rome and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Next week. he will head to Brussels. He led similar missions as governor, promoting Texas oil, gas and even wind energy.\n\nAD", "description": "The deputy energy secretary is the former top lobbyist for the Ford Motor Co.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "Tom Hamburger", "Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money", "Politics In Washington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9r3kob7sJywq60PjwyqWD3TH3Oc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKR5XPXR4YI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
