US rock radio and mainstream record-buyers had been almost implacably resistant to punk: none of the Ramones\u2019 albums had cracked the US Top 40, nor had Blondie. Patti Smith\u2019s ascension to the upper reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 had been achieved only by getting Bruce Springsteen to co-write a hit with her. Now, here was a band that felt like a product of the new wave \u2013 short, punchy tracks, distorted guitars, a hint of arty angularity, a mannered vocalist \u2013 but that wrote incredibly polished pop songs. They sounded enough like a straightforward hard rock band to appeal to the kind of music fans who had looked on aghast when the Sex Pistols fetched up in America. There was a vague suggestion of AOR, even prog rock about the keyboards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest He\u2019d been around the block even before the cars \u2026 Ocasek in 1982.

Their record company did the rest: hired the defiantly un-punk producer of Queen and Journey, Roy Thomas Baker, to add radio-friendly gloss; packaged it in a sleeve that featured a gorgeous, grinning model over the band\u2019s preferred selection of arty black and white photos.\n\nIt sold so well, and for so long \u2013 spending two and a half years on the US chart \u2013 that the Cars became embroiled in an argument about holding back the release of their follow-up with their label, who worried the band would effectively be competing with themselves.\n\nYou might have been forgiven for imagining the Cars represented a calculated bid to bring new wave to the American masses, but the way they sounded was just an accurate representation of the inside of frontman Ric Ocasek\u2019s head. By the time the Cars formed, he had been around the block: already in his mid-30s and a father of four, he\u2019d spent the early 70s in a Crosby Stills and Nash-esque acoustic trio called Milkwood. He loved straightforward pop music, but he loved what he called \u201cthe left side of the music brain\u201d, too: \u201cMy taste was to always go for that mix, even back in the 60s,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved the Velvet Underground and the Carpenters\u201d.\n\nOld enough to remember 50s rock and roll first hand, he prized simplicity and directness in rock and knew the commercial value of a striking image \u2013 by all accounts a thoroughly charming man, he invariably hid behind a pair of sunglasses on-stage, projecting an air of aloof mysteriousness \u2013 but had an abiding passion for the experimental.\n\nLeft to his own devices, he made a solo album called Beatitude that sounded noticeably weirder than the Cars, bearing the audible influence of early Roxy Music and Berlin-era Bowie. When he branched out into production, he worked with hardcore punk band Bad Brains and Suicide. He gamely attempted to introduce the latter to the Cars\u2019 audience, taking them on tour as a support act, with predictable results: \u201cThe booing started before they reached their second song,\u201d Ocasek delightedly recalled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Cars, from left, Greg Hawkes, Elliot Easton, Benjamin Orr, Ric Ocasek and David Robinson. Photograph: RB/Redferns\n\nThe Cars represented a perfect synthesis of both sides of Ocasek\u2019s taste. They could sound arty and left-field \u2013 particularly on their third, underrated album Panorama (1980) \u2013 but their success was driven by pure pop songwriting, at which he was astonishingly adept. For almost a decade, he gave the impression that knocking out huge hit singles came as second nature to him: Let\u2019s Go, My Best Friend\u2019s Girl, Shake It Up.\n\nFurthermore, the Cars were pragmatic and adaptable. Some of their US rock peers were squeamish about developments such as the rise of synth-pop and of MTV, but the Cars had embraced synthesisers from the start and they seemed to welcome the importance of videos as another extension of the image-consciousness Ocasek and drummer Dave Robinson, who designed most of their sleeves, had displayed from the start.\n\nOcasek\u2019s pop abilities reached a kind of pinnacle on 1984\u2019s Heartbeat City, an exercise in mid-80s arena rock recorded with a master of that genre, producer Robert \u201cMutt\u201d Lange, that was the most straightforwardly commercial album the Cars made, although Ocasek\u2019s wiry vocals lent it at least a touch of oddness. Tellingly, he wrote but didn\u2019t sing the album\u2019s biggest hit, the super-smooth, ultra-radio-friendly ballad Drive. The album sold 4m copies in the US: six of its 10 tracks were released as singles.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, there were problems, including mounting tensions between Ocasek and bassist Benjamin Orr, who sang lead vocals on a number of their hits, including Drive. Furthermore, Ocasek loathed touring, and it\u2019s hard not to think that the sheer scale of Heartbeat City\u2019s success may have influenced his decision to quit altogether. There was no longer any real financial imperative to keep doing it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Cars: Drive \u2013 video\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nThe Cars broke up after one more album, the lacklustre Door to Door (1987). When guitarist Elliot Easton and keyboard player Greg Hawkes mooted a reunion in the early 2000s, Ocasek demurred, and his former bandmates toured with Todd Rundgren as frontman, under the name the New Cars. Ocasek preferred to concentrate on a solo career, balancing sporadic releases that frequently leaned towards what he would have called the left side of the music brain (Getchertiktz, a collaboration with Suicide\u2019s Alan Vega and writer Gillian McCain from 1996, featured spoken word and exploratory electronics) with production work.\n\nBy then, his production talents were frequently sought out by artists inspired by the Cars: Weezer, Guided By Voices, No Doubt. Just how influential the band\u2019s early records were was underlined when the Strokes appeared. In case you had missed the fact that their sound was audibly indebted to the Cars, they covered their 1978 hit Just What I Needed live. And indeed, it became obvious when Ocasek was eventually inveigled into a Cars reunion in 2010, minus Orr, who died of cancer in 2000.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that the handful of live shows Ocasek agreed to play were rapturously received, it was how contemporary their reunion album Move to This sounded. Not because they tried to sound contemporary, but because they didn\u2019t need to. The way the Cars sounded in 1978 had become a sonic blueprint that permeated everything from alt-rock to mainstream pop.", "description": "Fired by a passion for everything from the Velvet Underground to the Carpenters, Ocasek forged a hugely influential sound that blended arty experimentation with pure pop", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/127b144165b3f6894f1b96c37698d68b329d25bc/38_258_4346_2607/master/4346.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=daf1d0095b446e7ecbb8baf7f108dbbc", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
