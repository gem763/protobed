Rebels had derailed a railroad line being used to shuttle German troops to Normandy and his division was ordered to arrest the males in town. The victims, who ranged from teenagers to elderly people, were lined up and shot.\n\nMuenter was convicted in absentia of war crimes and sentenced to death by a French court after the war, but by the time he was tracked down in 2013 \u2014 by the great-grandson of one of his victims \u2014 the statute of limitations on his conviction had passed.\n\nPAIR OF UNDERWEAR BELONGING TO EVA BRAUN SELL AT AUCTION FOR MORE THAN $4,600\n\nGerman prosecutors opened a new investigation of Muenter on suspicion of his being an accessory to murder, but had to shelve the case after determining they couldn\u2019t charge him again for the same crime.\n\nEarlier this year, Muenter was again charged, this time after he appeared in a broadcast television interview in which he defended shooting those he killed in Ascq \u2014 and also disputed facts of the Holocaust.\n\nHe said he had not shot anyone personally, and maintained that the killings were justified because the prisoners had tried to escape.\n\n\u201cIf I arrest the men, then I have the responsibility for them and if they run away, I have a right to shoot them,\u201d he said. Muenter also disputed that six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, saying \u201cwe didn\u2019t have that many Jews here at that time, that\u2019s already been disproved.\u201d\n\nARF, the public television show on which Muenter appeared, reported the former Nazi had close ties to neo-Nazi groups in recent years, talking to them about his experiences in the SS.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDenying the Holocaust is a crime in Germany.
