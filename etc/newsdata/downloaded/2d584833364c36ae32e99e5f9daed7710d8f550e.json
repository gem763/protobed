Mirror Sport reporters have their say below:\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nAndy Dunn - Man Utd 0-2 Liverpool\n\nAcross all competitions, Liverpool have won just once in their last 13 visits to Old Trafford - in March, 2014 - but that statistic is about the only straw for United fans to clutch at.\n\nEven allowing for the return of a couple of United players who have been on the sidelines, there is no logical argument to be constructed that concludes with a verdict in favour of the home side.\n\nIn all departments, Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team are stronger than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team.\n\nIt is as simple as that.\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\nDavid McDonnell - Man Utd 0-2 Liverpool\n\nGiven their respective positions in the Premier League, this should prove a routine win for leaders Liverpool , but I\u2019m expecting a tighter game, not least because United must surely raise themselves for the visit of their fiercest rivals, irrespective of their wretched form of late, and are likely to have several key players, including Paul Pogba and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, back from injury.\n\nThat said, with Liverpool rampant right now, United struggling for goals and potentially without first-choice keeper David De Gea, an away win seems the most likely outcome, one that will increase the pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nSteve Bates - Man Utd 0-3 Liverpool\n\nLet's be frank, United are a disaster zone and on Sunday they could easily be taken apart by their biggest historic rivals.\n\nThey haven't won a Premier League game for over a month since they edged past Leicester with a penalty from Marcus Rashford.\n\nAnd in the three matches since have scored only once and last time out couldn't even manage a goal against Newcastle losing 1-0.\n\nSo Virgil Van Dijk and Co are hardly going to be panicking over how to keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's powder-puff attack at bay.\n\nJurgen Klopp's midfield are vastly superior too - a well-oiled machine who press hard and keep the tempo high.\n\nLiverpool's Holy Trinity up front \u2013 Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Robert Firmino - will be looking for rich pickings and I'd be hugely surprised if they don't have a field day.\n\nUnited lack quality, creativity and direction. If you're Liverpool there's simply no better time to be going to Old Trafford.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJohn Cross - Man Utd 1-3 Liverpool\n\nI just can't see Man United being able to stop Liverpool's charge.\n\nI don't think I can remember going into one of these games so solid in belief that one of them would win - and win comfortably.\n\nThey say derbies are a great leveller, form goes out of the window, this is as good as... and there's just no other outcome than Liverpool win.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMike Walters - Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool\n\nEveryone agrees United have been hopeless, everyone agrees Liverpool are in the box seat to win their first title in 30 years.\n\nBut logic has little to do with anything when English football's red religions collide.\n\nIn all competitions, United have won 13 and lost only two of their last 18 meetings with Liverpool at Old Trafford.\n\nThis might be the day when the Kop drop their first points of the season.\n\nMatt Lawless - Man Utd 0-2 Liverpool\n\nIt says something about the current state of affairs on the pitch at Old Trafford, that Manchester United are the biggest price they've ever been to win a Premier League game at home.\n\n7/2 is the price most bookmakers are offering for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side to end Liverpool's 100 per cent winning start to the season.\n\nWorth a flutter? Keep your money in your pocket, I'd say. I expect Liverpool to pile more misery on their rivals with a comfortable away win.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nDavid Anderson - Man Utd 0-2 Liverpool\n\nYou have to go back 40 years to the last time Liverpool were such hot favourites to win at Old Trafford.\n\nOn form, this should be an easy three points for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side and they have swept all in front of them to win their first eight Premier League games, while United are in a mess under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nBut this fixture has proved troublesome for Liverpool, even back in their halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s, and they have managed just one win from their last 13 visits.\n\nOld Trafford is the one big ground where Klopp has not won and Liverpool were flat there in last season\u2019s goalless draw, despite United being in a tailspin and suffering a number of injuries.\n\nLiverpool must forget about all this bad history and focus on what a good team they are now.\n\nThey\u2019re scoring goals for fun while United are toothless up front and vulnerable at the back.\n\nUnited have their worst attack in a generation and have managed just two goals in their last five games.\n\nThey also have just one point from their last three league games and Newcastle\u2019s loss shows they can lose to anyone.\n\nThis game could be pivotal for the current incumbent in the United hot seat and Liverpool\u2019s emphatic 3-1 win at Anfield last December spelt the end for Jose Mourinho.\n\nBack in March 2014, the Reds\u2019 3-0 win at Old Trafford helped precipitate the fall of David Moyes.\n\nAnother bad loss could help hasten Solskjaer and losing at home to their most bitter rivals would be hard to take for United fans.", "description": "Liverpool will be aiming to inflict more misery on their rivals when they face off in the Premier League on Sunday", "authors": ["Jacob Murtagh", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Empics Sport", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
