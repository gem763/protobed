I still wanted to go out there and get it named after me for myself and then we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Biles qualified first for the all-around, second for the vault, second for the beam and floor with a seventh-best on the uneven bars.\n\n\u201cI still feel like I can do better, but the aim tonight wasn\u2019t to do great just to do well and I feel like I accomplished that and I\u2019ve made it into the finals, all of them now I guess.\n\n\u201cI get really nervous before I go out and my legs turn to stone, which scares me because I\u2019m supposed to be good on that event, but I had a lot of energy so that helped.\u201d\n\nBiles\u2019s overall tally of 20 worlds medals ties her with Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina for the most won by a woman.\n\nAnother four in Stuttgart would put her past the all-time record of 23 held by Vitaly Scherbo, a men\u2019s gymnastics star in the 1990s.\n\nBiles is the clear favourite to win all-around world gold for the fifth time, extending her own record, yet she has endured testing times away from the sport in the last two years.\n\nIn January 2018, she admitted to being among the victims of Larry Nassar, the disgraced former doctor of the US women\u2019s Olympic team, who was jailed for sexually abusing hundreds of girls and women.\n\nIn August, her brother was arrested and charged with a shooting which left three people dead last December.\n\nThis is likely to be her world championships swansong, having said she is \u201c99 percent\u201d sure she will not be at the 2021 event.\n\nAfter Stuttgart, her focus will turn to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where she will bid to add to her four-medal haul from Rio de Janeiro, where she took the team, all-around, vault and floor exercise titles.", "description": "Stuttgart (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 USA gymnastics queen Simone Biles made history on her opening appearance at the 2019 world championships on Saturday by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/0595fe_us-gymnastics-queen-simone-biles-landed-triple-twisting-double-on-floor-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
