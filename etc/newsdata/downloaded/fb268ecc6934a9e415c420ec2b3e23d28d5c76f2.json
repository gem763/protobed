Action Against Hunger has suspended full operations in Gambella, but are maintaining the provision of life-saving assistance.\u201d\n\nNguenyyiel camp hosts just over 74,000 refugees from South Sudan, according to data from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.\n\nThe refugees are part of 2.3 million who have fled South Sudan since 2013 when it descended into a civil war, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan, sparked by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar.\n\nThe conflict has killed 400,000 people, and also forced another 1.8 million out of their homes within South Sudan\u2019s boundaries and crippled production of oil, the country\u2019s main revenue earner.\n\n\u201cI am confident that Ethiopian authorities will arrest and prosecute those responsible for the attack,\u201d Steven Were, U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ethiopia, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ethiopia authorities on the incident.", "description": "Unidentified attackers killed two aid workers who were returning from a refugee camp in an western Ethiopia region that shares a border with South Sudan, their aid group and a U.N. organisation said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
