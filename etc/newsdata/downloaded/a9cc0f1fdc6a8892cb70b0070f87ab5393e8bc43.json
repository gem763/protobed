On capitol hill the first former white house aide in this inquiry now testifying behind closed doors reportedly telling congress former national security adviser John Bolton was so alarmed by the pressure campaign on Ukraine, he told that aide to alert white house lawyers. So let's bring in Mary Bruce there on capitol hill and, Mary, Bolton was especially concerned it seems about Rudy Giuliani calling him a hand grenade about to blow everyone up. Reporter: Cecilia, the president's own national security adviser at the time, John Bolton, was so concerned about Rudy Giuliani's campaign to pressure Ukraine for political help that he repeatedly tried to sound the alarm. Now, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that Fiona hill, the president's former Russia adviser told congressional investigators here that Giuliani, the president's personal attorney and allies inside the trump administration were going around official channels essentially running their own foreign policy to help the president. Hill says at one point the U.S. Ambassador to the eu, Gordon sondland told her that he was running Ukraine policy even though Ukraine isn't even in the eu. When she asked according to whom he told her the president. Now, John Bolton urged hill to take this matter to white house lawyers and tell them, quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal they are cooking up and he likened Giuliani to, quote, a hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up. Cecilia, hill did take this matter to white house attorneys but it is not clear what came of it. Yeah, Mary, now another twist it seems federal prosecutors are on the case as well reportedly investigating Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine and they may have been at this for months? Reporter: So, Cecilia, Giuliani tells us he's seen no indication he is under investigation but now there are reports that federal prosecutors are indeed investigating his business dealings in Ukraine. \"The Wall Street journal\" is reporting the prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Giuliani's bank records and have been questioning witnesses for weeks. Now we know that authorities are also looking into Giuliani's business ties with those two associates of his who were arrested last week after they allegedly were involved in campaign finance violations, Giuliani though has denied any wrongdoing, Cecilia. He certainly has.
