In fact, we have to get it right.\u201d\n\nThe joint appearance of NASA\u2019s top executive and the leader in commercial space was focused on timing and budget for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, which is the U.S. effort to once again launch people from Florida to the International Space Station. Since 2011, that has only happened aboard Russian spacecraft launched from Ukraine.\n\nAstronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley stood next to the pair as they addressed a crowd at the SpaceX headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve launched [cargo] to International Space Station 19 times,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that we\u2019ve done that 19 times.\u201d He added, \u201cHuman spaceflight is the reason SpaceX was created. We\u2019re honored to be doing that with NASA. It\u2019s truly a dream come true.\u201d\n\nMusk and Bridenstine said it appears people will not launch, even on a test flight, for the rest of 2019. But they said up to 10 tests of new parachutes will happen over the coming months, and they hope for a crewed flight in early 2020.\n\nThe united front comes after Bridenstine issued a statement Sept. 27 calling out SpaceX for delays in the development of the company\u2019s Commercial Crew capsule, Crew Dragon. Bridenstine made the statement on the eve of Musk\u2019s big announcement in Texas that he\u2019s proceeding toward a full prototype of SpaceX\u2019s Starship \u2014 a big, next-generation rocket/spaceship designed to carry people, eventually, to Mars.\n\nIn the meantime, SpaceX has a $2.6 billion NASA contract to shuttle American astronauts to and from the International Space Station using the Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nMusk responded to Bridenstine\u2019s statement in a comment to CNN, saying maybe Bridenstine was referring to delays in NASA\u2019s own program to build a big rocket called the Space Launch System that could travel to the moon, which is years behind schedule.\n\nIn their joint appearance Thursday, both men referenced their exchange, and said the safety of the astronauts is their top priority as they pursue return to U.S. human spaceflight.\n\n\u201cA lot of our programs have not been meeting cost and schedule. A lot of our programs are beyond cost and schedule,\u201d Bridenstine said.\n\nHe said he was signalling to SpaceX that the nation\u2019s top priority was getting astronauts back to the ISS from U.S. soil. But Bridenstine added that NASA is fully supportive of SpaceX\u2019s Starship project.\n\nMusk said he\u2019s heard people complaining that NASA is preventing the capsule\u2019s deployment with red tape.\n\n\u201cIs this like some kind of NASA bureaucracy that is delaying things? It is not,\u201d Musk said. He said the purpose is to \u201censure that American astronauts will be safe. Only at that point would we launch.\u201d\n\nBridenstine was careful not to speak ill of Russia.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with Russia is important and it\u2019s good,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to pay $85 million every time we have to launch an astronaut on a rocket. We want to make sure we don\u2019t have a day when we don\u2019t have an American astronaut on the International Space Station.\u201d\n\nBridenstein thanked Musk for a tour of SpaceX headquarters. He said it was good to shake hands SpaceX employees who are working on correcting problems with the Crew Dragon capsule that caused an explosion in a test firing in April.\n\nSince then SpaceX found that a titanium valve caused the explosion when it came into contact with liquid oxygen propellant. SpaceX has reduced the number of valves in the spacecraft and is using a different type of connection.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk presented a united front Thursday on the United States\u2019 pursuit to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
