On Friday, authorities announced a fifth death connected to e-cigarettes, battery-powered devices that can look like flash drives and pens and that mimic smoking by heating liquids with substances such as nicotine and marijuana.\n\nHow did the concerns start?\n\nE-cigarettes have been on sale for more than a decade, but reports of vaping-linked illness started proliferating this year.\n\nAn investigation by state health departments in Illinois and Wisconsin traces the first signs of illness among 53 tracked patients to April. The victims \u2014 mostly young men with a median age of 19 \u2014 overwhelmingly ended up in the hospital, many under intensive care. A third went on respirators.\n\nPatients typically experience coughing, chest pain or shortness of breath before their health deteriorates to the point they need to be hospitalized, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other reported symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and weight loss.\n\nMany victims have ended up with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a life-threatening condition in which fluid builds up in the lungs and prevents the oxygen people\u2019s bodies need to function from circulating in their bloodstream.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Lena Sun chronicled one Utah man\u2019s experience with the disease:\n\nWithin days, Alexander Mitchell had gone from being a 20-year-old hiking enthusiast to being kept alive by two machines forcing air into and out of his lungs and oxygenating his blood outside of his body. \u201cHe went from being sick to being on death\u2019s door in literally two days,\u201d recalled his father, Daniel Mitchell, as he struggled to grasp the unthinkable. \u201cThe doctor said he was dying. In all honesty, I was preparing to plan a funeral for my child. I wept and wept for this boy.\u201d ... Six weeks after he left the hospital, Mitchell has resumed hiking. But with his lung capacity diminished by 25 percent, he doesn\u2019t go for long or as often as he used to. He also struggles with his short-term memory. Doctors say they\u2019re not sure whether he will fully recover. The Washington Post\n\nThe first death to a vaping-related illness was reported Aug. 23 in Illinois. At that time, federal and state officials were investigating almost 200 cases of the baffling sickness in 22 states, according to the CDC.\n\nEarlier this week, Oregon officials announced a second death, saying a middle-aged adult fell seriously ill after vaping with marijuana oil. It was the first casualty linked to a store-bought product. (Authorities have not provided product details for the Illinois death).\n\nThree more deaths were soon disclosed in Indiana, Minnesota and California.\n\nOfficials say they are not sure why the afflictions are just now surfacing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all wondering if this is new or just newly recognized,\u201d the CDC\u2019s Dana Meaney-Delman said Friday.\n\n[Lung illness tied to vaping has killed 5 people as new case reports surge]\n\nWho is affected?\n\nAs of Friday, officials count 450 U.S. cases of potentially vaping-related illness spread among 33 states and one territory.\n\nWhile most of the victims have been young, all those who died were adults, according to authorities. One victim was 65, one middle-aged and another identified as older and suffering from chronic health problems. Officials have not specified the ages of the other two.\n\nWhat do we know about the cause of the illnesses?\n\nOfficials are still trying to figure out what, exactly, is causing people to fall ill. They think chemicals are to blame.\n\n\u201cThe focus of our investigation is narrowing, and that is great news, but we are still faced with complex questions in this outbreak that will take time to answer,\u201d Ileana Arias, the acting deputy director for noninfectious diseases at CDC, said.\n\nThe Post reported earlier this week that investigators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found the same vitamin E-derived oil in marijuana products vaped by multiple people sickened around the country. But officials cautioned that they could not yet pin the illnesses on it.\n\n[Contaminant found in marijuana vaping products linked to deadly lung illnesses, tests show]\n\nAnd authorities say it\u2019s apparently not just marijuana vaping making people sick. Some victims have said they vaped only nicotine products.\n\nOfficials add that there are no particular vaping devices or products linked to all cases and are looking into potential contamination or counterfeit, as many victims report buying marijuana on the street rather than from a store.\n\nAs authorities advise people to stop vaping as they try to get to the bottom of the illnesses -- the CDC is leading inquiries and working with state health departments -- some lawmakers have called for more urgent action. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) on Friday accused the FDA\u2019s acting chief Norman \u201cNed\u201d Sharpless of \u201csitting on his hands,\u201d tweeting that he would call for the leader\u2019s resignation if he did not \u201ctake action in the next 10 days.\u201d\n\nHow common is vaping?\n\nVaping has risen dramatically around the world \u2014 from 7 million users in 2011 to 35 million a few years ago \u2014 as smoking rates decline.\n\nTobacco and cigarette company Altria Group estimated nearly 14 million nicotine e-cigarette users in the United States earlier this summer. Another study found last year that more than half of American adult e-cigarette users are under 35 years old, stoking concerns about vaping among young people.\n\nStudies showing vaping\u2019s growing popularity among teens sparked particular worry last year. About 37 percent of 12th-graders reported vaping over the past year in one government-funded U.S. survey released in December \u2014 nearly a 10 percentage point increase from 2017. Past-month nicotine vaping rates among the seniors doubled, and younger students also reported higher use; marijuana vaping rose, too. And a CDC report found last year that e-cigarettes were the most popular product among the nearly 5 million high school and middle school students who used tobacco within a 30-day period.\n\n[How two Stanford grads aimed for big tech glory and got Big Tobacco instead]\n\nWhy were e-cigarettes controversial before the vaping-linked illness reports?\n\nMysterious illnesses aside, many have accused e-cigarette manufacturers of exposing young people to addictive nicotine and luring them toward smoking. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine say they found \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that youths who try vaping are more likely to use conventional cigarettes.\n\nLast fall, then-FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb called teenage vaping an \u201cepidemic\u201d as he announced a crackdown on more than 1,300 entities allegedly selling e-cigarettes to minors. He threatened to ban the flavored vaping liquids that have drawn so much scrutiny for their appeal to young people \u2014 unless e-cigarette manufacturers such as Juul Labs worked to substantially curb underage use.\n\nThat threat has not come to fruition at a federal level, but Michigan on Wednesday became the first state to announce a ban on flavored vaping products. San Francisco \u2014 home to Juul Labs \u2014 became the first city to ban all e-cigarette sales in June, a year after it outlawed flavored products.\n\nE-cigarette makers have lobbied aggressively against these measures and argue that their products can help smokers quit while giving those addicted to nicotine a safer option than burning tobacco. They say they\u2019re working to address underage vaping and warn that an outright ban could just replace regulated sales with a black market.\n\nThe CDC agrees that e-cigarettes can help smokers who substitute them for regular tobacco products, and health professionals believe vaping to be safer than traditional smoking, which kills 8 million people per year according to the World Health Organization. But the FDA has yet to vet vaping products, and experts caution that the long-term consequences of using e-cigarettes remain unclear.\n\nRead more:\n\nMallinckrodt reaches settlement with \u2018bellwether\u2019 counties in mammoth opioid lawsuit\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s sugary or diet: New study links all soda to an early death\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster is still a mystery.
