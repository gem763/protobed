The stock notched yet another record high Friday, its fifth over the past six trading sessions, and it\u2019s by far the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.57% for 2019.\n\nConsensus estimates, however, don\u2019t back up all the supposed enthusiasm about Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter report, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. Analysts surveyed by FactSet see the company posting revenue of $63 billion, nearly flat from $62.9 billion a year ago. The report will cap off a fiscal year in which Apple\u2019s earnings and revenue are both expected to decline from a year earlier, which has happened at Apple only once since 2001.\n\nThe fiscal fourth-quarter numbers will only contain a little more than a week\u2019s worth of iPhone 11 sales, so the big test for Apple is in its outlook, which should show how the company expects its devices to perform over the holidays. Analysts are calling for a December-quarter sales bump over last year, but overall estimates haven\u2019t budged for the period since the end of July.\n\nStill, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Katy Huberty, the most bullish analyst on the stock, says Apple doesn\u2019t even have to do much with its earnings report to sustain its share-price trajectory.\n\nOpinion: Apple iPhone event reveals a dramatic change in strategy\n\n\u201cWe believe Apple remains underowned by investors despite the 15% gain since last reporting earnings and therefore if Apple is able to post in-line September-quarter results and December-quarter guidance then the stock can sustain momentum into year-end, barring any major shocks to global markets,\u201d she wrote. \u201cUltimately investors appear to be owning the stock for the coming 5G iPhone cycle and ramping new services so even in the scenario of light December-quarter guidance, we expect inflows to the name in early 2020 as Apple\u2019s multiple typically expands in the nine to 12 months ahead of major product cycles.\u201d\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect that Apple earned $2.83 a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, down from $2.91 in the year-earlier quarter. According to Estimize, which crowdsources projections from hedge funds, academics, and others, the average projection calls for $2.89.\n\nRevenue: The FactSet consensus models $62.98 billion in September-quarter revenue, while the Estimize consensus is for $63.06 billion. A year earlier, Apple posted revenue of $62.9 billion.\n\nThe FactSet consensus calls for $32.77 billion in iPhone revenue, $4.67 billion in iPad revenue, $7.5 billion in Mac revenue, $5.94 billion in wearables, home, and accessories revenue, and $12.22 billion in services revenue.\n\nStock movement: Apple shares have gained following seven of the company\u2019s last 10 earnings reports, excluding a negative preannouncement made ahead of Apple\u2019s last holiday quarter. The stock is up 56% so far this year as the Dow has risen 16%.\n\nWhat else to watch for\n\nOne topic of interest heading into Apple\u2019s report is how the company plans to account for its new Apple TV+ streaming service. The company is offering a year\u2019s free trial to the service for those who make new hardware purchases, which Huberty says will require Apple to defer about $57 per iPhone sold to amortize as Apple TV+ services revenue over the year that the trial is active. She also expects that Apple will amortize content costs as services cost of goods sold for three years, but management may provide some guidance regarding the accounting treatment on the conference call.\n\nHuberty rates the stock at overweight with a $289 target, the highest on Wall Street.\n\nApple TV+ is a big theme for D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte as well, with the service set to launch Nov. 1. He\u2019ll be looking for the company\u2019s outlook on the service now that pricing has been announced and Apple has publicized its free-trial offer affecting those who buy new iPhones, iPads, Macs, iPods or Apple TVs. Forte has a buy rating and $270 target on Apple shares.\n\nOpinion: Apple design should be fine without Jony Ive\n\nChina traction is another major issue for Apple, and UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri sees the company making progress in the region, which has been a sore spot thus far this year. \u201cMonthly iPhone trends in China are encouraging,\u201d he wrote, with the company posting sales growth there in two of the past three months, according to third-party data.\n\nHe rates Apple\u2019s stock a buy with a $275 target price.\n\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co. analyst Brian White tells investors to be mindful of the timing differences between this current cycle and the last one. All three of Apple\u2019s new iPhones were available on Sept. 20 this year, whereas Apple released last season\u2019s iPhone XR that October. He rates the stock a buy with a $265 target.", "description": "From one look at Apple Inc.\u2019s stock, you might think that Wall Street was expecting something big from the company\u2019s coming earnings report.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR387_iPhone_ZG_20190916130302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
