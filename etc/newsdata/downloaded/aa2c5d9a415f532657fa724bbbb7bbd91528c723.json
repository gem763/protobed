That personal discipline, pride,\n\npresence and communication.\n\n\"All those skill sets which we foster in a team ethos and a team spirit which is brothers in arms.\u201d", "description": "The 1st Battalion the Coldstream Guards and the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland are on a live fire pre-deployment training mission in Kenya", "authors": ["Oliver Pritchard"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725612.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WS_STR__231019_ARMY_KENYA_15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
