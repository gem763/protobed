Mason Greenwood has huge potential, but it is a big ask for him to lead United\u2019s attack at the age of 17.\n\n\u201cI have some sympathy for Rashford, who failed to score in open play for the sixth successive match this season, because it would not give me great hope of getting 25 or 30 goals if I was playing in that team \u2013 but he has got to help himself too.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know if the 21-year-old is going to end up as as a centre-forward, but if he is going to be a top-class striker with a killer instinct then his movement in the box needs to improve dramatically, and he needs to learn to score the ugly goals as well.\u201d\n\nRashford struggled again vs West Ham before leaving the game injured (REUTERS)\n\nRashford will hope to return to the pitch soon after coming off at the London Stadium with a groin injury, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer anticipates being without the forward for a \u201clittle while\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe felt his groin,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a scan tomorrow to see how badly he\u2019s injured. I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be out, I\u2019m not a doctor. But he\u2019ll probably be out for a little while.\u201d", "description": "Alan Shearer believes Marcus Rashford must improve his movement inside the penalty area to prove himself as Manchester United\u2019s centre-forward.The England forward has struggled for form recently, firing a blank in the 2-0 loss to West Ham to extend his run without a goal in open play to six matches.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TNpDQ4H3lPZXGRZ5103D2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KcWQCZL7ILGyMSV1Sl8RQA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2172df9c15427cdc481e1e11eb7c86c2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
