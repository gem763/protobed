(Photo Illustration: Quinn Lemmers, Yahoo Lifestyle)\n\nThe word \u201cteacher,\u201d for many, has long been synonymous with \u201chero.\u201d\n\nOn social media, political stages and news sites, teachers are hailed as indefatigable public servants, selflessly working to shape the next generation of Americans. It\u2019s a reputation they\u2019ve undoubtedly earned, aided in part by how many roles (therapist, parent, first responder) they\u2019re often forced to take on.\n\nOf course, there are bad teachers; but the good ones are ubiquitous. Educators who give everything they have and then give more: donating kidneys, fostering their own students and literally taking bullets to tackle school shooters. Still, accurate as this heroic depiction may be, many feel it\u2019s been misused in recent years to excuse undervaluing and mistreating educators across the country.\n\nBecause teachers, perhaps more than ever, know what they\u2019re worth. And they\u2019re fed up with others not acknowledging it too. \u201cA lot of my colleagues are feeling overwhelmed by the burden that teaching has become,\u201d Rachel Bardes, a former Spanish teacher in Florida, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThings have just gotten so bad.\u201d\n\nTeachers \u2014 as Bardes and more than 50 others shared in an exclusive Yahoo Lifestyle survey \u2014 are sick of budget cuts, classroom violence and salaries so low they need two extra jobs. They\u2019re tired of standardized tests that stifle their creativity and a job that demands their every waking moment \u2014 even when they\u2019re ill. As Sariah McCall, a teacher whose resignation letter went viral in April, wrote, \u201cIt is unrealistic to expect this much of people. We\u2019re teachers, but we\u2019re still people.\u201d\n\nOf the dozens of teachers who spoke with Yahoo Lifestyle, many said that the conditions they\u2019ve endured are fuel to fight for better ones \u2014 a trend reflected in the historic statewide walkouts beginning in West Virginia this past February (and rippling to five other states since). But for an increasing number of educators\u2014 whether due to family, personal well-being or other factors \u2014 it\u2019s all simply too much to bear.\n\nAccording to a Labor Department report (obtained by the Wall Street Journal), teachers quit the profession in 2018 at the highest rate of any year on record. Roughly 1 million public education workers walked away that year, and experts predict those numbers will only get worse. The result is shortages of teachers in multiple states and a dropping number of education majors nationwide.\n\nTo explore this national crisis, Yahoo Lifestyle conducted a survey aimed at teachers who made the decision \u2014 most, in 2019 \u2014 to leave the classroom for good. More than 50 former K-12 public school teachers from over 20 states participated, sharing intimate details of ending a career that many imagined would last a lifetime.\n\nAccording to a report from the U.S. Department of Labor, teachers left the profession in 2018 in numbers never seen before.

He, like many, was motivated to leave in order to have time to be with his kids. Others shared reasons like financial instability or budget cuts, but none seemed immune to the physical and mental toll taken by one of the most stressful jobs in America.", "description": "More teachers left the profession in 2018 than any other year on record.
