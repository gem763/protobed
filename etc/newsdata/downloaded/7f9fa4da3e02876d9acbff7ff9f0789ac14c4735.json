(Paul Bereswill/Getty Images)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Luis Severino last pitched in a major-league game 339 days ago.\n\nIt was Oct. 8, 2018 \u2014 Game 3 of the 2018 ALDS.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd it was an absolute disaster.\n\nSeverino allowed six runs on seven hits in three innings, and the New Yankees were blown out 16-1 by the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox to fall into a 2-1 series hole (New York was ultimately eliminated in four).\n\nEven before then, controversy swirled around whether Severino knew what time the game started, as he had begun throwing in the bullpen just eight minutes before first pitch (Severino denied that was the case afterward).\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve had good starts in the playoffs before, so I don\u2019t take that as a bad thing,\u201d Severino replied recently when asked if he thinks about that outing given how long he\u2019s had to wait for his next one. \u201cThe game before \u2014 the wild-card game against the Oakland A\u2019s \u2014 I gave them four good innings (with no runs allowed).\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have games like that. You\u2019re going to go out there and not have your best stuff, and Boston was the best team all year. When it happens, you try to be better.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old right hander hasn\u2019t gotten a chance just yet. Multiple injuries have prevented him from pitching after signing a four-year, $40 million contract extension in the offseason.\n\nFirst, inflammation in his rotator cuff.\n\nNext, a setback due to a Grade 2 lat strain.\n\nThe Yankees even acknowledged missteps in their handling of Severino\u2019s rehab.\n\nHe didn\u2019t make his first minor-league rehab start until Sept. 1 \u2014 a rusty, one-plus inning outing with Triple-A Scranton that Yankees manager Aaron Boone compared to the pitcher\u2019s first start of spring training.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt was like getting into a room with a bunch of candies,\u201d Severino said of his excitement getting back on the mound. He did a lot of thinking out there, perhaps too much, wondering if his glove was in the proper position or whether he was tipping his pitches.\n\nSeverino looked sharper five days later (3 IP, 1 HR, 5 K, 50 pitches at Double-A Trenton), hitting 95-97 mph on the radar gun. Wednesday is expected to be the final hurdle before his return to the roster, one last rehab start with the Thunder.\n\n\u201cTo me, he\u2019s demonstrated enough to be an option,\u201d Boone told reporters in Boston.\n\nThat would enable Severino to make his first start for the Yankees when the team returns to The Bronx on Sept. 17-19 to face the Los Angeles Angels. He could potentially get three starts before the postseason to knock off the rust. He thinks he can get up to around 100 pitches by then, but that seems extremely ambitious.\n\n\u201cI mean, (this whole situation) has been a bit bad,\u201d Severino said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about the team. We got a great team here, we\u2019re in first place, I\u2019m getting better now and I\u2019m going to go pitch in the playoffs and maybe win a World Series.\u201d\n\nLuis Severino is expected to make his final rehab start Wednesday.

The 27-year-old Manaea came back after undergoing shoulder surgery, though he had been making minor-league rehab starts since July. So far, he\u2019s gone 1-0 with a 0.75 ERA and 15 strikeouts in two starts.\n\nAcross town, New York Mets righty Marcus Stroman (ACL) once made all of four September starts in 2015 before dealing for the Toronto Blue Jays in the postseason, though he was doing rehab outings in August.\n\nA pitcher like Severino going 0 to 100 \u2014 essentially spring training to the playoffs \u2014 in a month seems like a difficult challenge. Yet the Yankees need rotation depth behind emerging ace James Paxton (8-0, 2.57 ERA in his last eight starts) and postseason stalwart Masahiro Tanaka (1.50 playoff ERA in five starts).\n\nWith a deep bullpen, they would be more than happy to sign up for a scoreless, four-inning start like Severino had against the A\u2019s in the wild-card game. After all, the Yankees need to make sure not to overexert him given how valuable he is to their future going forward.\n\nAnd immediate expectations must be realistic. Severino owns a 6.26 ERA in six career playoff starts.\n\n\u201cAll Severino needs to go is four or five innings because of their bullpen,\u201d one scout said. \u201cPaxton looks sharp, and he\u2019s capable of beating anyone when he\u2019s on (though he\u2019s never pitched in the playoffs before). And Tanaka can step up in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nLast season, Severino had a 1.98 ERA in his first 18 starts, but a 5.67 ERA in his final 14 outings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much velocity with him as it is commanding his stuff,\u201d the scout said of Severino. \u201cHe had a great first half, but when he struggled in the second half it was because a lot of his pitches were center cut.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that in the big leagues. You\u2019ve got to really work the edges and then expand. You\u2019re not going to be successful over the middle. He\u2019s not going to fool you. He\u2019s not going to pitch backwards. He\u2019s a power guy with a fastball and slider \u2014 and he mixes in a changeup \u2014 so he\u2019s really gotta depend on late life and locate.\u201d\n\nYankees have pitching decisions before October\n\nOn Wednesday, 39-year-old veteran CC Sabathia will also return from his latest knee injury when he starts against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.\n\nSabathia (4.93 ERA), who hasn\u2019t gotten past the fifth inning since July 16, admitted to reporters recently that he would\u2019ve retired if this wasn\u2019t his final season. A spot on the postseason roster presumably hinges on his health.\n\nDomingo German, the 27-year-old righty who has a breakout season with 17 wins, will piggyback behind Sabathia. German has thrown a career-high 136.2 innings, and the Yankees may elect to use him in the bullpen come October.\n\nVeteran southpaw J.A. Happ has often looked as though he could be left off the postseason roster, but he\u2019s posted back-to-back scoreless outings at the perfect time. If nothing else, Happ (5.10 ERA) has held lefties to a .680 OPS, making him a viable left-on-left relief option.\n\nBoone also hasn\u2019t ruled out the idea of using Chad Green as an opener. Green has posted a 4.15 ERA in that role (28 strikeouts in 17.1 innings), and the Yankees are 11-2 in his starts.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be ironed out.\n\nBut the goal remains getting 27 outs \u2014 regardless of how it\u2019s done. And with Tommy Kahnle, Adam Ottavino, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman at the backend (Dellin Betances is also working his way back), the Yankees are positioned to get creative if needed.\n\nThey just don\u2019t have the luxury of Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole and Zack Greinke like the Houston Astros.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that I\u2019m going to start,\u201d Severino said. \u201cBut I just want to help my team. If it\u2019s in the bullpen, if it\u2019s starting, I just want to help.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Yankees righty Luis Severino, who has yet to pitch this season due to injuries, will make his final minor-league rehab start on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Viy99s0t0PxPOJ2v_fL2JQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MzguNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NU3.UwRzexuVoJ42sNEzMQ--~B/aD0zMjA0O3c9NDg5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6c381bd0-d441-11e9-afff-8e4caca4bc6e", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
