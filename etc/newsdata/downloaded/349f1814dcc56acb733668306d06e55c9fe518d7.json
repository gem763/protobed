Meanwhile, the bank's provisions and contingencies amounted to INR27.01 billion, up 48% from INR18.20 billion.\n\nProfit after tax increased 9.8% at HDFC's retail-broking subsidiary and fell 14% at its non-deposit-taking financial services unit.\n\nWrite to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 21, 2019 00:24 ET (04:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
