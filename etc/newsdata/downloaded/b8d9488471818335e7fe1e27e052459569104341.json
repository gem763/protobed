Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Monday announced a deal on the formation of a committee to draft a new Syrian constitution \u2014 ending a years-old deadlock with government of Bashar al-Assad but with uncertain prospects for a full political solution to the eight-year long civil war that has devastated the country.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce the agreement of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian Negotiations Commission for a credible, balanced and inclusive Constitutional Committee that will be facilitated by the United Nations in Geneva,\" Guterres said at the start of the U.N.'s annual General Assembly week in New York.\n\n\"I strongly believe that the launch of the Syrian-owned and Syrian-led Constitutional Committee can and must be the beginning of the political path out of the tragedy toward a solution,\" in line with U.N. resolutions, he said.\n\nThe former U.N. envoy for the Syrian conflict, Staffan de Mistura, had worked for more than a year to create such a committee before conceding failure in December 2018 after the sides could not reach agreement on the list of 50 people to serve on the panel. The failure of that effort also coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which eased pressure on Damascus and left Russian President Vladimir Putin as the most influential external power.\n\nA new Syrian constitution is expected to include presidential term limits that would at least theoretically signal a potential end to Assad's rule. Syrian opposition groups have insisted on Assad's removal, while Putin has deployed Russian military muscle to keep Assad in power.\n\nThe bloody Syrian conflict has dragged on amid a hodge-podge of peace efforts, including a U.N. initiative known as the Geneva process, and an initiative called the Astana process sponsored Russia, Iran and Turkey. Neither has yielded much progress.\n\nGuterres, speaking to reporters at U.N. headquarters, expressed thanks to the Russian, Turkish and Iranian governments, and he said the U.N.'s current envoy, Geir Pedersen, would step up efforts to bring the sides together.\n\n\"The Constitutional Committee\u2019s launch and work must be accompanied by concrete actions to build trust and confidence as my Special Envoy discharges his mandate to facilitate a broader political process forward,\" Guterres said.\n\nAt a press conference following most recent meeting of the sponsors of the Astana process, Putin threw shade at Saudi Arabia and the U.S., offering to sell the Saudis Russian-made air defense systems after Trump implicated Iran in a drone attack on Saudi oil assets.", "description": "Agreement \u2018must be the beginning of the political path out of the tragedy,\u2019  Guterres says.", "authors": ["David M.
