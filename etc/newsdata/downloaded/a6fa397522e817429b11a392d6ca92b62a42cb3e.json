USA TODAY\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2013 Before the first penalty, David Bakhtiari approached umpire Jeff Rice, frustrated, confused and downright incredulous, and asked a simple but potentially game-altering question.\n\nAll night, Detroit Lions defensive end Trey Flowers used the same move against the Green Bay Packers\u2019 All-Pro left tackle. Flowers would jam his hands high and in, near Bakhtiari\u2019s chin strap. Whether Flowers\u2019 hands were at Bakhtiari\u2019s neck and face area or not was perhaps open to perspective.\n\nBakhtiari, naturally a little biased, thought there was no doubt.\n\n\u201cI went over to the ref,\u201d Bakhtiari recalled in a corner of the Packers locker room, before slipping out into the night after his team\u2019s 23-22 comeback win Monday, \u201cI said, \u2018Hey, are we not calling hands to the face again? Because the past three plays, I\u2019ve been staring at the sky.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, you know, he\u2019s not looking at my side, but I at least made him aware.\u201d\n\nBakhtiari, perhaps, made Rice a little too aware.\n\nMore: Ex-Detroit Lions QB Dan Orlovsky rips NFL for its officiating 'epidemic'\n\nMore: Barry Sanders, Clay Matthews, Tony Dungy among those upset over refs in Packers-Lions game\n\nFlowers was called for a pair of illegal-hands-to-the-face penalties that went a long way toward deciding Monday night\u2019s game.\n\nThe first came after a third-down sack with 10:16 left in the fourth quarter, a play that would have forced the Packers to punt. Careful review of the replay \u2013 something referee Clete Blakeman couldn\u2019t benefit from last night \u2013 showed Flowers\u2019 left hand clasp the inside of Bakhtiari\u2019s right shoulder. At the end of the play, Flowers\u2019 hand slips off Bakhtiari\u2019s shoulder and briefly brushes by the left tackle\u2019s facemask. Flowers\u2019 hand didn\u2019t linger at Bakhtiari\u2019s facemask, and he never grabbed the facemask, but there was some contact.\n\nThe Packers scored three plays later when quarterback Aaron Rodgers dropped a dime to receiver Allen Lazard for a 35-yard touchdown. A nine-point deficit \u2013 with the Lions poised to take possession \u2013 was suddenly down to two.\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t \u201cprolonged\u201d contact, and shouldn\u2019t have been a penalty, but Trey Flowers at least brushed David Bakhtiari\u2019s facemask (ever so briefly) on the first illegal-hands flag. There\u2019s at least a case that could be made, if still a bad one.\n\n\n\nThe second one? Yeah, no. pic.twitter.com/27FIGO5AOI \u2014 Ryan Wood (@ByRyanWood) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cIt was hands to the chest initially,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cI was doing it all game. I didn\u2019t know that was a flag to the chest. I didn\u2019t think hands to the chest was a penalty. I thought hands to the face (was a penalty).\n\n\u201cI had him right here to the chest, and the second time I changed it. I don\u2019t think that was a penalty.\u201d\n\nThe second time \u2013 and, without question, the more egregious call of the two \u2013 came after a third-down incompletion inside the two-minute warning. It appeared the Packers would be forced to attempt their potential go-ahead field goal with 1:36 left. The Lions, who were without timeouts, would have a chance to take the lead back.\n\nWatching the play live, Bakhtiari\u2019s head jars back and upward. On replay, Flowers\u2019 left hand clasps the inside of Bakhtiari\u2019s left shoulder. It never contacts Bakhtiari\u2019s facemask or neck.\n\nBlakeman acknowledged he had spoken with Rice about the second penalty. In Rice\u2019s mind, Blakeman said, Flowers had prolonged contact to Bakhtiari\u2019s neck and face area \u2013 something replay shows did not happen.\n\n\u201cI can definitely tell you,\u201d Bakhtiari said, \u201cfor a good portion of the game, I was getting my throat punched in, and I was looking up at the sky a fair amount. If you think about it, if your hand is in my throat, you\u2019re probably hitting my facemask, which is pushing my head up in the sky.\u201d\n\nIn the past two weeks, Bakhtiari felt he was on the unfortunate end of \u201cpretty egregious\u201d holding penalties. After a questionable penalty one week earlier in Dallas, Bakhtiari was again called for holding in the first quarter Monday night. On the play, Bakhtiari double-team blocked Flowers with left guard Elgton Jenkins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting there,\u201d Bakhtiari said, \u201cI asked him, \u2018So what, how is that holding? What did I do?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Your hand was across him.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018No, it was not.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018Well, I thought your hand was across him.\u2019\u201d\n\nRice was perhaps left guessing again in the fourth quarter. This time, Bakhtiari and the Packers benefited from the calls.\n\nAsked inside the locker room if he thought the Lions had a legitimate gripe, Bakhtiari didn\u2019t say yes. He also didn\u2019t say no.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to go both ways,\u201d Bakhtiari said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get calls for you, and you\u2019re going to get calls against you. Fortunately, those two calls went in our favor, and from my vantage point, I\u2019m just looking up at the sky.\n\n\u201cIt can go both ways. That\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to look at it. that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
