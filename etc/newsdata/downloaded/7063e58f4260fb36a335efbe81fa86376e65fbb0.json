The Swedish Academy\u2019s Nobel Committee would bestow not one, but two awards, to make up for last year\u2019s no-show. And it promised that, after a period of intense self-reflection brought on by the scandal, everything would change.\n\n\n\nFamously opaque, the Nobel Committee announced earlier this year that it would be more transparent in an effort to regain the public\u2019s trust. Notoriously Eurocentric, it also indicated that it would broaden its purview to better include authors from the rest of the world. \u201cWe need to widen our perspective,\u201d Anders Olsson, the committee\u2019s new head, said in a video hyping the revamped Nobel. Having historically marched to the beat of its own drum, the Swedish Academy seemed, at long last, to be listening to its critics.\n\n\n\nBut when Olsson stepped through the Academy\u2019s gilded double doors to announce the winners of the 2018 and 2019 Nobel Prizes, it became clear that the Academy had set out to invite criticism, not quell it. The winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize was Olga Tokarczuk, a Polish novelist whose ambitious, deeply political work has made her an enemy of nationalists in her country. The 2019 Nobel Prize was won by Austrian Peter Handke, one of the greatest novelists of his generation who is now most famous for having eulogized Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the Serbian military leader who died while being tried for war crimes at The Hague.\n\nThis was not, in other words, a clean break from the past for the Academy. Instead, as Swedish journalist and Nobel-watcher Jens Liljestrand told me, \u201cThe prizes mirror the Academy\u2019s identity crises.\u201d Handke was likely \u201ca concession to the Academy old guard,\u201d while Tokarczuk represents the kind of new voice Olsson said he intends to elevate. And both awards show that, despite its professed global ambitions, the Nobel Prize in Literature is still bogged down in Europe. Taken together, it\u2019s difficult to discern what the Prize stands for anymore, other than to provide a new shock every time October rolls around.", "description": "In giving the award to Peter Handke, an apologist for Serbian war crimes, the Swedish Academy may have finally shown its true colors.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/bad94a06b1ea2ff1f939f5f17bc62bab625348ca.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
