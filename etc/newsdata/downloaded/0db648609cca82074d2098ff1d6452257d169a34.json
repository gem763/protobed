That means any requests would have to go through a longer procedure than a simple complaint to a regulator.\n\n\u201cEU law does not preclude a host provider such as Facebook from being ordered to remove identical and, in certain circumstances, equivalent comments previously declared to be illegal,\u201d the court said. \u201cIn addition, EU law does not preclude such an injunction from producing effects worldwide, within the framework of the relevant international law which it is for member states to take into account.\u201d\n\nThe court ruled after an Austrian politician, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, sued Facebook in her home nation to remove comments she considered bad for her reputation and insulting in a post that could be seen by any Facebook user.\n\nAustria\u2019s Supreme court turned to the EU\u2019s top court for an interpretation of a European rule that says online platforms are not liable for illegal content they are unaware of, as long as they act swiftly to remove or block it once they are informed about it.\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, noted that the ruling is limited to court orders and did \u201cnot concern any other forms of notice submitted by users alleging that certain content is illegal.\u201d\n\nFacebook said the ruling raises critical questions around freedom of expression.\n\nIt already has a system to restrict content if and where it violates any given country\u2019s laws. \u201cThis ruling goes much further,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country,\u201d it said.\n\nThe move comes after the same court ruled last month that the EU\u2019s \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules - which allow people to ask for the removal of some search results that come up for their name - do not apply outside the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling on Facebook is likely to encourage internet platforms more widely to step up their efforts to monitor user content.\n\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association, a lobby group including members such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, said Thursday\u2019s decision could infringe the right to free speech.\n\n\u201cThe ruling essentially allows one country or region to decide what Internet users around the world can say and what information they can access,\u201d said CCIA Europe senior manager Victoria de Posson. \u201cWhat might be considered defamatory comments about someone in one country will likely be considered constitutional free speech in another. Few hosting platforms, especially startups, will have the resources to implement elaborate monitoring systems.\u201d", "description": "The ruling would increase the onus on Facebook to monitor what appears on the internet.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD579_facebo_ZG_20190207175901.jpg"}
