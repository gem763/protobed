Instead of competing directly against fintech and third-party institutions, incumbents can leverage open banking to partner with them instead, and thereby remain competitive in the rapidly evolving industry. Open banking will transform how incumbents interact with third-party providers. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nOpen banking has the ability to transform how incumbents interact with not only fintechs and each other, but with consumers as well. We outline exactly what open banking is, and describe what financial institutions stand to gain by adopting it.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen banking is set to shake up the financial experiences for customers across the globe \u2013 in a good way. With this system, banks open up their application programming interfaces (APIs), allowing third parties to access financial information needed to develop new apps and services and providing account holders greater financial transparency options.\n\nWhile open banking allows third parties to develop better personal finance management (PFM) applications, it places pressure on incumbents to improve their own offerings. Open banking services cultivate competition in the banking industry \u2013 forcing incumbents to either enhance their financial services or partner with fintechs.\n\nWhat is a Banking API?\n\nAPIs are a set of codes and protocols that decide how different software components should interact \u2013 they essentially allow different applications to communicate with one another. APIs are essential to open banking services. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAccording to The Monetization of Open Banking Report from Business Insider Intelligence, APIs have been used to connect developers to payment networks as well as display billing details on a bank's website. Through open banking, APIs are now being used to issue commands to third party providers.\n\nAPIs are also necessary for the functionality of Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) \u2013 a key component of open banking. BaaS is an end-to-end process that connects fintechs and other third parties to banks' systems directly through the use of APIs. It helps to build up banks' offerings on top of financial providers' regulated infrastructure.\n\nOpen Banking Examples\n\nBBVA: In 2018, BBVA launched its BaaS platform, Open Platform, in the US. Open Platform utilizes APIs that allow third parties to offer customers financial products without needing to provide a full suite of banking services.\n\nHSBC: HSBC launched its Connected Money app in May 2018 in response to the UK's open banking regulations that attempt to place more control of financial data into the hands of consumers. Connected Money allows customers to view various bank accounts as well as loans, mortgages, and credit cards, in one place.\n\nFile photo of the logo of Barclays seen on the top of one of its branch in Madrid Reuters\n\nBarclays: Flaunting its success in the open banking market, Barclays claims to be the first UK bank to enable account aggregation inside its mobile banking app. Its open banking feature allows customers to view their account with other banks within Barclays' mobile app.\n\nBenefits of Open Banking\n\nOpen banking has the potential to increase revenue streams while expanding customer reach for financial institutions \u2013 an opportunity incumbents shouldn't ignore. It can also create revenue-sharing ecosystems, where incumbents give customers access to third-party-developed services while profiting from a subscription or referral basis.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence projects the revenue potential in the UK generated through Open Banking-enabled small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and retail customer propositions to reach $2 billion by 2024 \u2013 a 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nAdditionally, open banking allows banks to commercialize their infrastructure by moving into the BaaS space and providing core services to fintechs and other third parties.\n\nOpen Banking in the UK vs. US\n\nThe open banking movement began in the UK and has consequently spread across Europe. In 2018, the UK Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) Open Banking rules went into effect, requiring the nine largest retail and SMB account providers to give qualified third-party providers access to customer-permitted data. UK open banking regulations will soon make waves across the globe. BI Intelligence\n\nUK regulations have made waves across Europe, with a multitude of countries following suit and forming their own open banking frameworks. Since US incumbents operate under different regulations however, open banking adoption has been slower \u2013 but growing customer demand and pressure from competitors is forcing the US to start playing catch-up.\n\nOpen Banking Trends\n\nWith the fast-growing demand for financial services, incumbents are in constant competition with fintechs \u2013 but open banking offers them the opportunity to combat these pressures by instead partnering with them. Open banking is transforming relationships between incumbent institutions and their customers by shifting the narrative that customers themselves should have ownership of transactional data instead of their respective financial institutions.\n\nWant to Learn More?\n\nOpen banking has already transformed the banking landscape in the UK and is now rippling across Europe to the US.
