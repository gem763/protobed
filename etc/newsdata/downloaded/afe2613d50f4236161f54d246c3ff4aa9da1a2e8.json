Chances are they will say no. And research shows that we collectively are an under-slept nation. For a while, the conventional wisdom was that you can\u2019t \u201ccatch up\u201d on lost sleep\u2014that the sleep you didn\u2019t get last night is gone and each night of poor sleep you get will continue to eat at your health.\n\nWell, a new study has turned that idea on its head. In the study, those who slept poorly during the week (five or fewer hours per night) but slept in on weekends had the same mortality risk as people who consistently slept six to seven hours per night. The kicker: those poor sleepers that didn\u2019t sleep longer on weekends showed a 65% higher mortality rate.\n\nThis study flips the narrative on how much sleep is good for you and when you need to get it. I\u2019d like to unpack some of these mysteries to show you how you can sleep better\u2014not just on weekends, but every night.\n\nA Game-Changing Sleep Study\n\nThis landmark sleep study wasn\u2019t conducted on a couple dozen lab rats. It was conducted in Sweden on 38,000 adults over the course of 13 years\u2014enough people and enough time to derive a lot of meaningful data.\n\nIts primary finding is very important because it debunks the idea that you can\u2019t make up for lost sleep. Instead, it promotes the idea that sleep is like a bank\u2014poor weekday sleep is like a withdrawal and extra weekend sleep is like a deposit.\n\nThat should take some pressure off light sleepers and encourage them to slow down and relax on weekends, especially in the mornings.\n\nIn addition to its finding that extra sleep on weekends for poor sleepers is strongly linked with prevention of early death, it also revealed this nugget: consistently getting eight or more hours of sleep correlates with a 25% higher chance of premature death.\n\nTogether, these findings sound like a mixed signal. Too little sleep is bad. Too much sleep is bad. But it\u2019s OK to get too little sleep on weekdays as long as you get a lot of sleep on weekends. I don\u2019t blame you if you lose sleep just trying to make sense of it all!\n\nLet me make it easier for you: just focus on getting quality sleep every night. Here are a few tips to help you do just that.\n\nWhat\u2019s Preventing You from Getting Adequate Sleep?\n\nThis and many other studies bypass something vital to how much sleep you get: what is keeping you awake? Unfortunately, for most people there isn\u2019t one answer. More often there are many answers. Excess caffeine, stress, anxiety, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, excess exposure to blue light, the list goes on.\n\nI could write a book to unpack all of the things that are robbing you of your sleep. So briefly, here are a few lifestyle changes that won\u2019t just help you sleep better at night, but also feel better throughout the day.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nConsider a diet change that includes more organic and unprocessed food, more lean proteins and low-sugar vegetables, and minimal artificial flavor enhancers such as aspartame. Further, avoid eating large, late dinners. They require more time and energy for your body to digest them, which can make it hard to fall asleep.\n\nExercise daily for every reason, but especially to consistently sleep better.\n\nTake an inventory of your stressors and think about ways to reduce each of them. Very often, the simple act of daily meditation won\u2019t remove the stressor itself but it helps your mind cope with it. This alone can remove a significant barrier to sleep, especially if you are the type that tends to worry about things while lying in bed.\n\nNatural Sleep Remedies\u2014Magnolia Bark and Melatonin\n\nSpeaking of stress, I have another secret weapon that fights stress and promotes better sleep. Magnolia bark\u2014as in, the bark of magnolia trees. It is rich in bioactive compounds that seek and destroy inflammation, toxins, and bacteria lurking in your body.\n\nIn addition, magnolia bark stimulates production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that soothes your excitatory neurons after they experience a stressful event or thought. This is critical because studies show that if you have inadequate GABA production, you are more prone to insomnia and other sleep problems.\n\nResearch also shows that one of magnolia bark\u2019s compounds calms anxiety and aids sleep just as effectively as diazepams, the class of drugs commonly used to treat anxiety, but without side effects or risks of dependency.\n\nTypically, 200 to 400 mg/day of magnolia bark is recommended for better sleep and reduced anxiety and stress. But it\u2019s always wise to consult with your doctor before taking something new.\n\nMelatonin is also great for improved sleep. It is naturally produced in your body for this very purpose. But we tend to produce less and less as we age. Plus, the sheer amount of bright lights and screens you are exposed to, particularly in the evening, impedes your body\u2019s melatonin production.\n\nStart by taking 1 mg of melatonin about 30-60 minutes before your preferred bedtime. If 1 mg doesn\u2019t work for you after a day or two, you can gradually increase your dosage up to 3 mg.\n\nSleep Soundly Tonight, Steadily Every Night\n\nIf you read every journal article on sleep, it\u2019s only natural that you begin worrying about too much sleep, too little sleep, and catching up sleep.\n\nMy approach is simple: Remove the worry (or worries) and you\u2019ll find yourself sleeping better as soon as that night. On top of that, a healthy diet, exercise, and some sleep-specific supplements will ensure you sleep seven to eight hours nightly.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
