But while I've been linked up to a MyGov account for a few years now (responsible adult brag), it seems not everyone's cottoned on to the idea.\n\nFair enough, some have concerns about security after previous blunders but with your payslip summaries now automatically being added to your MyGov account, it's time to figure out how to access it once and for all.\n\nFive Tax Deductions You Probably Forgot To Claim Another tax year has come and gone, and most of us have already filed out returns. (You slow coaches out there have until 31 October.) Ideally, all that admin effort should have been rewarded with a nice little sum. But only if you remembered to claim the expenses you're entitled to.

You can link your ATO, Medicare and NDIS accounts, for example, meaning most of those annoying admin changes can be completed without attempting to visit the brick-and-mortar offices during their inconvenient opening times.\n\nThe full list of online services includes:\n\nAustralian JobSearch\n\nAustralian Taxation Office\n\nCentrelinkChild Support\n\nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs\n\nHousingVic Online Services\n\nMedicare\n\nMy Aged Care\n\nMy Health Record\n\nNational Disability Insurance Scheme\n\nNational Redress Scheme\n\nState Revenue Office Victoria\n\nBut the tool it's most used for is ATO. You can complete your taxes once you link the portal to your account and it'll give you an overview of any debts you've incurred, such as HELP loans or taxes owing.\n\nHow do I create a MyGov account?\n\nYou'll want to first go to MyGov's main page in order to sign up. Go through the usual steps of adding in your details and finish creating your account.\n\nOnce you've done all that, you'll have an account (yay) but linking the relevant accounts still needs to be done. To do that, under the Your services tab, opt to link an account. Let's just say you want to link your ATO account, seeing as it's pretty handy, select that option with your Tax File Number on hand. You'll also need to have either a notice of assessment or details of your superannuation account from the last five years, a PAYG summary from the past two years or your bank account details to prove it's really you.\n\nIf the information matches, you're in and can now view your most important ATO details. The most insightful, for me anyway, was the sheer size of my HELP loan. Peep yours, if you haven't paid it off yet, and weep.\n\nThis is definitely an ATO example and not my real balance.
