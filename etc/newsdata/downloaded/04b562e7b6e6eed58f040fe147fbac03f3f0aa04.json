Applications can be refused if a victim has a criminal record \u2013 meant to stop serious criminals getting money off the state. But the rule means compensation can also be withheld for petty crimes.\n\nAlistair previously helped overturn a controversial rule that blocked compensation for abuse by family members who lived with the victim.\n\nFigures also show 658 victims have been denied compensation because they did not lodge their claim within two years of the complaint.\n\nAlistair said: \u201cThe police don\u2019t want people to put the application in because a cross-examination could say, \u2018You\u2019re only in this for the money.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt ends up that trials go on for years \u2013 for one client, it was six years until she got justice. By the time it comes to put in a claim, it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Campaigners say the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority is denying help to victims even when their offences are triggered by the abuse they endured", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654689.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Image-of-teenage-boy-hacker-silhouette-sat-by-laptop-computer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
