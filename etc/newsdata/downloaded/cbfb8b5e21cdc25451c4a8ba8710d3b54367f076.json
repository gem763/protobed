This summer, township commissioners approved a 76-acre mixed-use development along Oregon Pike.\n\nBut one Amish man believes turning to the townships to solve problems of space is like \"rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic.\" His vision is to see the Amish leave their historic homeland.\n\nBalancing the needs\n\nOnly about one-third of Amish in Lancaster County are still farming, but many want to preserve a rural lifestyle.\n\nThat can create some friction for non-Amish neighbors, who the Amish call \"English.\"\n\n\"I have seen a cultural clash between the Amish community and the English,\" said C. Michael Weaver, a supervisor in Strasburg Township.\n\nFor example, some English might not want two horses in the yard right next door at their Amish neighbor's house.\n\nThe township's board of supervisors is trying to balance the needs of both groups.\n\nA person used to need one acre of land per horse to keep the animal on their property. Last year, the supervisors voted to allow up to two horses, for the purpose of transportation, to be kept on a half-acre lot.\n\nThe Amish, Weaver said, \"were raised in Strasburg Township, the vast majority, and they want to remain here. I was raised in Strasburg Township and I also want to remain here. So, I have great sympathy and empathy for that position.\"\n\nAs a compromise to English residents, the ordinance included restrictions on the size of the buildings used to shelter the horses, the distance they have to be from property lines, and requirements for storing manure.\n\nWeaver noted the pace of the requests did slow down.\n\n\"But we have found with the new ordinance, many of the Amish have asked for variances on the size of the carriage house,\" Weaver said. He doesn't foresee another change; he said the current rules are a fair compromise for neighbors.\n\nAmish are moving into homes on smaller lots because most have left farming behind for other opportunities.\n\nFor some, it may be a forced choice. For young Amish, in particular, the price of farming is out of reach.\n\nBill O'Brien, chief lending officer for the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, said he's been financing agricultural loans for more than 30 years and he's watched as the price for an acre of farmland in the county grew from about $8,000 to $20,000. O'Brien credits the increase to the desire among the Amish and Mennonite communities to own farmland, and the success the plain communities have had working the land.\n\nHe said it's still possible to make money farming in Lancaster County.\n\n\"But we've reached the point where the price of farm per acre is well beyond the income producing ability of it,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe high cost is driving some Amish to pick up and move to where land is more affordable.\n\nA \"mad visionary\"\n\nLancaster is one of Pennsylvania's fastest-growing counties, in part because of Amish population growth.\n\nWhile the United States' population grew at its slowest rate since the Great Depression from 2017-2018, the Amish grew at about six times the U.S. rate.\n\nResearchers at the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College rely on Amish documents with self-reported numbers to calculate an estimated population.\n\nThe Amish population nearly doubles every two decades. According to the Young Center's most recent tally, it now stands at 336,235 nationwide.\n\nLancaster County is home to 39,255, giving it more than 10 percent of the population and making it the largest settlement in the United States.\n\nHe said about 20 households left the county in the last year \u2014 not statistically significant, but noteworthy.\n\nReasons for leaving include finances, family ties, a desire to farm, and even just a change of pace. Some are seeking a more conservative or liberal lifestyle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption DEA / G. ROLI/De Agostini via Getty Images DEA / G. ROLI/De Agostini via Getty Images\n\nChet Lapp, an Amish realtor, argues more of his fellow Amish should leave Lancaster County for the purpose of preserving their faith.\n\nLapp describes himself as a \"mad visionary.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old is responsible for the creation of one of Pennsylvania's newest Amish settlements, in Glen Rock, York County.\n\nLapp had been helping Amish families move out of Lancaster County to join other settlements since he got his real estate agent's license in 2012, but the Glen Rock community is different. Lapp scouted the area with his broker ahead of time, then found people interested in moving.\n\nOne of those people is Sara Glick.\n\nShe and her husband own the Glick's Produce stand in the Markets at Shrewsbury, not far from Glen Rock. Glick called her move from a settlement in Newburg, Cumberland County a \"good challenge.\" She's now closer to her work, and that lets her spend more time with her five children, ages three through 12.\n\nGlick is an outlier in her new community, though. She said most of her new neighbors moved from Lancaster County to farm.\n\nA blueprint for the future\n\nLapp is hoping the settlement can become a blueprint for the future. He said it's far enough away from Lancaster to be affordable, while being close enough that those who move can still see family back home regularly.\n\nHe said he believes many Amish would move if they had that structure and remained close to supportive family members.\n\nLapp is concerned that, as a group, the Amish lack a plan for tackling issues of affordability and identity.\n\nIt's only families with money, he said, that will be able to keep farming in Lancaster County.\n\n\"For young John Stoltzfus, if you will, to maybe be starting at zero at 21. He's not going to make \u2014 he's not going to carry a lunch bucket then turn around and pay a million bucks. Ain't gonna happen,\" Lapp said.\n\nAs Amish heads of household more often work outside the home, in fields like business and construction, families are spending less time together. Lapp said those experiences in the modern world threaten their culture and traditions.\n\n\"That influence comes back into the home \u2014 period, you can't change that,\" Lapp said.\n\nAs he sees it, the Amish could evolve in two ways: either by taking on more of the modern culture in Lancaster County or safeguarding the traditions of their faith outside of their historic homeland.\n\n\"I'm perfectly content to ride this out until people understand that we have to [move],\" Lapp said.\n\nLoyal to the homeland\n\nIt's unlikely Lancaster County will cease to be a cradle of the Amish community.\n\nSupport from older generations would be key, Lapp said, to help younger ones start new communities.\n\nTraditionally, there's been something of a stigma for those who leave. The Lancaster County Amish, in particular, have been very loyal to their homeland.\n\n\"The Lancaster settlement has relatively fewer people as a percentage leaving,\" said Steve Nolt, a senior scholar on plain communities at Elizabethtown College, noting Amish in large Midwestern settlements move around more freely.\n\n\"There seems to be just a stronger attraction or pull in the Lancaster settlement of people staying here, of preferring to take on non-farm jobs and remain here,\" Nolt said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacqueline Larma/AP Jacqueline Larma/AP\n\nAn older farmer who wished to be identified only as a Leacock Township Amish man spoke about why some Amish move.\n\nMost Amish, for religious reasons, do not agree to be photographed or have their voices recorded. WITF is not using the Leacock Township farmer's name because he agreed to a limited recording for the radio version of this story, and even that is frowned upon in his community. He was concerned that if were named in the online story, community members would know he had been recorded as well.\n\nHe said he's had family members move for better opportunities, but he's never considered leaving.\n\nHis large white farmhouse and barn sit far back from the road, surrounded by fields of corn.\n\nAs he sat in his front yard under the shade of an old tree, he told how his ancestors came to the county in 1800 and his five-times-great-grandfather bought this very farm.\n\nHe understands why younger people would want to leave. Some just want to \"chase the Daniel Boone spirit,\" he said, but many can't afford to buy farmland, especially if their fathers left agriculture for another trade. He also cited growing taxes and encroaching development as reasons for leaving.\n\nWe are being squeezed, he said.\n\nStill, he added, they'll maintain the culture.\n\n\"I know we use horse-drawn vehicles. I know we farm with horses,\" he said. \"But we do this to preserve our heritage and for our children and our grandchildren.\"", "description": "The Amish country of Lancaster, Pa., is changing as only about a third of the fast-growing religious group still farm.
