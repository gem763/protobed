Do you hear me?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nThe White House group waited during the communications delay, which lasted for about five seconds. Then one of the astronauts replied, \u201cWe can hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI was starting to get worried about you.\u201d\n\nTrump congratulated the two women astronauts for their achievement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very brave people.
