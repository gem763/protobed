(David Coffey/National Aquarium)\n\nMacaroni, a baby puffin, has been born at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, joining its pasta-named siblings Ravioli and Gnocchi.\n\nOfficials said puffins get named at the aquarium \u201caccording to their lineage,\u201d and using a theme in the puffin families helps the staff easily recognize \u201chow the puffins are related.\u201d\n\nThe puffins all have unique names. There\u2019s another family of puffins \u2014 parents Victor and Vixen who had a puffin chick named Vega in August 2018. Puffin parents Princess and Jasper welcomed Sage in July 2018. Sage has a sibling named Willow.\n\nMacaroni is the 16th puffin chick that has successfully hatched at the aquarium since 2006, officials said.\n\n[Atlantic puffins pairs are plentiful this year, Audubon scientist says]\n\nBaby Macaroni hatched on Aug. 31 after a 31-day incubation period, officials said. It will stay in its burrow at the Sea Cliffs exhibit for \u201cthe next 40 days or so,\u201d the aquarium said in a statement. The burrow is similar to the deep burrows that puffins use in the wild.\n\nIn its burrow, Macaroni will be fed and cared for by its parents \u2014 Vigo and Staypuft \u2014 \u201cuntil it fledges, fully feathered and waterproofed and ready to explore.\u201d\n\nDebra Dial, assistant curator of the Australia and Rain Forest exhibits at the National Aquarium, said the puffins also wear colored bands on their ankles that help staff identify and \u201crecognize each bird.\u201d She said puffins are \u201csexually monomorphic, meaning males and females look the same.\u201d Experts have to figure out the gender of puffins by testing the DNA in their feathers.\n\nMacaroni\u2019s siblings, Ravioli and Gnocchi, are both females. But experts said they do not yet have the results for Macaroni.\n\n\n\nPuffin chick Macaroni being weighed in September. (David Coffey/National Aquarium)\n\nPuffins are not to be confused with penguins.\n\nThey are good swimmers, and when grown, they have bright orange legs and webbed feet. They typically stand about a foot tall when adults, and they are best known for \u201ctheir large, triangular, red-orange bill with a blue-gray base and yellow ridge,\u201d according to experts at the aquarium.\n\nAnd, unlike penguins, they can fly. Puffins are often dubbed the \u201cparrots of the sea,\u201d according to experts at the aquarium.\n\n\n\nThe new puffin chick is named Macaroni. (David Coffey/National Aquarium)\n\nIn the wild, puffins are found in the Northern Hemisphere, while penguins are in the Southern Hemisphere. Puffins in the Atlantic Ocean are listed as being \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nThis summer, scientists with the National Audubon Society said Atlantic puffins were having a productive season for mating pairs in remote areas off the coast of Maine. The success of the mating was due to many factors, including the abundant availability of the fish they prefer \u2014 haddock, hake and herring.\n\nBaby puffins are born with thick coats to keep them warm and usually weigh less than a pound when they hatch. Macaroni weighs almost a pound.", "description": "A baby puffin was born at the National Aquarium in Baltimore.
