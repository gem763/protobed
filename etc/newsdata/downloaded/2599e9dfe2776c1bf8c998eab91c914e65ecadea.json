Over forty years since The French, Manchester's first Michelin-starred restaurant, lost its garland, the \"curse\" has been broken, with Mana the hoodoo-breaker.\n\nChef-owner Simon Martin, formerly of the acclaimed Noma in Copenhagen \u2013 once considered the best restaurant in the world \u2013 describes Mana as attempting to \"rediscover anything that's been forgotten about Britain's indigenous produce and ingredients, and to then move forwards with that knowledge.\" The \u00a3105-a-head tasting menu features the likes of spruce, dehydrated scallops and beeswax.\n\nThe restaurant has achieved widespread acclaim for its inventive 16-course menu since opening in 2018, with The Times' Marina O'Loughlin saying: \"If Mana doesn't get a star, it'll be pretty much proof of what I've long suspected: the tyre floggers are having a sniggery time trolling the city.\" In her 9/10 Guardian review, Grace Dent said: \"Mana loves Noma like Oasis loved the Beatles. Positively, jubilantly, and creating their own buzz in the process.\"\n\nMartin, who spent two weeks living on the streets after his unpaid internship at Noma, said \"It puts quite a bit of pressure on. It's something quite a lot of people expected from the start but it's incredible.\" He later tweeted: \"Can't describe how I feel right now after being awarded a Michelin Guide UK star for mana.\"", "description": "It's been a long time coming, but a Michelin star has finally landed on Manchester again.", "authors": ["Tom\u00e9 Morrissy-Swan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212398352-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdO0Jyi0jPPD6Zx1hiwTPhlc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
