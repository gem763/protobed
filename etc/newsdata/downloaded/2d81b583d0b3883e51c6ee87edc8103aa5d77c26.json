As NBC News reported this morning, the Trump administration had other ideas.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, has been directed by the State Department not to appear Tuesday for a scheduled interview with House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. [\u2026] \u201cAmbassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the Committee\u2019s questions on an expedited basis,\u201d Robert Luskin, Sondland\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. \u201cAs the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department\u2019s direction,\u201d Luskin continued, adding that Sondland \u201cis profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting for context that the ambassador is a current employee of the U.S. State Department. According to Sondland\u2019s lawyer, he wants to answer questions, but he also can\u2019t defy the agency\u2019s directive.\n\nThe fact that the Trump administration is blocking a key witness from answering questions may not seem especially surprising, but note the timing: the ambassador left Europe, traveled to D.C., and was all set to answer questions today. It wasn\u2019t until the morning of Sondland\u2019s appearance that the administration balked.\n\nObstructing the impeachment inquiry likely makes impeachment more likely, which naturally raises the question of what it was Team Trump figured out in the 11th hour.\n\nFor his part, Donald Trump went further than I\u2019d expected in taking personal responsibility for today\u2019s developments.\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter, suggesting he was directly involved in the decision to block the ambassador from answering questions.\n\nOf course, by this reasoning, if Trump doesn\u2019t recognize the legitimacy of the process, then the White House isn\u2019t prepared to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry at all.\n\nThat will only reinforce impressions of a cover-up. For now, it appears the president and his team don\u2019t care.\n\nPostscript: Let\u2019s also not forget that the Wall Street Journal reported late last week that, according to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), it was Sondland who had \u201cdescribed to him a quid pro quo involving a commitment by Kyiv to probe matters related to U.S. elections and the status of nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine that the president had ordered to be held up in July.\u201d\n\nThe far-right senator, apparently confused, later tried to walk back his comments \u2013 I think Johnson thought he was helping the White House and reversed course when he realized he was making matters worse \u2013 but this further reinforces Sondland\u2019s importance as a key player in the larger drama.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union is a key player in Trump's impeachment mess and he was set to answer questions today.
