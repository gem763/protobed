MFA director Michael Teitelbaum publicly apologized, banned two visitors, launched an internal investigation and hired a law firm led by a former state attorney general to conduct an independent review.\n\nIt might have ended there. But in this city still scarred by court-ordered desegregation and the turbulent busing of minority students to white suburbs in the 1970s, the museum - which welcomes 1.2 million visitors each year - took it as a wakeup call to get \u201cwoke.\u201d\n\nIt has created a new position, senior director of inclusion, in an effort to become a more deliberately diverse organization. In a nod to the need for greater gender equity, it has given over an entire wing to female artists in \u201cWomen Take the Floor,\u201d an exhibition timed to coincide with next year\u2019s centennial of U.S. women winning the right to vote. And this month, for the first time, it will open its doors for free to celebrate Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\n\nIt\u2019s also been using its website to keep the public updated on its efforts to make things right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that this museum doesn\u2019t serve folks who are black and brown,\u201d said Makeeba McCreary, the MFA\u2019s chief of learning and community engagement, who\u2019s been holding a series of roundtable discussions on inclusion and racial diversity. \u201cWe know enough to know that\u2019s not who we want to be.\u201d\n\nMuch like the fine arts world as a whole, the MFA largely has been a male bastion of wealth and whiteness since its founding in 1870, five years after the end of the Civil War left the nation raw and riven.\n\nAs its 150th anniversary in 2020 approaches, the venerable museum - one of America\u2019s oldest, holding half a million prominent works - has been confronting its blind spots. They were painfully laid bare during last May\u2019s field trip by 26 seventh-graders, all students of color, from the Helen Y. Davis Leadership Academy in Boston\u2019s Dorchester neighborhood.\n\nIn addition to the watermelon remark , the school\u2019s principal, Arturo Forrest, said he also heard reports of museum security guards following his students while leaving white pupils alone and that several museum patrons made disparaging remarks. The state launched a separate civil rights investigation in June.\n\n\u201cThese young people left the museum feeling disrespected, harassed and targeted because of the color of their skin, and that is unacceptable,\u201d Teitelbaum said.\n\nThe Rev. Mariama White-Hammond, a pastor and activist, recalled taking painting classes at the MFA as a little girl in the mid-1980s and feeling out of place.\n\nRacism among the Rembrandts? White-Hammond isn\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I find shocking is that so many people seem to be shocked,\u201d she said in a commentary for WBUR-FM, Boston\u2019s NPR station. \u201cFor white folks, take this as a data point about how little you really know about the experience of people of color in this city.\u201d\n\nThe museum says it\u2019s determined to change that.\n\nIn January, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, it will open an exhibition devoted to artists of color from the Americas. There are also plans next year to kick off a community mural project and launch a free first-year membership program to make the museum more accessible to the poor.\n\n\u201cWomen Take the Floor,\u201d which opened last month, will run through May 2021. The takeover of the Art of the Americas wing by works by Frida Kahlo, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and 100 other important women artists \u201cseeks to acknowledge and remedy the systemic gender discrimination found in museums, galleries, the academy and the marketplace, including the MFA\u2019s inconsistent history in supporting women artists,\u201d the museum says.\n\nThe group Lawyers for Civil Rights insists the museum could do more, including providing mental health services to students who were traumatized.\n\nBut Boston city councilor Kim Janey said the museum deserves credit \u201cfor continuing the conversation around changes to its own policies and procedures.\u201d And McCreary said the focus is on institutional change.\n\n\u201cThis is not about amends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about our obligations as a public institution. It\u2019s about responsibility, about our contribution to the city, about leadership. It\u2019s about deconstructing the invisible and visible barriers we have in place.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Bill Kole on Twitter at https://twitter.com/billkole\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Boston's regal Museum of Fine Arts, home to some of humanity's greatest artworks, is scrambling to make amends.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "William J.
