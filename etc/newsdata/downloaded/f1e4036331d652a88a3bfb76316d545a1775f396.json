Most critically, Taylor\u2019s testimony challenges Sondland\u2019s claim that he did not know of an alleged quid pro quo involving nearly $400 million in security aid for Ukraine. The White House held up the planned aid over the summer as Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani worked with Sondland to press the former \u00adSoviet-bloc country to launch investigations that could help Trump politically.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the probes Giuliani wanted involved a discredited theory that Ukraine tried to undermine Trump in the 2016 U.S. election. The other was about Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that hired Hunter Biden when his father was vice president.\n\nSondland testified last week that he knew Giuliani had conditioned a coveted White House invite for Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, on such investigations. But he said he did not know whether the White House had also made security assistance contingent on Zelensky\u2019s committing to launch the probes.\n\nTaylor, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, contradicted Sondland\u2019s account Tuesday. In prepared remarks delivered to congressional investigators, Taylor wrote that Sondland not only knew of such a quid pro quo, but also had communicated the threat to Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor said he understood that on Sept. 1, Sondland warned Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak that the security assistance \u201cwould not come\u201d unless Zelensky committed to pursuing the investigation into Burisma, which could have damaged Joe Biden, a top 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed,\u201d Taylor wrote, saying a national security official had told him the demand was relayed in person by Sondland while the ambassador was traveling in Poland with Vice President Pence. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that the security assistance . . . was conditioned on the investigation.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions by email, Sondland\u2019s attorney Robert Luskin wrote to The Washington Post on Wednesday that his client \u201cdoes not recall\u201d such a conversation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSondland does not recall any conversation in Warsaw concerning the aid cutoff, although he understood that the Ukrainians were, by then, certainly aware of the cutoff and raised the issue directly with Pence,\u201d Luskin wrote.\n\nAD\n\nSome members of the House Intelligence Committee have begun calling for Sondland to return for additional questioning to reconcile the two diplomats\u2019 accounts.\n\nRep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.) said Taylor\u2019s testimony raises \u201ca lot of questions.\u201d In an interview on CNN, he said \u201cfor sure . . . [Sondland] needs to come back and answer some of these questions.\u201d\n\nThat Sondland did not know about an alleged quid pro quo involving taxpayer money is central to his contention that he did nothing wrong on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nAD\n\nSondland ratcheted up pressure on the White House last week by testifying that when he heard that security assistance may be tied to the investigations, he paused and called Trump on Sept. 9.\n\nAfter the call, Sondland sent a text message to Taylor, denying such an effort. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland wrote. \u201cThe President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSondland, however, told congressional investigators that his denial came directly from Trump and that Sondland had no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at the time.\n\nAD\n\nBut by Taylor\u2019s account, Sondland already knew the terms of the quid pro quo and had relayed them to Zelensky\u2019s aide a week earlier in Poland. Taylor said Sondland also suggested he had said as much in a conversation on Sept. 8 to Zelensky.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we would be at a \u2018stalemate,\u2019 \u201d according to Taylor\u2019s written testimony, which used an alternative spelling of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s name. \u201cI understood a \u2018stalemate\u2019 to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLuskin said his client \u201cstrongly opposed the cutoff of aid and believed (and advised internally) that it should be restored unconditionally.\u201d The attorney said that in seven hours of closed-door testimony last week, Sondland was asked about his discussions in Warsaw but did not recall a meeting as recounted by Taylor.\n\nAD\n\nSondland and Taylor also conflicted on other points.\n\nTaylor testified that it was clear earlier in the summer that Giuliani\u2019s focus on Burisma was related to Biden. Sondland told House investigators last week that he recalls \u201cno discussions\u201d with anyone at the State Department or White House about investigating Biden.\n\nTaylor also testified that Tim Morrison, a National Security Council official, had recounted to him a conversation between Trump and Sondland on Sept. 7 in which Trump insisted that Zelensky \u201cgo to a microphone\u201d and commit to \u201copening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLuskin said Sondland does not recall such a conversation. In his testimony to Congress, Sondland \u201cwas asked about all of his interactions with Trump on this subject matter. These did not include another call on the 7th.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLuskin said Sondland was also asked about a June episode that Taylor recounted.\n\nAccording to the Ukraine envoy\u2019s statement, \u201cSondland told me on June 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call planned with President Zelenskyy. . . . Sondland said that he wanted to make sure that no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President Zelenskyy to the call.\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney said the call with Zelensky was routine. The ambassador \u201cbelieves that it was monitored routinely and that an appropriate file memo was prepared. He never suggested otherwise.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "An attorney for Gordon Sondland disputed the House testimony of acting Ukraine ambassador William B. Taylor Jr.", "authors": ["Aaron C.
