Coles describes them as \u2018dark stores\u2019 based on the Tesco model.\"\n\nBut such a change in space configuration - which will be forced rapidly as online delivery expectations rise - would reduce the volume of walk-in sales for many retailers, he said.\n\n\"It needs an agility that most businesses cannot deal with,\" Mr Conneally said.\n\nIn most retail chains between 7 per cent to 15 per cent of stores were already unprofitable, but were kept open for strategic reasons or even basic ones such as being unable to get out of the lease. If those stores lost more of their retail footprint for the purposes of online fulfilment, they would become even more unprofitable and some stores that were profitable would also become unprofitable, he said.\n\n\"We\u2019re on the brink of quite a few more retailers going through this administration process,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of them. They\u2019re reflective of stores becoming more unprofitable as they deal with competitive cannibalisation, whether dilution of store profit or through having to be servicing online orders through distribution centres.\"", "description": "EY says the conversion of suburban sites into mini logistics hubs will make some less viable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1935%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a0f4d91bd0a06a95b5d8524c1cab4409f29cb642", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
