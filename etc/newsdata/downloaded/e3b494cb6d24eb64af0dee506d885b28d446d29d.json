REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo\n\nNew Zealand Agriculture Minister Damien O\u2019Connor said on Wednesday the producers\u2019 application to Beijing\u2019s Intellectual Property Court would protect the hard work of Kiwi manuka producers.\n\n\u201cWe believe manuka is a brand that has been developed and valued and promoted from New Zealand and it should remain that way,\u201d O\u2019Connor said in an email.\n\nLocal media reported that the government was giving NZ$5.7 million ($3.6 million) to the Manuka Honey Appellation Society (MHAS) to fight the case.\n\nManuka is the Maori name for the plant that produces the namesake honey, which is advertised as having health benefits including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it particularly popular amongst Asian consumers.\n\nAustralian manuka honey producers said if New Zealand is successful in trademarking the name in China, they stand to lose A$1 billion ($677 million) in sales.\n\n\u201cWe have 84 species of the manuka plant and one species in New Zealand which we strongly believe came from Australia,\u201d said Paul Callendar, president of the Australian Manuka Honey Association, adding a plea for assistance from his own government.\n\nAustralia has 65 manuka honey producers, based mainly in the country\u2019s south-eastern states of Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. There more than 100 producers in New Zealand.\n\nWilliam van Caenegem, a law professor at Australia\u2019s Bond University, said the meaning of \u201cmanuka\u201d had become blurred.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the term manuka honey has become descriptive of the style rather than indicating geographical origin of the honey,\u201d van Caenegem said. \u201cNew Zealanders would say that manuka really comes from New Zealand and that\u2019s how consumers see it whereas Australians just see it as a potent honey and that\u2019s it.\u201d", "description": "The New Zealand government is supporting a bid by the country's honey producers to trademark the name \"manuka\" in China, angering Australian rivals who fear losing out in their joint biggest market for the lucrative product.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433624910&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O08W", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
