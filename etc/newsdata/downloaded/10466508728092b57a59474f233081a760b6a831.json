It is expected that the opposition Labour party will request an emergency debate in order to introduce legislation that will force the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union in order to avoid a no deal Brexit on the 31 October.\n\nSome rebel Conservative MPs have voiced their intention to vote for legislation which would prevent a no deal Brexit, however many in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opposition Labour party back Brexit and may be inclined to vote against the legislation.\n\nThe gathering in Number 10 on the eve of parliament\u2019s return to the House of Commons has fuelled speculation that the PM will announce plans to call an election if parliament votes to block a no deal Brexit.\n\nThe U.K. is set to leave the European Union on the 31 October. Johnson is committed to leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d on this date.\n\nThis week will likely see a combination of legal challenges and political maneuvering to try to overturn Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to suspend parliament from Sept. 9 to Oct. 14, - or to force him to ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline.\n\nAs it stands, parliament will be suspended from Sept. 9 until Oct. 14, meaning that there is little opportunity for MPs to schedule debates in the House of Commons and legislate against a no deal Brexit.\n\nThe pound was in the red against all major currencies on Monday afternoon following speculation that an election could soon be called.\n\nAt 16:53 GMT was down 0.74 percent to 1.2066.\n\nWatch the live video here: https://youtu.be/XUf3LN82JJs", "description": "Watch Live: Boris Johnson to Make Statement Following Emergency Cabinet Meeting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1K0JW_L.jpg"}
