After what we saw from Project Veritas this week where Zucker was openly pushing for stories promoting Trump\u2019s impeachment and other footage of CNN employees admitting their bias and hate for the president we suppose we shouldn\u2019t be surprised.\n\nWhatever your politics, we should never ever again elect someone so ignorant of foreign affairs, so blind to geopolitical implications, so bereft of moral and ethical compunction, and so apathetic to history\u2019s long gaze. Syria will be a lasting stain on the Trump presidency. \u2014 S.E. Cupp (@secupp) October 18, 2019\n\nSo melodramatic.\n\nNothing convinces voters like bossing them around when it comes to their vote.\n\nShe really could have been talking about Obama but you know, orange man bad.\n\nIt's your ignorance and hatred is what helped get Trump elected in 2016, but you still haven't figured that out yet. \u2014 Jerry Fletcher (@guntotingteabag) October 18, 2019\n\nNo, no she hasn\u2019t figured that out yet.\n\nI thought Syria was a lasting stain on Obama. Red line? Assad Gassing children? Any of this ringing a bell? Oh and the worldwide apology tour. ISIS is the jv team. Iran Deal. @brhodes as an advisor. Yup Obama seems to fit the bill of your little rant quite well. \u2014 johnny cy (@johnnycy89) October 18, 2019\n\nSo don\u2019t elect Democrats. Got it \u2014 Scottergate \ud83d\ude00 (@Scottergate) October 18, 2019\n\nWhatever your politics, we should never ever again elect someone so ignorant of foreign affairs, so blind to geopolitical implications, so bereft of moral and ethical compunction, and so apathetic to history\u2019s long gaze.

They are fighting warriors who love arms and cash. We shouldn\u2019t have been in bed with them in the first place. Sorry; Trump is correct. You are so blind with hatred of Trump that you haven\u2019t done your research. Shame on you. \u2014 Apocalyptica (@Kelly3132) October 18, 2019\n\nObama isn't in the White House anymore. \u2014 Karsten Kinstler (@KarstenKinstler) October 18, 2019\n\nBecause all of the \u201cforeign policy experts\u201d of the past 70 years have done such a bang up job on the Middle East we should definitely stay on that path. \u2014 Palatine Pundit (@palatinepundit) October 18, 2019\n\nNo it will be a long-lasting stain on the Obama presidency, not Trumps. \u2014 Freedom of Religion (@dlh8) October 18, 2019\n\nAll true but you realize @BarackObama did the same thing and created Isis in the process so the \u201cnever ever\u201d schtick is a little vapid given the last guy was just as bad. \u2014 Ted Crumpet (@Tcrumps) October 18, 2019\n\nSyria is a stain on Obama and Clinton, who got involved after ruining Libya (where there\u2019s now actual slavery). Be honest. \u2014 Tim Andrews \ud83c\udfa4 (@TimAndrewsHere) October 18, 2019\n\nYeah, before Trump, no President has ever made a bad foreign policy decision. We need to get back to that. \u2014 BirdGang19 (@bird_gang18) October 18, 2019\n\nHeh.\n\nThe problems in Syria and Libya were caused by US military intervention under Obama. \u2014 TheCarston (@TheCarston) October 18, 2019\n\nWe should never ever have been there. \u2014 Dog guy (@Catsorange1) October 18, 2019\n\nIt will be like a red line that we\u2019ve crossed somehow. Oh wait\u2026 \u2014 tab\u00b2 (@Tommytabtab) October 18, 2019\n\nGosh, that does sound familiar.\n\nRelated:\n\nIt\u2019s getting REAL: John Durham has Blackberrys used by Mifsud (prof who launched FBI Russia-Trump probe) and HOO-boy\n\nWho they REALLY are \u2013> Nancy Pelosi admits Democrats don\u2019t want voters to decide who\u2019s president (watch)\n\nOUCH-Ville, population THEM: Mollie Hemingway uses Daily Beast journo\u2019s tweet to SHRED media in thread on peddling fake news", "description": "What happened to S.E.
