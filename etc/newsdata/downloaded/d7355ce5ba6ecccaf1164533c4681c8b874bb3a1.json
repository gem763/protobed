Then Hurricane Rudy blew into town.\n\nAs the GOP scrambles to contain the fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine controversy, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has inserted himself directly into the center of a crisis that has engulfed the White House and brought impeachment closer to Trump\u2019s doorstep. And Republicans want him to stop.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I have great respect for Mr. Giuliani, but I said this yesterday and take it for what it's worth: He's wild as a March hare,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). \u201cHe's like a lot of senators, he's kind of a free range chicken, he kind of gets out there. What he says is his business, I don't speak for him.\"\n\nOthers put it more bluntly.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a good thing if he would go take a vacation,\u201d a senior GOP lawmaker told POLITICO, one of several who declined to go on the record so they could speak critically of Giuliani.\n\nEven some of Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill don\u2019t think Giuliani is doing the president or the party any favors by being such a constant presence in the media.\n\n\u201cRudy\u2019s saying a lot of things and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s helping the president by being on TV every 15 minutes,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters this week.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

In one interview, he denied that he asked Ukraine to probe the Biden family, only to admit 30 seconds later that he did.\n\nAnd in another exchange, Giuliani even held up his cellphone to show alleged text messages from State Department officials in an attempt to prove that he wasn\u2019t operating on his own.\n\nThe public displays \u2014 while exactly the kind of fire-eating performances that Trump relishes from his allies \u2014 have sparked some serious groans from Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI wish he would shut the heck up,\u201d said a Republican lawmaker who declined to speak on the record.\n\nBut beyond just annoying Republicans, lawmakers are raising serious questions and concerns about Giuliani\u2019s role in the Ukraine episode \u2014 and they want answers.\n\nDemocrats, who are considering hauling him in to testify, have already demanded documents from the State Department and the White House related to Giuliani\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nAnd Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, said on CNN on Friday that it\u2019s a \u201cfair question\u201d for Congress to ask about Giuliani\u2019s involvement.\n\nGiuliani has spent months publicly calling for Ukraine to investigate whether former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 a potential political rival to Trump \u2014 pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to help his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nAnd as the Trump administration held up $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, Giuliani met with an aide to Ukraine\u2019s president in August, raising questions about who asked him to do so and whether that was an appropriate move for the president\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\n\u201cI am curious about what his role is. Why has he been a big player on this issue with Ukraine?\u201d said the senior Republican lawmaker. \u201cTo me, the president has every right to work with Ukrainian leadership [on corruption]. But I\u2019m not sure where Rudy Giuliani fits into that.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, however, maintains that the State Department directed him to meet with Ukrainian officials \u2014 and he even called on them to admit it. \u201cThey basically knew everything I was doing,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump confidant, said it would have been appropriate for Giuliani to notify the State Department if he were visiting Ukraine. But, he added, \u201cinvestigating things that are not in defense of the president would be the role of the [attorney general], not a private attorney.\u201d\n\nWhile a whistleblower complaint released this week detailing Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine have made some Republicans uneasy, they have largely stood by the president. But they don't appear to have the same loyalty to Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of people concerned with whether Rudy is representing the president effectively,\u201d said the GOP lawmaker.\n\nBurgess Everett and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Even some of president's closest Hill allies say Giuliani isn't helping the president.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/22/ae/18d6513d4a56934ae800d1902ce4/190927-kennedy-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
