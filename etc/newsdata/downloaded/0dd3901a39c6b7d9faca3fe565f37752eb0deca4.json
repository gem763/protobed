He said, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Even as he quickly moved to delete the tweet and the NBA attempted to smoothen the dialogue, Morey\u2019s views had offended many in China, which maintains a low tolerance for criticism of its political system.\n\nIn a statement, the NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s views had \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d This stance from the NBA, which has grown accustomed to seeing its star players speak freely and criticize anyone they wish including the U.S. president Donald Trump, in turn, offended many.\n\nAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of big $$, the @nba is shamefully retreating. https://t.co/7waMde5KrM \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nEarlier today, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it was also suspending broadcasts of the league\u2019s games to be played in China.\n\nIn a statement today, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver tried to steer the league from the controversy. \u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way,\u201d he said.\n\nChina remains a key strategic nation for the NBA. According to official figures, more than 600 million viewers in China watched the NBA content during the 2017-18 season. The league\u2019s five-year partnership with Chinese tech giant Tencent for digital streaming rights of matches is reported to be worth $1.5 billion.\n\nIn a statement issued today, Tencent Sports said it was \u201ctemporarily suspending\u201d the pre-season broadcast arrangements. Over the weekend, Chinese sportswear maker Li-Ning Company and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank suspended their cooperation with Houston Rockets team.\n\nUsers on Twitter reported today that e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com appear to have taken a stand, too. Searches in Chinese for \u201cHouston Rockets\u201d and \u201cRockets\u201d, which previously surfaced NBA franchise products, now return no results.\n\nIn an unrelated event, several Chinese services banned an episode of satirical animated show \u201cSouth Park\u201d last week. In the episode, titled \u201cBand in China\u201d, the show criticized China\u2019s policies on free speech and U.S. corporates\u2019 efforts to bow down to the world\u2019s most population nation to avoid any repercussions.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, South Park creators issued a mock apology. They said, \u201clike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom. Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\u201d", "description": "Smartphone maker Vivo, broadcaster CCTV, and internet giant Tencent said today they are suspending all cooperation with the National Basketball Association, becoming the latest Chinese firms to cut ties with the league after a tweet from a Houston Rockets executive supporting Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters offended many in the world\u2019s most populous nation.
