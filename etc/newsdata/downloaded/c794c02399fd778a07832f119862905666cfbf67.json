That turned into a Google doc to draft the op-ed, and eventually a conference call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, filling her in on what they were up to. \u201cAll of us being CIA or former military, we practice the doctrine of, no surprises. You do not surprise your commander,\u201d she said. Our interview can be heard in full on the latest episode of the Radio Atlantic podcast.\n\nThe troops comparison isn\u2019t exact, she told me, but it was the first thing that came to mind when she came out for impeachment, a position she had resisted for months, and one that presaged a tide of calls for impeachment in her party. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things, when you\u2019re in national security, that you do that aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you do them because you think you\u2019re doing what the country needs to be safe.\u201d\n\nWhy did the Ukraine call change her mind when the Mueller report didn\u2019t? Slotkin\u2019s argument is that the difference is that this newest development is \u201cprospective,\u201d dealing with the 2020 election and not the 2016 election. She said she could \u201cfeel the Oath of Office kick in,\u201d in which presidents vow to \u201cpreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.\u201d Her thought process, she said, was, \u201cWhat\u2019s to say a Democratic president in four years or five years starts to reach out to China and ask for a little dirt there, or North Korea, or anywhere? And I just sort of feel the bones of the democracy being eaten away at.\u201d\n\nGiven that Trump made the call to Ukraine the day after Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony before Congress in July, there\u2019s an argument that Trump might have felt enabled by Democrats deciding not to officially call for impeachment. Slotkin said while she doesn\u2019t think about it that way, she\u2019s been revisiting the call in context.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, you read into these documents what you want to see in them sometimes. And I think the president seems to have read the Mueller report, or the summary, or whatever he consumed of that and thought, \u2018Well look, they don't have anything on me. They didn\u2019t have enough,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even though many of his cohort are now serving time or in the middle of litigation, the lesson that he clearly took away is that \u2018I dodged a bullet. And now maybe I\u2019m bullet proof.\u2019 And the timing was definitely pretty amazing once I learned about it. He said that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and no one would care and he clearly is acting that way when it comes to our national security.\u201d\n\nSince publishing the op-ed, Slotkin has been throwing herself into convincing her constituents that she\u2019s right. With Congress in recess this week, she\u2019s been holding town halls in her district. (When we spoke on Wednesday evening, she\u2019d just come from one that had been shut down by the fire marshal because of overcrowding.)\n\nShe told me there are mothers at school drop off who\u2019ve stopped talking to each other over impeachment, neighbors mad at neighbors because they\u2019re on different sides of what\u2019s going on in Washington. Whether her constituents gets on board could be a good barometer of how Americans respond to impeachment, especially in a key state both Trump and the Democrats are desperate to win next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so tense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stand that here in Michigan.\u201d", "description": "A former CIA analyst, Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan changed her mind on impeachment after Trump\u2019s Ukraine phone, leading her party to follow her lead.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Draft_Episode_for_Oct_03_2019/facebook.jpg?1570145758"}
