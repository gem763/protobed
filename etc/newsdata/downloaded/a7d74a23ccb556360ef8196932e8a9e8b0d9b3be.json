Tehran denies its involvement.\n\nThe attacks were claimed by Yemen\u2019s Huthi rebels. Saudi leads a military coalition against the Iran-backed Huthis, which have carried out dozens of cross-border drone and missile attacks on Saudi targets, including oil facilities.\n\nWorld oil prices briefly soared following strikes which temporarily knocked offline six percent of global oil production.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 The head of Saudi Aramco hit out Wednesday at the lack of global resolve to stop attacks on more oil installations, one month after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/d7bbb2_observers-say-attacks-on-abqaiq-world-largest-oil-processing-facility-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
