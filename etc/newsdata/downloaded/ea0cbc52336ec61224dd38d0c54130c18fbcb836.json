As a result, children were left at risk of abuse which could have been stopped decades earlier.\u201d\n\nPaedophiles at the school were \u201cemboldened by this inertia\u201d, the report suggested. \u201cSerial abuser\u201d David Pearce, a monk and headteacher of St Benedict\u2019s junior school, committed sexual assaults \u201cwith apparent impunity\u201d over a three-decade period, the inquiry noted.\n\nAt least 14 boys complained of being sexually abused by Pearce, who would line up naked pupils and openly film them at the school\u2019s swimming pool.\n\nTeachers and other monks were aware of his behaviour but \u201cseemingly powerless to do anything about it\u201d, with staff afraid that they would lose their jobs if they spoke up, the report said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Staff said raising concerns \u201cmeant putting your job on the line\u201d.\n\nThe report added Pearce had been protected by Laurence Soper, Ealing\u2019s abbot between 1991 and 2000, who himself abused at least 10 children while in other senior roles at the school and abbey between 1972 and 1983.\n\nMany of the assaults, which included multiple rapes, were committed by Soper \u201cduring acts of corporal punishment apparently inflicted on the slightest of pretexts\u201d, the inquiry heard.\n\nOne of the abbot\u2019s victims told the inquiry he \u201dfeared going to school once the abuse started\u201d and in adulthood had suffered depression and alcoholism, struggled to hold down work or maintain personal relationships, and attempted suicide several times.\n\n\u201cI feel like I am still in a black hole and just can\u2019t climb out of it,\u201d the former pupil said. \u201cHe has damaged me for life.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Soper was jailed for 18 years after being convicted of 19 charges involving 10 former pupils. He was tried at the Old Bailey after being extradited from Kosovo, where he had fled in an attempt to evade justice.\n\nPearce was jailed for eight years in 2009 after being convicted of indecently assaulting five boys.\n\nTwo lay teachers, John Maestri and Stephen Skelton, have also been also jailed for sexually abusing children at the school.\n\nThe IICSA strongly criticised Martin Shipperlee, the abbot who took over from Soper in 2000, for \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in his handling of to abuse allegations, noting he failed to pass information on to police and \u201cany action he did take was often inadequate and ill-judged\u201d.\n\nFather Shipperlee resigned from his role during the inquiry\u2019s investigation into the school, acknowledging \u201cserious failings\u201d under his leadership.\n\nChristopher Cleugh, headmaster of the school from 2002 to 2016, was also criticised in the report, which said he had minimised questions of child sexual abuse \u201cto the point of materially misrepresenting significant facts\u201d.\n\nThe inquiry highlighted mistakes by the Metropolitan Police in investigating early allegations against Pearce and Soper and found the CPS at fault for failing to prosecute of the pair in 2004.\n\nThe Charity Commission\u2019s inquiry into Ealing Abbey\u2019s handling of Pearce between 2006 and 2008 was found in the report to be \u201cdeficient\u201d. Its review, which took place during the period when Pearce was abusing, concluded he was being managed appropriately.\n\nThe IICSA said the school\u2019s current headmaster Andrew Johnson, appointed in 2016, had since made a number of improvements to safeguarding, including record-keeping and vetting.\n\nBut it added: \u201dIt remains to be seen whether Ealing Abbey proves itself capable in the future of ensuring proper safeguarding of children at risk.\u201d\n\nThe report, published on Thursday, forms part of the IICSA English Benedictine Congregation (EBC) case study within a wider investigation into the Roman Catholic church.\n\nIt said the EBC had a \u201cclosed, defensive and resistant\u201d culture with teachers and monks \u201creluctant to support complaints for fear it would undermine the institutions and the church\u201d.\n\nThe report noted the Vatican had declined a request from the inquiry for a witness statement on what steps were taken after Soper disappeared while on police bail in 2011, when he resided at Sant\u2019Anselmo monastery in Rome.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the inquiry is unable to fully understand and assess the role that the Holy See may have played,\u201d said panel. John O\u2019Brien, secretary to the IICSA, described the Holy See\u2019s refusal to provide a statement as \u201cregrettable\u201d.\n\nThe inquiry had requested a statement from the Vatican through the Apostolic Nuncio to the United Kingdom, the Holy See\u2019s diplomatic representative in the UK, who is covered by diplomatic immunity and cannot be compelled to give evidence.\n\nAsked why the Vatican had declined to provide a statement, the Nunciature referred questions to the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference (CBC) of England and Wales.\n\nA spokesperson for the CBC told The Independent: \u201cWhile a witness statement was not forthcoming from the Holy See, the IICSA report does confirm that there has been a disclosure of material from the Holy See, and this is under review.\u201d\n\nCardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster and head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, issued an \u201cunreserved apology to all who have suffered\u201d and \u201cprofound regret at all that has taken place\u201d.\n\nThe cardinal will give evidence to the wider IICSA next month, which he said would \u201cenable me to offer assurance of our willingness to learn further lessons\u201d about safeguarding and the church\u2019s response to abuse.", "description": "A \u201csadistic and predatory\u201d atmosphere and a culture of cover-up and denial allowed monks and teachers to abuse children at a Catholic school for decades, a report has found.
