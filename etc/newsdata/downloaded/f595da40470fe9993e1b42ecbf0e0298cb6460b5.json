There's nothing weak about looking out for others. There's nothing weak about being honorable. You're not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect', he said earning applause in Baltimore Friday in an apparent dig at the current POTUS.\n\nLawmaker Cummings, who died this month at 68, played a leading role in Trump's impeachment inquiry.\n\nObama said he sometimes turned to Cummings during difficult times of his administration.\n\n'He was never complacent, for he knew that without clarity of purpose and a steadfast faith and a dogged determination demanded by our liberty, the promise of this nation could wither,' Obama said.\n\n'Complacency, he knew, was not only corrosive for our collective lives, but for our individual lives.'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama remembered the late Elijah Cummings in a eulogy at his funeral in Baltimore\n\nLawmaker Cummings, who died this month at 68, played a leading role in Trump's impeachment inquiry. Obama said he sometimes turned to Cummings during difficult times of his administration, and put in plugs for the Affordable Care Act\n\n'There's nothing weak about looking out for others. There's nothing weak about being honorable. You're not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect,' Barack Obama said in a more subtle dig at Trump than Hillary Clinton's\n\nHe pointed to Cummings' reputation for being kind to others even as he wielded power in Washington.\n\nObama, the father of two daughters, referenced hearing Cummings' daughters at the funeral. He said it got him 'choked up.'\n\n'I was thinking I'd want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I'd also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there's nothing weak about kindness and compassion.'\n\nHe said 'honorable' was a title that many elected officials hold. But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office. There's a difference,' said Obama.\n\n'Elijah Cummings came from good soil,' Obama said, calling him 'a leader who once said he'd die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what's possible in this country - not guaranteed, but possible.'\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during funeral services for late U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings\n\n'Like that Old Testament prophet, he stood again corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel,' Hillary Clinton said\n\nHillary Clinton compared Trump to the Bible's evil and 'corrupt' King Ahab and first lady Melania to Jezebel.\n\nShe did not name the president - but her message could hardly have been clearer; Cummings was one of the leaders of the current impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHer comment drew loud applause from a crowd gathered to honor the late House Oversight Committee chairman, with Bill Clinton also in attendance, but no White House official representative.\n\nTrump instead gave a speech at the historically black Benedict College in South Carolina. No information was available as to whether he had been invited.\n\n2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris were also among the thousands who attended the service at Baltimore's New Psalmist Baptist Church.\n\n'Our Elijah could call down fire from heaven. But he also prayed and worked for healing,' Clinton said.\n\n'Like that Old Testament prophet, he stood again corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel,' she said.\n\n'He weathered storms and earthquakes, but he never lost his faith,' Clinton said.\n\n'And he looked out for the vulnerable among us. And he kept reminding us, life is no dress rehearsal,' she added.\n\n'The American people want to live their lives without fear of their leaders,' Clinton said, 'and as leaders, we have a responsibility to keep the promises made when running for office to make the lives of Americans better,' she said.\n\nAhab was a corrupt and evil king of Israel; Jezebel was his wife, a Phoenician princess who adorned herself in fine clothing and jewelry, and worshiped the false god Baal, only to ultimately meet her doom. In the Old Testament Elijah brought the kingdom of Israel back to the true path of God.\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Barack Obama arrive to the funeral services for the late U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings at the New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore on Friday\n\nMaya Rockeymoore Cummings paid tribute to her late husband. She is likely to run for his vacant seat\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during funeral services for late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings\n\nHillary Clinton's eulogy did not mention Donald and Melania Trump but the implication was clear\n\nClinton said Cummings had 'little tolerance for those who put party above country or partisanship above truth.'\n\nMaya Rockeymoore Cummings, widow of the longtime lawmaker and the Maryland state Democratic party chair, acknowledged that President Trump's attacks on Baltimore 'hurt' Cummings.\n\nShe said Cummings was fighting the 'very real corruption' in the country and was working to save 'the soul of our democracy.'\n\nBill Clinton lauded Cummings for 'sticking up for Hillary and lots of other people, many of whom were voiceless and weak and will never be known.'\n\n'While doing all that he actually made in one of the most partisan periods in our country's history a lot of Republican friends. Why did he do that? How did he do that?' Clinton asked.\n\n'I think he did it because everybody could see he was the real deal \u2026 His heart was in it. And I think he did it because no matter how hard he fought and how passionately argued he tried to treat everybody the way he wanted to be treated. The way he thought America should be treated. You know you can't run a free society if you have to hate everybody you disagree with,' he said.\n\nBarack Obama hugs Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Elijah Cummings' widow, at the start of the funeral service\n\nBill Clinton pointed to the prophet Isiah and referenced Cummings' call to service: 'Elijah Cummings spent a whole life saying, 'send me.' An entire lifetime.'\n\nClinton lost to Donald Trump in 2016 after a bitterly contested election. Her former spokesman on Thursday refused to rule out 100 per cent that she wouldn't run again.\n\nIn her eulogy Clinton praised Cummings, a leading force in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, as someone who 'stood against corrupt leadership.'\n\nThe former Democratic lawmaker's funeral drew a Who's Who of Democratic leaders past and present to the New Psalmist Baptist church in Cummings' hometown of Baltimore, as well as thousands of other supporters.\n\nThe son of sharecroppers, Cummings served for 22 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before his death on Oct. 17. He was an ardent civil rights voice who decades ago endured violence from white mobs as he and other African-Americans sought to integrate a public swimming pool.\n\nThe 13-term congressman was credited with helping calm tensions in Baltimore in 2015 when violence erupted following the death of an African-American man in police custody.\n\nHe was a high-profile antagonist of Trump, who reacted to a weekend of deadly violence during a 'Unite the Right' rally in Virginia saying there were 'very fine people' on both sides of the demonstrations.\n\nThe funeral was being held in Cummings' congressional district, which Trump vilified earlier this year as 'disgusting, rat and rodent-infested.'\n\nCummings responded at the time by saying Trump should visit his majority-black congressional district. 'I'll ride with him for hours... I want him to see all of the wonderful things that are happening.'\n\nU.S. race relations are sure to be a contentious topic during the upcoming 2020 presidential election season in which Democrats aim to unseat Trump.\n\nThey hope to win over the votes of African-Americans who could play an important role in determining the outcome, along with growing Hispanic communities throughout the United States.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings before his death led a series of investigations of Trump's administration and business dealings. He had been a central figure in Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry on the president's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nA sharecroppers son who rose to become a civil rights champion and the chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Cummings died last week of complications from longstanding health problems aged 68\n\nTribute: Mourners at Elijah Cummings' funeral in the New Psalmist Baptists Church in Baltimore, where there were eulogies from Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton and Maya Rockeymoore Cummings", "description": "Former President Barack Obama, left,\u00a0remembered the late Elijah Cummings\u00a0in a eulogy at his funeral, right, in Baltimore on Friday.
