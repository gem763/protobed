It determined that people in poorer nations were on average 2.5 times more likely to die from heart disease than those in richer ones.\n\n\n\nIt conversely found that non-infectious diseases such as cancer and pneumonia were less common in low-income states than in richer ones.\n\n\n\nA second study, also by researchers in Canada, and looking at data from patients in the same 21 countries, found that so-called \"modifiable risk factors\" accounted for 70 percent of heart disease cases globally.\n\n\n\nThese included diet, behavioural and socioeconomic factors, they said.\n\n\n\nMetabolic risk factors -- high cholesterol, obesity or diabetes -- caused more than 40 percent of all heart disease, and were by far the biggest determinant of disease in richer nations.\n\n\n\nBut there was also a strong link between heart disease in developing countries and household air pollution, poor diet and low education levels.\n\n\n\n\"A change in tack is required to alleviate the disproportionately high impact of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries,\" said Salim Yusuf, professor of medicine at McMaster University.\n\n\n\n\"Governments in these countries need to start investing a greater portion of their gross domestic product in preventing and managing non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular disease, rather than focusing largely on infectious diseases.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "Cancer has become the leading cause of death in rich nations, overtaking heart disease, according to the results of two landmark, decade-long global surveys of health trends released Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5va1ZWqpm6sp53pm3pPwPQ--~B/aD0xOTI0O3c9Mjg4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/US-AFPRelax/istock_840514774.7190d100320.original.jpg"}
