We\u2019ve played against each other in some big matches in the past in big tournaments.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had his injury troubles as well the last couple of years and done great to get back to the top of the game.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my match with him at the French Open in 2017 when my hip problems really started.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough five-set match in the semis and my hip never really recovered from that, so it\u2019s cool to be back playing against him in a final.\u201d\n\nMurray spurned two break points at 2-2 in the first set and was made to pay when he was broken in his next service game to trail 4-2 before Humbert served out to clinch the first set 6-3 after 41 minutes.\n\nMurray broke Humbert to lead 3-1 in the second and was pegged back to 3-3 and 5-5, when the two-time Wimbledon winner began to flex his elbow, which was feeling the effects of a hectic schedule.\n\nThe Scot edged 6-5 in front and in the decisive game he pounced when Humbert faltered.\n\nTwo wayward forehands helped hand Murray three break points and he converted the third as the Frenchman double-faulted to take the set 7-5 and level the match.\n\nMurray dug deep to take the opening game of the deciding set after saving three break points, and went on to make it five games in a row as he opened up a 3-0 lead in the decider.\n\nHe dictated more of the rallies as Humbert lost his way and moved 4-1 and 5-2 ahead before taking the contest on the first of two match points.\n\nPA", "description": "Andy Murray stayed on course for his first ATP Tour title since 2017 by beating Ugo Humbert in three tough sets at the European Open in Antwerp.
