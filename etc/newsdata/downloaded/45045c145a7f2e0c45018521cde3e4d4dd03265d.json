One of those clubs will be the NL Central champion; the other will be the league\u2019s second wild-card entry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome. I don\u2019t have to go home and pack,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cNice to stay at home. The boys wanted to stay at home, so they came out and swung the bats.\u201d\n\nAsked before Saturday\u2019s game about the importance of clinching home-field advantage, Scherzer said: \u201cWould it be nice? Yes. But is it imperative? No. We\u2019re ready to play anybody, anywhere.\u201d\n\nSure looks that way at the moment. Washington extended its winning streak to seven games, the longest run this season for a team that was 19-31 before heading in the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hot at the right time,\u201d said starter Patrick Corbin, who got hit around, giving up six runs on three homers in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nThe Indians hit four long balls in all, breaking their franchise record for a season with 222.\n\n\u201cI care more about finding a way to be one run better than the other team, whether it takes 10 singles or five homers,\u201d manager Terry Francona said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. All I care about is us winning, and, however we get to that, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen enough in 2019 to extend the season, and Cleveland has lost four games in a row.\n\nAn 8-2 defeat at Washington on Friday eliminated the Indians from the playoff race after they won the previous three AL Central titles.\n\nPlaying in place of an ill Victor Robles, Parra drove in four runs Friday - with a homer, a double and a sacrifice fly - and continued his surge Saturday, going 2 for 2 in the second inning alone.\n\nThat included his second grand slam with Washington, which signed him in May to a deal worth the $555,000 minimum after the 32-year-old outfielder was designated for assignment by San Francisco.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable. Unbelievable. Yesterday was a big day,\u201d Parra said, \u201cbut I think today is another big day.\u201d\n\nHis most notable contributions to the Nationals would have to be the post-homer dance line anyone who goes deep has to participate in and his choice of a repetitive children\u2019s song to precede his at-bats. Nationals fans have taken to vigorously clapping along whenever \u201cBaby Shark\u201d plays, and they certainly made themselves heard Saturday.\n\nWas that the most vociferous he\u2019s heard so far?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Parra answered, \u201cbecause every at-bat, I hear more loud, loud, loud.\u201d\n\nGAME SUMMARY\n\nDaniel Hudson (3-0), the fifth of six Washington pitchers, struck out two in a perfect eighth. Cleveland\u2019s Adam Plutko (7-5) lasted 1 1/3 innings, his shortest start in the majors, and was charged with eight runs and seven hits. Parra\u2019s slam came off reliever Hunter Wood.\n\nCorbin drove in Washington\u2019s first run with a bases-loaded single in the second, and Adam Eaton, Anthony Rendon and Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera also tacked on RBI hits as the Nationals built a 9-0 lead. Jordan Luplow homered twice for Cleveland, Franmil Reyes hit his 37th of the year, and Eric Haase hit the first of his career.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nIndians: 3B Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (sore right hand) sat out a second game in a row and probably won\u2019t play in the season finale Sunday, Francona said. Ram\u00edrez returned to the lineup this week, less than a month after having his broken right hand surgically repaired.\n\nNationals: On Robles, Martinez said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys sick. He came in today not feeling good. If he feels better, I want him to get some at-bats\u201d in the regular-season finale Sunday. \u2026 C Kurt Suzuki \u201cfeels absolutely normal,\u201d Martinez said, after playing the full game Friday in his first start since Sept. 5. Suzuki missed time because of a bad right elbow.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndians RHP Mike Clevinger (13-3, 2.39 ERA) can establish a career high for wins on Sunday. He hasn\u2019t allowed a run in his last two starts. Washington will pitch RHP Joe Ross (3-4, 5.90).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Washington Nationals assured themselves of hosting the NL wild-card game by holding on to beat the already-eliminated Cleveland Indians 10-7 Saturday with the help of a grand slam in a nine-run second inning from Gerardo Parra.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/indians_nationals_baseball_95566_c0-193-4603-2876_s1770x1032.jpg?db3c5a5e923e77bda929ebaef366c4ff97f5df82", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
