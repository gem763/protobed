But I just think it needs to be done at this point, for finality.\u201d\n\nThe child has not been named and Mr Minger would not discuss the nine-year-old\u2019s sex, or relationship to the victims.\n\nBut he said he had read multiple reports about the fire before deciding to proceed with the first-degree murder charges. The child has also been charged with two counts of arson and one count of aggravated arson.\n\nTim Ruestman, the Woodford County Coroner confirmed the fire was started intentionally.\n\nMr Minger said if child was found guilty of murder, they could be placed of probation for at least five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny proposed probation would not last beyond the age of 21, he said, adding that compulsory therapy and counselling are likely.\n\n\u201cProbation, given the age, is about the only outcome that could happen here,\u201d he said, adding that no arrest warrant would be issued for the child, who will have a lawyer appointed to represent them.\n\nA suspect younger than 10 cannot be detained in Illinois.\n\nTo secure a conviction, prosecutors will need to prove the nine-year-old had intent to kill in advance, which is the threshold for first-degree murder cases.\n\nGus Kostopoulos, a defence lawyer in Chicago, said the case would prove a major challenge for prosecutors.\n\n\u201cNine-year-olds don\u2019t know that Santa Claus doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know people die and don\u2019t come back to life. I don\u2019t know if nine-year-olds can form intent to commit murder.\u201d\n\nBetsy Clark, an advocate for children within the criminal justice system, was sharply critical about the charges.\n\nShe said they were \"completely out of line, given everything we have learned ... especially about the brain development of children.\"\n\nThe decision came days after a United Nations report recommended that children under 14 should never be prosecuted, no matter the crime.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "A nine-year-old has been charged with five counts of murder after a fire killed three children, including a one-year-old baby, and two adults in central Illinois.A pair of two-year-olds also died in the blaze on 6 April, alongside the 34-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h5LMAbewnpR4JAqU4oJhxg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/643ee956303f619c1d6632d578f8a35a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
