And physicians say it's about time as many of the diet teas advertised contain the active compound Seena glycoside, a laxative, and doctors warn its problematic when used in weight-loss products.\n\n\"It may lead to dehydration and loss of vital electrolytes in the body essential for optimal function of your heart and nervous system,\" Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency care physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told FOX Business adding: \"A detox is not part of a healthy lifestyle. I applaud any efforts on social media platforms to restrict such advertising regarding detox teas or other weight loss products to minors.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram says it is looking out for its users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the interest of the broader community to be exposed to these kind of branded miracle claims,\u201d Instagram Public Policy Manager Emma Collins told the Evening Standard, adding that the company will also restrict users under 18 from seeing promotional posts about cosmetic procedures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram\u2019s crack down comes amid the recent growth of influencers \u2013 people with thousands of followers who often get paid by brands to hawk their products \u2013 and celebrities advertising goods with miracle weight loss claims.\n\nStars like Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Cardi B have faced backlash for promoting detox products like FitTea and diet lollipops that can be potentially harmful to young people.\n\nTeas that advertise themselves as \u201cdetox\u201d products are typically not measured for safety or tested the way medication would be because they\u2019re not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nStill, they continue to sell. American consumers have spent more than $62 million on detox products such as weight-loss teas in 2018, according to Chicago-based market research firm, SPINS reported by The Washington Post. What\u2019s more, women are more likely to use diet and weight loss products compared to men.\n\nNow, Instagram content reviewers will be able to report a post if they feel it violates the new policy. And influencers will no longer be able to make miracle weight-loss claims and link to a discount code to get followers to buy it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Instagram is restricting minors from viewing promotional posts about detox, weight loss and cosmetic surgery.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/kim-jenner-instagram.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
