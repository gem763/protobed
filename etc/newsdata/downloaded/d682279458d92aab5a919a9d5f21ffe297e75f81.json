Which ace would crack first?\n\nThe answer: Verlander. And even when he was taken out, things only got worse for the Houston Astros.\n\nThe Washington Nationals hung six runs on the Astros in the seventh inning to break Game 2 wide open and go on to win easily, 12-3.\n\nCatcher Kurt Suzuki led the inning off with a towering solo shot:\n\nAfter Verlander followed that up by walking Victor Robles, he was pulled for reliever Ryan Pressly. Pressly walked Trea Turner and Adam Eaton advanced them on a sacrifice bunt.\n\nAnthony Rendon flew to center, but Astros outfielder George Springer got off a quick throw to home plate to ensure Robles wouldn\u2019t try to score. But that only held off the inevitable.\n\nJuan Soto was intentionally walked to bring up Howie Kendrick with two outs and the bases loaded, and Kendrick\u2019s grounder could have spelled the end of the inning. Instead, third baseman Alex Bregman couldn\u2019t quite pick it up cleanly, so Washington\u2019s second run of the inning scored. Despite the bobble, it was ruled a single and an RBI for Kendrick.\n\nThat was crucial for keeping things alive. With the bases still loaded, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera did this:\n\nTwo more runs made it 6-2. Next up was Ryan Zimmerman, who grounded to third. Again, a clean out would have ended the inning. Here\u2019s where Bregman\u2019s throw went:\n\nsomeone: send it! You won\u2019t!\n\n\n\nBregman: bet pic.twitter.com/kID1a82YdO \u2014 Evan Daniel (@mrevandaniel) October 24, 2019\n\n\n\nIt was that kind of night for the Astros. By inning\u2019s end, Washington was in control with an 8-2 lead.\n\nThe Nationals now take a 2-0 lead home to the District, and the World Series could be over as soon as Saturday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
