Miller had a pair of goals and Elias Pettersson and Alex Edler each had a goal and a two assists as the Vancouver Canucks used a potent power play to beat the Detroit Red Wings 5-1 on Tuesday night.\n\nTroy Stecher also had a goal and Brock Boeser finished with three assists for Vancouver.\n\nThe Red Wings' lone goal came from Dylan Larkin. Jonathan Bernier stopped 27 of 32 shots for Detroit.\n\nThatcher Demko had 26 saves and picked up his first win of the season in his first start for Vancouver.\n\nThe Canucks have won three games in a row, matching last year's best win streak.\n\nVancouver got off to a rough start, with a costly turnover deep in its own zone.\n\nVancouver Canucks' Quinn Hughes (43) is tripped by Detroit Red Wings' Mike Green (25) during the second period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, in Vancouver, British Columbia. (Ben Nelms/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nDetroit right-winger Anthony Mantha collected the puck and found Larkin alone in the slot. Larkin slid a shot past Demko's blocker to put the Red Wings up 1-0 just 30 seconds into the game.\n\nThe Canucks countered later in the first as Jake Virtanen sent a spinning backward pass to Stecher at the point. Stecher sent a shot past Bernier to tie the game.\n\nThe Canucks moved out in front in the second, starting with a power-play goal 1:13 into the period.\n\nDetroit's Mike Green was called for holding on Bo Horvat, and Edler scored on a long wrist shot 20 seconds into the man advantage.\n\nEdler and the defensive core have been key to Vancouver's offensive success this year, scoring six of the team's 17 goals.\n\nTyler Myers set up the Canucks' next goal, firing a shot at Bernier, who made the stop but failed to control the rebound.\n\nIn front of the crease, Pettersson batted the puck out of the air and into the Wings' net.\n\nAnother penalty to Green gave Vancouver the advantage again midway through the second period.\n\nMiller parked himself in front of Detroit's crease and tipped a shot from Edler, making it 4-1.\n\nThe Canucks had to go on the defensive early in the third, after both Miller and Jay Beagle were sent to the box for tripping in a 23-second span.\n\nTheir teammates killed off the ensuing five-on-three, but emotions erupted with nine seconds left in the second penalty when Mantha and Brandon Sutter squared off near center ice.\n\nMantha head butted Sutter, spurring several others to pair off.\n\nOnce officials had calmed the melee, Mantha headed to the box for tripping and unsportsmanlike conduct, while Sutter was called for roughing.\n\nThe Canucks got their fifth power-play opportunity of the game midway through the third period after Jacob de la Rose was called for holding.\n\nPettersson was taken down along the boards early in the advantage, but got up and rejoined the rush, setting up the final goal.\n\nPettersson patiently passed the puck around until he found Miller in the slot. Miller wasted no time in firing a wrist shot past Bernier.\n\nThe action wasn't over, however. Before the final buzzer, Stecher and Detroit's Adam Erne got into a scuffle deep in the Canucks end, resulting in both being given game misconducts.\n\nNOTES: Alex Biega made his debut with the Red Wings. The former Canucks defenseman was sent down to Vancouver's American Hockey League team in Utica, New York, after training camp, then traded to Detroit earlier this month. ... Red Wings defenseman Danny DeKeyser was scratched from the lineup with an upper-body injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRed Wings: At Calgary Flames on Thursday.\n\nCanucks: At St. Louis Blues on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nVancouver Canucks' J.T Miller (9) stands in front of Detroit Red Wings goalie Jonathan Bernier (45) during the second period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, in Vancouver, British Columbia.
