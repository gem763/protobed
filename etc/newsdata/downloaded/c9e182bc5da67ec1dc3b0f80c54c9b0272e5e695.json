And the Raiders surely don\u2019t want to give Brown a one-way ticket to New England.\n\nAt this point, however, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone would want Brown. There\u2019s way too much to unpack, way too much due dilgence to be done, to find a way to plug Brown into a new team on the fly. And even if a team decides to roll the dice, they\u2019ll be spending time watching the dice roll and roll and roll via Brown\u2019s various social-media channels and personal interactions with teammates, coaches, and executives when they should be instead focusing on one opponent after another.\n\nTalent is seductive; it\u2019s completely blinded Jon Gruden. But at some point no amount of talent is worth it. Brown has reached that point.\n\nSo maybe the Raiders need not worry about engineering the ability to place Brown on the reserve/left squad list. Maybe they should just cut him \u2014 and let him go rip apart another franchise the way he\u2019s ripped apart the Steelers and now the Raiders, if someone else is going to be sufficiently seduced by Brown\u2019s talent to overlook the very, very bad that comes with the very, very good.", "description": "As the Raiders try to figure out what to do with Antonio Brown, the player seems to be walking right into the team's nuclear option.
