The company said the acquisition would be paid for using an equal split of senior unsecured debt and mandatory convertible bonds.\n\nThe purchase forms part of DTE Energy\u2019s plan to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion into its midstream unit between 2019 and 2023, the statement said.\n\nDTE Energy has looked to expand into natural gas pipelines and storage, which provides steady cash flows even during energy price swings, at a time when advanced energy efficiency measures have made the provision of electricity less lucrative.\n\nHowever, DTE Energy expects to retain a long-term business mix of which between 70% and 75% will consist of its utility operations, the statement added.\n\nReuters reported that DTE was nearing a deal to buy the gas pipeline system on Thursday, citing sources.\n\nDTE Energy was advised by Barclays, with legal assistance from Shearman & Sterling and Dechert. Jefferies and Credit Suisse served as financial advisors to Momentum, with Vinson & Elkins as its legal counsel. Kirkland & Ellis was legal advisor to Indigo.", "description": "DTE Energy's midstream business said on Friday it would buy a natural gas gathering system and pipeline in Louisiana's Haynesville shale formation for $2.25 billion in cash, expanding the unit's operations to the Gulf coast.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
