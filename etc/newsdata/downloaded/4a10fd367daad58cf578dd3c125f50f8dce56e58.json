McKew is a writer and lecturer on Russian influence and information warfare. She advised the Georgian president and national security council from 2009 to 2013 and former Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat in 2014 and 2015.\n\nA year ago, I was in Kiev when a young Ukrainian soldier was killed. Olesya Baklanova, 19, enlisted in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as soon as she was eligible and fought to be assigned a combat post. Deployed to the front lines of her country\u2019s war against Russia, she was killed during the night while manning an observation post, shot by a sniper stationed among the Russian and proxy forces dug in a few hundred meters way. She was one of four Ukrainian soldiers killed at their post that night \u2014 one of the estimated 13,000 soldiers, fighters and civilians killed in eastern Ukraine in the past five years.\n\nHer story was a concise reminder of the realities of Ukraine\u2019s forgotten war. Russian forces seized Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in early 2014; weeks later, Russia formally annexed the territory. This was an important strategic goal for President Vladimir Putin. To ensure that no one had time to do anything about it \u2014 and to further destabilize Ukraine \u2014 Russia then launched a war in eastern Ukraine, in the Donbas region, using nominal separatists with Russian backing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFive years on, it\u2019s still a hot war, with Russia constantly pushing forward the line of occupation. Some 1.5 million people have been displaced. The shifting mass of regular and irregular Russian troops in eastern Ukraine \u2014 soldiers and mercenaries; \u201cseparatist\u201d proxies and militias; a lot of guys with pseudonyms using advanced Russian weaponry that Russia claims must have been bought at the local corner shop (note: it is supplied from Russia) \u2014 constantly test and adapt new capabilities, especially electronic warfare capabilities, on the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian forces, with Western support, have steadily developed new measures to counter whatever is thrown at them. The Ukrainian war effort is defined both by this ingenuity and by sacrifice. The army, left gutted by former President Viktor Yanukovych, was rebuilt entirely in wartime. New units are rotated through areas of heavy fighting to increase their combat experience \u2014 a wartime readiness strategy that contributes to spikes in casualties, but which has been enormously successful. The average age of Ukrainian recruits is officially around 36, though anecdotally it\u2019s over 40 at the front, as the generation that remembers life before independence now leads the fight to keep it.\n\nThe dirty, confusing, irregular conflict in Ukraine is part of a broader political war waged by the Kremlin. In countless ways, this is the inevitable evolution of Russia\u2019s aggression against its neighbors after Putin paid so little price for invading Georgia in 2008. I worked as an adviser to the Georgian government in the years after that war, and we watched as almost everyone normalized Putin\u2019s behavior, emboldening him to press forward. Now, Russia\u2019s army sniper school has been transferred to the Ukrainian front, training the next generation of elite Russian marksmen by having them pick off Ukrainian soldiers. Soldiers like Baklanova.\n\nThis is the necessary context in which Americans should understand the gravity of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into becoming a subsidiary of his re-election campaign. In one gesture, Trump reduced the survival of Ukraine to a bargaining chip in an utterly petty pursuit; embroiled Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in scandal and undercut his ability to defend the interests of his nation; and weakened the clout of U.S. leadership on Ukraine, the region and beyond.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of this latest Trump-derived scandal is the Kremlin. This isn\u2019t some theoretical future calculus. It has an immediate impact on U.S. security and our strategic outlook. And it enhances the ability of the Kremlin to keep stirring chaos inside the United States.\n\nTrump is bargaining away U.S. security for conspiracy theories about Ukraine and the Bidens that he hopes will not only strengthen his position for his re-election, but will also erase the evidence that Kremlin intervention helped to elect him president. It\u2019s actually hard to know which part of all this makes the Kremlin most happy.\n\n\n\n***\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea, there has been a lot of speculation about Putin\u2019s long-term goals for Ukraine and the region, be it rebuilding a kind of Russian empire or disrupting what he views as another empire moving toward his borders. But in the near term, Putin knows that pushing for a pro-Kremlin alignment in Ukrainian politics \u2014 especially with the war still on \u2014 is a waste of effort. Far better to hope for what has succeeded elsewhere along the Russian rim, and in Europe, and in the United States: the sense that it would be nice to get along better with Russia, because it\u2019s exhausting to live under a constant existential threat.\n\nThe caveat to this is that Russia doesn\u2019t actually want to get along. Putin needed Crimea, as he detailed in a March 2014 speech marking its annexation, because it was where Prince Vladimir, ruler of the medieval federation known as the Kievan Rus, was baptized into Orthodox Christianity more than a thousand years ago \u2014 the starting point of the arc of Russian history that has culminated in Vladimir Putin. Annexing Crimea into Russia did away with the inconvenient fact that the Russian empire was born in Ukraine. Putin spent years telling people that Crimea was Russia. And then, suddenly, it was.\n\nA lot of what Putin has done since 2014 is about keeping Crimea. An important component of achieving that is ensuring that Ukraine remains a nation governed by a fractious elite awash in Russian money and highly subject to Kremlin manipulations. This helps keep Ukraine in limbo between Russia and the West.\n\nBecause if Russia can\u2019t have Ukraine, neither can anyone else. Right now, the Kremlin\u2019s de facto veto on Ukraine\u2019s westward integration is the war. In the simplest terms, a country not in control of its own territory isn\u2019t an ideal alliance partner \u2014 it\u2019s the same card the Kremlin played to keep Georgia out of NATO. The ongoing conflict can also be used to disrupt the politics, society and economy of Ukraine. In exchange for agreeing to end the war, the Kremlin wants a new form of the veto \u2014 a permanent \u201cspecial status\u201d guarantee for Ukraine\u2019s eastern provinces, which will allow the Kremlin to maintain political control over territories within Ukraine through local Russian proxies. It would be the end of Ukraine\u2019s post-independence geopolitical aspirations, preventing it from ever integrating fully into NATO or the European Union.\n\nThe Kremlin wants you to believe Ukraine has only two choices: Ukrainians can keep fighting and dying to defend their sovereignty, or they can accept a proxy occupation designed to disrupt their governance and national unity. The only chance for a third option is unwavering Western support \u2014 which requires unwavering American support \u2014 for the Ukrainian people\u2019s desire to live in a reformed, secure, democratic nation at peace within its recognized borders and working toward integration into Western institutions. The Kremlin\u2019s propaganda works to make Americans believe that this third option is just some unicorn dream \u2014 that a corrupt, divided, Nazi-infested Ukraine is utterly unsupported by the distracted, feckless, immoral West (that\u2019s Kremlin terminology, not my own).\n\nSince 2014, the propaganda on this has become pretty stale and formulaic. The Trump-Zelensky spectacle \u2014 a play about American fecklessness and Ukrainian corruption in one \u201cperfect\u201d act \u2014 was a gift to the Kremlin to refresh the tired themes.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThis whole tent revival is a spin-off of a longer play, the script of which is ribboned with conspiracy narrative actively hawked and amped by the Kremlin\u2019s disinformation machinery. In this drama, of course, poor Russia \u2014 despite documentation of their operations by U.S. and Dutch intelligence; financial records, personnel and travel records; lists of accounts and content archived from social media; high-level sources inside the Kremlin; and more \u2014 is a blameless bystander in the 2016 attacks on American election systems and the aggressive information operations that targeted and polarized American society. And the actual villain, totally conveniently, happens to be Ukraine, the nation the Kremlin has been working to smear and dismantle since 2013.\n\nIt is a tedious and clunky story that weaves in and out of other bonkers, far-right disinformation conspiracies \u2014 Seth Rich, QAnon, everything a secret plot and ANY DAY NOW the real truth is gonna come out \u2014 that has been amply documented as false by very smart and patient researchers and journalists. But the once-respected Rudy Giuliani has become a well-oiled cog in the machine nonetheless. You can spend time trying to unravel his 52-dimensional chess explanations of how he has uncovered a Clinton/Soros/Ukraine plot, but honestly, don\u2019t. It\u2019s unclear if he actually understands that virtually all of it is made up by malign actors who are just here to watch it all burn. But listening to his self-narrative about being the hero of the story is a sign that he\u2019s an easy mark for anyone who understands how to work this psychology.\n\nThe waters were so heavily chummed for sharks like Giuliani \u2014 how could he not take the bait and run after the irresistible story that solves all problems?\n\nMaybe Giuliani explained the story to Trump in a way that made sense: It could exonerate Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, muddle the narrative, febreze away the stink of the Mueller report from Trump himself forever. Or maybe the sales pitch was all about the Biden thing. Regardless, Trump unleashed Giuliani, apparently with the support of U.S. diplomats, to undercut U.S. interests and policy \u2014 because, again, Trump just doesn\u2019t care if Ukraine, a nation of 44 million people is sentenced to purgatory because of his actions. It is a crippling indictment of his judgment, his leadership, his fitness for office and his grasp on reality.\n\nFalse equivalencies are the lifeblood of Russian propaganda, an easy tool to exploit bias and distort perception. They are also a tactic that Trump deploys nearly instinctually. \u201cFake Ukraine collusion 2020\u201d as the new \u201cfake Russia collusion 2016\u201d is an extraordinarily powerful false equivalency \u2014 to minimize the significance of the support the Kremlin levied to help get Trump elected, to erase the importance of the Mueller investigation, and to create problems for the new Ukrainian president and his country.\n\nBy embroiling Ukraine in scandal, by politicizing support of Ukraine among the American audience, by linking Ukraine to the conspiracy nexus that underlies all thinking in Trumpworld \u2014 and by minimizing the existential threat that Ukraine and Ukrainians face every day from the Russian assault on their nation \u2014 Trump is advancing core Kremlin objectives. He has made the president of Ukraine an accomplice in that effort, or maybe just a companion in the same trap.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just about Ukraine. There is a systematic Russian effort to gain similar concessions on Moldova and Georgia \u2014 to force acceptance of a Russian veto of those countries' determination to be nations aligned with western values. The United States should be leading a political and diplomatic effort to expose what Russia is doing and explain what those Russian efforts mean. We should be leading to counter the advance of illiberal ideals in the world.\n\nInstead we look inward at the circus. Faith in who we are and what defines us is eroding, while the geostrategic landscape of the world is remade around us \u2014 and not by anyone who believes that the will of the people is going to be a thing that matters in the future.\n\nTrump has sent clear signals that Ukraine might not have his support \u2014 go ahead, make your own deal with Putin #shrug. Diplomatic resources that should have been focused on crafting a policy to counter Russian aggression were diverted to chase down rumors and personal vendettas instead.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to ignore the details of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. It\u2019s easy to get lost in the smoke-and-mirrors fiction that what the Kremlin is doing isn\u2019t actually what it is doing \u2014 a dance at which the West has become quite adept since Russia\u2019s cyberattack on Estonia in 2007 and invasion of Georgia in 2008.\n\nWe watch what the Kremlin does to its neighbors, to us, to Europe, to the Middle East, to Afghanistan \u2014 and we blink. Hackers, cyberattacks, disinformation, invasion, annexation, devastation, mercenaries, terrorists, giant arms expos \u2014 and we blink.\n\nUkraine is now the frontline, the place where we have the best chance to act, and to stop ignoring the reality of what we face.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Congress has consistently, and in a bipartisan fashion, approved military assistance for Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian invasion and aggression. With limited but targeted resources and support, America and other NATO allies have quietly done a lot to bolster Ukraine. It\u2019s a vast, sweeping success story. A story that almost no one talks about for fear that the president will interfere.\n\nWe don\u2019t offer this support on some fantastical whim anchored in Cold War nostalgia, but because it is in our vital contemporary interest, in countless respects, to limit the further expansion of Russia\u2019s hold on the Black Sea region, which the Kremlin uses to stage its war in Syria and to project power into the Middle East and Africa, across the Mediterranean on up to the western Arctic, and beyond. It is a pattern of activity that has degraded the security environment in which we and our alliances operate, and it has contributed to the sense of political instability and unrest, of churn and upheaval, that has plagued Europe since the financial crisis, the migration crisis, and Brexit, and that has defined the Middle East since the Islamic State and Bashar al-Assad became twin pillars of decay.\n\nUsing the Black Sea as an operational base, the Kremlin works against the United States and our interests, consistently choosing confrontation over cooperation. Russian forces attack U.S. ships, troops and planes with electronic warfare, mercenaries, and air assets, toeing the line about what is defined as activity \u201cbelow the line of conflict.\u201d They have not pivoted from a zero-sum view of relations with the United States. And not seeing how far the line has moved since 2008 \u2014 we now accept borders being changed by force, and the deployment of Russian forces to new ports and bases, and the fact that Russia arms the Taliban as they target American soldiers in Afghanistan, and ongoing, overt political interference in our domestic politics \u2014 is still a crazy, blind weakness of the West.\n\nThis is why remembering Olysea Baklanova is so important. America might be looking inward, waving our arms about whatever horrific violation Trump has tweeted that day \u2014 but we can\u2019t define what Trump did to Ukraine from the perspective of our sad, fleabag circus.\n\nEvery time Trump guts an institution, diverts money to his personality projects, labels an internal enemy, violates a norm, secures a job for a corrupt and unqualified appointee, ignores the law, asks a foreign leader to \u201cdo him a favor\u201d \u2014 every time he breaks a rule and pays no price, he provides illustration for Putin\u2019s expanding primer on \u201cthe hoax\u201d of democracy and \u201cthe people.\u201d\n\nPutin believes that all democracy is farce, and he has worked tirelessly to make sure that Western democracies believe this too. His propaganda machinery has supported Trump and the Brexiteers, faux-democrats like Hungarian President Viktor Orban and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, because their self-dealing motivations amplify the firehose of cynicism that now spreads anti-democratic derision across the West.\n\nUkrainians have bled during a five-plus year war that they haven\u2019t lost to Russia. They fight this war at the border of Europe to defend their democracy and the right to pursue a future of their choosing. They fight this war because they know that someone has to, and because they know what it will cost them if they don\u2019t.\n\nIt will cost us, too. Trump recently called Ukraine \u201ca big, wide, beautiful wall\u201d between Russia and Europe. In reality, it is the thinnest of shields. For Ukrainians, that shield holds the line between the future they want and the past they won\u2019t go back to. For Americans, in more than a symbolic way, the thin shield of Ukraine stands between the America we think we are, and the America we might actually be, in a world where the terms are dictated by autocrats and our power is greatly diminished.\n\nUkrainians deserve American support \u2014 far less cynical American support \u2014 not because we decide this-or-that president or prime minister is a guy we like, but because the people of Ukraine have died to have what we have, and to become equal members of alliances that are the architecture of American prosperity, security and power in the world. Trump talks constantly about how none of our allies are paying enough for security. Well, the Ukrainians have paid. They\u2019ve paid a lot. Their commitment, and vibrancy, and innovative spirit will help reinforce and reinvigorate our alliances. It is of material benefit to the United States of America to have a thriving, secure, democratic Ukraine \u2014 and Georgia, and Moldova \u2014 integrated into that architecture.\n\nAnd maybe if we can help them get there, it will begin to counter the corrosion of that architecture that has occurred under President Trump.", "description": "The biggest beneficiary of the Ukraine scandal is, sure enough, the Kremlin.", "authors": ["Molly K.
