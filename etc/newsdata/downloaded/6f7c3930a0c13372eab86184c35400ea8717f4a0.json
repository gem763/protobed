German police have in the past faced criticism for using a loose definition of what constitutes a weapon.\n\nRaids on the radical Left in recent years have led to confiscations of bricks and household implements as police sought to up political pressure on Berlin\u2019s militant squatter scene.\n\nMatthias Quent, an extremism expert at the Institute for Democracy and Civil Society, told ARD that the new figures showed the far-Right are \"massively arming themselves\".\n\n\"Their aim is to intimidate society and drive out ethnic minorities. Parts of the scene even want a civil war,\" Mr Quent said.\n\nComing just months after the murder of a politician from Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats by a suspected far-right fanatic, the news adds to concern about rising militancy.\n\nWalter L\u00fcbcke, mayor of Kassel, was shot at point blank range outside his house in June. Weeks later police arrested Stephan Ernst, a man with a long history of involvement in the neo-Nazi scene.\n\nIn the course of investigations, police found 46 guns at Mr Ernst\u2019s home and place of work.\n\nWhile it is still unclear how many of the weapons were held legally, investigators have reportedly told the home affairs committee that they were \u201chidden professionally\u201d.", "description": "The German government says it will respond to an \u201calarming\u201d rise in weapons seizures during raids on far-Right extremists by handing police more powers to fight radicalism.
