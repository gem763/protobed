She could get up tomorrow, test it out, and see where she is, but the reality is, I don't know anything more than that. She hasn't done anything athletic all week.\"\n\nWashington guard Ariel Atkins (back spasms) also is listed as questionable.\n\nThe timing of the injuries isn't good with the best-of-five series knotted at one win apiece.\n\n\"We're listing them both as questionable and preparing as if neither one of them will play,\" Thibault said. \"Elena has made some progress, but she isn't here, nor is Ariel -- they are with our therapists and doctors right now. I'm not counting on them playing.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old Delle Donne averaged 19.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocked shots in 31 regular-season games. Atkins, 23, averaged 10.3 points and 1.5 steals in 33 games and is considered one of Washington's top defensive players.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Regular-season MVP Elena Delle Donne of the Washington Mystics is listed as  questionable for Sunday's Game 3 of the WNBA Finals against the host ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
