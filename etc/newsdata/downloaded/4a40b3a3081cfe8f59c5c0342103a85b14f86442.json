After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement I won\u2019t be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will survive,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith, who was also managing editor of the network\u2019s breaking news unit, has been one of the few senior journalists on Fox News to criticize Trump.\n\nHis departure follows attacks by Trump on the network\u2019s less friendly coverage of his administration since the U.S. House of Representatives began an impeachment inquiry, which opinion polls suggest has growing support from Americans.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier on Friday that U.S. Attorney General William Barr met this week with Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox Corp owns Fox News.\n\n\u201cFoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!,\u201d Trump tweeted on Thursday.\n\nIn March, Smith took issue with Trump\u2019s criticism of the late Republican Senator John McCain, and in August Smith spoke out about the \u201cunmistakable rise of white nationalism and white racism in America\u201d which Democrats say Trump has not done enough to discourage.\n\nIn September, Smith called out Trump for his mistaken insistence that the state of Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly criticized the U.S. media as \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d has lashed out publicly against Shepard.\n\n\u201cWatching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews,\u201d Trump tweeted in August.\n\nSmith has been with Fox News since it was launched in 1996 and his departure took colleagues by surprise.\n\nA person walks by the Fox News offices after it was announced that news anchor Shepard Smith had quit the network in New York City, U.S.,October 11, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\n\u201cShepard Smith just dropped a bomb ... He was part of the glue that held Fox together. He is a supreme pro who made us all better,\u201d Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts tweeted on Friday.\n\nFox News President Jay Wallace in a statement called Smith \u201cone of the premier newscasters of his generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network,\u201d Wallace said.", "description": "Shepard Smith, the chief news anchor of Fox News and a sometime critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, abruptly quit the network on Friday after 23 years.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439860690&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27J", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
