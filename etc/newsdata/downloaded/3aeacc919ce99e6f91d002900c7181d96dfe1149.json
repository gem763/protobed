Navigating income, outgoings, taxes, benefits, savings, investments, mortgages, loans and the rest isn\u2019t made any easier by the constantly shifting sands of politics and policy as the powers that be attempt to cut costs and balance the books without alienating too many voters.\n\nIn fact, in their ideal world we wouldn\u2019t even realise our finances were being tinkered with.\n\nDespite the army of financial and political experts, analysts, data geeks and consumer campaigners who pore over the fine detail of each tax change, budget announcement and policy detail the occasional tweak slides through unnoticed. And sometimes those quiet changes have fundamental effects in real life.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In a bid to simplify an impenetrable raft of rules and restrictions, the underlying valuable benefit has been quietly swept away too.\n\nWhile the good news is that women now usually receive a larger pension in their own right, a typical pensioner could now see their total household income fall by between half and two-thirds following bereavement.\n\nWith outgoings usually staying relatively high including rent or mortgage costs, car-related expenses and even energy, water and food bills, a grieving widow or widower will have to battle a squeeze on their living standards at the same time.\n\n\u201cAs well as the emotional impact of bereavement, losing a spouse in later life can have a huge impact on living standards,\u201d said Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London. \u201cUnder the new state pension system, widows and widowers will inherit little, if anything, of their late spouse\u2019s pension and income from an annuity often ceases when the recipient dies.\n\n\u201cHousehold outgoings may reduce somewhat following a bereavement, but income is likely to fall by much more. Couples in retirement need to make sure they know where they would stand and plan ahead to make sure they do not face an unexpected financial shock.\u201d\n\nExperts are now urging those approaching retirement to look carefully at the terms of their state, company and/or private pension to see how much would be passed on.\n\nIf you are unsure about your state pension rights, the government website goes through the options.\n\nMeanwhile, after a lifetime of retirement saving, those approaching retirement are being advised to spend their money carefully in the early years and think about setting more money aside while there are two incomes coming in to fill the gap. Couples could also look again at life insurance or a similar policy.\n\nThose people considering a single life annuity in particular are being urged to tread carefully as calculations show a couple both on the flat rate pension with one single life annuity could see the household\u2019s income drop by 66 per cent when one partner dies.\n\nThe most common type of annuity, these policies have no provision for a spouse beyond a minimum guarantee period.\n\nCouples who are both on the full flat rate pension with no other income and couples who also have one company pension would see their household\u2019s income drop by 50 per cent according to Royal London\u2019s calculations.\n\nBut while death in older age is sadly par for the course, further changes made from April 2017 have seen the benefits available to all bereaved Brits drop significantly.\n\nFollowing the death of a spouse or partner a bereaved person will now receive a tax-free lump sum of \u00a32,500 if they don\u2019t have children or \u00a33,500 if they do, plus a monthly tax-free payment, again depending on family situation of either \u00a3100 or \u00a3350 for 18 months.\n\nUnder the new system, bereaved families with young children are likely to be the hardest hit, as they will now only get support for 18 months instead of until the youngest child leaves school. The 2017 changes mean some of the UK\u2019s lowest income families receive \u00a331,000 less than they would have done under the old system, while the average working widowed parent could now receive \u00a312,000 less in total.\n\nMore details about claiming benefits after the death of a partner are available from the government\u2019s information pages on gov.uk", "description": "Financial affairs can be\u2026 complex.
