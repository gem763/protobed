Without him, Famalicao could not bring in those players,\u201d says Francisco Fontao, a 37-year-old supporter.\n\nDespite its heady heights in the league, Famalicao\u2019s stadium harks back to a bygone era, owning just 5,500 seats that will be expanded to 7,000 in 2021, after an investment of around 8 million euros.\n\nIt is a reminder that there is work to do and coach Joao Pedro Sousa is determined to keep his players grounded.\n\n\u201cOur goal is survival and I want to ensure we don\u2019t think about anything else until we achieve it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut should they beat Porto, then Famalicao might think anything is possible.", "description": "Lisbon (AFP) \u2013 Four years on from languishing in Portugal\u2019s third tier, Famalicao sit atop the Primeira Liga and face Porto on Sunday in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/4df7b8_famalicao-players-celebrate-fans-club-victory-sporting-lisbon-on-september-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
