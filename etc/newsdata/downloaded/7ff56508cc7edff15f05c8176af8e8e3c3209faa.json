You score, there\u2019s an explosion of noise and then it\u2019s VAR. You wait. Is it a goal?\u201d\n\nVAR was introduced to the Premier League this season but has been widely criticised, with many feeling it has not been effectively implemented or utilised so far.\n\nReferees have not used the screens at the side of pitches, and the threshhold for overturning \u201cclear and obvious\u201d errors has seemed incredibly high.\n\nMilner scored the winning penalty in the 95th minute as Liverpool beat Leicester 2-1 earlier this month, but had his spot-kick delayed as the video assistant referee checked the penalty incident.\n\n\u201cThat was a new experience as they\u2019re debating if it\u2019s going to be a penalty,\u201d Milner explained.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s use for it \u2013 if we can improve it. But football is a game of human error on the field and in officiating as well. They have a very tough job and I\u2019m all for making their lives easier \u2013 but not at the expense of the flow of the game.\n\n\u201cIf the VAR took away controversy I\u2019d back it 100 per cent. But we\u2019re still having discussions about VAR. I don\u2019t think many footballers feel differently.\u201d\n\n26 decisions have been overturned in the first ten weeks of the Premier League season.", "description": "James Milner has claimed that VAR is ruining the atmosphere at football matches.
