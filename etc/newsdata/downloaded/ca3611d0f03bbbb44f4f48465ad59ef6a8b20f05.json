Industry leaker @UniverseIce has said that neither the S11 nor the Fold 2 will be sporting this tech, which only leaves the Galaxy Note device when it comes to the company's flagships.\n\nThe alternative is to roll it out in one of Samsung's budget handsets, like the A series. Either way, there's no official word just yet.
