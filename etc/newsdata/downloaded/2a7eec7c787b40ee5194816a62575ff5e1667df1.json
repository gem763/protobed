There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Silver makes a distinction between the \u201cgovernment and business\u201d in a communist-controlled country, shows that the NBA may not have a proper understanding of exactly who and what they\u2019re dealing with in China.\n\nThe NBA-China rift seemed like it was on its way out of the news cycle earlier this week, however, Lakers star LeBron James breathed new life into the controversy by claiming Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d on the Hong Kong issue, and pointing out the \u201cnegative\u201d side-effects of free speech.\n\nSilver explained to reporters that the NBA is still feeling the impact of the China controversy.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d he said. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we go from here. The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nWhile the NBA\u2019s initial response to China drew bipartisan backlash for being too deferential to the Chinese Communist Party, and not supportive enough of an American citizen using free speech in support of democracy, Silver sounded far more resolute in his Thursday comments.\n\n\u201cThese American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd one of those values is free expression. We wanted to make sure that everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver says that China wanted Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey fired over his tweet in support of Hong Kong", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gty-andy-lyons-640x480-640x480-R-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
