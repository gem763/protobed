However, the event was not sanctioned by the school, according to officials.\n\nHunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks told reporters Sunday that 12 people were injured, including eight who were shot.\n\nInvestigators told CBS News the gunman entered the building through a backdoor and his first victim may have been his intended target. The shooter used a handgun.\n\nSheriff's deputies were already on scene responding to reports of illegal parking when gunfire erupted. Meeks said it is believed there were over 750 people at the party.\n\nDramatic cellphone video showed the aftermath of the shooting \u2014 wounded partygoers laid out on the floor as others desperately tried to help them, CBS News' Mireya Villareal reported.\n\n\"It's just kinda sad knowing that we were here coming to like celebrate something and then something like this happens, but I guess it's just the world that we live in, so,\" said Ciara Vital, who was at the party. \"It kind of hurts but it's the world that we live in now.\"\n\nThe Party Venue is seen after a mass shooting where two people died in Texas early Sunday, October 27, 2019 as partygoers were celebrating homecoming week ahead of Halloween.
