(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Latest on developments following President Donald Trump's announcement that U.S. forces in Syria killed the Islamic State group's leader (all times local):\n\n3 p.m.\n\nA Philippine general overseeing the battle against Islamic State group-aligned local militants says he's ordered intensified monitoring and tighter security in insurgency-affected areas in the country's south, following the reported death of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nRegional military commander Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana told reporters on Monday that al-Baghdadi was not well known among younger Muslim militants in the southern Philippines but that his death could be exploited to encourage retaliatory attacks.\n\nPhilippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana says al-Baghdadi's death \"is a blow\" to his brutal organization \"but this is just a momentary setback considering the depth and reach of the organization worldwide.\"\n\nPhilippine security officials have blamed IS group-aligned militants for deadly attacks in the country, including the five-month siege of southern Marawi city in 2017 and a string of suicide bombing attacks in southern Sulu province this year.\n\n___\n\n2:55 p.m.\n\nThe European Union says the death of the Islamic State group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a U.S.-led raid in northwest Syria is a severe blow to the extremist group, also known as Daesh, but is warning that it remains a major security threat.\n\nEU commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said on Monday that al-Baghdadi's death \"represents another step\" toward defeating terror inspired by IS.\n\nBut Kocijancic says that \"Daesh continues to represent a major threat. We must remain extremely vigilant to mitigate the risk it poses.\"\n\nShe says the fight \"against global terrorism requires unity, determination and collaboration,\" and underlines the importance of ensure stability in northern Syria, where Turkish troops recently launched an offensive, and in neighboring Iraq.\n\n___\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThe prime minister of Sri Lanka, where 269 people were killed last April in suicide attacks claimed by the Islamic State group, commended President Donald Trump for the successful operation that killed IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe said on Twitter that IS \"has been creating fear and terror around the world. This successful operation makes the world a safe place\"\n\nSuicide bombers struck in three churches and three tourist hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing 269 people and wounding some 500. Investigators found two local Muslim groups were responsible for the attacks.\n\nA video released afterward showed ringleader Mohamed Zahran, who was among the suicide bombers, and others whose faces were covered pledging allegiance to al-Baghdadi.\n\nA separate video showed al-Baghdadi appearing in a video praising the attacks in Sri Lanka.\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nThe German government says its thoughts are with the many victims of Islamic State atrocities following the reported death of the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a U.S. special forces raid.\n\nGovernment spokesman Steffen Seibert cited the \"murdered and enslaved Yazidis,\" local people in areas where IS had taken control as well as foreign hostages, and those who were killed in IS attacks in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nHe told reporters on Monday that al-Baghdadi \"can't issue such murderous orders anymore now,\" but added that \"this doesn't mean that the fight against IS is over.\"\n\nSeibert says he had no information on whether Germany was involved in the U.S.-led operation, and declined to comment on President Donald Trump's claim that Germany and other European countries have been unwilling to take back their nationals who joined IS.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman says Kremlin will regard the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a welcome development if it is confirmed that he was killed in a U.S. special operation in Syria.\n\nDmitry Peskov's comments on Monday echoed a Defense Ministry statement a day earlier that expressed doubts about the veracity of President Donald Trump's claim.\n\nPeskov says that iIf the reality of this information about the liquidation of al-Baghdadi is confirmed, then in general we talk about a serious contribution by the president of the United States in the fight against international terrorism.\"", "description": "A Philippine general overseeing the battle against Islamic State group-aligned local militants says he's ordered intensified monitoring and tighter security in insurgency-affected areas in the country's south, following the reported death of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
