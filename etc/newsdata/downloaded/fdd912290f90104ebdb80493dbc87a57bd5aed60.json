Thousands of people remained under evacuation orders, though many were allowed to return home Saturday.\n\nOne man who tried to fight the blaze died of a heart attack, and one firefighter reported a minor eye injury.\n\nRead more: Photos show the Saddleridge Fire as it ripped through 7,500 acres of LA's San Fernando Valley, growing 800 acres per hour\n\nThe fire's cause is under investigation, and authorities warned that the threat of flare-ups remained.\n\nAt the site of another blaze east of Los Angeles, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said a second body was found at a mobile home park where 74 structures were destroyed Thursday in Calimesa. Officials previously reported one death at the community east of Los Angeles.\n\nThe department said one of the Calimesa victims has been identified as 89-year-old Lois Arvikson. Her son Don Turner said she had called him to say she was evacuating, but he never heard from her again. Authorities are working to identify the other victim.\n\nA helicopter drops water onto an advancing wildfire Friday, Oct. 11, 2019, in Porter Ranch, Calif. Associated Press/Marcio Jose Sanchez\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said the bulk of the fire at the city's edge had moved away from homes and into rugged hillsides and canyons where firefighters were making steady progress slowing its advance. Television footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the area but no walls of towering flame, as a water-dropping helicopter moved in to dump another cascade on the blaze.\n\n\"The bulk of the fire has moved toward wildland,\" Humphrey said.\n\nFirefighters worked under sunny skies, but air quality was poor as smoke dispersed over much of greater Los Angeles. Air quality officials urged people to limit outdoor activities.\n\nThe forecast called for low humidity \u2014 in the 10% range \u2014 with light wind and an occasional gust up to 15 mph (24 kph).\n\nRead more: The California power outages show how dire the wildfire crisis has gotten \u2014 9 of the state's 10 biggest fires came in the last 16 years\n\nEast of Los Angeles, firefighters were also gaining ground on a blaze that ripped through a Riverside County mobile home park, destroying dozens of residences. In Northern California, the lights are back on for 98% of customers who lost power when Pacific Gas & Electric switched it off in an effort to prevent wildfires.\n\nSome 100,000 residents were ordered out of their homes because of the wind-driven wildfire that broke out Thursday evening in the San Fernando Valley, though authorities began lifting evacuation orders in many areas Saturday. It spread westward through tinder-dry brush in hilly subdivisions on the outskirts of the nation's second-largest city.\n\nFlames from a backfire, lit by firefighters to stop the Saddleridge Fire from spreading, burn a hillside in Newhall, Calif., on Friday, Oct. 11, 2019. Associated Press/Noah Berger\n\nInterstate 5, the main north-to-south corridor in the state, was shut down for much of the day Friday, choking traffic until finally reopening.\n\nThe smoky scent spreading through much of Los Angeles was a reminder of the threat of a fire season just beginning.\n\nThe region has been on high alert as notoriously powerful Santa Ana winds brought dry desert air to a desiccated landscape that only needed a spark to erupt. Fire officials have warned that they expect more intense and devastating California wildfires due, in part, to climate change.\n\nFire danger remained high for much of Southern California, with warnings in place for large swaths of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties west of Los Angeles.\n\nRead more: A Los Angeles bush fire has burned over 7,500 acres and prompted evacuation orders for 100,000 people \u2014 here are the latest updates\n\nThe cause of the Los Angeles blaze wasn't immediately known, though arson investigators said a witness reported seeing sparks or flames coming from a power line near where the fire is believed to have started, said Peter Sanders, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nJonathan Stahl was driving home to Valencia when he saw the smoke and immediately diverted to a mobile home park in Sylmar where his grandmother and aunt live together.\n\nThe park had been nearly wiped out in 2008 when one of the city's most destructive fires leveled 500 homes.\n\nStahl helped his grandmother, Beverly Stahl, 91, who was in her pajamas, and his aunt to pack clothing, medication and take their two dogs. They saw flames in the distance as they drove away.\n\n\"We just packed up what we could as fast as we could,\" Stahl said at an evacuation center at the Sylmar Recreation Center, massaging his grandmother's shoulders as she sat in a wheelchair with a Red Cross blanket on her lap. \"If we'd stuck around, we would have been in trouble. Real big trouble.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stefanie Dazio and Brian Melley contributed to this report.", "description": "Officials say the fire in the San Fernando Valley area hasn't grown significantly since Friday, and ground crews are tamping down lingering hotspots.", "authors": ["Christopher Weber", "Michael R.
