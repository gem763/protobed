Despite the anticipation for a big event, the server simply went offline. There it is.\n\nAt around 4am Eastern, with thousands of people around the world staring at Fortnite\u2019s swirling black hole, the game suddenly blinked to a loading screen, with a message reading \u201cFortnite servers are currently undergoing maintenance. Please try again later.\u201d The servers currently read as \u201coffline,\u201d presumably undergoing maintenance for the next season.\n\nIn a normal Fortnite season, this is pretty standard: developer Epic takes the game offline between roughly 4 and 6am to update things. I\u2019m not surprised to see there be downtime here, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ll be getting the new season so soon. But after all the waiting and social media blackout surrounding the black hole, this feels a little anticlimactic to me. Was a big \u201cblack hole death\u201d event inside us all along? I\u2019m awake at four in the damn morning, so I\u2019m going to say yes, because I need this.\n\nSome folks on Twitter are saying the new cinematic trailer played for them in the lobby, but I was unable to access that, as pressing \u201crelaunch\u201d just took me out of the game, which is currently updating. Here\u2019s what folks are seeing:\n\nHere's the cinematic trailer for #Fortnite Chapter 2 - Season 1! pic.twitter.com/6mYUWQ7bik \u2014 Fortnite News (@FortniteBR) October 15, 2019\n\nFollowing the game\u2019s big end of season event, Fortnite turned from a game of weird characters and 10-year-old teammates into a swirling black hole. It then, to the internet\u2019s collective shock, stayed that way. Confused players joined forces to decode mysterious numbers, play a hidden minigame, entertain themselves with speculation, and spend more than 35 hours staring at what basically amounts to a screensaver.\n\nAt last, we are free from the hole, and we\u2019ll be getting a new season of Fortnite. There have been hints of a new map, and a supposed leaked battle pass trailer shows possible new weapons, a new way to level up, and new things to do. We\u2019ll see what Fortnite\u2019s new world looks like when the game comes back online.\n\nUpdate: It's up:\n\nThe cinematic seen above played, and the end of it I was dropped straight into a solos game, which I have to admit was pretty cool. There is, as expected, a new map. The patch notes are up: The new season is called Chapter 2, and it features 13 new locations. There\u2019s also fishing, swimming, and boats. You can hide in haystacks and dumpsters. There\u2019s a new battle pass featuring \u201ca brand new XP system and medals you can earn in-game.\u201d In my quick first playthrough, XP appeared on the screen and I got a medal for finding a new location.\n\nThings are certainly different! I\u2019ll have more impressions as I play more.", "description": "After roughly a day and a half, Fortnite\u2019s black hole is over.
