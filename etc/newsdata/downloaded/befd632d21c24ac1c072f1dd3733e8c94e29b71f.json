(AP) \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said Thursday that it would benefit U.S. judges to study how other countries handle cases related to important global subjects such as terrorism, immigration, civil rights, health and the environment.\n\nBreyer delivered a speech and answered questions from a moderator before about 500 people at Rhodes College in Memphis as part of the school\u2019s program for Constitution Day, which took place Sept. 17. Breyer is the second sitting Supreme Court justice to speak at the private liberal arts university in recent years. Justice Antonin Scalia spoke at Rhodes in September 2015.\n\nBreyer touched on theories of globalization, versus localism or tribalism, stressing that the perception that those ideas are \u201cat war\u201d with each other is false. He cited cases related to international issues that have been heard in the U.S. because they were tied to the U.S., and U.S. laws or treaties that applied to them.\n\nThey include cases related to the internment of Japanese in U.S. camps during World War II, foreign terror suspects being held at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and a foreign commerce case with ties to Ecuador and The Netherlands. He also discussed ways legal systems have handled immigration and terrorism cases in England and Israel.\n\nBreyer said the Supreme Court is seeing an increasing number of cases in which international law comes into play.\n\n\u201cYou have to know what\u2019s going on beyond our shores in order to solve problems, statutes, constitutional interpretations, locally,\u201d Breyer said. \u201cWe are a local court. You might all think, \u2018Oh well.\u2019 Yeah, we are.\u201d\n\nHe said hundreds of bodies and organizations around the world have established laws, rules and standards that could lead to court challenges in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe more you read about this, the more you think it isn\u2019t good versus evil. It isn\u2019t somehow globalization over here, or localism or tribalism over there,\u201d Breyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are in a world where there is both.\u201d\n\nBreyer also sought to dispel a perception that perhaps the Supreme Court\u2019s liberal and conservative justices are \u201cdivided about everything.\u201d Breyer said justices don\u2019t raise their voices at each other while discussing cases. He also said they don\u2019t make snide remarks at each other\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t fight all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say zero. I can say it\u2019s more just doing your work, and quite often agreeing much more than people think.\u201d\n\nBreyer is former federal appeals court judge who was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1994.", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said Thursday that it would benefit U.S. judges to study how other countries handle cases related to important global subjects such as terrorism, immigration, civil rights, health and the environment.
