This side effect is common in children like Xander with high-risk neuroblastoma, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information.\n\nAfter his \"superhero ears\" were turned on, Xander grinned at the camera and danced around the doctor\u2019s office at the Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMelissa Bowman\n\n\"Before he got them, he was constantly asking me to repeat myself. He would get very frustrated that he couldn\u2019t hear what I was saying,\" Bowman said.\n\nShe worried if Xander would like his hearing aids because he\u2019s \"sensitive\" about his ears. But after seeing his giddy and giggly reaction, she knew that his \"whole new set of ears\" made him happy. And they still do.\n\n\"I was overjoyed. It made me feel so good that he felt that good,\" Bowman said.\n\nEven Xander\u2019s doctors have been touched by the sweet moment caught on camera by Bowman's boyfriend, Alex Pennebaker, and posted on the Sarah Cannon Cancer Network's Facebook page.\n\n\"Even after doing this for 20 years, it brought tears to my eyes \u2026 just to see his reaction was really amazing. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it,\" Dr. Jennifer Domm said.\n\nDomm works as a pediatric hematologist and oncologist at the TriStar Centennial Women and Children\u2019s Hospital in Nashville. She called Xander \"remarkable\" and said that even though his kind of cancer is \"very very difficult\" to treat, Xander brings joy to her and the other members of the medical staff.\n\nMelissa Bowman\n\n\"You would never honestly even know that he\u2019s sick, which is part of the amazing thing about Xander,\" Domm said.\n\nBut for Xander and his loved ones, things haven\u2019t always been this happy.\n\nThe last nine months have brought bout after bout of bad news for the family. He was first diagnosed with cancer at age 3 in January after experiencing \"severe\" back pain.\n\nXander started chemotherapy immediately to battle the cancer that had already spread throughout his body. He has a large tumor growing out of his upper back bone as well bone marrow disease and bone lesions in his legs, his pelvis, his spine and his skull.\n\nHis diagnosis requires long stints of intense treatment, which has been \"difficult\" for Xander, his mother and his 3-year-old-sister Olivia, who often has to be left with relatives during hospital stays.\n\nAnd so far, treatment has not worked.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t think it would ever happen to us,\" Bowman said.\n\nMelissa Bowman\n\nBowman opened up to \"GMA\" and shared that in addition to the shock of her son\u2019s sudden diagnosis, she has struggled with anxiety and panic attacks.\n\n\"There would be mornings where I would wake up, and the first thing I thought about was losing my son. I couldn\u2019t live like that anymore, so I got help,\" Bowman said.\n\nShe also told \"GMA\" that she now seeks counseling and takes medication, which has helped alleviate her fears and depression. She said that she\u2019s doing \"a lot better now.\"\n\n\"I try not to look at the future. I try to just focus on the day that we\u2019re in and enjoy everything we do together and enjoy his smile,\" Bowman said.\n\nLike Bowman, Domm said she remains \"cautiously optimistic\" for the future, and she expressed some confidence in new treatments for Xander.\n\n\"I\u2019m always hopeful, and I think we\u2019ve identified some potential new options,\" Domm said.\n\nMelissa Bowman\n\nShe offered advice to parents who hear stories like this and fear their children might suddenly develop cancer, and she cited Bowman\u2019s actions as a prime example of what to do.\n\n\"If a parent thinks that something is not right, just keep asking for answers,\" Domm said.\n\nBowman offered her own advice to parents and families currently facing similar situations with sick or suffering loved ones.\n\n\"Just know that it gets better. That it gets easier,\" Bowman.\n\nAs for Xander at the moment, Bowman said he\u2019s having a blast and acting like any other 4-year-old. He and his family are on a trip to Disney World for Xander\u2019s Make-A-Wish.\n\n\"He\u2019s got so much personality. He just remains happy through all of this. He draws people to him \u2026 he\u2019s a good little boy,\" Bowman said.", "description": "Xander Bowman lost his hearing during an intense type of chemotherapy.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/xander-bowman-01-ht-jef-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
