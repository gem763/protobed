America said it was ready to rip out the rot, and now we\u2019re ripping away. Why, then, doesn\u2019t this one feel like a win?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the Hill episode hasn\u2019t been a story merely of progress and principle; it certainly didn\u2019t begin that way. It started instead as an occasion for prurience: Katie Hill\u2019s ex, she says, handed intimate photographs over to a tabloid, which published them for the nation to consume. Hill\u2019s downfall was the result of her own misconduct, but it was also the product of revenge porn.\n\nHill\u2019s alleged affair with her congressional employee would violate a rule her colleagues passed only last year. But even the behavior she does own up to merits her exit since her campaign staffer was in a subordinate role. Everything Hill is accused of was consensual, and though that matters, it doesn\u2019t matter enough to excuse her, because employer-employee affairs present an inherent risk of coercion.\n\nThe #MeToo movement taught us that power is the problem. Its aim was to dismantle the systems that allow that power to accumulate in the hands of the people most likely to abuse it \u2014 and then allow the powerful (especially men) to abuse the less powerful (especially women) even more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis movement has succeeded, at least in part. Something has shifted, fundamentally enough that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) felt compelled after Hill\u2019s announcement to sing out about \u201ca climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u201d\n\nMen accused of worse than Hill have stuck around in high places. But Al Franken resigned, John Conyers Jr. resigned, and Katie Hill, now, is resigning.\n\nSomething else, however, hasn\u2019t even budged: the way that society is simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by female sexuality.\n\nThere have been nude and nude-ish photos of men, too, of course. Remember Anthony Weiner? Remember, more recently, Joe Barton (R-Tex.)? He decided not to seek reelection after a picture of him made the rounds on the Internet, and now commentators are holding him up like a mirror. He and Hill, they say, are the same. But the thing is, the mirror is actually doing what mirrors do: displaying the flip-side.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarton sent a woman images she said she didn\u2019t even initially ask for \u2014 then threatened to report her to the Capitol Police if she shared them. The full-frontal snapshot of the then-sexagenarian congressman that circulated most widely wasn\u2019t even fully frontal after all; his genitals were obscured, and there wasn\u2019t much else to see. Few people, it appeared, really wanted to stare at a naked old man for their own enjoyment.\n\nThen there\u2019s Hill. The congresswoman, unlike the congressmen who went before, doesn\u2019t seem to have been the one who hit the send button on the infamous \u201cthrouple\u201d photos. Her husband appears to have publicized pictures that all parties took with each other for each other\u2019s private pleasure. His motivation for spreading them, according to Hill, is nothing but spite. This is part of a tradition of jilted men charging their jilters with promiscuity. And the propaganda outlets and peeping-tom tabloids dressed up as newsmakers who helped him out have always been proud participants in this effort to weaponize women\u2019s sexuality against them.\n\nRevenge porn didn\u2019t earn the name \u201crevenge porn\u201d only because it\u2019s vengeful. It earned the name in part because, as far as many men on the receiving end are concerned, it\u2019s porny. Many men are eager to gawk at a naked young woman, which helps these images go viral: Vox points out that ordinary Internet users weren\u2019t Googling to learn what Hill did or didn\u2019t do. They were Googling to sneak a glimpse of her with another woman. Top search terms, after \u201cthrouple,\u201d included \u201cphotos\u201d and \u201cuncensored.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust as crucially, many of these same men are eager to smear a woman as a slut even as they\u2019re gawking, which also makes the images potent tools of retribution. Maybe compromising photos of a male legislator in his more vigorous years would rocket across the web, too, and were employees involved, he could surely meet his political demise as well. But he\u2019d probably earn accolades for his virility instead of attacks for his wantonness along the way.\n\nThe Hill matter isn\u2019t only about misogyny, either. It\u2019s about homophobia and a strange intersection of bigotry and fetishization. RedState\u2019s original headline sags with subtext: \u201cBisexual Rep. Katie Hill Allegedly Left Her Husband For Her (Male) Legislative Director.\u201d\n\nWe want to be able to hold up something a man does next to something a woman does and say, yes, these two things are exactly the same, and the way we will treat them is also exactly the same. Today, we aren\u2019t there. Katie Hill\u2019s resignation is what accountability looks like \u2014 but it\u2019s also what slut-shaming looks like. We can\u2019t celebrate how far we\u2019ve come when we got there by walking backward.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "This is what slut-shaming looks like", "authors": ["Molly Roberts", "Editorial Writer Covering Technology", "Editorial Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y_BIX47B_LmLNwhPzdvrhwpm7wA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ASUG5XZBYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
