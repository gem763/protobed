He was arrested Wednesday morning upon his arrival for work.\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr. Frese with two counts of willful transmission of national defense material. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count.\n\nOne of the journalists who allegedly received the confidential materials from Mr. Frese appeared to be involved in a romantic relationship with him, the Justice Department said. The pair shared an address for about a year and appeared in each other\u2019s social media posts, department officials said.\n\nThat reporter wrote at least eight articles based on five top secret intelligence reports leaked by Mr. Frese, according to a criminal indictment. Mr. Frese retweeted the link to an article based on information he leaked to her prosecutors said.\n\nA week after Mr. Frese allegedly leaked one of the intelligence reports, the journalist sent him a direct message on Twitter asking if he would speak to another journalist, court documents disclosed.\n\nMr. Frese told the reporter he would help her colleague.\n\nOn September 24, 2019, FBI surveillance caught him transmitting national defense material to the second reporter through his cell phone, according to the indictment.\n\nThe two journalists have not been charged with a crime. Speaking with reporters Wednesday, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger declined to say if he intended to file charges against the journalists.\n\n\u201cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people \u2014 a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
