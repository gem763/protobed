Ireland would then need any sort of victory in their final game against Samoa on Saturday - or even a bonus point should they lose - to join them, with Scotland eliminated.\n\nIf the news is confirmed it would be the first time a World Cup match has been cancelled.\n\nThe 1995 semi-final between hosts South Africa and France was delayed an hour due to a waterlogged pitch, but famously went ahead after cleaning ladies took to it with brooms.", "description": "Rugby World Cup organisers are expected to announce on Thursday that England's game against France on Saturday has been cancelled and that Sunday's game between Japan and Scotland is in doubt, because of the potential impact of Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439061960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9901C", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
