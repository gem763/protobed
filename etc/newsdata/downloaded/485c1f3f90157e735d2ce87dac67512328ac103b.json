I've national intelligence but we're getting our first look at the original whistle blower complaint that set all of this into motion a person inside the government. Their first sounded alarms about president trumps phone call with Ukrainian president here's what it says it's. On page one of the complaint it says in the course of my official duties the whistleblower rights. I received information from multiple US government officials the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country. And that's point one election this interference includes among other things pressuring a foreign country to investigate the president's main domestic political rivals. The president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is a central figure. Attorney general Barr appears to be involved is well in moments ago in this blockbuster hearing on Capitol Hill the Director of National Intelligence who received that complaint. Was asked what she thinks about the whistle blower and what he had to say take a look. Inspector general said this was urgent no in this that stirred meaning this was urgent as everyone understands that term can we. Agree. That it was urgent. Air wish urgent. And important. You don't believe the whistle blowers a political hack it to you director. I believe that yes I said before mister chairman. I believe the whistle blow apart it is our operating in good shape as well than they had a smile and the law they couldn't be in good faith that they were. Acting as a political pact could day. Mr. chairman my job is to support and leave the entire intelligence community. That individual. Works for me therefore it is my job to make sure that I support and defend that person. You don't have any reason to accuse them of disloyalty to our country or suggests or beholden to some other country are you. Sir it. Absolutely not. I believe that the whistle blower followed the steps every step of the way however the statute was wind in this situation. Involving the president of the United States who is not in the intelligence community or matters underneath my supervision. Did not meet the criteria for urgent concern I'm to assess him the whistle blower right now I think the whistle blow it did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way. Where else the poor in this hearing was to establish the credibility. Of the whistle floor we heard the the and I appointed by Donald Trump finds this credible Charlie and historic and breathtaking cheering in my opinion because at its core. Congress is investigating. A whistle blower this pointing fingers and lobbying allegations. Not act some staffer. At in the intelligence community not as an undersecretary but a whistle blower lobbying allegations at the commander in cheat. And so many of those process questions that Democrats were getting at. Dealt with just how difficult it is to understand how even to go forward with allegations from whistle blower. That deal with the president you saw there Adam Schiff the chairman basically implying that he thought it was an appropriate. That the McGwire went back. Back to the White House to ask questions of executive privilege. But he's come a wider basically say he didn't know what else to do built this dealt with the president and the president in his opinion might have wanted to exert executive privilege. Who is this person who is the whistle blower this person remains anonymous but we do you know something's. From today's report let's put up a graphic of what we do you know this from today's whistle blower complaint we know this is someone who was an employee of the intelligence community. Someone who by his own admission or her own admission is not a direct witness to the conduct here. I somebody who says more than half a dozen US officials have informed me of various facts related. To me in the course of official business within the administration. And the inspector general writes today about this person that. He did show some indeed in to see an arguable political bias but that that bias did not. Affect his determination that this is credible on Pierre Thomas or Chief Justice correspondent. He's been following all this that is a significant. An admission on the part of Indian I appear that that this person is credible deserves to be protected. And came forward and away all the counter to president trump calling this guy treasonous. DeVon just think about what we have here essentially the whistle blower is in intelligence community official. Who is saying that he or she got information directly from people. Who were part of the executive branch and it all these people express very levels of concern about actions being taken. By the president of the United States and White House attorneys. The accounts that. Is described to the whistle blower. Almost exactly matches the account in terms of the conversation between the president of the United States. And the Ukrainian president. And this is additional detail again that White House officials including some attorneys were. Apparently uncomfortable with the nature of the conversation and actually move deet tails. Of that conversation two or more secret and Covert computer system. So this opens the door for documents requests this opens the door for congressional investigators are trying to talk to additional witnesses. It's a fascinating situation again where the whistle blower. Is serving almost as a reporter. And getting this information in the due course of their official business as a member of the executive branch. It's an extraordinary reed period Pierre Thomas think he's so much nine pages said dated August 12 addressed to the chairman. The Republican and Democrat of both Intelligence Committees in congress we have it posted an ABC news. I dot com C you can read it for yourself a lot of this is the. Is corroborated. By the transcript in the rough transcript the president put out yesterday and also. Let's bring in Tanya Imus and his he's over in Kiev flew over their very quickly as the story was breaking. Tom you're also hearing that other aspects. Of the whistle Gore's complaint are have been corroborated by Ukrainian officials. Yeah that's right those were part of the whistle blower complaint that really stood out to is here in Kiet and and that was a section that net written in part. Multiple US officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the president. And president is a list he would depend on whether saloons he showed willingness to play ball now from what we understand play ball in this issue. May possibly talking about investigations. Here in the Ukraine. Now we heard from a former advisor to the current Ukrainian president who worked during the campaign and transition who tells us it was his understanding it was widespread knowledge here. That to get a meeting rural phone call with president trump. The audience had to be discussed as a sort of known as as one of the ground rules the first to get that meeting between Ukrainian president. And president trump and we're now seeing this in the whistle blower complaint. We're also learning that Rudy Giuliani has spoken or met with at least why former or current Ukrainian officials. We've spoken to choose so far Victor Shogun who was the prosecutor the vice president supply and demand he fired. Sort of at the center bought this controversy. He tells us he spoke to Giuliani he reached out to them and they did speak about the bodies we actually just spoke to another Ukrainian diplomat just today. Who Giuliani spoke with. And he tells us Rudy Giuliani wanted to know what the process would be to re open investigations. Here in the Ukraine obviously we Giuliani's work on the behalf of the president he's trying to. Sort of what information he can't two's thriller the process here in Ukraine at least I support the legal. System's concerned Evan. Yes something of a freelance diplomat someone who doesn't hold an official position into the president's personal attorney extraordinary in its own right Tommy on this. From Ukraine and hearsay on the story Tom thank you so much. For sticking around here let's go to the White House now see with the president has to say about this testimony from his DNI he's on his way back. To DC from New York Karen Travers are White House correspondent been tracking him Karen so far looks like on the Twitter front at least the president doesn't have an immediate reaction. To the. He's been quoting people he's clearly watching some television cable news this morning DeVon including people who've been defending him in the wake of this whistle blower complaint being released. The Press Secretary Stephanie Gresham released a statement saying nothing has changed since that complaint was released publicly. Saying it's all got cobbled together a third hand accounts of events. Questions here and not just about. The president's phone call with the president of Ukraine but the process here. I think it was striking to see so many occasions in that whistle blower complaint where the whistle blowers said that it was White House officials giving them that information multiple White House officials. And and that is going to set off quite a frenzy here in the administration because the president over the last two and a half years of course has been very focused. On what he refers to as the deep state this sub level of officials may carry overs from the previous administration who he believes. Are out to get him and now to see it in black and white that there are people with in the president's team who were talking to this whistle blower sharing their concerns about how this transcript was taken from one place put somewhere else to protected because of the politically sensitive nature of it. That I think we'll just set off had fewer thought about a week's time a witch hunt here to figure out who this is that was behind this what White House officials we're talking. And sharing this information. Yet this document Karen lays out so many people involved in that these episodes it wasn't just one person misses and a rogue actor there are a lot of White House officials Karen Travers at the wettest think he's so much. And Jack. As Karen alluded to there and is in the report. This isn't the first time allegedly that the White House has tried to hide some of these transcripts. And keep them out of public view. Righted if it appears that you know this whistle blower that suggested that that he injured it's not the first time that transcription materials were. Removed from the normal flow of information. To a more secure a separate system a compartment it. System. It's hit because they might be potentially politically sensitive. According to whistle blower. He suggested or she suggested that the materials more of a national security concerns but about political concern. But it raises all kinds of issues of the executives and finance wide latitude to handle information as they see fit. It in so. You know while it kind of has a whiff of may be trying to hide things or cover things up. These are also has that authority so they eat eat it depends on where you're standing there. And he's gonna take a lot more questions the DN I he's just arrived at the Senate Intelligence Committee and the committee up on Capitol Hill. A we're senators now get a chance to question him that's behind closed doors meanwhile. The House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff of California who just held the hearing you watch journey BC news riders taking questions. Let's listen in. Because what this whistle blowers said about the nature of that call has been borne out in great detail by the call record. That has now been released so and a very substantial part. This whistle blower has already. Been found to be credible. Whether the other allegations that go beyond this specific hall will be borne out. Has yet to be determined and that will be the subject of our investigation this was some lore has given us a road map. For our investigation but it's important to underscore that. What we are able to cry operate already about the whistle blower has been corroborated. In detail by this record of the president's conversation with the president of Ukraine. That gives added weight and urgency to the need to get to the bottom of the other allegations that are made by the possible. And once again I want to express my profound gratitude. To whistle blower for coming forward and I'm grateful for the director. For coming to the committee. For not requiring us to use a portion yes he's. We provided to simply subpoena but nonetheless became before our committee. And he came before the committee voluntarily. And while I believe that he has made the wrong decision with holding the complaint like my colleagues. I respect his service to the country. But we are profoundly concerned with the breakdown of this whistle blower system. That has been manifest over the last month that a whistle blower who was deemed credible that a complaint that was deemed urgent. That a complaint that was intended to come to congress would be withheld the congress and would do so on the basis. Would be withheld on the basis. Of advice given by the subject. Or subjects of that complaint. The conflict of interest is all too apparent all too palpable. It is indeed a minor miracle that we got the complain at all and that we got the transcripts of all. At the end of the day. What is alleged in this whistle blower complaint goes to the very heart of the president's oath of office. That he faithfully execute the laws of the country that he defend the constitution. And if as alleged if as this. Record of Paul already indicates the president was. Instead. Of faithfully executing his office was using that office. As leverage. To obtain dirt. Have another country manufacture dirt on his opponent. It is hard to measure more fundamental. Abuse of that office. And so we are determined to get to the bottom of this and I'm happy to respond to the miss. The loss beating it was a blur when your next investigative steps were targets emerge from reading this plan from here today. You're doing what's the timeline in which are. This begins Friday night. We'll be working through the recess and as I mentioned I think the complaint gives us a pretty good road map of allegations that we need to investigate there is a whole host of people apparently who have knowledge of these events. That the whistle blower makes reference to now we don't know. How many or any. Of them that have already been interviewed by the inspector general we will be having a subsequent hearing with the inspector general which we have requested. So that we can determine. What he was able to find in this preliminary investigation he only fourteen days to do it. But it looks like he did a far more substantial investigation and an even the Justice Department was apparently willing to do. And so. We will see what witnesses have been interviewed in which happened and we'll do our best to identify those will obviously going to be bringing the whistle blower in. And I was pleased that the director committed to. To have in the whistle blower a menace whose insurance issues are resolved with a whistle blowers council and that the we have the commitment of the Director of National Intelligence that there will not be some reminder from the White House or the Department of Justice or anywhere else. That is instructing him what he can and cannot. And sir what she can or cannot answer. That further testimony will help identify hope some of these other individuals I can corroborate these deeply troubling allegations. We also want to determine what the documentary. Evidence is. We need to look into the allegation that this may not be the only communication. Of a potentially corrupt character that was shielded by this. Classified information computer system. Abuse for that purpose. We want to know what role Rudy Giuliani had in all of this we want to know what role bill Barr had in any of this. We want to know what Ukraine understood. Was expected of them before they even had this July phone call with the president nine states so. We know what we have to do and of course will be guided by the evidence we find along the check. And that was ABC's Ben Siegel asking the question there of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff sane his next steps in this effort now. Are to assemble a list of witnesses documents. Other potential calls and transcription the president that may have been squirreled away in different places Jack. All of these people now we understand will be treated as whistle blowers as well all the people involved in this. Potentially you know assist the chairman said. He's got a road map and out of work on. You know to to to sort of untangle. All of this information I mean that as that the united. He wants this to speak for itself this complaint to speak perks up and it says a lot. And you know more than a dozen direct witnesses that it was a blow himself cites the maybe a dozen people who were on that call it. Who knows what else is gonna come of this when you realize what happened with Ukraine policy and whether people were doing things in pulling levers. You you're in response to what happened in this call. And whether there's an effort to then undo some of that. Yeah we just don't know the answers these questions clearly the committee his interest in finding out. In so many the American people marry Alice are trying to digest that some this hurricane of information that's come the past 24 hours. Morning leapt to keep things you are observing about this moment and how quickly this impeachment push came together is. But this is very digestible to people this episode to seeing you were saying that Democrats can in many ways cell. Perhaps more clearly than they quote a sprawling two year investigation. Into Russia. Yes I think this line in a whistle blower complaint where there was a lower wrote. I am concerned of the actions pose a risk to national security and undermine the US government's efforts to deter or counter foreign interference. Fundamentally Nancy Pelosi thinks that her members can also make that case speaks specially in purple and swing states that in this one instance it's true that the president who has. Was putting pressure foreign leader to get dirt on a political opponent hit back is a matter of national security and that in boaters and got its. They walked into the symbolic well we heard from the director national himself today say that his chief concern in protecting this country. Is protecting our democracy from foreign interference it's exactly the thing the president appears to be asking one of these calls. There is going to be a debate over whether or not this call what the president said on this call whether or not there was in their quid pro quo amounted to some sort of election. Interference we know Mike Levine our justice reporter joins us as well now. The Justice Department looked at this it was at the center of today's hearing my. They are determination was that this wasn't quantifiable. You couldn't. I'm in this presidential conversation may be related to the election maybe you did Watson help looking into Joseph Biden but it was difficult to. Quantify that is an illegal contribution. Right this is going to be some sort of debate here over semantics in the legal terms of what amounts to it an illegal camp. Pain contribution. Yes and Democrats they were clearly trying to make hay of the fact that it was the Justice Department that made this decision because. The Justice Department is led by of course by attorney general Barr who is implicated they said in this entire case. So when this went to the Justice Department they basically they looked at it may decide that the investigation should not continue. It there. And the president thinks might the president just go now weighing in on today's testimony let's put up the tweet as he's. I now boarded Air Force One back to Washington DC the president addresses the whistle blower says. This was a war with second hand information another fake news story see what was said on the very nice no pressure call another witch hunt. Little fact check here Jack got tape the whistle blower information. Was second hand he admits that in the letter. Arm but the DN I today DIG the inspector general looked at all this they talked to dozens of other people who had firsthand knowledge. And there was a lot of alignment there he said this is credible. But one heap only leaves look at the transcript of the call that helped president authorized release that's first and information that it seems to line up. With the whistle blowers account and Republicans. Graham Mullen repeatedly. Democrats asked the he thought that the determination from the IG at this is credible. Unless something he will understand I he complemented. The AG he says it was lord did the right thing. I'd rather is a really interesting exchange actually with representative Jackie spear from California. For she took the president's own words to me Deanna I McGwire and asked him if he should defend it was alerts sent out. We might have. The president on Monday sad. Also who is this so called whistle blower. Who who knows the correct facts is he on our country's side. Do you believe the whistle blower is on our country's side. I believe that the whistle blower and all employees who go forward in the eyes she IG to raise concerns or fraud waste and abuse. Are doing what they perceived to be. The right things so working on behalf of our country. Are you aware of the fact that whistle blowers within the federal government have identified waste fraud and abuse. Of over 59 billion dollars. That has had the effect of benefiting the taxpayers. And keeping our country safe as well. Congresswoman I'm not familiar with the dollar value but having been and the government service for nearly 4 decades I am very much aware of the value. A thank you or program I ask you one final question. Did the president the United States ask you to find out the identity of the whistle blower. I can say although I would not normally discuss my conversations with the president I can tell you emphatically. No. So much into the White House's response all of this is going to be to start to smear the whistle blower the president hitting it that on Twitter on Twitter. Michael Meehan so whether it's Mike it's can you talk at all about what sort of protections got to go into keeping these whistle blower safe and anonymous. Or is it. Is it likely that we're gonna have find out who this person is. I mean the way there's happens I'm sure at some point down the road that will learn who this whistle blowers. But I think from a hearing today it's important to realize how much the Democrats tried to establish the credibility. Of the whistle blower. The chairman shift one of the first questions he asked to. Any press to the and I think that they may have been taking a page from what happened with the Muller investigation. The questions they had a lot to do with process our process has power remember during the Mueller investigation some of the attacks on Mueller himself. Had to do with whether he was properly vetted her render the FBI followed proper procedures in process so I think Democrats were trying to deal with that today. And I worst not just Democrats Republicans trying to put their minds are on this as well sir you see some cracks in the armor. Are Republicans who largely stayed close to the president today at senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin saying he might be concerned about some of the cover up of this transcript. Also heard a couple Republicans in the committee let's listen to them. I've read the complaint. And I have read the transcript of the conversation with the president and the president of the U crane. Concerning that conversation I wanna say. The president this is not okay. It isn't that the conversation is not okay. I greatly appreciate your statement that you believe the whistle blower is operating in good faith I think that's very important. For Americans to hear. Those are. Since you didn't winds have Republicans defends. The words in that transcript was released yesterday instead they lodge some allegations back into a similar tried on occasion to crack at his or her credibility. But use our right there Mike Turner from Ohio CNN when he read in that transcript. He engineered that the united bout. Also to protect that whistle blowers identity do support him the protections that the whistle blower has under the law. And this is going to be a risky area for the White House the for the president's allies that they want to attack this person. They may run afoul of the law. To work we go from here guys we have had this blockbuster testimony congress. Is set to leave town now for a couple of weeks he can. Here on recess and they built all of us in the men's and they've got all this media attention Democrats. Their ounce and now they're gonna go away but what what's the most step. We'll see there's been some rumblings in the further from left progressive wing of the Democratic Caucus urging speaker close AT and cancel recess. There's a lot and think that they do you have momentum right now and he should stay in town and then behind the scenes are telling the speaker that much. I think speaker Pelosi is still gonna half to define the scope of the impeachment inquiry right now there are six chairmen that are tacit continuing their work. And that could get really nasty. Again there some Democrats in her caucus and are urging her to be very explicit. Why should they go after who is in charge and what is the ramifications. Spoke meg sure. And impeachment inquiry that's different from past investigations were invented in the summer. And meantime Jack there's also some indication here very briefly that they could be starting to look at other phone calls the president may have had with China and other co. Yeah I'm so that opens up other cans of worms and end. You know maybe that's how a lot of times gonna get occupied during the recess in terms of you know whether or not those are going to be problematic and you know it's not just congress it's going to be looking visas have reporters like us are going to be looking at these things as well and if information. Comes out through other channels. It's if this child is in the water I. I'm getting just every gamer now our Chief Justice or producer Jack Johnson think you so much Carol sparks deputy political director of thanks to Michael Weiner senior.
