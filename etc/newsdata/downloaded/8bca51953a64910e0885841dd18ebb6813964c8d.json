If approved, any telecom networks that currently use subsidies from the Universal Service Fund to purchase equipment would not be allowed to use the funding to purchase any company \u201cthat poses a national security risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concern is that hostile foreign actors could use hidden \u2018backdoors\u2019 to our networks to spy on us, steal from us, harm us with malware and viruses, or otherwise exploit our networks,\u201d Pai said on Monday. \u201cAnd there are mounting reasons to believe that the Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE pose an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPai\u2019s proposal would also compel the government to examine whether Chinese telecom equipment that is already deployed in USF-funded networks should be removed and replaced, which is a costly process that The Verge previously reported could hurt rural providers. In a further notice of proposed rulemaking, Pai\u2019s proposal asks for comment from stakeholders over how the FCC could financially assist these carriers who may be required to rip out Chinese equipment.\n\nThe vote will take place at the FCC\u2019s Open Meeting on November 19th.", "description": "The proposal comes as politicians on Capitol Hill continue to scrutinize American companies that do business in China, like Activision Blizzard and the National Basketball Association.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVqbJx3yvdCdNr39v-FurxqiVmo=/0x359:5019x2987/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16277445/1147617670.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
