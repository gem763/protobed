US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said such actions would mark a \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office\u201d and declared, \u201cNo one is above the law\" when announcing the inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry sets up the party\u2019s most direct and consequential confrontation with the president, injects deep uncertainty into the 2020 election campaign and tests anew the nation\u2019s constitutional system of checks and balances.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

In order to make educated inferences, it's important to go back to the beginning of the scandal that got us here in the first place:\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe straw that seems to have broken the camel\u2019s back was a phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr Trump reportedly ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400m (\u00a3323.7m) in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call, in which he seemingly urged the Eastern European nation\u2019s leader to investigate Mr Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nA memorandum the White House released on Wednesday from the call showed Mr Trump calling on Mr Zelensky to look into the matter, in which no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens has been found.\n\n\u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d Mr Trump said on the phone call, according to the memorandum. \u201cWe spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it\u2019s something that should really ask them about.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In a highly polarised Congress, an impeachment inquiry could simply showcase how clearly two sides can disagree when shown the same evidence rather than approach consensus.\n\nMoreover, a two-thirds majority of the Senate would have to vote in favour of removing the president in order to have him ousted by an impeachment vote. So far, it does not appear likely the Republican majority will abandon Mr Trump.\n\nBuilding towards this moment, the president has repeatedly been stonewalling requests for documents and witness interviews in the variety of ongoing investigations.\n\nAfter Ms Pelosi\u2019s announcement, the president and his campaign team quickly released a series of tweets attacking Democrats, including a video of presidential critics like the speaker and Democrat Ilhan Omar discussing impeachment. It concluded: \u201cWhile Democrats \u2018Sole Focus\u2019 is fighting Trump, President Trump is fighting for you.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Ms Pelosi\u2019s well-known \u201cefforts to restrain her far-left conference have finally crumbled.\u201d\n\nWhat needs to be done to get Republicans to join in on impeachment?\n\nThere are two possibilities for this to happen. The first depends on attitudes from Republican voters.\n\nIf Republican voters end up turning on Mr Trump, it is likely for the GOP\u2014who are eager to keep their seats in Congress after their shackling in 2018\u2014will follow suit.\n\nThe other possibility, according to some political theorists, is that Republicans could view Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment as an opportunity to get the president they wanted all along: Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCan Mr Trump face jail time?\n\nThe Justice Department has taken the position that a sitting president cannot be indicted or prosecuted. But Mr Trump's fate could change if he is successfully impeached from office, or if prosecution begins after he serves his tenure in the White House.\n\nCalifornia Congressman Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said that Mr Trump \u201cmay be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time\u201d, saying it could be the case the Justice Department's decision to indict Mr Trump once he leaves office.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen \u201cacted in coordination with and at the direction of\u201d the president before his election to silence two women\u2014Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal\u2014about their alleged affairs with the former reality TV star.\n\nWhat would a Mike Pence administration look like?\n\nThere are stark differences in the way Mr Trump and Mr Pence handle political business. First, Mr Pence takes more of a traditionalist approach in communicating with the American people. Unlike Mr Trump, Americans probably won\u2019t see Mr Pence tweeting out threats against world leaders or insults towards the press in the middle of the night.\n\nWhen it comes to reproductive rights and women\u2019s healthcare, Mr Pence is likely to vow overturning landmark Roe v. Wade and might champion the GOP agenda to defund Planned Parenthood. During his tenure as an Indiana congressional representative, Mr Pence made a name for himself through his stalwart commitment to reducing government spending. In 2003, Mr Pence fought \u201ctooth and nail and led GOP caucus members\u201d to prevent a prescription drug entitlement from being added to Medicare\u2014proving that the vice president is willing to take on his own political party for limited government.\n\nEssentially, Mr Pence is married to the concepts of limited government, deregulations, shrinking government and returning the powers to the states. His critics say one thing for certain: a Pence presidency could mean bad news for Medicare, women\u2019s reproductive rights, civil rights, public education and climate change.\n\nCan the president simply say, \u2018You can\u2019t fire me! I quit!\n\nThat's a possibility. Former President Richard Nixon took that route when he resigned from the Oval Office in August 1974. Historians believe that if Mr Nixon would have not resigned, he would have been impeached and removed from office.\n\nSome legal experts believe Mr Trump could take a page out of Mr Nixon\u2019s playbook. California Congresswoman Jackie Speier\u2014a Democrat sitting on the House permanent select committee on intelligence\u2014reportedly said that based on the growing evidence on the Trump campaign\u2019s ties with Russia, she believes he might resign before impeachment.\n\n\u201cI have always thought that he was never going to fulfil his full term,\u201d Ms Speier said. \u201cI am more convinced that he will leave before any impeachment would take place.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "After nearly three years, countless investigations, damning public testimonies and an explosive scandal to yet again rock Capitol Hill, the US House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta", "Sarah Harvard"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/18/trump-impeach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
