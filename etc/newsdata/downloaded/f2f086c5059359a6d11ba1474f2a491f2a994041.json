Duke, and recording my voice, is one of the most fun things I get to do in the business, I would be happy to to participate in another one.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a great group of people. It\u2019s a great cast, it\u2019s a great company. So of course, I would love to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do [about a sequel]. I haven\u2019t heard anything yet. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re talking about whether they want to do another one or not.\n\nEric reprised his role as shaggy dog Duke in Secret Life Of Pets 2 (Picture: Universal)\n\n\u2018That would be great. People love the characters, and they love the movie. And if there\u2019s a desire for more content, I would be excited to be part of it.\u2019\n\nAnd he has some huge names in mind for the third outing \u2013 including his Modern Family co-stars.\n\nSo who would he love to see joining Max (Patton Oswalt), Duke and the gang?\n\n\u2018Maybe my co-star Sofia Vergara would be good as a dog? She would be great,\u2019 he told us.\n\nEric wants Modern Family co-star Sofia in Secret Life Of Pets (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018John Goodman as well. Maybe we could find Duke\u2019s dad, and John Goodman could voice Duke\u2019s dad.\u2019\n\nSecret Life Of Pets 3 is basically writing itself.\n\nOn top of all this, Eric would also love to do a SLOP spin-off with Snowball star Kevin Hart \u2013 and we absolutely need this to happen.\n\n\u2018Well, I would definitely love a spin off. I think Kevin would be very, very upset about that,\u2019 he joked.\n\nCould we be blessed with a Snowball spin-off? (Picture: Universal)\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a fun guy to play with. I would love to do more in the franchise, for sure.\u2019\n\nCount us in.\n\nDespite the animated film being marketed for kids, there\u2019s no doubt that adults have also been getting in on the action, with both the first and second film being loved by all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Eric teased there might have been a few jokes that definitely weren\u2019t suitable for the final cut\u2026\n\nDiscussing any possible X-rated moments, he added: \u2018I mean, once you put a bunch of comedians in a recording booth and just tell them to start talking, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to inevitably end up with a lot of unsuitable, yet funny stuff.\n\n\u2018[We\u2019re] making movies for kids, and we\u2019re making movies for families, so you have to stay on that line.\n\n\u2018I think everyone is really conscious and careful of that, but there\u2019s just no doubt that if you put Kevin Hart in sound booth or whomever, you\u2019re going to get a lot of interesting things that may not [make the cut].\u2019\n\nPetition for a blooper reel, anyone?!\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets 2 is available now on DVD, Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD and Digital Download from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
