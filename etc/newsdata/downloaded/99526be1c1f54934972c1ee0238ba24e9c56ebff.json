That remains the ultimate target.\n\nUntil then, he landed a big one in Japan.\n\nWoods was coming off a two-month break that began with a fifth surgery on his left knee, this one to repair minor cartilage damage. He opened his new season with three straight bogeys, and then followed with 27 birdies to win the Zozo Championship by three shots. It was his 82nd career victory, tying the record Sam Snead established in 1965, 10 years before Woods was born.\n\nThat\u2019s three victories in 13 months, and no indication it will be the last one.\n\n\u201cThe ball-striking exhibition I\u2019ve seen the last two days is a joke,\u201d said U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland, who played the final two rounds with Woods on a rain-soaked course northeast of Tokyo. \u201cI don\u2019t see him stopping anytime soon. Eighty-two is pretty special. I think there\u2019s a lot more in store.\u201d\n\nExpect plenty of debate until Woods makes it 83 and has the record to himself.\n\nSnead always argued he won more than 82 times during his seemingly ageless career that stretched across three decades. He also has team events, like the Inverness Four-Ball Invitational, counted among his official tally.\n\nThe PGA of America ran tournament golf in Snead\u2019s time and there wasn\u2019t a standard tour schedule like there is now. The PGA Tour researched the records and settled on 82 wins for Snead. Whatever arguments are made, that\u2019s the official mark.\n\nThat\u2019s what Woods matched, an astonishing feat considering the litany of obstacles he has faced \u2014 five surgeries on his knee, four surgeries on his back, the embarrassment of being caught in a personal scandal that cost him his marriage and universal corporate support, a mug shot from his DUI arrest two years ago when he mixed pain medications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to dig my way out of it and figure out a way,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThere are some hard times trying to figure it out, but I\u2019ve come back with different games over the years, moving patterns, and this one\u2019s been obviously the most challenging.\u201d\n\nWoods has been linked with Nicklaus his entire career. He has been mentioned alongside Byron Nelson, not only for breaking his record for consecutive cuts, but for twice getting at least halfway to Nelson\u2019s unthinkable 11 straight victories. Woods reached seven in a row on the PGA Tour through 2006 at Torrey Pines.\n\nBut the better measure of his greatness is not the legends Woods is chasing.\n\nIt\u2019s the players he is beating.\n\nGenerations are tough to compare even with simple numbers like 18 and 82. The game, the courses, the equipment, everything evolves. No one will ever know how Woods stacked up against Snead, Nelson, Ben Hogan or Bobby Jones. No one can say how Nicklaus would fare against today\u2019s generation.\n\nWhat made Snead\u2019s record 82 victories even more impressive than the number alone was that no one else was close to him. When he won the last of his official victories at the Greater Greensboro Open in 1965, only two other players had more than 50 career wins \u2014 Hogan (64) and Nelson (52).\n\nWoods now has 82 victories.\n\nThat\u2019s more than Phil Mickelson (44) and Vijay Singh (34) combined. The other Hall of Famer from his generation is Ernie Els, who traveled and won worldwide but has 19 victories on the PGA Tour.\n\nThey all had access to the same game. Woods played better than anyone imagined.\n\nEven after going through so many injuries that led to Woods going five years without a victory, his winning rate is still 22.8%. That\u2019s the highest ever for the PGA Tour with a minimum of 200 tournaments. Hogan is next at 21.3%, followed by Nelson at 18.1%. Nicklaus is sixth at 12.2%.\n\nDustin Johnson, the winningest player of this generation, with 20 PGA Tour titles, has a winning rate of 7.7%.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan was in Japan and could only think, \u201cWow,\u201d when he considered what Woods had done \u2014 and if it will ever be seen again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a never-say-never kind of person, but you start looking back \u2014 the longevity, the consistency, what goes into it,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cYou start looking at some of the underlying elements like the 142 consecutive cuts, the seven tournaments that he won five times or more, 11-time Player of the Year, all the stuff that you\u2019ve documented.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to imagine anybody doing that again.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Woods now has 82 victories.
