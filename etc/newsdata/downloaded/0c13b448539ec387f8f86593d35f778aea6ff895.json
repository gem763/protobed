The wheels are moving for that so they want to make it into a film which is just amazing.\n\n'I didn't imagine that that would happen so it's a dream come true really.'\n\nWith the chance to see their love story immortalised on the big screen, Christine asked Zoe and Mark - who are known as the 'Love Train' couple - who they would like to play them.\n\n'Well, we've talked about it and we were thinking Jenna Coleman and Tom Hughes might be quite nice,' Mark commented.\n\n'We quite like Victoria,' Zoe added to explain why they had settled on the British actress and actor.\n\n'She's a lovely English rose and he's got that smouldering train man thing that I think would suit, but who knows?'\n\nZoe revealed that she would like to see Victoria star Jenna Coleman portray her in the big screen adaptation\n\nSticking with the Victoria theme, Zoe revealed that Tom Hughes would be a good fit to play Mark in the movie\n\nDuring the interview, both Zoe and Mark recalled how each of them felt on that fateful day when their first connection was made.\n\n'I was just nervous. I wouldn't normally go up to someone on a train and ask them out. He was a handsome guy and I just didn't think he would be interested so it kind of took me that long to steal my nerves to be able to do it,' Zoe explained.\n\nUpon receiving the note, Mark revealed that he was initially 'confused' by Zoe's actions.\n\n'I turned around and looked up and Zoe was standing there holding the note out for me. It was a quiet commuter train where nobody talks.\n\n'By the time I had taken the note and unfolded it an read it, Zoe was down the carriage hiding.\n\n'It was quite confusing at first but then I kind of guessed what it was by the time I opened it.'\n\nZoe described Jenna as an 'English rose' and Tom as 'smouldering'\n\nThe couple both recalled how each of them felt on that day in 2003 when Zoe handed Mark a note asking him out\n\nZoe and Mark went on to marry and have two sons\n\nDespite his initial reaction, Mark added that the note put a smile on his face for the whole day.\n\n'It was really flattering and a lovely thing to happen. It brightened up my day and put a spring in my step.'\n\nHowever, the love story took a while to get going as eight months passed before Mark got in touch with Zoe to ask her out for a drink.\n\n'I was in a relationship at the time so I knew I wasn't going to act on it but then that relationship broke down,' Mark said.\n\n'I broke up with my then girlfriend three months later and then it was eight months [before I contacted Zoe]'\n\nDuring their appearance on Lorraine, Zoe talked about the possibility of there being a third book\n\nContinuing the story, Zoe added: 'I got an email out of the blue. I didn't expect it and it said, do you still fancy going for that drink? It was unbelievable.'\n\nHaving received acclaim for her first book 'The Note', Zoe went on to write another novel, 'The Postcard'.\n\nBut this time, it was more fiction than fact.\n\n'I like to call it faction,' Zoe joked before adding: 'The first book did really well so my publisher asked for a sequel and people have resonated with it well.'\n\nOn the possibility of a third book, Zoe added: 'I've left it quite open at the end of The Postcard so there is scope for that.'", "description": "Zo\u00eb Folbigg, from Hertfordshire, appeared on Lorraine alongside husband Mark, whom she met during her commute to work in 2003 to reveal a production company has bought rights to their story.", "authors": ["Deepika Rajani For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/10/20076734-0-image-a-29_1571823964954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
