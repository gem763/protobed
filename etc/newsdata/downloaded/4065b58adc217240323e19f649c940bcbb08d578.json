The company sent out an email to customers in Venezuela today to let them know their accounts would be deactivated, and posted a support document further explaining the decision.\n\nIn the document, Adobe explains: \u201cThe U.S. Government issued Executive Order 13884, the practical effect of which is to prohibit almost all transactions and services between U.S. companies, entities, and individuals in Venezuela. To remain compliant with this order, Adobe is deactivating all accounts in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nUsers will have until October 28th to download any content stored in their accounts, and will lose access the next day. To make matters worse, customers won\u2019t be able to receive refunds for any purchases or outstanding subscriptions, as Adobe says that the executive order calls for \u201cthe cessation of all activity with the entities including no sales, service, support, refunds, credits, etc.\u201d\n\nWell, is officially illegal has an Adobe products if you live in Venezuela pic.twitter.com/25zgaUIyqF \u2014 Aender Lara (@AenderLara) October 7, 2019\n\nThe news is not only disastrous to designers and freelancers who rely on the company\u2019s software like Photoshop and Illustrator, but to NGOs and media outlets that will no longer be able to use software like InDesign, Acrobat, and Reader. The ban will also affect all free services like Behance, Adobe\u2019s portfolio site, which requires a Creative Cloud account.\n\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation that highlights a downside of Adobe\u2019s subscription-based model \u2014 users lose access to the company\u2019s products immediately as soon as the option to pay for them is removed, no matter how long they\u2019ve been a customer. Adobe says it\u2019ll continue to monitor the US sanctions for more developments, but until then, accounts will remain deactivated.\n\nWhen reached for comment, an Adobe spokesperson provided this comment to The Verge: \u201cDue to the recent Executive Order (Executive Order 13884) regarding \u2018blocking\u2019 select activities with the Government of Venezuela, Adobe is currently evaluating our existing partnerships and agreements with individuals and organizations subject to the rule to ensure we remain compliant. Adobe will continue customer and partner support activities permitted under the Executive Order but will pause all activities which are not permitted. We regret any inconvenience this may cause to customers, as we continue to carefully monitor and assess the situation. We will share more details as to how our operations and customer activities might be impacted, as those details become available.\u201d\n\nAbout @Adobe\n\n\n\nI didn't find any solution. My account will be suspended. I will lose everything of my Behance account and other services.\n\n\n\nWe need to start again. For all the Venezuelans citizens, refugees and immigrants...This is just unfair.#Adobe #Venezuelans #Venezuela pic.twitter.com/DIyAa0AZ23 \u2014 Gabriela Yanez (@faintenkiu) October 7, 2019\n\nUpdated October 7th, 2019, 11:43pm ET: This article has been updated with a statement from an Adobe spokesperson.", "description": "Adobe sent out an email to customers in Venezuela today, letting them know their accounts would be deactivated in order to comply with US sanctions.
