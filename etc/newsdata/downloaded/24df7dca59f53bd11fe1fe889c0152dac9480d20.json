A self-fulfilling prophecy, as it turned out.\n\nFor the next five days, in which Keemo\u2019s song and its accompanying, brutal visuals sent ripples through the German rap scene, his notoriously funny Twitter feed kept quiet. Apparently, the track\u2019s explicit imagery of everyday racism, black pride, self-hatred, and racial profiling left some feeling personally attacked.\n\n\u201cI wish I wasn't the type of guy to read YouTube comments,\u201d OG Keemo says, laughing. \u201cPeople think because those themes don't directly affect them, they simply don't exist. I knew some people would get upset. But I never thought I would get called a full-blown racist for addressing their inherent racism.\u201d\n\nSince appearing on the scene in 2017, OG Keemo has been somewhat of an outlier in the current German rap landscape. The son of a Sudanese man who came to Germany in 1990, the 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities. Growing up in the mid-90s between the southwestern cities of Mainz, Heidelberg and Mannheim (where he still resides today), Keemo was raised on a diet of Sade, Nelly, Coltrane and 50 Cent\u2019s Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019.\n\nStoic cool\n\nStylistically, he is an MC of the post-everything ilk who has mastered rap as a native language in itself; the kind that makes you wonder how people could have ever struggled to hold a beat or find clean, multi-syllabic rhymes for every curse word in the dictionary. His musical tastes and his rapping abilities are truly advanced.\n\nOn his three latest releases Neptun, Skalp, and Otello, Keemo\u2019s biggest trick has been to perform his raps with the stoic cool of an unfazed, post-game NFL player.\n\nThis knack for code-switching became most apparent in Vorwort, his breakout song that defined the early stages of his career. In it, he moved effortlessly from punchlines about \u201cgliding through the streets like a manta ray\u201d to discussing his mother\u2019s passing mere days before signing his record deal; all wrapped up in one, hook-free stream of thought. In interviews and on his tracks, he\u2019s outspoken about his first and second passions in life being visual art and stealing stuff (he still engages in the former via his Joel Novelle Instagram account).\n\nThe 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities\n\nMix that with an infectious sense of humour, and you have an MC persona as complex as the times he tries to make sense of in the track 216.\n\nFor 216, OG Keemo tried a different writing approach. Instead of jotting down the lyrics in one go, the song consists of various lines he\u2019s written about different experiences of daily racism throughout his life. It\u2019s all held together by a recurring reference to his father who raised him on a \u2018by any means\u2019 ideology, urging him to \u201cnever turn the other cheek\u201d. The song culminates in the gripping depiction of an encounter with a racist policeman struggling to accept that his grandchildren are, in fact, mixed race.\n\nGhost notes\n\nSonically, 216 is as radio- and club-unfriendly as its lyrical content. The beat, as always provided by Keemo\u2019s producer and childhood friend Funkvater Frank, consists of little more than a few piano notes, rattling chains, scattered bits of sound design and some ghoulish screams at the song\u2019s peak. It\u2019s a fittingly odd choice for the lead-single of their upcoming debut album Geist (Ghost). This is particularly noteworthy since Geist will be released on Chimperator, a Stuttgart-based label still best known for initiating the rise of masked pop-rap star Cro.\n\n\u201cI guess people wouldn't have expected such a track from me, simply because I wasn't very political in my songs so far. To be perfectly honest, I was against dropping this first. I thought we should come out with a banger. But Frankie suggested that it would be a good idea to put this out as a first statement. Of course, 216 is one of the most poignant songs on the album, so he was completely right,\u201d says OG Keemo.\n\n\u201cI guess people wouldn't have expected such a track from me, simply because I wasn't very political in my songs so far\u201d \u2013 OG Keemo\n\nPresented without any further explanation, the title 216 had fans and critics wondering about its meaning. Most listeners speculated that the number in the title referred to a paragraph in the German Criminal Code concerned with \u201ckilling on request\u201d. Keemo is quick to debunk that theory \u2013 he\u2019d rather leave it at that. However, one could see where this theory stems from; after all, it is Keemo, dressed up in the same white military uniform that he\u2019s wearing at the beginning of the clip, who kicks away the chair at his own hanging.\n\nIt\u2019s this circular structure of every-day racism and self-destructive behaviour that Keemo finds most frustrating.\n\n\u201cI don't say we're to be blamed for what's happening. On the other hand, I also don\u2019t feel \u2018It's an us-against-them scenario\u2019. The last thing I wanted to achieve with this song is create more division. But, my father came here around 1990 and I\u2019m shocked when he tells me that nothing ever changed,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the comments I saw most frequently was \u201cthis only applies to America, never to Germany\u201d. To me, this is evidence that people have no clue what is really going on here. Because we never address it.\u201d\n\nThis unapologetic anger expressed in 216 couldn\u2019t be more timely. The single was released against the backdrop of the elections in Saxony and Brandenburg, in which the far-right AFD party surged in elections, and the results were mostly met with a collective sigh of relief about how it could it have been even worse. It\u2019s this form of apathy and ignorance towards the struggle of others that 216 counters with anger directed at everyone who still chooses to not listen, even when they\u2019re told loud and clear by those affected.\n\n\u201cThat is exactly what I don't understand\u201d, says Keemo. \u201cFor example, it would never occur to me say \u2018I don\u2019t get it, why are these women complaining all of a sudden? I never experienced sexism\u2019. Do you know what I mean? Or, as a heterosexual man, I could never take on a position to tell a gay man that it\u2019s not that bad in Germany. That behaviour is the most absurd to me.\u201d\n\nBBC Music\u2019s greatest hip-hop songs of all time:\n\nThe 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\nWhat critics had to say about the top 10\n\nFull list of critics who participated \u2013 and how they voted\n\nWhy Juicy is number one (not available in UK)\n\nTrends and surprises in the poll (not available in UK)\n\nWhy are there so few women in hip-hop polls?
