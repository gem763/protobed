Soon after pushing a wheelbarrow across the stage as part of the show, the bear suddenly latched onto his handler, dragging him to the ground.\n\nHuge circus bear attacks trainer as \u2018terrified\u2019 families scramble to escape pic.twitter.com/AmWo4mMvXmhttps://t.co/HPQIIBGsBl \u2014 Atlantide (@Atlantide4world) October 24, 2019\n\nWith no barriers between the audience and the stage, after a moment of shock, people scrambled to gather their children and belongings to flee the venue.\n\nAn assistant rushed to assist the trainer, kicking the animal in an attempt to stop the attack, but the bear did not appear to be fazed. It was eventually subdued by electric shock, one witness told Gazeta.ru.\n\nFortunately, there were no serious injuries to the trainer, bear, or bystanders, thanks in part to the fact that the animal was wearing a muzzle.\n\nAlso on rt.com RT team nearly attacked by POLAR BEAR while making wildlife film in Russia (VIDEO)\n\nThe director of the circus told Gazeta.ru that while neither the trainer nor the animal were hurt, the bear routine would no longer be part of the show. He appeared to blame the incident on the circus-goers, who he said violated the rules by using camera flashes during the performance.\n\nEdgard Zapashny, famed Russian ringmaster and director of the Zapashny Brothers & Great Moscow Circus, said that attacks like this are not entirely out of the norm, and human error is usually part of the equation.\n\n\u201cAn animal is an animal, they attack and will attack. This is normal,\u201d Zapashny told Russia\u2019s National News Service. \u201cBut under each attack there is a certain error of the person himself, which means that he did not see something, could not get ahead of the animal\u2019s thought, did not have time to react, to stop the attack.\u201d\n\nSome work will probably be done on the mistakes, and the trainer will draw conclusions for himself, but I know for sure that neither the bear nor the person were injured in this attack.\n\nZapashny, however, noted that the bear appeared \u201cgood, big\u201d and \u201cplump,\u201d suggesting it was well fed and in good health.\n\nAlso on rt.com Darwin Award wannabe?
