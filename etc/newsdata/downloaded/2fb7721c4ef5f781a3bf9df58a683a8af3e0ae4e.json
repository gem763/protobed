Walgreens, CVS, and Wegmans are joining in to combat a problem that doesn\u2019t really exist.\n\nAll of them will exempt law enforcement officers from the new restriction, just as Kroger and Walmart decided to do. The retailers don\u2019t want to get left behind in the rush to \u201cdo something\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe support the efforts of individuals and groups working to prevent gun violence, and continually review our policies and procedures to ensure our stores remain a safe environment,\u201d CVS said in a statement.\n\nThe emotional responses to recent mass shootings set into motion renewed efforts from special interest groups to demand corporate activism. Moms Demand Action, a campaign sponsored by Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund (largely funded by Mike Bloomberg), was quick to applaud the announcements.\n\nNot one, not two, but THREE of America\u2019s leading retailers joined the growing number of businesses who are rejecting gun extremism and saying no to open carry of firearms in their stores.

They claim that it will make women (the majority of the retailers\u2019 customers) safer as they shop. The Twitter feed of Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, is full of calls for specific stores to join in. Her tweets include email addresses and phone numbers to help other activists pressure corporate decision-makers.\n\nGrocery stores that have stood up for gun safety:\n\n\u2705Walmart\n\n\u2705The Fresh Market\n\n\u2705Kroger\n\n\u2705Wegmans\n\n\u2705Sprouts\n\n\u2705Target\n\n\u2705Costco\n\n\u2705Trader Joes\n\n\u2705HEB\n\n\u2705Safeway\n\n\u2705Whole Foods\n\n\u2705Schnucks Stores we encourage to do the same:\n\n\u274c@AldiUSA\n\n\u274c@Publix\n\n\u274c@meijer\n\n\u274c@HyVee#GroceriesNotGuns \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) September 5, 2019\n\nWatts says that stricter gun policies in retail stores are good for business, too. I\u2019m not so sure that Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods would agree with that conclusion.\n\n\u201cProhibiting open carry sends a very strong cultural signal that companies are siding with the safety of families,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of advocacy group Moms Demand Action, which has spent years pushing these and other companies to stop allowing open carry. \u201cThey know their customers are with them on this \u2026 they want to be on the right side of history but they also know that these actions are good for business,\u201d Watts said.\n\nApparently, the mere sight of a gun is too much for delicate shoppers in Wegmans.\n\nWegmans said in its statement Thursday that the policy is intended to keep customers and employees safer, and to help them feel more comfortable in its stores. \u201cThe sight of someone with a gun can be alarming, and we don\u2019t want anyone to feel that way at Wegmans,\u201d the company said.\n\nAs I wrote earlier this week, this is a solution looking for a problem. Open carry isn\u2019t common, even in gun-friendly Texas. Just as I said about being a Kroger customer, I\u2019m a Walgreens customer and I have never seen anyone take advantage of open carry laws in the store I patronize in Houston.\n\nNone of the retailers are saying exactly how they will enforce their decision. In Texas, a retail store must post signs in English and in Spanish that state that store\u2019s gun policy. Store management can ask a customer to leave or call law enforcement over violations to the posted policy.\n\nIt\u2019s much ado about nothing. Concealed carry is how Texans and gun-owners elsewhere prefer to protect themselves and their loved ones. Open carry isn\u2019t the smartest way to go. The gun owner can be overtaken by a bad guy trying to steal the weapon and it makes the person a walking target. It\u2019s better to keep the bad guys guessing as to how many people in a store can stop them.\n\nSpecial interest groups \u2013 the people making a living off lobbying corporations to become involved in cultural debates in the political arena \u2013 tout new restrictions on gun rights as progress. This way of thinking emboldens talk of gun confiscation, as we see in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary. Leftists no longer hesitate to admit that yes, straight up door \u2013 to \u2013 door confiscation is the goal to eliminate guns in America if buyback efforts fail. They will. (Looking at you, Beto.)\n\nConsumer reaction is yet to be measured. The retailers are not yet calling for a full ban on open carry, just asking customers not to do it. Putting an employee making minimum wage in a situation of enforcing an open gun ban isn\u2019t something store managers want to do.\n\nStarbucks, Wendy\u2019s and Target have already asked customers not to openly carry guns in stores unless they\u2019re law enforcement officers. But the retailers have stopped short of introducing an outright ban because they say they don\u2019t want to put employees in confrontational situations. Ken Perkins, president of research firm RetailMetrics, says retailers can\u2019t have their workers, who get paid $15 an hour, trying to pry a gun away from an armed shopper.\n\nChances are, if a person open carries, he or she also has a concealed carry license. A customer could just move the gun to a handbag or other discrete spot. The gun is still in the store, in the customer\u2019s possession, just not in sight. Aggressive confiscation by an employee wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Or, the customer could just leave the store and the retailer loses the sale.\n\nThe irony is that more restrictions or laws wouldn\u2019t have stopped the recent mass shootings. The gun control alarmists know this. Laws have to be enforced to work. People failing background checks \u2013 like the Odessa shooter \u2013 go to other sources for a weapon. Cooler heads and rational law-making to address the actions of madmen has to overrule the demands of opportunists.", "description": "Bandwagon", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/f8e3b32d-2811-4b72-a538-9c3a7fe90277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
