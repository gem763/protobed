The cruise line operating the new route that will explore the Gulf of California has had to delay the launch date.\n\nCruise and Maritime Voyages has canceled the three sailings scheduled for December and said the first cruise will depart Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, also known as Rocky Point, on Jan. 2. The company said it encountered \"an unforeseen and extended dry-docking requirement.\"\n\nBetween sailing seasons, cruise lines sometimes dry dock their ships for maintenance, refurbishing and upgrades before repositioning them to other routes.\n\nCruise and Maritime Voyage's Astoria ship was scheduled to sail from Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, located on the opposite side of Gulf of California from Baja California, on Dec. 7. But it will not be finished with its dry docking in time to make the transatlantic trip and meet that departure date.\n\n\"We would like to sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment this decision will cause to those passengers booked,\" spokesperson Marlene Oliver said.\n\nOliver said the cruise line offered passengers the option of choosing another departure date or getting a refund.\n\nAbout the Rocky Point cruise\n\nCruise and Maritime Voyage's will offer a cruise of the Sea of Cortez leaving from Rocky Point on board the Astoria ship. The vessel holds 550 passengers. (Photo: Cruise and Maritime Voyages)\n\nThe second-oldest cruise ship currently sailing, the historic Astoria was refurbished in 1994 at a cost of $150 million. It carries 550 passengers and has 277 cabins and eight-passenger decks.\n\nFares for the 11-day cruise start at $1,599 per person and include meals (including afternoon tea and late-night snacks), a captain's cocktail party, self-service tea and coffee, entertainment, activities, guest speakers and arts and crafts. Passengers can get bus transportation from Phoenix and Tucson.\n\nDetails: Cruise and Maritime Voyages, 855-206 4897, us.cruiseandmaritime.com.\n\nYou can connect with Arizona Republic Consumer Travel Reporter Melissa Yeager at melissa.yeager@azcentral.com.
