This is despite the broader index Nifty made marginal gains of only 0.3% today. Let\u2019s analyze the factors behind this jump in Realty and Auto stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Auto. We all know that the auto sector is in the midst of its worst slump. The sales for the Auto sector continue to decline by more than 30% for the last few months on a year-over-year basis. There is a clamor by the auto industry to reduce the GST rate on auto sales.\n\nA few days back the index got a boost from a speech from Road transport and highways union minister Nitin Gadkari, who assured that petrol and diesel vehicles will not be banned in the future and even said that the tax rates on these vehicles need to come down. Then India's junior finance minister Anurag Thakur mentioned that the automakers could expect full support from the government in the coming days.\n\nIndian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in a statement said yesterday that the government was looking at all possible measures to help the auto industry to come out of the slump. Investors are hoping that the GST council would soon slash GST rates on automobiles in its meeting on September 20th.\n\nThe spurt in Nifty Auto index rubbed onto Tata Motors (NS: ) stock, which was up by 10.2% today. However, positive news for Tata Motors was its announcement of JLR sales in China, which grew by 17% YoY. This indeed came out as a pleasant surprise for investors.\n\nTalking about the jump in Nifty Realty index, the statement from FM that the government is working on the housing sector package provided a fillip to the index. Godrej Properties (NS: ) and DLF (NS: ) were the standout performers in today\u2019s trade with the stock jumping by 6.7% and 4.0% respectively. Another statement from FM provided a boost to the infrastructure sector after she stated that the government would try to frontload infrastructure spending.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Nifty 50, DLF Ltd, Godrej Properties Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd.
