Eighteen of them are women.\n\n\u201cPeople think that usually these crimes are not being committed by women, but they are and they are equally as serious as those committed by men,\u201d said Tine Hollevoet, a Europol spokeswoman.\n\nThe wanted suspects face a range of charges including murder, and human and drug trafficking.\n\nThe interactive campaign first shows the suspects hidden behind masks, before their faces are slowly revealed as viewers read the stories behind their crimes.\n\n\u201cAfter the last time a viewer scrolls, the face of the wanted fugitive is revealed and they will be able to see if it\u2019s a man or a woman,\u201d Hollevoet said.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to attract as many visitors as possible, with experience showing us that the more eyes that look at the wanted fugitives, the higher the chance to locate and arrest the wanted person.\u201d\n\nFrance is looking for Jessica Edosomwan, a Nigerian citizen who escaped after police raided a prostitution ring in the Lyon region in late 2007 and arrested 26 people.\n\nThe ring exploited 60 prostitutes who were lured to France with the promise of a better future and were smuggled there through Libya.\n\nOnce in France, the destitute women were subjected to Voodoo \u201cjuju\u201d rites and their families threatened, French police said.\n\nThe case against the suspects was expected to start in Lyon on 6 November and Edosomwan was the only suspect still outstanding.\n\nShe was believed to be either in the Benelux countries, Italy or Germany, police said.\n\nAnother wanted suspect is Hungarian national Ildik\u00f3 Dud\u00e1s, 31, who is wanted for drug trafficking and child abuse.\n\n\u201cVery often the suspect\u2019s children were brought along to the drug transactions,\u201d Europol said of Dud\u00e1s.\n\nDud\u00e1s was sentenced to six years in prison for crimes committed between 2011 and 2012 but her whereabouts are unknown.", "description": "Crime Has No Gender website shows suspects hidden behind masks, which users remove", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In The Hague"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29144f85cf95702b7696485aff4b3df1481326fd/0_165_5555_3333/master/5555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ead498e7bd36127f7931b977fd452b0", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
