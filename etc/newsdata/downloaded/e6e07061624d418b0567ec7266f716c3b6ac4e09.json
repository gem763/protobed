Ravens 336-pound defensive tackle Brandon Williams was inactive. There\u2019s a cause and effect there.\n\nNew Ravens safety Earl Thomas was reportedly upset that Williams didn\u2019t suit up and play.\n\nThomas and Williams had a \u201cheated discussion\u201d in the training room after the Browns\u2019 40-25 win, NFL.com\u2019s Mike Garafolo said. Garafolo said the argument had to do with Williams being inactive over a knee issue that came up on Saturday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEarl Thomas not happy with teammate who was out\n\nWilliams was a late add to the injury report. He was included on the injury report Saturday and then was inactive for Sunday\u2019s game. It\u2019s rare to see a player added to the injury report on Saturday and not play on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe has something that flared up on him,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after the game. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an injury. It was a thing that caused him a lot of pain and that was what flared up on him.\u201d\n\nWithout Williams, a stout nose tackle who was a Pro Bowler last season due to his excellent play against the run, the Ravens gave up 530 yards. Cleveland rushed for 193 yards, with Chubb getting 165. Thomas gave a curious answer to why he pulled up on an 88-yard touchdown run by Chubb in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I tried to get there, couldn\u2019t get there,\u201d Thomas said, according to Jamison Hensley of ESPN.com. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth pulling a hamstring. I\u2019ve been there before trying to chase DeAndre Hopkins down on a screen. I pulled a hamstring, and I was out. I wasn\u2019t doing that today\"\n\nThomas has a fiery personality\n\nGarafolo wrote the exchange \u201cdidn't get physical because players and staff members quickly interceded.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTeammates argue, though it\u2019s not often you hear about players fighting over someone missing a game due to a health issue. While Harbaugh was vague, he did say Williams was in a lot of pain.\n\nThomas comes from a culture in Seattle in which players never were shy about expressing their feelings. He seems to want to bring that to Baltimore too.\n\nEarl Thomas had an argument with teammate Brandon Williams after Sunday's game.
