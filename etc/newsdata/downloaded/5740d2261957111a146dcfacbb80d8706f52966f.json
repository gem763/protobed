'But his comment really hurt. It was the final straw.'\n\n'I was determined to figure out how to love myself, and I wasn't going to let anyone make me feel that way ever again.'\n\nTeaching assistant Alexa Nicole Robles, 22, from North Carolina, has revealed how she lost an impressive 80lbs in one year after following the keto diet\n\nThe 22-year-old has praised the keto diet - which involves cutting back on carb intake and eating a moderate amount of protein, and helped her to get down to a slim size 8 (pictured)\n\nAlexa tipped the scales at 190lbs (left) at her heaviest - and was motivated to shed weight after a cruel comment about her appearance from her then-boyfriend\n\nALEXA'S DIET NOW Breakfast: Eggs and bacon with a side of Two Good yogurt. Lunch: Turkey BBQ meatballs (I like Hughes sugar free BBQ sauce) with a side of green beans. Snacks: Frozen strawberries, cheese sticks, or salt and vinegar almonds. Dinner: Grilled chicken with a side of loaded Brussel sprouts (mozzarella, bacon and Brussel sprouts baked in the oven). Dessert: A Choc Zero bar or a Lily\u2019s dark chocolate bar.\n\nGrowing up, Alexa says she always struggled with her weight, so much so, that her social life started to suffer.\n\nHowever, it soon began to affect her professional life as a teaching assistant too - and she started feeling anxious standing in front of a room full of people.\n\nThe cruel jibe from her then-partner in July 2018 was the final knock to her confidence and kick-started Alexa into researching different weight loss programs - which is when she came across the keto diet.\n\nThe concept focuses on eating lots of 'good' fat to help curb hunger pangs, while cutting back on carbs and eating moderate amounts of protein. It claims to increase energy levels and increase the speed of weight loss.\n\nDuring her weight loss journey, Alexa, pictured while on her diet, allowed herself the occasional dark chocolate cheat\n\nFor the fist six-and-a-half months of her weight loss journey, Alexa limited herself to a total of 13 grams of carbs a day (pictured left before and right after)\n\nIn time, Alexa started upping her carb intake to 20 grams - and allowed herself the occasional dark chocolate cheat. Pictured now\n\nThe 22-year-old explained how being overweight was impacting her life in 'major ways' but that her weight loss has 'changed everything\n\nFor the fist six-and-a-half months, Alexa limited herself to a total of 13 grams of carbs a day, before upping the intake to 20 grams - allowing herself the occasional dark chocolate cheat.\n\nBut her hard work and determination paid off and before long, Alexa's confidence skyrocketed.\n\nShe started hitting the gym daily and began sharing her weight loss journey on her Instagram page in a bid to help inspire others.\n\n'This is a journey, not a race. Don't compare your path to anyone else's,' she explained. 'Weight is something that so many women struggle with, but know that you have the power to do something about it.\n\nShe added: 'Being overweight was impacting my life in major ways, so this weight-loss journey has changed everything. I am no longer afraid, and I no longer suffer from anxiety.'", "description": "Alexa Nicole Robles, 22, from North Carolina, has told how she lost 80lbs in one year after following the keto diet.
