In its most recent update, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was burning more than 66,000 acres. It is only 5 percent contained.\n\nThe fire has been propelled by strong \u201cDiablo winds,\u201d which have reached speeds up to 93 miles per hour in some spots. The hot, dry wind, combined with bone-dry vegetation, creates a tinder box that allows the fires to spread at blistering speed.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, an earthquake hit the area early Monday morning. The 3.3 magnitude tremor did not cause any damage or injuries.\n\nMass evacuations have been ordered in and around Sonoma County, with 180,000 people ordered to leave their homes as the fire approaches Santa Rosa. Sonoma County public schools were ordered closed Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGeyserville, California, after the Kincade fire passed through.

But they reached capacity Sunday morning, forcing some evacuees to sleep in chairs and in their cars.\n\nThe Getty Fire erupts in Southern California.\n\nTwo large fires burned over the weekend near Los Angeles, with the Saddle Ridge and Tick fires engulfing around 13,000 acres. Both were largely contained by Monday morning, but strong Santa Ana winds are expected to return later in the day.\n\nEarly Monday, a new fire broke out near the Getty Center museum, causing major problems in West Los Angeles. Thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes, including LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The fire has resulted in the closure of dozens of schools and parts of Interstate 405, one of the nation\u2019s busiest highways.\n\nThe #GettyFire is now moving down the hillside towards the 405 Fwy.

Do not get your own hoses. Leave it to the professionals \u2026 be calm, but get out,\u201d Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti warned Monday.\n\nHundreds of firefighters are battling the Getty Fire from the ground and air. Planes were seen Monday scooping up water from the Pacific Ocean and dropping it on the blaze.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the L.A. County Fire Department announced that a new 10-acre fire, dubbed the Oak Fire, in Calabasas. It was quickly put out.\n\nMany smaller fires are contained.\n\nA handful of fires that cropped up during the weekend\u2019s strong winds have been contained, with evacuations lifted. In the East Bay city of Martinez, a 50-acre blaze in a residential neighborhood was contained Sunday evening. Parts of Interstate 80 were closed Sunday as a fire that started in Vallejo jumped the Carquinez Strait and threatened Crockett as well. Dubbed the Sky fire, the 150-acre blaze was largely contained by Sunday afternoon and evacuations were lifted. Another East Bay fire, this one in Lafayette, prompted evacuations and burned a local tennis club before it was contained.\n\nIntentional blackouts continue.\n\nOn Saturday, PG&E purposefully cut power to 965,000 homes, or more than 2 million people, in parts of 32 counties. The utility said Sunday it\u2019s working quickly to restore power, but threats of strong winds Tuesday have raised the possibility of more intentional outages that are expected to hit half as many customers as this weekend\u2019s.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate in both Northern and Southern California.", "authors": ["Adam K.
