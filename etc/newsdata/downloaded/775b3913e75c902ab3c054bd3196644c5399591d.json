R Kelly came on and I walked up to the DJ and said: \u2018We don\u2019t play him in this house.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the documentary, Legend, the only major musician to appear in the series, said: \u201cR Kelly has brought so much pain to so many people. #TimesUp for R Kelly.\u201d", "description": "John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have reimagined the Christmas song Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside without the controversial lyrics.\u00a0 The Voice coach shared a preview of the updated song, co-written with Insecure star Natasha Rowell, with Vanity Fair for the magazine\u2019s November cover story.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/19/gettyimages-169770386.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
