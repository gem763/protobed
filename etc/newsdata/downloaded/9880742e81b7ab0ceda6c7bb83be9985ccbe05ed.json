That is, some stock bucked the broader \u201cmixed bag\u201d trend and instead reported blowout Q2 numbers which propelled their stocks meaningfully higher.\n\nWhich stocks crushed it this earnings season? And will they stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future?\n\nLet\u2019s answer those questions by taking a deeper look at 7 of the best stocks that absolutely crushed it this earnings season \u2014 all of which are up 15% or more since they reported earnings \u2014 and seeing whether or not these hot stocks can sustain their post-earnings momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoku (ROKU)\n\nThe More Streaming Surges, the Better Roku Stock Looks More\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\n% Gain Since Earnings Report: 55%\n\nStreaming device maker Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) reported Q2 numbers in early August that smashed expectations on all important metrics, including revenues, profits, active accounts, average revenue per account and margins. The report also comprised sequential revenue growth acceleration, broad margin improvements and sustained robust account growth, as well as a strong guide which implied that all of this positive growth momentum will persist for the next few quarters.\n\nROKU stock shot higher in response. It hasn\u2019t slowed since. In the month since the earnings report, ROKU stock has risen a jaw-dropping 55%.\n\nThis rally seems overextended in the near-term based on valuation and technical concerns. But the long-term growth narrative here is compelling, as Roku is transforming into the cable box of the secular growth streaming TV market. In the long run, that position will translate into tons of ad and subscription-sharing revenue dollars, all of which will be high margin and translate into big profits.\n\nNet net, ROKU stock seems overextended in the near term, but has tons of potential to zoom higher in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest (PINS)\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\n% Gain Since Earnings Report: 20%\n\nFreshly public social media company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) reported Q2 numbers in early August that topped every metric that mattered. Monthly active users topped expectations. Average revenue per user did, too. As did overall revenues and profits. Management also hiked its full-year 2019 revenue and EBITDA guides and sounded an optimistic tone on the conference call with respect to future user growth.\n\nPINS stock soared in response. It has largely maintained those gains ever since, and about a month later, the stock is up 20% from its pre-earnings price.\n\nPINS stock should stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future. The valuation is ostensibly rich at 20-times trailing sales, but this is a really big social media company with a wide reach and unique value prop that is in the very early stages of monetizing its 300 million user and growing platform. Thus, the trailing valuation will naturally be rich because that trailing sales base is growing very, very quickly \u2014 62% revenue growth last quarter. This big growth will persist for a lot longer, and as it does, PINS stock will more than grow into its rich valuation and head significantly higher in the long run.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Second=quarter earnings season has come and gone, leaving investors with a mixed bag of results.From a headline perspective, 75% of companies topped profit expectations -- above the five year average profit \"beat rate.\" But only 56% of companies topped revenue expectations -- below the five", "authors": ["Luke Lango"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/by7tS9DIM2LcGNeH5QxR0w--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/3bc897670c34442aca7eb2ed51ff0033", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
