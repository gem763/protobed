Scott Applewhite/AP Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr. arrives on Capitol Hill. Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr. looked out over the front lines of Ukraine\u2019s long war with Russian-backed separatists last July, taking in a damaged bridge and then, farther in the distance, an \u201carmed and hostile\u201d enemy.\n\nTaylor had taken the job of acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine reluctantly, he said in congressional testimony Tuesday. His decision came only after assurances from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late May that President Trump was committed to helping Kyiv hold off forces, armed and funded by Moscow, that had besieged the country for nearly five years.\n\nNow it was July and Taylor was already doubting both his decision and his country\u2019s intentions.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThe Trump administration's official policy, which had bipartisan backing, was to support a young democracy \u201cstruggling to break free of its past\u201d and battling Russian aggression. But it was becoming increasingly clear to Taylor that those noble intentions were being \u201cfundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making\u201d in which Trump and a handful of allies were withholding desperately needed military aid in exchange for political favors that would benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nThe worrisome signs had been building for weeks. Taylor\u2019s predecessor had been recalled from Kyiv under questionable circumstances. A few days before his visit to the front lines, Taylor had received a report from Washington that the $391 million in military aid was being held up until Ukraine\u2019s new president committed to investigations that would help Trump.\n\nPerhaps most troubling, the ambassador couldn\u2019t get a readout of a call that had taken place one day earlier on July 25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That conversation would trigger an extraordinary whistleblower complaint as well as a House impeachment inquiry that would threaten Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nEventually, Taylor would be called back to Washington for day-long testimony before Congress in which he described his distress in an excoriating, 15-page opening statement.\n\nBut, on this day, standing on the front lines with the new and inexperienced Ukrainian president, Taylor was most worried about the betrayal of a desperate ally at the hands of an American president.\n\nThe 72-year-old ambassador gazed out at the guns and troops on the other side of the bridge. \u201cOver 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war,\u201d he recalled thinking. \u201cMore Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s 50 years of service spanned some of America\u2019s greatest successes as well as some of its most catastrophic blunders. He had graduated from the U.S. Military Academy and fought with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam as an infantry officer. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he had done stints in Iraq and Afghanistan, during some of those wars\u2019 darkest days, overseeing reconstruction aid.\n\nIn 2006, President George W. Bush tapped Taylor to serve as ambassador to Ukraine, a place he described as \u201cspecial\u201d to him and critical to the security of the United States and its European allies.\n\nTaylor was retired from the State Department and working at the nonpartisan U.S. Institute for Peace when Pompeo asked him to rush to Ukraine to take the place of the recently departed ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who Taylor said he thought had been \u201ctreated poorly, caught up in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and Washington.\u201d\n\nTaylor, who feared that the problems that spurred Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster were still present, sought out the advice of friends and colleagues. One former mentor told him, \u201cIf your country asks you to do something, you do it \u2014 if you can be effective.\u201d\n\nHis wife, he recalled in testimony, urged him in \u201cno uncertain terms\u201d to turn down the appointment. Taylor also sought out the advice of Kurt Volker, who recently stepped down as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine amid the growing controversy over his role in withholding American aid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to navigate this new world,\u201d Volker texted him this spring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a world I want to set foot in,\u201d Taylor replied.\n\nWhat followed, according to Taylor\u2019s testimony, was the agonized awakening of a diplomat who arrived certain that he was being put in place to deliver implacable American support, but gradually came to understand that the entire U.S. relationship was being subverted for the president\u2019s political gain.\n\nTaylor came to Kyiv so confident in his mandate that he brought hard copies of two documents: a congratulatory letter from Trump to Ukraine\u2019s newly elected leader, in which Trump invited Zelensky to a meeting at the Oval Office, and a framed pledge by Pompeo that the United States would never recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\n\nWithin days, however, Taylor began to detect signs of an \u201cirregular, informal\u201d diplomatic channel competing with his own, and a secret agenda seeping into U.S. policy. Upon arrival, he wrote, he faced \u201ca weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances.\u201d\n\nAmong the first clues was the resistance he encountered trying to deliver on Trump\u2019s White House invite. Before he could even begin to discuss dates, Taylor said, two other diplomats informed him that Trump first \u201cwanted to hear from Zelensky,\u201d though it was not clear yet about what.\n\nOn June 27, Taylor got a fuller explanation from Gordon Sondland, a wealthy Trump donor who had been named U.S. ambassador to the European Union. In a phone call, Sondland told Taylor that the president wanted assurances that Zelensky would not stand in the way of \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nWhat that meant was left unsaid. But by then, there were other indications of Trump\u2019s intent. Among them were odd statements by his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that he was pursuing meetings with officials in Ukraine that he hoped would deliver politically valuable material to his client.\n\nThere were also disconcerting signs that those responsible for the \u201cirregular channel\u201d were seeking to hide their tracks. On June 28, Taylor was scheduled to join Sondland and others on a conference call with Zelensky. But before the call got underway, Sondland said that \u201che wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President Zelensky to the call.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sensed something odd\u201d about that request, Taylor wrote in his testimony.\n\nVolker, an old friend of Taylor\u2019s, also seemed to be pursuing aims at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s official policy. In that same call \u2014 before Zelensky joined it \u2014 Volker said he would be meeting with the Ukrainian leader days later and planned to press him to commit to investigations that would \u201cget to the bottom of things.\u201d\n\nTaylor was so troubled by the dissonant signals that he reported the conversation to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, putting his concerns in a memo that presumably now resides among the files at the State Department that Pompeo has not yet furnished to impeachment investigators.\n\nIn mid-July, Taylor began to assemble a fuller picture of the Ukraine intrigue.\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\nOn a video conference call with White House officials on July 18, Taylor heard the voice of someone out of the camera\u2019s frame, an official from the Office of Management and Budget informing the group that she had been instructed not to allow any additional military aid to flow to Ukraine until further notice.\n\n\u201cI and others sat in astonishment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support.\u201d The OMB official offered no explanation for the sudden suspension of this aid, except to say that \u201cthe directive had come from the president to the chief of staff to OMB.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cThe irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy.\u201d\n\nThe cessation of aid appears to have caught the attention of Cabinet-level officials in ways that other developments \u2014 including the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May, and Giuliani\u2019s public comments about Kyiv conspiracy theories \u2014 had not. The Pentagon swiftly produced an analysis showing that the military aid was effective and should continue. Pompeo, CIA Director Gina Haspel and national security adviser John Bolton sought a meeting with Trump to raise the issue, but delays and difficulties prevented that from happening until September.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor\u2019s isolation in Kyiv prevented him from learning in real time about disturbing developments at the White House. It wasn\u2019t until July 19 \u2014 in a call with Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s top adviser on Russia \u2014 that Taylor learned about a meeting nine days earlier in Washington at which Sondland told members of a Ukraine delegation that their existing anti-corruption work wasn\u2019t enough. They needed to look back at cases regarded as closed, Sondland said.\n\nBolton and others saw Sondland\u2019s line as a clear reference to Trump\u2019s desire to have Ukrainian authorities dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had secured a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at a time when his father was overseeing Obama administration policy.\n\nTrump was also determined that Zelensky pursue discredited conspiracy theories involving Democratic computer servers supposedly being hidden in Ukraine. Bolton halted the meeting on the spot, according to Taylor\u2019s testimony, telling Hill to go \u201cbrief the lawyers\u201d on what had happened and likening the proposed transaction to a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d\n\nIn Kyiv, it fell to Taylor to decipher these puzzling developments for increasingly worried Ukrainian officials. Often, he had only partial answers, in part because officials in his own government were working to keep him in the dark. When he heard that Volker had met with Giuliani about Ukraine, Taylor tried to confront Volker, asking him if it were true, but \u201creceived no response.\u201d\n\nAt other moments, Sondland and Volker laid out aspects of their scheme with surprising candor. On July 19 and 20, the two diplomats engaged Taylor in a series of encrypted texts and phone calls, saying that prospects of a Trump-Zelensky call were improving but that Zelensky had to convince Trump that he would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d regarding Trump\u2019s sought-after probes.\n\nTrump used his July 25 call with Zelensky to secure that very commitment, reminding the leader of Ukraine how much aid his country received from the United States before soliciting dirt on Biden and material that might help substantiate 2016 conspiracy claims with the line: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d\n\nAgain, the details were hidden from the country\u2019s acting ambassador. \u201cStrangely,\u201d Taylor testified, \u201cI received no readout of the call from the White House,\u201d even though he was scheduled to meet with Zelensky the next day.\n\nAs the shadow policy in Washington became clearer to him, Taylor sought to raise alarms. In late August he met privately with Bolton in Kyiv and said he expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about the conditions Trump was putting on military aid.\n\nAt Bolton\u2019s urging, Taylor wrote a cable to Pompeo. It went unanswered.\n\nNearly a month later, Taylor was in Washington, laying out his story for Congress.", "description": "Ambassador William Taylor told lawmakers that \u201cirregular channels\u201d and demands for political investigations in Kyiv were warping U.S. policy on Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJbtSL.img?h=211&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1289&y=445", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
