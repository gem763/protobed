Shooting on location and using mostly practical sets, Ad Astra is undoubtedly one of the most realistic depictions of space travel we've seen so far.\n\nVideo of Ad Astra Official Trailer 2 [HD] 20th Century FOX\n\nWhile the film is set in the near future, the production design team made the right call by incorporating as many nostalgic items as possible from the golden era of Space Age in the 50s and 60s. The not-so-futuristic looking props make Brad Pitt\u2019s character all the more relatable, infusing warmth into his nuanced performance.\n\nHowever, it would\u2019ve been much better to cast a younger actor, as there would\u2019ve been a more obvious generational gap and better dynamics between Pitt and his onscreen father Tommy Lee Jones - who, by the way, deserves far more screen time than he got. Pitt, who turns 56 in a few months, looked more like an aging father himself rather than a fresh-faced rookie seeking to uncover what had become of his father.\n\nThe best sci-fi movies to rewatch for the anniversary of the Moon Landing\n\nAs for sound effects, the overuse of low frequency sounds and voiceover were slightly distracting at times, further dampening a film that already lacks the element of surprise. While the visuals and the pace of the film were great in the beginning, there was an obvious dip in the second half, and the story just dragged on for what seemed like an eternity.\n\nThe film should\u2019ve stopped just before Pitt\u2019s character, Roy, reaches Neptune, whereafter the plot just became almost entirely predicatable and redundant. Granted, it\u2019s a film and not a book, but sometimes it\u2019s best to leave some room for imagination.", "description": "Although it's one of the most believable portrayals of space travel, it would have been more believable to cast a younger actor as Tommy Lee Jones' son.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/deab638c-e00f-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires182438.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
