Bush signed the income-tax hike that Democrats demanded, thus breaking his most famous campaign pledge: \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes.\u201d Had he resisted a tax increase, he might have fended off Bill Clinton and won a second term.\n\nPresident Trump has increased taxes on imports \u2014 that is what tariffs are \u2014 unilaterally. Tariffs are not as economically destructive as income taxes are, and they are not as politically unpopular. But still, taxes impose a drag on the economy, and so if Trump loses in a close race, it\u2019s entirely plausible that it will be his tariffs that drag him down.\n\nSo Trump is helping himself with his recent decision, as part of progress on a trade deal, to call off a planned tariff increase on $250 billion of exports. Trump ought to wrap up a deal as soon as possible and take down all the new tariffs he has imposed.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are costing American households $425 a year, according to an estimate by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. That\u2019s not as bad as Bush\u2019s 1990 tax hikes ($592 per household), and it\u2019s also only an estimate based on economic models that may not bear out.\n\nThe tariffs, for instance, have not resulted in price increases yet. Also, in certain circumstances, the cost of the tariffs is not passed on to domestic consumers, but is instead born by foreign exporters. These complexities ought to instill tariff critics with some level of humility.\n\nYet tariffs are still taxes. Taxes, in general and all other things being equal, stultify commerce. In the long run, a country that allows more commerce to flow is wealthier than one that restricts commerce more.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s tariffs were merely replacing other taxes, they might be fine. If Trump\u2019s tariffs could bring back the heyday of U.S. manufacturing, there\u2019s a strong case it would be worth costs to economic efficiency. We would take a slightly depressed GDP and more expensive jeans if it resulted in millions more good jobs for working-class men and women.\n\nBut that\u2019s not happening. And if tariffs did bring manufacturing back home, the factories would be filled with robots rather than guys from Youngstown, Ohio.\n\nTrump has done many good things for the economy. He has rolled back costly regulations. He has cut corporate taxes and individual income taxes. These things have made us wealthier as a people. Taxes will not make us wealthier \u2014 and they will not make Trump more popular.", "description": "In the long run, a country that allows more commerce to flow is wealthier than one that restricts commerce more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abe6e0e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2273x1194+2+123/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F11%2F66%2F4668af5a46c1b34fd440b7791070%2Fap-19130499892980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
