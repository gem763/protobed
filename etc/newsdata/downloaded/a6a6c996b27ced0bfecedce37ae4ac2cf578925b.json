At the state level, at least 166 drug pricing bills were passed between 2015 and 2018 and so far this year 33 states have enacted another 51 such laws.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe problem with all these bills is that they are shooting in the dark. Lots of information is available about drugs\u2019 published list prices. But the drug distribution system is so complex \u2014 involving numerous middlemen and confidential negotiations for myriad rebates, fees and discounts \u2014 that manufacturers\u2019 list prices are almost meaningless.\n\nThe net prices manufacturers receive after all discounts and rebates are more useful, but the difference between what manufacturers receive and what consumers and insurers pay is still shrouded in mystery.\n\nUntil regulators and legislators understand where the profits are flowing in the drug business, writing bills to control prices risks serious misfires that could target the wrong participants in the distribution chain.\n\nThe critical first step is mandating price and profit transparency throughout the supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacy benefits managers, pharmacies and insurers.\n\nSuch a sweeping demand for information requires congressional action. Some states have attempted price transparency, but their efforts are incomplete and can be misleading.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a new first-of-its-kind study of state drug pricing laws, my colleague and I found that 22 states had passed 35 bills that included some kind of transparency component between 2015 and 2018. But only seven of the bills went beyond requiring information that is already available.\n\nOnly two states required that net prices be reported: by insurers in Vermont and by manufacturers in Maine. Only Oregon and Nevada required that profits be reported by manufacturers.\n\nOnly Connecticut, Louisiana and Nevada required that pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 the big intermediaries that negotiate prices for insurers and employers \u2014 report rebates that they receive from drug makers. But even then, the requirement is only for aggregate reporting, not drug-by-drug.\n\nTracking how money flows in the aggregate is important, as a previous study shows. That will not substitute for drilling down into individual drug cases. For example, the reasons why insulin prices are rising may be very different than the dynamics affecting other generic drugs.\n\nImportantly, no state passed laws that together revealed true transaction prices or profits across all supply chain segments.\n\nTo compound the problem, states have created a thicket of requirements that add to administrative costs without securing meaningful results. The laws vary widely, including the timing of disclosures (before or after a price increase), the type of information (price amounts, justification for increases, etc.) and what thresholds trigger disclosure. In many cases, the information submitted to the state is confidential, which inhibits media and academic oversight of the process.\n\nEarlier this year executives from drug makers and other sectors of the distribution chain appeared before congressional hearings and pointed fingers at each other over who is most responsible for soaring prices. The only way Congress will know who is right \u2014 if any of them \u2014 is to see pricing and profit information from each stage in the supply chain.\n\nSuch information could directly influence legislative or regulatory strategy. Speaker Pelosi is advocating federal negotiations with drug makers, but in some cases negotiations with pharmacy benefit managers or other participants in the supply chain might be the better course.\n\nJust as Pelosi has targeted a top segment of drugs in her proposed legislation, policymakers could start by requiring transparency for drugs with the largest budget impacts. Once armed with that data, they can fashion informed rules that drain unjustified profits from the chain and start making important drugs more affordable.\n\nNeeraj Sood is a professor of public policy at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics and the Price School of Public Policy.
