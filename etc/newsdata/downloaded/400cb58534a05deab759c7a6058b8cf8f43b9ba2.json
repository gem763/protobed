Once they have a business model, they will be able to move into Barclays\u2019s 64,000-square-foot workspace for startups in Manhattan.\n\nOnce participants have a business model, they can move into Barclays\u2019s 64,000-square-foot workspace for startups in Manhattan.

About $131 billion was invested across about 8,950 deals in 2018.\n\nBusinesses founded by women deliver more than twice as much revenue per dollar invested than those founded by men, according to a 2018 Boston Consulting Group study.\n\nThe goal is for participants to ultimately build businesses that will become Barclays vendors, Mr. Stecher said: \u201cWe have a number of things we need to accomplish that we don\u2019t want to build proprietary.\u201d\n\nFor example, Barclays is looking for software that could help when onboarding new customers and clients, such as identity validation, he said. The company also is interested in customer-facing software that appeals to specific target-age demographics, such as mobile apps for different banking services.\n\nBarclays and Anthemis will connect participants with mentors within the two organizations to help them build out their ideas and get venture-capital funding.\n\nThe founders also will get access to mentorship from a broader network of startups that Barclays has invested in over the past five years.\n\n\u201cSomething that can\u2019t be discounted when you\u2019re an entrepreneur is how little access you have to a wide mentoring network,\u201d Mr. Stecher said.\n\nBarclays and Anthemis will select entrepreneurs for the program who have a strong sense of purpose and a high level of conviction around their ideas, said Amy Nauiokas, founder and chief executive of Anthemis, which invests in early-stage financial technology startups.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take rocket science to recognize there\u2019s some real opportunity to spend time helping fund, nurture and build up\u2026women\u2019s companies,\u201d Ms. Nauiokas said, who was a Barclays executive from 2004 to 2008.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "Barclays and venture-capital firm Anthemis Group are looking for women with ideas for fintech startups, hoping some can start businesses that can eventually sell the London-based bank new software or other products.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118087/social", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
