How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you 1/9 Lock your profile down If you haven\u2019t done this already, do it now. In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu. 2/9 Limit old posts Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who\u2019s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up. 3/9 Make yourself harder to find You can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It\u2019s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. At the bottom of the page is the option to prevent search engines outside of Facebook from linking to your profile. 4/9 Control access to your Timeline You can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. 5/9 Block people When you block someone, they won\u2019t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. You can also add friends to your Restricted list here, which means they\u2019ll still be friends with you but will only be able to see your public posts and things you share on a mutual friend's Timeline. 6/9 Review tags One of Facebook\u2019s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you\u2019re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They\u2019ll still be visible on the News Feed while they\u2019re fresh, but won\u2019t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 7/9 Clean up your apps You can view a list of all of the apps you\u2019ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It\u2019s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. If you don\u2019t want to log into websites and apps with your facebook account, scroll down and turn Platform off. 8/9 Change your ad preferences You can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you\u2019re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we\u2019d recommend doing this on a computer. 9/9 Download your data Facebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you\u2019ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you\u2019ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site. It\u2019s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again. 1/9 Lock your profile down If you haven\u2019t done this already, do it now.

Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, called for a halt on the project in July.\n\n\u201cBecause Facebook is already in the hands of over a quarter of the world\u2019s population, it is imperative that Facebook and its partners immediately cease implementation plans until regulators and Congress have an opportunity to examine these issues and take action,\u201d she and four other Democrats wrote in a statement at the time.\n\n\u201cDuring this moratorium, we intend to hold public hearings on the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency-based activities and explore legislative solutions. Failure to cease implementation before we can do so, risks a new Swiss-based financial system that is too big to fail.\u201d\n\nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will appear before Congress on 23 October to justify Libra and its planned roll-out.\n\nHis appearance is scheduled a little over a week after the first official meeting of the Libra Association Council, which will take place on 14 October in Geneva.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just three days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Council.\n\nDavid Marcus, Facebook\u2019s lead executive on the Libra project, wrote on Twitter he \u201cwould caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not great news in the short term, but in a way it\u2019s liberating,\u201d the tweets continued. \u201cStay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you\u2019re on to something when so much pressure builds up.\u201d", "description": "Mastercard, Visa, and eBay have all pulled out of Libra, Facebook\u2019s\u00a0increasingly embattled cryptocurrency project.
