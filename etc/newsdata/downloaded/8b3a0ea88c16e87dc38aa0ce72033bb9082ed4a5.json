The man was a monster, the president declared, responsible for a global campaign of devastation, and particularly the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 Americans. True, the killing would not mean the end of the broader war, the president noted, but the U.S. had reaped \u201cthe most significant achievement to date\u201d against the jihadists.\n\nBarack Obama said this in 2011, following the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nAfter U.S. special operations forces ensured a violent end for the leader of a new global jihadist movement, the president hailed the importance of the moment. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a monster, the president declared, responsible for a global campaign of devastation, even the beheadings of American hostages. True, the killing would not mean the end of the broader war, the president noted, but it showed that \u201cthese savage monsters will never escape their fate.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump said this on Sunday, following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nTrump Turns Baghdadi\u2019s Killing Into a Reality Show\n\nThese three fatal milestones all point to the strategic incoherence within a global war that has now lasted an entire generation. No one, neither the Trump administration nor its critics, believes that the so-called Islamic State is finished because al-Baghdadi is dead. As proficient as U.S. special operators have become at manhunting these past 18 years, and as central as manhunting has been during that time, there is no campaign plan, not even a theory, by which the killings of jihadist leaders knit up into a lasting victory. Asking for one would require reckoning with the catastrophic failure represented by a war that only perpetuates itself.\n\nThere would be no Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had Bush not invaded and occupied Iraq in 2003. That war created an opportunity for a mass murderer, Zarqawi, to construct an al-Qaeda franchise more bloodthirsty than even the one bin Laden created. Even after Zarqawi\u2019s 2006 death, Bin Laden could never rein in al-Qaeda in Iraq, documents recovered after the 2011 raid on his Abbottabad compound showed, and he grew particularly dyspeptic over the offshoot\u2019s clear desire to declare a caliphate.\n\nSome believe bin Laden is the real victor of the war on terrorism, since he succeeded at provoking the U.S. into endless war in unfamiliar terrain. But the rise of ISIS showed bin Laden lost control of the movement he started. Bin Laden did not believe the time was right for a caliphate. Baghdadi took advantage of both the Syrian civil war and Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal from Iraq to make the caliphate a brutal fascist reality, complete with misogynist enslavement and opportunities for men to find meaning through sanctified violence. When al-Qaeda and the elder generation of jihadist theorists opposed ISIS, Baghdadi\u2019s organization\u2014now an actual state, complete with an army, and a flag\u2014had no problem attacking them. Baghdadi was less visible than bin Laden, rebuking the leadership style of a previous generation and signaling that the caliphate was more important than he was. The caliphate was ISIS\u2019 triumph over bin Laden, whose children ate his revolution.\n\nThis history matters because it shows that the expansive war the U.S. launched does not fight against a static enemy. It generates enemies \u2013 the slain al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki is another example \u2013 and provides opportunities for new ones to arise. Baghdadi himself experienced four years of captivity in the U.S. detention facility at Camp Bucca in Iraq before his 2009 release. Trump on Sunday recalled the horror of seeing American detainees dressed in orange jumpsuits without recalling that ISIS chose the orange jumpsuits to evoke the ones worn by detainees at Guantanamo Bay.", "description": "GettyAfter U.S. special operations forces dealt a violent end to the leader of the premier jihadist group in Iraq, the president hailed the importance of the moment.
