It's simple,\" said Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern.\n\nA solution to the problem is a smoke detector that combines a high-frequency alarm to wake adults, with a separate device placed inside a child's bedroom that uses a voice warning - which studies show is much more likely to wake them.\n\nWatchdog tested one of those devices on the same children and six out of the eight did wake up.\n\nImage caption Karen and Jon Martin's two daughters slept through an alarm during a fire in their home\n\nIn March last year, a fire tore through Karen and Jon Martin's home while they and their two children were fast asleep. At around 1a.m. the smoke alarm went off and the couple could see smoke and flames downstairs.\n\n\"I would have expected with the commotion and the smoke detector going off, that they would have heard it, but they were both fast asleep,\" Karen said.\n\nDerbyshire Fire and Rescue Service fire investigator Dave Coss said: \"Currently, in legislation, one smoke alarm fits all. So there's no requirement to make a separate one for children or a separate one for adults.\"\n\nImage caption Dave Coss, from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, also found children failed to wake to traditional alarms\n\nThe British Standards Institute said it was aware of the research into the challenges of waking children. It said it already suggested that alarms should be packaged with extra advice for families on the importance of an effective fire escape plan.\n\n\"We are not aware of conclusive evidence from fire statistics to show that the current frequency of sound emitted by the majority of smoke alarms is ineffective,\" the BSI said.\n\n\"For those concerned or those with impaired hearing, low-frequency sounders have been available for a number of years and can be connected to many models of a smoke alarm.\"\n\nYou can watch the full investigation on Thursday 12 September at 20:00 BST on BBC One or on iPlayer afterwards.", "description": "A BBC investigation has found that many children don't wake at the sound of an alarm.", "authors": ["Assif Majid", "Bbc Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9A8D/production/_108756593_gettyimages-528289716.jpg"}
