As embodied by writer/director Taika Waititi, the F\u00fchrer is a hate-spewing clown cast in a Shaggy-by-way-of-Looney Tunes mold, all childish exaggerations and cartoonish anti-Semitism, encouraging and abetting his young creator\u2019s desire to be an ideal Aryan adolescent (as well as sparking a national craze akin to Beatlemania). Far from Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Hitler proxy in 1940\u2019s The Great Dictator, he\u2019s a lovable sort of genocidal monster, the kind of goofy caricature you\u2019re not meant to derisively laugh at so much as laugh with as he accompanies his young charge on his quest to be the very best Nazi he can be.\n\nThis, you\u2019ll no doubt realize, is meant to be ironic. Unfortunately, it\u2019s irony of a bad, unfunny sort.\n\nBafflingly bestowed with the People\u2019s Choice Award at this year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, Jojo Rabbit isn\u2019t just a misfire for its creator (whose prior What We Do in the Shadows and Thor: Ragnarok were superior comedic efforts); it\u2019s an eye-opening miscalculation that, premiering Friday, Oct. 18 amidst white nationalism\u2019s rise throughout Europe and America, couldn\u2019t arrive at a worse time. Waititi is, I\u2019m sure, opposed to fascism, and his latest\u2019s message is, in the end, about how the blackest hearts and minds can be transformed by face-to-face communication with people who are different from us. No matter the heartwarming uplift it eventually dispenses, however, the film is an ill-advised disaster that thinks it\u2019s pulling a provocative bait-and-switch, even as it makes a series of missteps that validate the criticisms it was courting from the start.\n\nThe incongruity of a mainstream comedy about Nazis is the entire point of Jojo Rabbit, which thinks it can get away with deeply humanizing its characters because, in the end, those figures will see the error of their ways and, thus, prove examples of how kindness and compassion can prevail over intolerance. While that\u2019s certainly a fine message in the abstract, the means by which Waititi\u2019s film goes about it is disingenuous to the point of repugnant, and thus destroys any humor or heart that might have materialized from this tale (adapted from Christine Leunens\u2019 novel Caging Skies). Even Life is Beautiful, Roberto Benigni\u2019s 1997 Oscar-winner, knew better than to mine comedy and pathos from the perpetrators of the Holocaust, which is exactly what Waititi does here, via a collection of colorful Nazis that\u2014save for Stephen Merchant\u2019s Gestapo guard, and a couple of early bullies\u2014are nothing short of likable, entertaining and inherently decent.\n\nThat begins with Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), a 10-year-old who just can\u2019t wait to be an active member of the Third Reich. There\u2019s nothing that excites Jojo more than the opportunity to show his boot-stomping stuff at a Hitler Youth retreat, and with his trusty make-believe Hitler (Waititi) by his side, he\u2019s super-enthused about getting in the swing of Jew-killing things. Whether pumping himself up in the mirror or hanging out with his mates, Jojo talks a big bigoted game, although he turns out to be, deep down, a good person\u2014something we first learn when he balks at his teenage superiors\u2019 orders to kill a rabbit (hence his nickname, shorthand for \u201ccoward\u201d). If that weren\u2019t enough to make us emotionally side with adorably lively Jojo, his subsequent act to get back in his comrades\u2019 good graces does: running and leaping in slow-motion through the woods alongside fake Hitler, and grabbing a grenade from the hands of Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) and throwing it like a pro.\n\n\u201c \u2018Jojo Rabbit\u2019 is, in the end, about how the blackest hearts and minds can be transformed by face-to-face communication with people who are different from us. \u201d\n\nAlas, the resultant blast leaves Jojo\u2019s cherubic face scarred and his leg injured. Oh no, his Aryan perfection has been marred! This troubles Jojo but not his mom Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), whom Jojo Rabbit depicts as angelic. That\u2019s in keeping with its characterizations of everyone involved in this mess, be it pompous and absurd Klenzendorf, \u201ccrazy\u201d Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), or Jojo\u2019s upbeat best friend Yorki (Archie Yates), all of whom are portrayed\u2014by Waititi\u2019s script, and by the game cast\u2014as hilarious misfits who treat their Final Solution duties as business as usual, and who, at every meaningful turn, choose to do the right thing. Who knew SS stormtroopers were so fun, silly and secretly caring and considerate?\n\nJojo Rabbit\u2019s story really kicks into gear once Jojo discovers that his mother has been hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in their apartment\u2019s clandestine crawlspace. This rocks Jojo\u2019s Jews-are-horned-devils world, but because Elsa is nice and cute, and he\u2019s nice and cute, well, you can guess that they soon strike up an aww-shucks quasi-romantic relationship. This development is Anne Frank wish-fulfillment of the grossest kind, and Waititi milks it for all its worth, having Jojo pen her phony love letters from her fianc\u00e9 (since Jojo adores her! And her fianc\u00e9 is really dead because of the Nazis!), write a book about the \u201cevils\u201d of Jews (that really illustrates the idiocy of anti-Semitic stereotypes), and do whatever it takes to protect her. Waititi\u2019s Hitler, predictably, disapproves of Jojo\u2019s behavior (because he\u2019s such an incorrigible anti-Semite, haha!). But the film certainly doesn\u2019t, segueing in its latter portions from treating Nazis as endearingly amusing oddballs to painting them as benevolent souls who, after getting to know Jews, sacrifice everything to save them.\n\nIt goes without saying that this is horseshit of the highest order. But worse is that Waititi normalizes his white nationalists by placing them front and center in a saga that, in most respects, hews to a traditional modern comedic formula. Jojo\u2019s tale isn\u2019t very different from that of Ron Burgundy or Ricky Bobby; like them, he (and everyone around him) is an over-the-top buffoon who\u2019s defined by his tasteless antics, and who ultimately has to realize the foolishness of his opinions and actions. The latter comes during a third act that has our protagonist change for the better, thus demonstrating that the very inappropriate material we were laughing at earlier was \u201cbad.\u201d In spirit, Jojo Rabbit is really just a pint-sized Wedding Crashers with more swastikas.\n\nThe problem with that, of course, is that Nazis aren\u2019t the same as promiscuous American thirtysomethings, or funny newscasters, or race car drivers, and equating them indicates a fundamental misunderstanding\u2014and willful denial and warping\u2014of history. Jojo Rabbit knows what it\u2019s doing, and thinks it\u2019s oh-so-devilishly clever for making you care about its cretinous subjects, whose ridiculousness is designed to invite empathy rather than scorn. That alone makes it ill-advised (not to mention mirthless). But the fact that it does this in service of a treacly \u201canti-hate\u201d sermon\u2014as if we needed to be reminded, by Nazis themselves no less, that mass-murdering Jews is uncool!\u2014only compounds its wrong-headedness. Irony may not be dead, but the brand peddled by Jojo Rabbit is certainly DOA.", "description": "Save for a handful of its Gestapo caricatures, the Nazis in writer-director Taika Waititi\u2019s latest are nothing short of likable, entertaining and inherently decent.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571437822/191018-Schager-Jojo-Rabbit_1_ze4m8z", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
