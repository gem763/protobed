I'm very proud of the boys, it's just a very weird feeling at the minute.'\n\nCanberra coach Ricky Stuart agreed with the selection panel, agreeing his player was best on field.\n\n'The best player on the field got the award,' Stuart said. 'Whether those people out there that booed agree or not, Jack didn't pick it.

Cooper Cronk was sin-binned over the incident. 71st minute: The Roosters were given the ball back deep in Raiders territory when the referees initially waved six more tackles to Canberra but then changed their minds. 73rd minute: Roosters full-back James Tedesco races away to score the match-winning try.\n\nThe Sydney Roosters' 14-8 premiership victory was marred by an outrageous blunder by referees Ben Cummins and Gerard Sutton with seven minutes to go and the score dead-locked at 8-all on Sunday evening.\n\nCummins waved 'six again' when he ruled Roosters full back James Tedesco had touched the ball when attempting to catch a bomb before reversing his decision - but the confusion led to drama.\n\nRaiders five-eight Jack Wighton, thinking he had another set of six tackles up his sleeve with seven minutes to go and the scores locked up, took the tackle in front of the posts instead of kicking the ball.\n\nSutton then informed him that it was the sixth tackle and he had to hand the ball over, which almost immediately led to the Roosters' game-winning try.\n\nRoosters winger Daniel Tupou made a break from inside his own half before putting full-back James Tedesco away for a try.\n\nIn the opening stages, a charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit the Sydney Roosters physio on the field at the time, in the head.\n\nThe Raiders were also denied a penalty try when Josh Papalii was tackled without the ball metres from the try-line, which resulted in the sin-binning of retiring Roosters star Cooper Cronk.", "description": "The title was awarded to Canberra Raiders five eighth Jack Wighton, but Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, from the victorious Sydney Roosters side, was told  earlier that he had won.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/02/19377310-0-image-a-27_1570410713048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
