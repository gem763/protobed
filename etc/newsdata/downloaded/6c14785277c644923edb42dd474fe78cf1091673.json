(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe official holdout of Redskins tackle Trent Williams has stretched over four months now. It has gone through a mandatory minicamp, training camp and the season\u2019s first five games. A little more than a week ago he reached the point at which the NFL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement permits the team to keep all of his 2019 bonus money.\n\nWilliams already has lost more than $4 million in game checks in addition to the $1.5 million of bonus money. If he doesn\u2019t return by Week 10, he will not get credit for a year toward free agency.\n\nBut Williams has given no indication that he plans to return. The team is operating as if he won\u2019t come back and Redskins President Bruce Allen said after firing Coach Jay Gruden on Monday that he is not considering trading the seven-time Pro Bowl player.\n\n\u201cHe is not here and really there has been no dialogue with any other team,\u201d Allen said.\n\nOne person with knowledge of the situation said Allen is responsible for managing the team\u2019s response to Williams\u2019s holdout and that he has convinced owner Daniel Snyder to let Williams miss enough paychecks that he will eventually return. The same person said Allen has refused to consider trading Williams, believing the team\u2019s top offensive player will eventually return.\n\n[Redskins fire Coach Jay Gruden, who says he isn\u2019t bitter: \u2018I didn\u2019t get it done\u2019]\n\nAllen and Gruden both have said they expect Williams to come back.\n\nWilliams has given few public signs about his intentions or the reason he is holding out. Several people who know him say he is unhappy with the franchise\u2019s handling of a growth on his head last offseason that led to a cancer scare. He is said to be cancer free but does not seem willing to come back to the team even with the promotion of his position coach, Bill Callahan, to interim head coach.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been here so there\u2019s really nothing to talk about in that regard,\u201d Callahan said Monday. \u201cBasically we\u2019ll see how it all plays out, but going forward, we\u2019re just playing and working with the players that we have.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nBrewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nPlayers react: \u2018Sorry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you\u2019\n\nThe Redskins are starting over, but in what direction?", "description": "Williams already has lost more than $4 million in game checks in addition to $1.5 million of bonus money.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "October At Am", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hjFPGOWvdCrxqlOc12psL6QojDI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAYFDOQNEII6TDYMN6DYUJRIRI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
