Last year this technique was used to identify the Golden State Killer, who committed at least 13 murders and 50 rapes in California during the 1970s and 80s. Joseph James DeAngelo (pictured above) was caught after crime scene DNA was compared to DNA uploaded to a website called GEDmatch, a site that helps people who\u2019ve had their DNA tested to locate and identify other relatives.\n\nWhile the Golden State Killer is the most high profile case in which familial DNA matches were used it\u2019s far from the only one. But earlier this year there was a backlash among users of GEDmatch who became concerned about police using their DNA information to solve crimes:\n\nCurtis Rogers didn\u2019t ask for this. Rogers, 81, works in Florida as a court-appointed guardian for the elderly. He founded GEDmatch as a free public service in 2010 after being inspired by his own experience connecting with people who shared his last name. He partnered with a computer programmer who wrote software that made it easy for people to find relatives through certain shared pieces of genetic material. The site became popular among professional and amateur genealogists, and as direct-to-consumer genetic testing services grew, GEDmatch enabled people to compare their DNA profiles in a single place\u2026 As law enforcement searches of his site surged, Rogers imposed a few restrictions. He allowed investigators to pursue leads on homicides and rapes, but not less serious crimes like assaults. Then, late last year, police in Utah asked Rogers to use the site to investigate an attack on an elderly church organist, who was seriously hurt but survived. Rogers agreed, and police used GEDmatch to identify a 17-year-old suspect, who was arrested in April.\n\nThe use of the database to search for someone who wasn\u2019t a rapist or a murderer created a backlash. Buzzfeed reported that some people in the field became concerned the whole thing had become a slippery slope:\n\nCritics worry that the case, which led to the arrest of a 17-year-old high school student who has not yet been named, marks the start of a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to law enforcement using such methods to investigate increasingly less serious offenses, eroding people\u2019s genetic privacy. \u201cThis is very disturbing,\u201d Leah Larkin, a genealogist in Livermore, California, who helps adoptees find their biological relatives, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cWe\u2019re right here on the precipice, sliding down.\u201d\u2026 \u201cFor me, this highlights the need for proper oversight,\u201d Debbie Kennett, a genealogist and honorary research associate at University College London, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThis should not be for one person to decide.\u201d Kennett believes that independent ethical committees should be set up to review requests from law enforcement agencies before they upload DNA profiles to genealogy websites.\n\nA few days after the Buzzfeed story was published, GEDmatch announced a change to its terms of service:\n\nThe new terms of service extend the crimes for which law enforcement searches are allowed to \u201cmurder, nonnegligent manslaughter, aggravated rape, robbery, or aggravated assault.\u201d But importantly, they also add a new privacy setting for users to say whether they wish to have their profiles made available for searches by police. And by default, all profiles have been set to \u201copt out\u201d unless users decide to opt in. \u201cYour story and others brought attention to the definition of \u2018violent crime\u2019 which was clearly inconsistent with what is generally used elsewhere,\u201d John Olson, an engineer in Texas who runs GEDmatch with Rogers, told BuzzFeed News by email. \u201cThe other changes were mostly based on lessons learned since our last TOS revision a year ago.\u201d\n\nWhile the change potentially allowed for police to investigate more types of crime, the opt-in privacy setting meant that the number of users available for police to compare suspect DNA went from 1.2 million to zero overnight. That was in May of this year. Since then, the number has crept back up to just under 200,000 users who have opted in. That\u2019s thanks in part to Curtis Rogers who has sent emails to users of his site encouraging them to participate:\n\nRogers has sent emails to members urging them to allow law enforcement to search their profiles, linking to a video message from a relative of one of the Golden State Killer\u2019s victims. \u201cMany of these families have suffered for decades. They need your support,\u201d he wrote in an email to members. \u201cWe hope you will encourage others who have been genealogically DNA tested to also add their information. We believe it is the caring thing to do.\u201d\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m sorry we had to do this. However, I feel very strongly that when we bit the bullet and did what we did, we set the whole future on a much stronger base,\u201d Rogers said of genealogy. \u201cTwo or three years from now, this whole thing will be forgotten.\u201d\n\nI hope he\u2019s right about that. I guess the opt-in makes sense but it\u2019s hard to imagine why someone would refuse to offer information they\u2019ve already put into the public sphere to help police solve violent crimes. Buzzfeed cited this 2018 survey of public opinion which shows an overwhelming percentage of people support allowing police to use this information to solve violent crimes.\n\nTwo videos to close this out. The first is an ABC story about the capture of the Golden State Killer.
