An American tourist finds himself indicted for manslaughter in the British territory of Anguilla after a bizarre set of events on a family vacation. Scott Hapgood claims self-defense but authorities there seem intent on trying him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve see Trump help Americans in peril around the world,\u201d Kallie Hapgood told Fox & Friends while pleading for his intervention. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him do amazing things for Americans, and Scott Hapgood is the type of American that you want to help.\u201d And that just happened to be the one venue guaranteed to get Trump\u2019s attention:\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com\n\nAlthough Kallie Hapgood noted that the State Department has already been supporting the Hapgoods, Trump responded on Twitter that he would take a personal interest in resolving the issue. Based on the Fox & Friends segment, Trump has already expressed his skepticism about the prosecutors\u2019 case:\n\nWill be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla. Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved! @foxandfriends @SteveDucey @ainsleyearhardt \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nUntil now the Hapgood case has not drawn a large amount of attention, but that\u2019s changing rapidly. The New York Post offers a brief primer after Trump\u2019s comments, including the results of the toxicology report:\n\nHapgood has told authorities he killed the resort worker in self-defense during the family\u2019s trip to the tiny tropical island six months ago, after the man showed up to their hotel room in a drug-fueled craze, whipped out a knife and demanded money. Hapgood, a 44-year-old dad of three from Darien, was charged with manslaughter and freed on bail, angering some residents on the isle. \u2026 A toxicology report showed that the worker died from a lethal amount of cocaine in his system.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t quite what the coroner ruled as the cause of death. The toxicology report was part of the final ruling, but Kenny Mitchel died from \u201cdue to prone restraint, positional asphyxia and blunt force trauma to the head, neck and torso.\u201d However, the toxicology report tends to substantiate the Hapgoods\u2019 description of the man\u2019s behavior, which also seems to comport with his previous record. The NY Post reported over the weekend that the supposed victim had been in custody for an alleged violent attack on his former girlfriend earlier this year:\n\nAfter meeting her daughter in the lobby, once Kallie was reunited with her husband back in Room 49 and saw what had happened between Hapgood and the hotel worker \u2014 the details of which she declined to discuss with The Post, citing the ongoing criminal case \u2014 she \u201cbegged\u201d hotel staff to call the police. When they finally did arrive, after what seemed like hours, a female officer relayed an ominous message that has stuck with Kallie as her distrust for island authorities has grown over the past six months. \u201cShe looked at me and said, \u2018We know him. He is a bad guy. He was just in our custody,\u2019\u201d Kallie said. Once Mitchel\u2019s death was made public, reports surfaced that he was arrested and accused of raping the mother of his children, Emily Garlick, in March. Garlick later claimed it was a misunderstanding. Considering the charges against Mitchel, which were pending at the time of his death, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the hotel thought it was OK for him to be around my children or me and my family,\u201d Kallie said.\n\nThe toxicology report and the man\u2019s previous track record would tend to produce copious amounts of reasonable doubt about whether Hapgood was defending himself and his family, even apart from the injuries he sustained \u2014 at least in an American courtroom. Anguilla shouldn\u2019t be that much different; it is a British territory, using the English common law that serves as a basis for our own. Either the Hapgoods and the US media that have covered this story are leaving out significant portions of the case, which is very much a possibility in this kind of a PR campaign, or the case really does look \u201cvery wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat can Trump do about it? He could press Anguilla and the UK to drop the case, but the UK has another case they want to discuss with Trump in return. Boris Johnson just got done scolding Trump publicly for his refusal thus far to revoke Anne Sacoolas\u2019 diplomatic immunity and return her to the UK in a vehicular-homicide case:\n\nAsked about the case this afternoon, Mr Johnson said invoking diplomatic immunity in the case was \u2018inappropriate\u2019. \u2018In my experience, America is very, very reluctant to allow its nationals to be tried overseas, and is absolutely ruthless in enforcing the code of diplomatic immunity,\u2019 he said. \u2018I must say, I don\u2019t think it was appropriate for that provision to be used in this case. \u2018I made that point to the president, and he is sympathetic. \u2018I think we\u2019ve just got to keep working on that and see what we can do to get justice for Harry Dunn and his family.\u2019\n\nSacoolas has finally apologized for the accident, but the victim\u2019s family says the time for apologies have passed:\n\n\u201cAnne would like to meet with Mr. Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident,\u201d said the statement released through her attorney. \u2026 Speaking from Heathrow Airport, Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said that she was \u201cvery, very open\u201d to meeting with Sacoolas. But, she added, \u201cSorry just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not really quite enough,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two cases might leave Trump stuck in a tough trade. He might just hope that his interest in the case forces prosecutors to re-evaluate whether they want to pursue Hapgood at all.\n\nIf Trump does succeed in extricating the Hapgoods from this situation, it will no doubt redound to his favor politically, at least briefly. Will it be enough to deflect his other case from its one-way track to impeachment? Naah, but it will give Trump\u2019s supporters plenty of reason to also talk about how they\u2019ve \u201cseen him do amazing things for Americans.\u201d", "description": "\"I've seen him do amazing things for Americans...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hapgood-anguilla.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
