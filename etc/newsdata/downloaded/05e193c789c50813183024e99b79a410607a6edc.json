According to Morning Consult\u2019s polling, he\u2019s also the stated second choice of Bernie Sanders\u2019s supporters, Kamala Harris\u2019s supporters, and Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters. Elizabeth Warren is in fifth place according to this poll, and her supporters\u2019 second choice is Sanders \u2014 but their third choice is Biden.\n\nBut despite his polling lead, it\u2019s commonplace among progressives to act as if Biden\u2019s early strength is nothing but a consequence of name recognition and that he will inevitably fall by the wayside once actual campaigning gets underway.\n\nAnd he certainly might. Huge swaths of Biden\u2019s record are out of step with the views of progressive activists, from his early opposition to school desegregation measures to his record as a fighter in the war on drugs to his loyalty to the credit card industry to his support for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nBut progressive activists may not have as firm a grasp on the Democratic Party electorate as a casual follower of the news might think. People who spend a lot of time online reading and posting about politics (some Vox readers, say) will find themselves immersed in a discourse that tends to implicitly portray the 2020 nomination as a battle between Sanders and a group of contemporary mainstream Democrats \u2014 Harris, Warren, O\u2019Rourke, Buttigieg, etc. Biden is essentially an afterthought, with neither a chorus of cheerleaders nor a set of intense detractors who are visibly worried about him winning the nomination.\n\nThis risks a version of the mistake Republican Party insiders made in 2016, when they banked on Trump falling by the wayside. Consequently, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, etc., focussed their energy on attacking each other. Biden\u2019s frontrunner status is underwhelming for a variety of reasons, but he really is in first place in the polls, and there\u2019s nothing inevitable about him falling by the wayside. For him to lose, someone has to take him on and beat him.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s record is not very progressive\n\nBiden spent his formative years in politics during an era of conservative dominance. First elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden built his career as a senator from Delaware, a swing state at the time, through considerable crossover appeal to voters who backed Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush before coming around to Bill Clinton.\n\nHis record fundamentally reflects those origins, and it\u2019s why progressives today do not want him to win the nomination.\n\nHe was a tough-on-crime drug fighter who, at one point, voted to let states overturn Roe v. Wade and spent years as a critic of school desegregation efforts. He not only voted for Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut but years later would vote for a GOP-sponsored Balanced Budget Amendment. And though probably his single most notable action as vice president was leading the charge toward the Obama administration\u2019s belated embrace of LGBT marriage equality, as a senator he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nBy the 21st century, Delaware was a more solidly liberal state, and Biden\u2019s record had become pretty conventionally liberal. But he did have a few noteworthy breaks with the base like being a leading sponsor of an industry-friendly bankruptcy reform bill in 2005 (Delaware was, at the time, home to a major credit card company) and acting as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to lend a bipartisan imprimatur to the legislation authorizing war in Iraq.\n\nAll things considered, there was very little in his record to recommend him as a major progressive leader, and it\u2019s hardly a big surprise that he ended up finishing a dismal fifth in the 2008 Iowa Caucus \u2014 behind not just Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but also John Edwards and Bill Richardson.\n\nObama selected him as his running mate to balance the ticket with a more conservative partner. As vice president, Biden\u2019s deeper personal relationships on Capitol Hill made him repeatedly a useful emissary during bipartisan negotiations. But he was not particularly known as a champion of progressive causes inside the administration.\n\nDuring his quasi-apology for his tendency toward touching women inappropriately at photo ops, Biden acknowledged that \u201csocial norms have changed\u201d since he was a younger politician.\n\nBut more broadly, American politics has changed. Biden has kinda sorta changed with it, but he\u2019s been a laggard rather than a leader in that change, and progressives have good reason to want another standard-bearer \u2014 either someone like Sanders who espoused progressive ideas back in the 1980s when they were unfashionable or else one of the many candidates from younger generations who simply don\u2019t have their roots in the long Nixon-Reagan-Bush era of GOP hegemony.\n\nBiden has a pretty good chance of winning\n\nTalking to themselves online, however, progressives tend to reach consensus not only that Biden shouldn\u2019t be the nominee but also that he won\u2019t be.\n\nBut as Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy detailed in a New York Times story on Tuesday, social media can be misleading in this regard.\n\nSocial media users are substantially younger, better-educated, and more politically engaged than rank-and-file Democrats. Only 29 percent of them define themselves as moderate or conservative, compared to 53 percent of Democrats who do not post online about politics.\n\nCNN\u2019s Harry Enten rightly emphasizes that, in particular, the rank-and-file membership of the Democratic Party is quite a bit older than you might think. In the Trump era, Democrats are the party of the young in the sense that Trump is popular with senior citizens and deeply unpopular with young people. But 56 percent of Democratic voters in 2018 were over the age of 50, while just 29 percent were below 40. There is a huge age gradient in current polling, with Biden faring far better with older Democrats than younger ones.\n\nAnd, crucially, it would be a mistake for progressives to just assume that Biden\u2019s advantage will fade away when more information becomes available. For one thing, as Cohn and Quealy note, the majority of Democrats who don\u2019t post about politics on social media also say they don\u2019t follow the news that closely.\n\nUnflattering details about Biden\u2019s record like his support for Reagan\u2019s tax cuts for the rich or a giveaway to credit card companies aren\u2019t things less-informed Democrats are likely to be made aware of unless it becomes a specific point of emphasis in someone\u2019s campaign. A broad, hazy sense that Biden is a more moderate option won\u2019t do him in for the simple reason that, as Gallup found last December, most rank-and-file Democrats say they favor a more moderate party.\n\nSimilarly, dedicated followers of Crooked Media personalities\u2019 Twitter feeds will have noticed that Team Obama is very open to a range of voices in the party, but a less-attentive voter is just going to think of Biden as the second-in-command to the popular former president.\n\nBiden appears to have an unambitious agenda\n\nObama, of course, is extremely popular among both rank-and-file Democrats and the vast majority of the party\u2019s elected officials. But for most progressives, admiring what Obama achieved in office doesn\u2019t mean complacency about the need for further change.\n\nIndeed, Obama himself has long been an advocate of going further than his own administration\u2019s achievements. In a 2015 interview with Vox, he called for a much more aggressive government role in regulating health care prices. Two years later, as he was about to leave office, he did another interview with Vox where he reiterated his support for adding a strong public option to Affordable Care Act exchanges and conceded the abstract case on the merits for Medicare-for-all, explaining that \u201cif I was starting from scratch, I would have supported a single-payer system because it\u2019s easier for people to understand and manage.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 midterms, he again praised Medicare-for-all. During his second term he pushed for (and failed to achieve) significant public investments in child care and early childhood education. Other members of his administration, similarly, see no contradiction between pride in their work and desire to go further. John Kerry, a key architect of the Paris climate accord as secretary of state, praised the Green New Deal plan this week. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro is running for president on Medicare-for-all and an ambitious immigration reform agenda.\n\nBiden, by contrast, has spent the past few years laying the groundwork for a presidential run while generally avoiding ambitious policy commitments. He\u2019s associated himself, instead, with a rather modest agenda focused on higher minimum wage, free community college, and some worker-friendly tweaks to labor law.\n\nThese are not bad ideas by any means. But they suggest the mind of a politician who continues to be fundamentally more conservative than Obama at a time when progressives are hoping to drive the country forward in key areas. And yet he very well could win \u2014 especially if his rivals don\u2019t take him seriously.\n\nBiden\u2019s lead is not just name recognition\n\nBiden\u2019s near-universal name recognition as a former vice president is, of course, a tremendous asset compared to several other candidates in the field. But it\u2019s critical to understand that while name ID is an advantage, his lead is not just about name recognition.\n\nA good chart by CNN\u2019s Harry Enten shows Biden is clearly outperforming what you\u2019d expect based on name recognition alone. The two other best-known candidates are underperforming.\n\nCorrected: Name id is highly correlated with polling right now, but I think it's noteworthy a. Biden/Sanders have same name id, but Biden is 10 pts up. b. Warren has *higher* name id than Harris/O'Rourke & yet is behind them. c. Booker/Gillibrand meh. d. Buttigieg over-performing pic.twitter.com/GO0zIzwDzd \u2014 (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) April 9, 2019\n\nBy the same token, Biden is in first place in a new poll of California Democrats, well ahead of both Sanders and of a senator from the state, Kamala Harris \u2014 something that should cause doubt that she will automatically gain ground compared to Biden once she becomes as well known nationally as she is in her home state.\n\nToday is still a long way from the first caucus in Iowa, and of course things can change a lot between now and then. At this point in the 2008 cycle, Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton had big leads and at this point in the 2016 cycle Trump wasn\u2019t even in the race (Jeb Bush had a small lead). But Mitt Romney led early in 2012 and Clinton led early in 2016, and they both won.\n\nOne big story from the 2016 GOP primary is that political junkies who paid a lot of attention to elite conservative opinion just kept assuming that Trump would fade. In part because of that, rival campaigns mostly attacked each other trying to position themselves for Trump\u2019s inevitable collapse. But it turned out that Trump\u2019s basic message \u2014 hard-right on identity issues, a bit heterodox on economics \u2014 was closer to the views of rank-and-file Republicans even though it was unpopular with GOP thought leaders.\n\nBiden could be in a similar position this time around. He starts off with a lead, and no individual campaign has a clear interest in attacking him, thanks to his association with Obama. His more moderate brand of politics is out of step with the ideas of the most vocal Democrats, but there is a large cohort of older, more working-class Democrats who are open to the idea of a moderate nominee. If progressives don\u2019t want that to happen, they\u2019re going to have to put in the work to stop it.", "description": "Liberals are assuming the former vice president will fade on his own, a trap Republicans fell for with Trump.", "authors": ["Matthew Yglesias", "Theodore Schleifer", "Hannah Brown", "Alex Ward", "Umair Irfan", "Li Zhou", "Nicole Narea", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hk44_JpFhlsNfdp0q5l3xEXpCGg=/0x0:4288x2245/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4001160/GettyImages-79739525.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-11"}
