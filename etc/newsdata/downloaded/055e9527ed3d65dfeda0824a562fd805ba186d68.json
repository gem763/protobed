REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nWall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index rose but pulled back from sharper gains after disappointing data on consumer confidence that also put pressure on the U.S. dollar.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for trade talks in two weeks, after waning optimism on trade had hit the stock market on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe tone around trade is really setting the table for markets today, both domestically and globally,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.\n\nA report showed that U.S. consumer confidence fell by the most in nine months in September, far more than expected, as Americans\u2019 economic outlooks darkened in the face of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nInvestors have pointed generally to U.S. consumer strength as a reason to be optimistic about the economy despite questions otherwise about a potential downturn.\n\n\u201cOn balance, the economic data today in the United States was mildly disappointing,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 72.58 points, or 0.27%, to 27,022.57, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.51 points, or 0.28%, to 3,000.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 1.60 points, or 0.02%, to 8,110.86.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.15% and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.19%.\n\nGerman business morale rose in September for the first time in six months but Europe\u2019s largest economy was still likely slipping into recession, the Ifo economic institute said.\n\nSterling gained after the court ruling, but uncertainty over a possible general election and the eventual outcome of Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union capped its rise.\n\nSome investors bet that the court\u2019s decision would reduce the probability of Britain leaving the European Union without a transaction agreement on Oct. 31.\n\nThe pound was up 0.36% GBP= against the dollar.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.08%, with the euro EUR= up 0.07% to $1.0999.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, September 23, 2019.
