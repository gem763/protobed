Another female then recorded a voiceover to describe the different makeup steps for the viewer.\n\n'We\u2019re going back in time, you guys. The beauty world was a lot different. There was no scandals, no one was canceled, and everyone just enjoyed makeup,' Jeffree said.\n\nAt the start of the 1969 tutorial, the woman demonstrated how she would use makeup to 'accentuate the good points' of her face while 'minimizing the others'.\n\nFoundation was then applied by the woman using her fingers instead of any brushes or sponges, which shocked the beauty influencer.\n\n'Oh my god, no Beautyblender, no Morphe sponge, nothing. Your fingers. I never do this,' Jeffree said while attempting to follow the tutorial.\n\nBut quickly after Jeffree started to use the finger technique with the foundation, he was sold.\n\n'I\u2019m not really minding this,' he admitted to the camera.\n\nThe next step entailed the woman applying concealer to her face. But the routine differed from the normal conceal and contour now dominating YouTube tutorials because she just applied the concealer to her under-eye area.\n\nInteresting: At first, Jeffree was not sure about using only his fingers to apply foundation and concealer to his face\n\nSold: But the technique, as well as using a cotton circle, worked for the YouTuber\n\nConcealer was also blended out with the woman's fingers instead of using any brushes or sponges.\n\n'She blended this out with her fingers. Like, I don't know about that,' Jeffree said, adding: 'If there isn\u2019t eye shadow in this video I\u2019m quitting.'\n\nThe tutorial went on to advise the viewer to apply blush along the cheekbones, but Jeffree was unimpressed with the lack of color used.\n\n'Her blush, by the way, looked invisible. Maybe there was no pigment back then in cosmetics,' he said while following the tutorial.\n\nBut the makeup look turned around once the video detailed how to set the face, a step Jeffree was concerned would be skipped by the 1969 model.\n\n'Thank god she is setting the face,' he said.\n\nThe technique used, though, is different from what is popular today when setting the face. Typically, someone will use a makeup brush to apply the powder. But the tutorial instead recommended using a cotton circle to apply the product.\n\nAt first, this move shocked Jeffree. But he was quickly won over once he realized the benefits of using the cotton circle.\n\n'That\u2019s insane. It actually kind of blends into the skin. My concealer actually looks the best it\u2019s ever looked in a long time,' he said, adding: 'Throwing away all my brushes. She just put it over everything. She was living.'\n\nLackluster: Jeffree was unimpressed by the lack of color allowed by the tutorial\n\nKeeping it light: The tutorial recommended only using neutral colors on the eyes instead of 'bright, obvious, evening colors'\n\nPucker up: The final step entailed applying a 'subtle color' of lipstick to be 'the most becoming'\n\nFinished look: 'I look great, I feel good. The tutorial, it may be life changing. I might have a new way to do my base,' Jeffree said at the end of the video\n\nAnother bizarre technique used by the old-fashioned tutorial was applying baby oil to the eyebrows before using product.\n\nBecause Jeffree shaves off his eyebrows, and has done for many years, he did not follow this step.\n\nThe tutorial moved on to mascara, where the voiceover said: 'Mascara applied to the lashes would complete the well-groomed eye and is sufficient eye makeup for the early teens. However, if you wish to give more attention to the eyes you may use the following procedures.'\n\nJeffree joked he 'loved a good procedure' and was definitely not done with his makeup routine.\n\n'She literally said you can do mascara and be done. Can you imagine me being done with my makeup right now?' He asked the viewers.\n\nJeffree owns his own makeup company and often produces makeup palettes featuring bright colors, so he does not often model minimal makeup.\n\n'I still feel nude,' Jeffree said after he applied mascara and eye shadow.\n\nThe video went on to reprimand anyone who didn't get a good nights sleep, stating makeup would not help.\n\n'Mascara makes lashes look longer and fuller,' the voiceover said. 'Incidentally, no amount of eye makeup will help if your eyes are drowsy and lackluster. To be wide-eyed and alert, a whole measure of sleep is necessary.'\n\nJeffree couldn't stop laughing over the woman's blunt statement, saying: 'She is really reading everyone to the ground.'\n\nThe final step entailed applying a 'subtle color' of lipstick to be 'the most becoming'.\n\nUltimately, Jeffree was impressed with some of the steps featured in the 50-year-old tutorial when applying makeup. But there were other steps he was happy to skip.\n\n'I look great, I feel good. The tutorial, it may be life changing. I might have a new way to do my base,' he said, confessing his foundation looked 'snatched' after using the finger and cotton-circle technique.", "description": "Jeffree Star, 33, followed a makeup tutorial from 1969 that was sent by his 100-year-old grandmother.
