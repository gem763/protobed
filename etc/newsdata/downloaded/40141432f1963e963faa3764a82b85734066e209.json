Authorities have also imposed a near-total internet blackout in a bid to make it harder for protesters to mobilise.\n\nWhy are people protesting?\n\nAngered by Iraq's stuttering recovery from years of conflict, protesters have rallied to demand improved services, more jobs and an end to graft that analysts describe as endemic.\n\nThe focus of the demonstrators' ire has been not just the government but Iraq's wider political establishment.\n\n191004085506824\n\nIraq has the world's fourth-largest reserves of oil, according to the IMF, but nearly three-fifths of its 40 million people live on less than $6 a day, World Bank figures show.\n\nUnemployment, particularly among young people, is a major issue, while millions lack access to adequate healthcare, schooling, water or power supplies. Much of the country's infrastructure remains in tatters after decades of near-ongoing conflict, including a United States-led invasion, and United Nations sanctions.\n\nThe economic struggles have come despite Iraq enjoying relative stability in recent years after the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group in 2017.\n\nWhat has the official response been?\n\nAbdul Mahdi has warned there is no \"magic solution\" to Iraq's problems but moved to assuage protesters by offering to meet with \"representatives of peaceful demonstrators\".\n\nHe has also pledged to pass legislation which would grant the country's poorest families a basic income and generate better employment opportunities.\n\nAn emergency parliamentary session has been called for Saturday to address the crisis. But Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr, whose political coalition won the most seats in last year's elections, has urged legislators to boycott sessions until the government presents concrete measures addressing the protesters' demands.\n\nThe country's top Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has urged security forces not to use violence and called on the government to heed the demonstrators' demands \"before it is too late\".", "description": "Anti-government demonstrations rock oil-rich Iraq as widespread anger erupts over economic mismanagement and corruption.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/1bcb59250d1b4325bebdbd303a2ba5a6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
