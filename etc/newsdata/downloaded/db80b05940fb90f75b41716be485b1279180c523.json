REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan on Thursday warned the country\u2019s banking system is becoming increasingly fragile as financial institutions boost risky lending and investment in an environment of prolonged ultra-low interest rates.\n\n\u201cCredit costs remain low but have recently started to rise, particularly for regional financial institutions,\u201d the BOJ said in a semi-annual report analyzing Japan\u2019s banking system.\n\nRegional banks have been actively taking risks via lending and investment as prolonged ultra-low interest rates and a dwindling population prod them to seek higher returns, it said.\n\n\u201cAs they have not been able to secure adequate returns relative to the risks involved, their capital adequacy ratios have continued to decline moderately,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cShould this situation persist, loss-absorbing capacity in the event of stress would decrease, intensifying downward pressure on the economy by weakening financial intermediation,\u201d it said.\n\nMajor financial institutions have also expanded overseas lending, which make Japan\u2019s banking system more susceptible to the impact of overseas economic conditions, the report said.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s report is among factors the nine-member board will likely scrutinize in deciding monetary policy at its rate review on Oct. 30-31.\n\nFailure to fire up inflation to its elusive 2% target has forced the BOJ to maintain its massive stimulus program for longer than expected, crushing financial institutions\u2019 margin and straining Japan\u2019s banking system.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed the central bank will carefully weigh the benefits and costs of any further easing of monetary policy.", "description": "The Bank of Japan on Thursday warned the country's banking system is becoming increasingly fragile as financial institutions boost risky lending and investment in an environment of prolonged ultra-low interest rates.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444380633&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0CD", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
