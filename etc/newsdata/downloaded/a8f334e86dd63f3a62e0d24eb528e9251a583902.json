Lawmakers believe it would harm the Republic of Ireland\u2019s all-island economy, that it lacks detail, is not operational and puts the deal under custody of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\n\n\nThe @Europarl_EN has three fundamental problems with the UK\u2019s latest proposal:\n\n\n\n1\u20e3 Harms Ireland\u2019s all-island economy\n\n2\u20e3 lack of detail/not operational\n\n3\u20e3 puts deal under custody of DUP\n\n\n\nThis is repackaging old, bad ideashttps://t.co/z7rDgCAmh6 \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) October 3, 2019\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has cast major doubts about the viability of the UK government's proposals. Tusk, who spoke to both the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Johnson on Thursday afternoon, warned that despite remaining open to discussions, they are \u201cstill unconvinced\u201d by the UK\u2019s Brexit plans.\n\n\n\nToday I had two phone calls on #Brexit, first with Dublin then with London.\n\nMy message to Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar: We stand fully behind Ireland.\n\nMy message to PM @BorisJohnson: We remain open but still unconvinced. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 3, 2019\n\nJohnson submitted the potential deal to the EU on Wednesday, as part of a last-ditch effort to keep his promise to leave the union by the end of the month. It would see the contentious Irish backstop replaced with electronic and a \u201cnumber of physical\u201d customs checks at traders\u2019 premises and other supply chain locations away from the border.\n\nIf ratified, it would mean that Northern Ireland would remain in the same 'regulatory zone' as the Republic of Ireland for goods traded across the north-south border.\n\nHowever, it would also stay in the same customs territory as mainland UK - not the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member state. Therefore, checks would be necessary on some trade, both between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between Northern Ireland and mainland UK\n\nAlso on rt.com Bye bye Irish backstop: BoJo\u2019s final offer to the EU\n\nAddressing Parliament on Thursday, Johnson pleaded with British lawmakers to back his proposal and avoid a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit.\n\nJohnson has come under fire for trying to temporarily shut down Parliament, a move which many viewed as an attempt to push through his Brexit plan without parliamentary interference. He previously vowed to take his country out of the bloc by October 31, \u201cdo or die,\u201d but now claims that leaving without a deal would be \u201ca failure of statecraft for which all parties would be held responsible.\"\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
