to Country before the NRL Grand Final on October 6\n\n'The embarrassing performance of Ryan James in his speech last weekend was offensive and weighed heavily on this decision,' Mr Thomas said.\n\nMr

I'm human like anybody else'.\n\n'I sincerely apologise to Ryan James, and his family, for any hurt my comments caused. It was a stupid thing to say, and it's not how I think or who I am,' he said.\n\n'During sponsorship negotiations with the Titans, I overreacted and unfairly brought Ryan into a situation that had nothing to do with him.'\n\nThe court ordered TFH to file a defence by December 13, and for the parties to attempt a settlement through mediation by February 28.\n\nMr Thomas' lawyers have field a defence and he is expected to fight the claims.", "description": "Brett Thomas, 52, and his Gold Coast firm TFH Hire Services are being sued by former marketing manager\u00a0Ashleigh Martinovic, 24, for $815,793 for sexual harassment.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/01/19942168-0-image-a-98_1571531894778.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
