In this case, we thoroughly reviewed [the facts], and we believe this decision best protects our users.\"\n\nThe app is still available on the Google Play Store, and is viewable through its website.\n\nCupertino initially dragged its feet last week in approving the app, before abruptly reversing course and removing it on Thursday.\n\nTwo years ago, Apple ripped the VPN apps from its Chinese app store.\n\nApple makes around $3 billion in revenue from China each month.\n\nEarlier this week, Quartz reported Apple had removed the ability for users in Hong Kong to type the Taiwanese flag emoji in iOS 13.1. Two days later, the masthead found itself on the end of a banning, after Beijing asked for the Quartz app to be removed from the app store for mainland China. Apple complied.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Charles Mok says HKmap.live is used by innocents to avoid police violence.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/13/5c8baa3d-c8ba-46ae-a96b-1f4e33a007ea/thumbnail/770x578/e16d21fe7bae9beafd98bfb0e778936b/hongkongskyscrapers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
