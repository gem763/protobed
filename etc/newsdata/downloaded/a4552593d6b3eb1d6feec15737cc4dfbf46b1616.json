Today, Elizabeth Warren was asked if her health reform plan would raise taxes on the middle class. In keeping with every other time she\u2019s been asked this question, Warren dodged.\n\n\u201cSo, yes or no, should middle-class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?\u201d NBC News\u2019 Ali Vitali asked.\n\n\u201cYou know, you may remember that I spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle-class families go broke,\u201d Warren replied.\n\nI can\u2019t bring myself to transcribe the rest of her minute-long answer to a yes or no question. You\u2019ve probably heard it enough times to recite it yourself by now. She ended her spiel with, \u201cWe should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle-class families, for hard-working people costs are going to go down.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not the same as taxes not going up,\u201d Velshi pointed out.\n\n\u201cWhat matters to families is cost,\u201d Warren replied.\n\nVelshi tried again: \u201cSo do you think then that Americans are willing to pay a little bit more in taxes if, generally, the household costs are going down?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that families care about what their costs are,\u201d Warren replied, still refusing to use the T-word. Then she added, \u201cOver and over and over.\u201d It seemed like a not-so-subtle hint to Velshi, i.e. you can ask me this same question over and over and I\u2019m never going to admit middle-class taxes will go up.\n\nGood for Velshi for at least trying to breach this wall, but she isn\u2019t the first to try and fail. Last Tuesday night, Elizabeth Warren appeared on Stephen Colbert\u2019s show. Colbert begged her to admit the truth about middle-class taxes going up instead of offering the same answer she has been giving for months. Warren refused and instead offered a two-minute-long filibuster. Colbert gave up and used what little time he had left in the segment to ask a few other questions.\n\nThe thing is, Colbert (and probably Velshi) wouldn\u2019t be arguing this point with Warren at all if she\u2019d just admit that middle-class taxes would go up. They aren\u2019t going to challenge her on the claim that overall costs would go down, they just want her to be straightforward on taxes. But she won\u2019t do it.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think Warren keeps this up even if it isn\u2019t fooling anyone in the media. The difference between premiums and taxes is that many people, at present, aren\u2019t paying the full cost of their premiums directly to an insurer. Instead, their employer is shouldering a portion of the cost. Even so, they may have some options about what they want to pay when they renew each year. They can select a Cadillac plan that covers a high percentage of everything or a more modest plan that covers a bit less. But no one gets to make a choice about what taxes they pay. Once taxes go up, you\u2019re stuck paying or facing off with the IRS over failing to do so.\n\nAgain, Warren could make the case that not having a choice is a better system for everyone, but her refusal to admit the truth about taxes on the middle-class suggests she doesn\u2019t quite believe it.", "description": "\"So, yes or no, should middle-class Americans expect their taxes to go up...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warren-Velshi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
