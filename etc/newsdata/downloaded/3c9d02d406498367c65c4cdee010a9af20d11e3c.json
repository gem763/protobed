So it's not because he got fired,\" Combs said. \"This did not happen because he was fired. When he showed up to work he was already enraged.\"\n\nSue Ogrocki/AP\n\nCombs said the condition of Ator's Odessa home when investigators searched it on Saturday also indicated the person who lived there was in the throes of mental instability.\n\n\"I can tell you the conditions reflect what we believe his mental state was going into this,\" Combs said. \"He was on a long spiral of going down. He didn't wake up Saturday morning and walk into his company and then it happened. He went into that company in trouble. He's probably been in trouble for a while.\"\n\nThe shootings unfolded at 3:15 p.m. local time on Saturday, about 15 minutes after Ator called the FBI's National Tip Line, Combs said.\n\nThe first victim in the rampage was a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper who pulled the suspect over for failing to signal before making a turn, Gerke said. As the trooper approached the car, Ator allegedly opened fire with an AR-type assault rifle, wounding the trooper, he said.\n\nErnst Villanueva via AFP/Getty Images\n\nGerke said the trooper had no prior knowledge of the phone calls Ator made to law enforcement before pulling the suspect over.\n\nAtor then allegedly drove around in his vehicle randomly firing at victims in 20 different locations, including a car dealership and outside a movie theater, police said.\n\nThe victims killed ranged in age from 15 to 57.\n\nOne of the victims was Mary Granado, a 29-year-old U.S. Postal Service worker, who Ator allegedly shot to death during a carjacking, Gerke said.\n\nThe suspect allegedly ditched his car and stole Granado's postal service van after killing her, Gerke said. He continued driving around the Odessa area, firing at people at random, the chief said.\n\nMario A Leal via Reuters\n\nThe alleged killer then sped toward the Cinergy center, a local entertainment complex that includes a cineplex and a laser-tag range.\n\nGerke said the carnage could have been much worse had the police not killed Ator before he got inside a crowded movie theater.\n\nA cellphone video taken by a witness showed the suspect speeding toward a police roadblock outside the theater before a police officer in a marked SUV rammed the stolen postal van on the driver's side, causing it to spin out and stop. Within seconds, police opened fire on the van, killing the driver inside, Gerke said.\n\nGerke said the motive for the shooting may never be known because Ator is no longer alive to answer questions.\n\nInvestigators are also trying to determine how Ator obtained the AR-type weapon he used in the rampage.\n\nNot only did the Odessa gunman have a criminal history...\n\n\n\n...he also previously failed a gun purchase background check in Texas...\n\n\n\n...& he didn\u2019t go thru a background check for the gun he used in Odessa.\n\n\n\nWe must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands. https://t.co/vgrqcHtBtF \u2014 Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) September 2, 2019\n\nTexas Gov. Gregg Abbott posted a message on Twitter on Monday saying Ator not only had a criminal record, but he had also once failed a background check when he tried to purchase a gun.\n\n\"He didn\u2019t go thru a background check for the gun he used in Odessa,\" Abbott tweeted. \"We must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands.\"\n\nAccording to online records in the Texas Department of Public Safety database, Ator did have a minor criminal history, as first reported Monday by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper.\n\nThe online records show that Ator was arrested on Aug. 1, 2001, for evading arrest and criminal trespass in McLennan County, Texas, when he was 18.\n\nAtor pleaded guilty to the two misdemeanor charges and was sentenced to 24 months of court probation, according to the records.\n\nGerke said Odessa police also had several contacts with Ator for minor offenses, but added that wouldn't have prevented him from obtaining a license for a gun.\n\nRick Lobo via Reuters\n\nJohn Wester, a special agent for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, confirmed on Monday that Ator did fail a firearms background check.\n\n\"The background check was run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NIC system did work. He applied to get a gun. He was denied a gun,\" said Wester, who declined to say why Ator was rejected.\n\nHe said the investigation into how Ator got the weapon he allegedly used in the massacre remains under investigation.\n\nGerke also said that overnight, police learned about another victim wounded in the rampage, bringing the number of people injured to 23.\n\n\"It was a 70-year-old female who had been struck by shrapnel while in her car,\" Gerke said. \"She took herself to the hospital and she was treated and released. So that's good news.\"\n\nThe mass shooting came exactly four weeks after 22 people were gunned down at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and another nine people killed the next day by another gunman in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe Odessa-Midland rampage was the fifth high-profile mass shooting in Texas since September 2017 that have left a combined 72 people dead and 79 wounded.\n\nThe shooting also came a day before eight new laws that ease restrictions on guns went into the effect in Texas, including prohibiting landlords from banning tenants from having guns in their apartments and allowing people licensed to carry concealed weapons to have firearms in churches and other places of worship.", "description": "Seven people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a series of shootings near Odessa in western Texas.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/odessa-3-rt-er-190901_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
