Since 2014, the Kurds have fought alongside the U.S. in defeating the Islamic State in Syria, and Trump's move was decried at home and abroad as a betrayal of an ally.\n\nFaced with unrelenting criticism, Trump said Monday he was putting new sanctions on Turkey, halting trade negotiations and raising steel tariffs in an effort to pressure Ankara to stop its offensive. Vice President Mike Pence also said Trump was sending him to the Middle East because the president was concerned about instability in the region.\n\n___\n\nTrump orders Turkey sanctions; US scrambles for Syria exit\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Targeting Turkey's economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions Monday aimed at restraining the Turks' assault against Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria - an assault Turkey began after Trump announced he was moving U.S. troops out of the way.\n\nThe United States also called on Turkey to stop the invasion and declare a ceasefire, and Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O'Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations. Pence said Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group's first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.\n\n\"President Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of American wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate ceasefire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence,\" Pence said.\n\nThe Americans were scrambling for Syria's exits, a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the Islamic State group, whose violent takeover of Syrian and Iraqi lands five years ago was the reason American forces came in the first place.\n\nTrump said the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops who had been partnering with local Kurdish fighters to battle IS in northern Syria are leaving the country. They will remain in the Middle East, he said, to \"monitor the situation\" and to prevent a revival of IS - a goal that even Trump's allies say has become much harder as a result of the U.S. pullout.\n\n___\n\nTexas officer charged with murder, resigns after shooting\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - A white Fort Worth police officer who shot and killed a black woman through a back window of her home while responding to a call about an open front door was charged with murder on Monday evening after resigning from the force.\n\nAaron Dean, 34, was jailed on $200,000 bond after the police chief said he acted without justification and would have been fired if he hadn't quit.\n\nPolice bodycam video showed Dean approaching the door of the home where Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was caring for her 8-year-old nephew early Saturday. He then walked around the side of the house, pushed through a gate into the fenced-off backyard and fired through the glass a split-second after shouting at Jefferson to show her hands.\n\nDean was not heard identifying himself as police on the video, and Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus said there was no sign Dean or the other officer who responded even knocked on the front door.\n\n\"Nobody looked at this video and said that there's any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,\" Kraus said.\n\n___\n\nCalifornia regulator criticizes utility over power outages\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - California's top utility regulator blasted Pacific Gas and Electric on Monday for what she called \"failures in execution\" during the largest planned power outage in state history to avoid wildfires that she said, \"created an unacceptable situation that should never be repeated.\"\n\nThe agency ordered a series of corrective actions, including a goal of restoring power within 12 hours, not the utility's current 48-hour goal.\n\n\"The scope, scale, complexity, and overall impact to people's lives, businesses, and the economy of this action cannot be understated,\" California Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer wrote in a letter to PG&E CEO Bill Johnson.\n\nPG&E last week took the unprecedented step of cutting power to more than 700,000 customers, affecting an estimated 2.1 million Californians. The company said it did it because of dangerous wind forecasts but acknowledged that its execution was poor.\n\nIts website frequently crashed, and many people said they did not receive enough warning that the power was going out.\n\n___\n\nFormer White House adviser objected to ambassador's ouster\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser on Russia, told House impeachment investigators behind closed doors Monday that she had strongly and repeatedly objected to the ouster earlier this year of former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, according to a person familiar with the testimony.\n\nYovanovitch testified Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to fire her.\n\nHill made the remarks as she testified for more than 10 hours in the Democratic inquiry, which is probing Trump's pleas to Ukrainian officials for investigations into political rival Joe Biden's family and into the country's involvement in the 2016 presidential election. The person requested anonymity to discuss the confidential interview.\n\nThe interview is one of what could eventually become dozens of closed-door depositions in the impeachment probe. There are five more scheduled this week, mostly with State Department officials, though it is unclear if they will all appear after Trump declared he wouldn't cooperate with the probe.\n\nWhile interviews have focused on the interactions with Ukraine, the probe could broaden as soon as next week to include interviews with White House budget officials who may be able to shed light on whether military aid was withheld from Ukraine as Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pushed for the investigations.\n\n___\n\nMore victims, more damage found in Japan typhoon aftermath\n\nNAGANO, Japan (AP) - More victims and more damage have been found in typhoon-hit areas of central and northern Japan, where rescue crews are searching for people still missing.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe told a parliamentary session Tuesday that typhoon-related deaths have risen to 53, with 20 others missing. Lawmakers prayed in silence for the victims before starting the session.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis hit Japan's main island Saturday, unleashing strong winds and dumping historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers in central and northern Japan to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power.\n\nBusinesses appeared nearly back to normal in central Tokyo but paralyzed in Nagano and other hard-hit areas still inundated. Residents elsewhere started cleaning their houses.\n\n___\n\nProtests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatists\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) - Riot police engaged in a running battle with angry protesters outside Barcelona's airport Monday after Spain's Supreme Court convicted 12 separatist leaders of illegally promoting the wealthy Catalonia region's independence and sentenced nine of them to prison.\n\nOfficers fired foam bullets and used batons against thousands of protesters who converged on the airport after the verdict was announced in Madrid. Protesters fought back by throwing objects, spraying dark clouds with fire extinguishers, and breaking windows during clashes that lasted into the night.\n\nRegional emergency service SEM said 75 people were treated for injuries at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport. Spain's airport operator, AENA, said at least 108 flights were canceled.\n\nPolice also clashed with angry crowds late Monday night in downtown Barcelona. They used batons, and sounds similar to the firing projectiles were heard.\n\nNine of the 12 Catalan politicians and activists were found guilty of sedition and given prison sentences of nine to 13 years. Four of them were additionally convicted of misuse of public funds.\n\n___\n\n'Nothing-burger': US-China truce leaves big issues for later\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump heralded a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks, and markets rallied in relief over a de-escalation in tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nBut closer inspection suggests there isn't much substance, at least not yet, to the temporary truce Trump announced Friday at the White House after the U.S. and China wrapped up their 13th round of trade talks.\n\nYes, Trump agreed to suspend a tariff hike scheduled for Tuesday on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. And the president said the Chinese agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.\n\nBut nothing's on paper and details are scarce. China's state-run media hasn't even mentioned the promise to buy all those soybeans and other agricultural products.\n\nAnd the negotiators have delayed dealing with the toughest issues for future talks. Meanwhile, the U.S. is still scheduled to target another $160 billion in Chinese goods Dec. 15, a move that would extend Trump's tariffs to virtually everything China ships to the United States.\n\n___\n\nLatest deadly police shooting raises questions about tactics\n\nOn any given day in the U.S., police respond to thousands of non-emergency calls asking them to check on someone's home. Most such visits prove uneventful. A few, like one over the weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, end up with someone getting killed by police.\n\nExperts in law enforcement training and tactics say there is a multitude of questions raised by the shooting of 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, who was cut down at her home by a bullet fired through a window by an officer responding to a call in the middle of the night about her front door being open.\n\nAmong the questions: Did the neighbor who made the call see or hear something that raised alarm bells? What, if anything, happened that made the officer believe there was an imminent threat? Why not just knock on the door and announce that a police officer was there?\n\nExperts say there's no one correct way for officers to respond to such calls. It can depend on a number of variables. At police academies around the country, recruits spend hours being put through simulations of a variety of calls designed to show them ways to de-escalate situations or prevent unjustified shootings.\n\nIn this case, Fort Worth police and the mayor said Monday that there was nothing to justify the officer firing his weapon; the police chief said he was prepared to fire the officer, Aaron Dean, 34, but he resigned first. Dean had been on the force for a year and a half.\n\n___\n\nStrasburg Ks 12, Nats top Cards 8-1; 1 win from World Series\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Stephen Strasburg took his turn silencing the Cardinals' struggling bats, Nationals postseason star Howie Kendrick doubled three times and drove in three more runs, and Washington moved one win from the city's first World Series appearance in 86 years by beating St. Louis 8-1 Monday night to take a 3-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.\n\nAfter Nationals starters An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and Max Scherzer flirted with no-hitters in the first two games of the best-of-seven series, Strasburg wasn't quite that untouchable: He allowed a double in the second inning, six later singles and one unearned run. Still, he was rather dominant for seven innings, striking out 12 batters and finishing off each one with an off-speed pitch.\n\nThe Cardinals, quite simply, can't hit in this NLCS: They have a grand total of two runs and 11 hits through three games. Washington's three starters have a combined ERA - no calculator necessary for this one - of 0.00.\n\nYes, that's zero-point-zero-zero.\n\nNow it's Patrick Corbin's chance to see if he can match his rotation-mates. The $140 million lefty will start for the Nationals in Game 4 on Tuesday night, when they can close out a sweep at home. Rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson will be on the mound for the Cardinals.", "description": "Turkey widens invasion as Syrian army returns to northeastAKCAKALE, Turkey (AP) - Syrian government troops moved into towns and villages in northeastern...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
