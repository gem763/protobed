If, as expected, lawmakers reject the government's attempt to call an election, he said he would quit on Oct. 31 - the day Britain is currently due to leave the EU.", "description": "Britain's House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who played a key role in the three-year Brexit crisis, said on Monday he would stand down from the role.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104266210-RTR3DE3S.jpg?v=1529452221"}
