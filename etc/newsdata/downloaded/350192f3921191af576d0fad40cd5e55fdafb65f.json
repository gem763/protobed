Google\u2019s Pixel lineup isn\u2019t the easiest to suss out if you\u2019re unfamiliar, and it\u2019s about to get a little more complicated next week when the Pixel 4 is announced.\n\nThe Pixel 3A is the more budget-friendly version of the flagship Pixel 3. The same goes for the Pixel 3A XL, but it has a bigger battery and screen. It, too, is $50 off of its normal price. For the things it lacks from the more expensive variant, like the high-end build materials, the Snapdragon 845, and the wide-angle selfie cam, it retains most of its key selling points: the camera performance, an OLED screen, Android 10 support, and compatibility with all US carriers.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) is $189 at Walmart. This is just a $10 discount, but it\u2019s a deal that\u2019s not available at other retailers. Apple recently released watchOS 6, and you\u2019ll be able to update this model with the latest software.\n\neBay is hosting a sale today on games, gaming accessories, and other tech. There\u2019s, frankly, too much to list here, but below, you\u2019ll find a few of the highlights. You can check out all of the offerings over at its landing page.\n\nA callback to yesterday\u2019s best deals\n\nAmazon\u2019s deal on the excellent Beats Powerbeats Pro truly wireless headphones just keeps going. It started earlier this week, and to my surprise, it\u2019s still available. We\u2019ve seen $50 off sales like these before, but this one sticks out because you can save on every color that\u2019s available (black, ivory, moss, navy).\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a set of truly wireless earbuds that you can rely on for good sound, comfort, and long-lasting battery life, this model is your next.", "description": "You can save $50 on the Google Pixel 3A or Pixel 3A XL at Best Buy, Amazon, and B&H Photo. Other deals worth your attention include Walmart\u2019s $10 discount on the Apple Watch Series 3, and eBay\u2019s sale on games and gaming accessories.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-3-kfIF4Bqt1bBKktCHD0yIyWCc=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16213696/vpavic_190503_3404_0040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
