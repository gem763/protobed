And the performance wasn\u2019t up to the standard of England\u2019s comprehensive wins over Ireland and Italy in its last warmups.\n\nBut coach Eddie Jones was happy, he said. Happy to get out of Sapporo with a win, a bonus point and no major injuries at the start of a tough group campaign that will see the 2003 World Cup winner face Argentina and France back-to-back in its last pool games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased. We came here to get five points, we got five points. We got no injuries. We know we can play better,\u201d Jones said.\n\nOne overwhelming positive for England was the performance of Tuilagi, who relished taking on the Tongans.\n\nHis tries showed the range of his talents.\n\nHe bashed his way through a pack of Tongan defenders for his first. Then he skipped clear out wide for his second after England created an overlap on the left and wing Jonny May fed him an inside ball.\n\nBut England didn\u2019t secure the bonus point until three minutes from the end through replacement hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie. Hooker Jamie George had England\u2019s third try early in the second half from a rolling maul.\n\nEngland generally played within itself, maybe with an eye on those bigger battles later in the pool.\n\nJones, as he noted, has been to a few World Cups. He coached Australia to the 2003 final, was an assistant coach of South Africa\u2019s title-winning team in 2007, and masterminded Japan\u2019s stunning upset of the Springboks four years ago.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup is not a 100-meter sprint,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come out of the blocks and be fantastic. You have to be steady and you have to improve.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s errors cost it a more comprehensive victory. Flanker Sam Underhill dropped a pass five meters out with the English lining up to score early in the second half. Henry Slade threw a pass into touch when all he had to do was find fullback Elliot Daly for a try.\n\nEngland also had two tries ruled out by the Television Match Official in the first half after players went over the tryline but didn\u2019t ground the ball.\n\nBut the English got what they wanted to lead Pool C and came out in one piece against a Tongan team with a reputation for bruising physicality.\n\nJones was also victorious on his return to Japan. Japan\u2019s former coach was given a huge cheer before kickoff when his name and face came up on the big screen.\n\nTuilagi\u2019s tries in the 24th and 31st minutes put England in control for good after Tonga, ranked outside the world\u2019s top 10, had held the No. 3-ranked English to 3-3 through the first quarter.\n\nTuilagi threw off Tongan defenders and muscled his way over after a five-meter scrum and a move down the short side. Tuilagi\u2019s score was confirmed by the TMO just a minute after England had a try ruled out by the TMO because Underhill didn\u2019t ground. Tuilagi\u2019s midfield break also started the move for Underhill to go over and the bustling center was clearly England\u2019s best player.\n\n\u201cWe tried to contain him,\u201d said Tonga captain Siale Piatau, who played opposite Tuilagi in midfield. \u201cBut obviously when you have someone like Manu\u2019s talent\u2026\u201d\n\nThere were four TMO referrals in total in the first half, one to award Tuilagi\u2019s first try, two to disallow tries, and the other to check the legality of a crunching tackle by Tonga flanker Sione Kalamafoni on Anthony Watson. The TMO ruled it was fine.\n\nThe forwards took George over in the corner for the third try and England showed two flashes of backline brilliance right at the end when backs Watson and Jonathan Joseph made searing breaks. Watson\u2019s 70-meter run was wasted by Slade\u2019s loose pass, but Joseph used his run to put Cowan-Dickie clear for the bonus-point clinching try in the last few minutes.\n\nOnly then was the job done.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "England was relatively comfortable in beating Tonga 35-3 with a four-try bonus point at the Rugby World Cup on Sunday without the former champion being compelling in the opening game of its campaign.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_england_tonga_94712_c0-115-2715-1697_s1770x1032.jpg?c29ad6ea4c2b5faf60146ce679276e91a4ab8c38", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
