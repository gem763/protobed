She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied, 'Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me'.\n\n'I asked whether she would like to say, 'Good evening, James' or 'Good evening, Mr Bond' and she chose the latter, knowing the Bond films. Within minutes, I was back in Edward's office delivering the good news to Danny \u2013 I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen's only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line.'\n\nThe Queen had only one request for her appearance with James Bond at the opening of the 2012 London Olympics \u2013 that she could deliver the line: 'Good evening, Mr Bond'\n\nAngela Kelly writes: 'Within minutes, I was back in Edward's office delivering the good news to Danny \u2013 I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen's only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line'.

I went to the bird, picked it up and solemnly told her it was dead.\n\n'She looked horrified as I walked towards her and as she took the bird from my hands she realised I had been winding her up. It was really a stuffed toy. 'April Fool', I said with a mischievous grin on my face and she had only two words for me \u2013 'You're sacked'.'\n\nMrs Kelly, the Queen's dresser of 25 years, left, tells how she was called to a meeting with Boyle and private secretary Edward Young to discuss the idea in 2011.

And yes, I am that flunky ... as we share the same shoe size it makes the most sense this way.'\n\nMrs Kelly also dispelled reports that the Queen was offended by Michelle Obama putting her arm around her during a 2009 reception at Buckingham Palace.\n\nShe pointed out that the Queen had responded the same way and said there was 'an instant and mutual warmth' between the two women.\n\nRead the full article in Hello!
