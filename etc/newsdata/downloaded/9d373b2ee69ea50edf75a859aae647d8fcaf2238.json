Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the government has not offered any proof of life or health for Ferrer since October 4. He disappeared from prison records at the facility holding him two weeks after his arrest; his family has not been able to find any proof that he is being held in any prison on the island.\n\nFerrer is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), believed to be the largest pro-democratic dissident organization on the island.\n\n#Cuba Dictan prisi\u00f3n preventiva para @jdanielferrer sin que Fiscal\u00eda emita documento oficial. Dicen en Instrucci\u00f3n Penal que no lo pueden ver porque fue trasladado para Prisi\u00f3n Aguadores y all\u00ed tampoco dejan verlo. Tememos por su vida y tambi\u00e9n por los otros 3 activistas\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\uddfa pic.twitter.com/ejdx358AXl \u2014 Katerine Mojena (@KataCuba) October 11, 2019\n\nFerrer was arrested in his home in eastern Santiago de Cuba and told, according to wife Nelva Izmaray Ortega, that the government would fabricate criminal charges to keep him in prison if he insisted on continuing to demand the communist government respect the human rights of its people.\n\nThis weekend, Ortega and three of Ferrer\u2019s children took the streets of Santiago to demand information on his status, resulting in a brutal beating and arrest by Cuban state agents.\n\nThe U.N. OHCHR issued a demand for \u201curgent action\u201d Tuesday in response to a request from Cuban Prisoners Defenders, an organization that advocates for the rights of political prisoners on the island. The group published the letter in full on Twitter.\n\nThe OHCHR \u201chas activated the procedure for urgent action, sending a note to the State party in which it expresses its grave concern for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda and has required urgent action by the State to seek and localize him,\u201d the letter reads. It demands that Cuba give the family either confirmation of where Ferrer is and his health status immediately or, in the event that the state does not know where he is, adequately explain why it does not. The deadline given is November 12.\n\nThe letter notes that Ferrer was initially arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison in the \u201cBlack Spring\u201d repression of 2003, but ultimately freed after serving seven years. Since then, \u201cMr. Ferrer Garc\u00eda has been arrested on over 100 occasions without charges, more than once a month in the past eight years.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials have not charged him with any crime, and there is no evidence that he committed any.\n\nAdding to the illegitimate nature of the actions against Ferrer, the United Nations noted that Cuban police had threatened neighbors to \u201ctestify falsely against Mr. Ferrer Garc\u00eda with the objective of creating a criminal cause of action against him.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. also details that, following his disappearance from prison records, UNPACU allies filed a habeas corpus petition in the Cuban court system, but \u201cthe judicial response \u2026 did not offer freedom or any other information about the whereabouts of Mr. Ferrer Garc\u00eda or the motives for his detention.\u201d\n\nCuba is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\nHis family is particularly concerned about his health status. Upon his arrest, Ferrer was receiving treatment for an ulcer and had an infected tooth, broken by a beating he received during his last arrest prior to his most recent one.\n\nFerrer\u2019s last arrest occurred in September. UNPACU had planned a mass protest that month to observe the feast day of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba. As the group had branded the protest a \u201csunflower march,\u201d urging members to use the flower as a symbol of peace, the Cuban government outlawed the sale of sunflowers prior to the scheduled date of the event. Police then began sweeping the homes of dissidents and preemptively arresting them. Police arrested dozens and vandalized their homes, in some cases looting their kitchens for hard-to-find items such as milk, cooking oil, or eggs.\n\nCuban officials also ransacked UNPACU\u2019s headquarters in Santiago, stealing laptops and food items, in late August following the publication of a detailed list of political prisoners on the island by Cuban Prisoners Defenders, in cooperation with UNPACU.\n\nOrtega, Ferrer\u2019s wife, took tp the streets of Santiago on Friday along with two of Ferrer\u2019s adolescent children \u2013 F\u00e1tima Victoria Ferrer Cantillo, 14, and Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Cantillo, 17 \u2013 and the couple\u2019s four-month-old son Daniel Jos\u00e9 Ferrer Ortega holding signs demanding proof of life for the UNPACU leader. The group was protesting peacefully, without any disruption to pedestrian or other traffic, when Cuban state police arrived on the scene and pummeled Ortega and the two teen children.\n\n\u201cThey twisted my arms, they put handcuffs on me, they tightened them very hard and punched me in the stomach so that I couldn\u2019t speak or scream or do anything,\u201d the younger Jos\u00e9 Daniel told Mart\u00ed News, adding that they also attacked his sister leaving her bruised. All three were arrested.\n\nOrtega said that, upon her arrest, officers told her, \u201cShut up, shut up, wait until we\u2019re alone, we\u2019ll take your son \u2026 and we\u2019ll beat you so hard you\u2019ll need therapy.\u201d\n\nThe group spent hours in temporary detention and were released on Saturday after being publicly abused. Authorities did not file any charges against them. The incident was caught on video, published by UNPACU on Youtube.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has demanded Ferrer\u2019s freedom.\n\nWe call on the Cuban regime to immediately release human rights defender @jdanielferrer, arrested October 1 on false pretenses. The United States and #humanrights organizations around the world are monitoring Ferrer's case \u2014 one of more than 100 political prisoners held in Cuba. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cJos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer\u2019s case is one more example of the Castro regime\u2019s continuous and flagrant violation of human rights, which has recently escalated into a wave of repression against freedoms of speech, expression, and religion,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an October 18 statement. \u201cThe United States will not allow these abuses against the Cuban people to go unnoticed or unanswered. We will continue to increase sanctions and trade restrictions to diminish the resources available to the Cuban regime, which uses its income to suppress its own citizens and to prop up other regimes with shameful human rights records, including the former Maduro regime in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The United Nations demanded in a letter Tuesday that the communist regime in Cuba reveal the whereabouts of Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-531074374-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
