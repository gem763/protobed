But Giuliani confirmed to The Daily Beast that he also briefed another diplomat: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. President Trump\u2019s lawyer said he briefed both Volker (whom he referred to as the \u201cmain one\u201d in terms of his State contacts) and Sondland on multiple conference calls earlier this year about his progress in pursuing a Ukraine investigation.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly an unknown topic for Sondland. The ambassador was also closely involved with the Trump phone call to Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI spoke with both of them before and after this conversation,\u201d Sondland told Ukraine\u2019s state-run news agency after the phone call. \u201cThe conversation was very successful. They found a common language immediately.\u201d The two leaders discussed Ukraine\u2019s civil war, energy security, and \u201cthe rule of law,\u201d Sondland said in July.", "description": "", "authors": ["Banco Etal", "Thedailybeast.Com Impeachment-Inquiry-Us-Ambassador-Roped-Into-Rudy-Giulianis-Quest-To-Smear-Biden"], "top_image": ""}
