I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s irresponsible or not to have a child, because only by some mysterious, variable quotient is the desire to have a child even rational. Like most of the big choices we make in life, wanting that kind of relationship is largely pre-thought in origin, an emotional instinct felt in the heart and gut before it travels northward.\n\nImage\n\nBut I think you\u2019re also asking something more essential about how we think and feel through the personal choices we make in a world that feels out of our control, one that is shaped largely by the decisions of others more powerful than ourselves. On the one hand, there\u2019s the sheer luxury of having such a choice, with all its implicit optimism and hopefulness; on the other, the gravity of it, given our deepening pessimism. Could humanity\u2019s midnight come in our children\u2019s generation, or even our own? No one wants to be the father in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road,\u201d roaming post-apocalyptic America with his son and a gun with two bullets in it, waiting for the moment it all becomes too much to bear.\n\nAnd here I wonder if we could agree that this isn\u2019t the best moment to catch up on doomsday dystopian fiction? Not because of its futility (in fact, many such novels end on an oddly cathartic, \u201cwe\u2019ll all pull through in the end somehow\u201d note), but because I believe that deferring to a speculative future rather than focusing on the imperative of the present moment doesn\u2019t help us. Which is not to say that you should simply \u201cget on with it,\u201d or allow others to dismiss your anxiety or make you feel it is unwarranted, because it is the natural response of any intelligent person to the irrevocability of the decision you are making. You should listen to your fear and get under the rock of its reasons.\n\nThe fact is, even in the best of times, parenthood is an alarming prospect. In our culture, parents \u2014 perhaps mothers especially \u2014 are inculcated in fear. Here\u2019s a short, quaint-feeling list of things I worried about, back when I had a baby, in comparatively less dire 2015: phthalates, sulfates, bisphenol A, pesticides, carbon-monoxide fumes, the leaching lead pipes in my Victorian-era home, crib bumpers, plush toys, the flame-retardant chemicals sprayed on every stroller sold in America, high food-chain fish, turkey sandwiches, unpasteurized cheese, even that my own bad mood could be potentially harmful to my daughter\u2019s delicate brain chemistry. And then there\u2019s sudden infant death syndrome. Because putting an infant down to sleep on their stomach or side increases the risk of sudden death, babies are advised to sleep only on their backs, a position inhospitable to sleep, and so they must be swaddled, wrapped and bound like a mental patient. I had finally, possibly, mastered this form of textile origami when one of the baby apps I had installed on my phone sent me a push notification: \u201cSwaddling Linked to Sudden Death.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWalking through life with curiosity and a sense of investment and joy in no way requires having a child,\u201d writes one of our new advice columnists.", "authors": ["Megan O Grady"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/t-magazine/art/culture-therapist-slide-S3JG/culture-therapist-slide-S3JG-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
