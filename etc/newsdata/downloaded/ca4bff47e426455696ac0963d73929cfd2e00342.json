Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn\u2019t true when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that that said that was true,\u201d Castro said in what appeared to be a prepared attack on the front-runner for the presidential nomination.\n\nMoments earlier in the third debate, which was held in Houston and moderated by anchors from ABC News and Univision, Biden had touted his plan\u2019s coverage.\n\n\u201cEvery single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately and we\u2019re talking four, six, 10 years, depending on who you\u2019re talking about, before we get to Medicare for All, come on.\u201d\n\nCastro sensed an opening and pounced.\n\n\u201cI grew up with a grandmother who had Type 2 diabetes and watched her condition get worse and worse, but that whole time she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available. If they choose to hold on to a strong solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that, but the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in, they would automatically be enrolled,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have to buy in. That\u2019s a big difference, because Barack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered, he wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden, left, and Juli\u00e1n Castro.

They do not have to buy in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just said that,\u201d Castro shot back.. \u201cYou just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. You said they would have to buy in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you qualify for Medicaid, it would automatically \u2014\u201d Biden protested as Castro continued to talk over him.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro pressed on. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago? I mean, I can\u2019t believe you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying that they don\u2019t have to, I mean you\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\nAs he has in previous debates, Biden \u2014 whose memory and command of facts has been questioned by some Democrats \u2014 seemed incredulous. \u201cI said anyone like a grandmother who has no money, they\u2019re automatically enrolled,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not,\u201d Castro shot back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nThe exchange did not sit well with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cThis is why the presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d Buttigieg interjected. \u201cThis reminds everyone what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other, poking at each other and telling each other that my plan, your plan\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s called a Democratic primary election,\u201d Castro shot back. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for, it\u2019s an election.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s rapid response team highlighted Castro\u2019s former praise for Biden.\n\nLater during the debate, during another clash between on the subject of immigration, Castro returned to the question of Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but doesn\u2019t want to answer questions,\u201d Castro said.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Castro argued that he was \"fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama\" better than the former vice president.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n2ZwOSjpGhtzXUMpPzcZWw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d13a8e20-d5c5-11e9-9eeb-c54d966a7eeb", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
