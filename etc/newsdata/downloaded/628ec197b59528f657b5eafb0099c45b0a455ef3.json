But, says our critic, not even mirrored pods and sci-fi islands can shake the feeling that these are relics from a bygone age\n\nMonkeys swinging through assault courses, tigers prowling along caged walkways in the sky, polar bears taking centre stage in a giant copy of a Yukon harbour as crowds look on from a simulated boat deck \u2013 the architecture of zoos seems to have come a long way since the king of England first locked a bunch of lions in the Tower of London and charged the public a few hand-hammered pennies to see them. But has it left the 13th century far enough behind?\n\n\n\nThe Tower of London\u2019s grim menagerie, which entertained paying punters for an astonishing 600 years, came into being after Henry III received three lions as a gift from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1235. They were meant to be a living embodiment of the royal arms of England, and the tower seemed a suitably fortified place to put them. Over the years, the royal collection grew to include elephants, rhinos, hyenas and a polar bear from Norway that was kept on a leash so long that it could catch fish from the Thames. It lasted until the Zoological Society of London was established in 1826, and the animals moved to the slightly more humane surrounds of London zoo in Regent\u2019s Park.\n\nWith the birth of the modern zoo came the dawn of zoo architecture, spawning a peculiar kind of building that had to combine the roles of prison, theatre and museum. Over the years, there have been elaborate Sumatran temples for tigers, aviaries for exotic birds with all-but-invisible nets, and a range of equally eye-catching attempts to break down the barrier between human and animal. It\u2019s a rich, strange history that has gone mostly undocumented \u2013 until now.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cold comforts \u2026 visitors and bear at Hanover zoo\u2019s Yukon Bay zone.

Meuser, an architect and professor, aims to redress this balance and provide guidance for future zoos. She began researching the topic a decade ago, when a toy manufacturer asked her to design some typical zoo structures to go with its animal figures, a task less straightforward than she imagined.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a simple answer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I became fascinated by how the architecture of zoos reflected man\u2019s changing relationship with animals: going from a sense of exoticism and wonder, to better hygiene and animal welfare, to the idea that the architecture should disappear altogether.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer book traces the origins of the zoo, from the villas of Roman senators, whose copious estates featured banqueting pavilions where guests could dine in safety while surrounded by wild beasts, to the bear pits and stag trenches of the middle ages, to the lavish royal menageries of the baroque era. None surpassed Louis XIV\u2019s at Versailles, designed as a radial complex of enclosures with the king\u2019s pavilion at the centre, reflecting his notion of himself as master of the natural world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tiger overhead \u2026 Philadelphia zoo\u2019s Big Cat Crossing.

Creatures were housed in exotically styled pavilions, in the manner of a world\u2019s fair, cementing the zoo as part of the colonial project \u2013 often complete with indigenous humans transported from their homelands to be displayed alongside the animals.\n\nBerlin took things to a different level: its zoo was transformed into an architectural theme park, with elephants housed in a Hindu temple, antelopes in a Moorish palace and ostriches reached through a momentous Egyptian portal, every detail conceived as part of the total work of art. As Ludwig Heck, the zoo\u2019s pro-Nazi director, put it: \u201cNothing is so negligible that it can\u2019t be artistically transformed.\u201d This thought extended to the thatched-roof huts of his barbaric human enclosures.\n\n\n\nA backlash against themed pavilions led to a more naturalistic approach, switching the focus from anatomical spectacle to natural behaviour. The wild animal trader and circus impresario Carl Hagenbeck emerges as the godfather of the modern zoo, the first to propose enclosures without bars, realising his \u201cpanorama zoo\u201d concept in Stellingen, near Hamburg, in 1907. He conducted tests on exactly how high each predator could jump (by tying a stuffed pigeon to a branch three metres up) and displayed them accordingly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Without bars \u2026 Carl Hagenbeck\u2019s Hamburg \u2018panorama zoo\u2019, c 1920.

The viewer assumed the role of Adam in the Garden of Eden, with mouflon and ibexes on artificial mountains, steppe animals on wide open ranges, and big cats in ravines without bars. An enthusiastic Thomas Edison visited in 1911. \u201cThe animals are not in a cage,\u201d wrote the scientist gleefully in the guestbook. \u201cThey are on a stage!\u201d\n\n\n\nTaking a similar approach, French zoologist Gustave Loisel proposed a plan for a zoo in 1908 in which visitors would be hidden beneath an enormous landscaped hill, with the animals roaming above. People would make their way through a network of tunnels inside his artificial mound, all the way into the most intimate parts of the enclosures, getting an up-close glimpse of the animals \u2013 who, in theory, would be unaware of the subterranean voyeurs. \u201cNothing has really changed in zoo architecture since then,\u201d says Meuser. \u201cThe ultimate goal is still for the people to be invisible and the animals to have a sense of freedom.\u201d\n\nMore than a century later, Danish architect Bjarke Ingels recycled Loisel\u2019s proposal, creating a grand plan for a \u201cZootopia\u201d in Jutland. Unveiled in 2014 with characteristic chutzpah, the proposal was presented as a radical new zoo concept, where the animals would roam free and humans would be swept beneath a landscaped carpet. As the Guardian put it: \u201cCage-free zoo will put humans in captivity.\u201d Visitors would be able to spy on creatures from hidden dens inside log piles, or trundle around enclosures in mirrored pods.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chutzpah \u2026 a drawing for \u2018Zootopia\u2019 in Jutland, Denmark.

Meuser thinks it leaves the pandas too exposed, with little chance of hiding, suggesting that Ingels\u2019 vision of an animal-centric zoo revolution is still a long way off.\n\nMeuser believes the recent emergence of \u201centertainment architecture\u201d has been damaging, with zoos following attractions such as Disneyland by introducing of themed restaurants and shops to complement every enclosure, placing more emphasis on visitor experience than animal welfare. She quotes veteran US zoo director David Hancocks: \u201cThe main difference from a century ago is a new look, which is essentially superficial, and is typically a peculiar distortion of the natural world \u2026 a design vernacular best described as Tarzanesque. Modern zoos often resemble a Hollywood version of Africa on a B-movie set.\u201d\n\nFuture zoo directors should have no qualms about demolishing these flimsy stage sets. The precious modernist architectural heritage that many zoos boast has proved to be an albatross around their necks. Berthold Lubetkin\u2019s renowned 1934 penguin pool at London zoo has stood empty for 15 years, after the penguins contracted bumblefoot, a bacterial infection caused by walking on the concrete ramps.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A proposal for St Petersburg \u2026 a series of islands surrounded by water and dotted with biospheres.

It\u2019s one of 10 Grade-I and -II listed monuments the zoo is forced to work around, with little scope for adaptation.\n\nMeuser says elephants pose one of the biggest dilemmas for modern zoos. Their immense size, and the fact they thrive in numbers and prefer to gather their own food, make them unhappy captives \u2013 yet they remain the biggest crowd-pullers. One baby elephant can double a zoo\u2019s annual visitor numbers. London zoo (except for Whipsnade) San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago zoos, to name just a few, have all recently given up on keeping elephants.\n\nThe book\u2019s survey of 50 international zoo buildings built in the last 20 years picks out Norman Foster\u2019s overblown elephant house in Copenhagen as a place \u201cwhere the animal competes for attention with the building in which it lives\u201d. Meanwhile, Zurich\u2019s great domed elephant enclosure, by Markus Schietsch, is highlighted for its more pachyderm-friendly approach. The creation includes more than 40 \u201cfodder depots\u201d hidden around the 11,000-sq-metre enclosure to encourage the elephants to forage, along with various pools where the creatures can wallow. There\u2019s even a self-service shower to reduce contact with keepers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Overblown \u2026 Norman Foster\u2019s elephant enclosure in Copenhagen zoo. Photograph: Natascha Meuser\n\nWhile the book is full of such best-practice models, even the boldest proposals \u2013 like the series of islands, each housing creatures from a different continent, surrounded by water and dotted with biospheres imagined for St Petersburg \u2013 feel like strange anachronisms, curious relics from a bygone age. As Hancocks has pointed out, zoos\u2019 claims of existing for conservation and education are questionable: the main priority is still the display of charismatic \u201cmegafauna\u201d for visitors to gawp at. A growing awareness of captivity-related problems \u2013 including malnutrition, repetitive activity \u201czoochosis\u201d and even cannibalism \u2013 has caused a number of zoos around the world to close. It might not be too long before Meuser\u2019s thought-provoking guide finds itself in the history section.", "description": "The architecture of zoos has come a long way from its barbaric beginnings.
