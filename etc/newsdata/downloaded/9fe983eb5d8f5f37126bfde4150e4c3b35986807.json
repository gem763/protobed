I'm exhausted, weary and emotional and should (guiltily) go to bed BUT there is an image burnt in all the teams' minds tonight.\n\n'It\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s distressing but this IS happening and it\u2019s only getting worse each week.\n\n'Sam' is 5 and this was him eating a dinner of carbonara tonight on a sheet of cardboard. Can we really accept this ?\n\nThousands have commented on the post , with many wanting to help, others expressing their gratitude to the charity for its work, and others yet calling for the Irish Government to make the issue of homelessness a priority.\n\nOne woman wrote: 'Something needs to be done for any person, or persons living on our streets. It's not acceptable in this day and age when our government had money to spend else where.\n\n'This situation has to take priority.'\n\nAnother woman wrote: 'So sad, shame on this country', and another: 'This is so very heartbreaking...what can I do to help?'\n\nAnother, a mother herself , expressed her sadness at the poignant image.\n\n'This is so sad. I have a 5 year old and I can\u2019t imagine how he\u2019d survive like that.\n\n'All we hear every morning when we turn on the news these days is about Brexit! What about this poor little boy and I can imagine countless other children eating their dinner from a pavement... Why aren\u2019t our government taking action?'\n\nThe Homeless Street Cafe thanked all those who responded to their post, as it gave an update on the boy's situation.\n\nIt said the boy was in emergency accommodation and goes to school.\n\n'His mother is simply trying to access nutritious home-cooked meals for him. Most emergency accommodations strictly forbid cooking or food preparation.'\n\nThe latest Department of Housing, Planning & Local Government Homelessness Report figures from August this year showed that in the Irish capital there were 6,143 adults and 2850 children who were homeless or living in temporary or emergency accommodation.\n\nAcross all of Ireland there were 8,216 adults and 3848 children who were deemed to be homeless.", "description": "The boy nicknamed Sam was spotted on the side of a main road in Dublin, by The Homeless Street Cafe on October 15 - when overnight lows dipped to a mere 4C.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19824748-0-image-a-12_1571299951003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
