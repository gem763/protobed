However, the report cited sources familiar with the bilateral relationship as saying the fund would be in the name of economic cooperation, not compensation for wartime labor victims.Seoul and Tokyo have struggled to keep bilateral relations from deteriorating amid a trade spat stemming from the Korean top court\u2019s rulings last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate individual victims of forced labor during World War II.The Japanese government would not make any contribution to this fund, according to the report, but would allow Japanese companies to provide money without contradicting the basic government stance that a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral relations between Seoul and Tokyo settled all compensation issues.However, the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman denied the report of an economic cooperation fund Tuesday.\u201cThe report is not true,\u201d said Kim In-chul, the Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman in a briefing Tuesday. \u201cAs said before, we respect the decision of the judicial branch and are working toward enabling relief for the victims and also finding a resolution with the Japanese side taking into consideration bilateral relations.\u201dHe continued, \u201cWe are continuing communication for a constructive method toward this direction.\u201dLikewise, Yoshihide Suga, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary, said the report was \u201cnot factually true,\u201d in a press conference the same day.The Korean Supreme Court made a landmark ruling on Oct. 30, 2018, ordering Nippon Steel to compensate Korean victims of wartime forced labor and made a similar ruling on Nov. 29 against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Tokyo has fiercely protested the rulings, claiming all compensation issues have been resolved through the 1965 bilateral accord, which provided Korea with an economic cooperation fund of $500 million.However, the Korean Supreme Court acknowledged the illegality of Japan\u2019s 1910-45 colonial rule over Korea and recognized that the individual\u2019s right to compensation has not expired. The Japanese companies refused to comply, and the victims have begun the legal process to seize and liquidate the companies\u2019 assets in Korea.Japan has implemented export restrictions on Korea since July and removed Seoul from its white list of favored trading partners, widely seen as retaliation for the forced labor rulings.The two countries\u2019 relations are in a sticky situation as trade and security matters, namely the bilateral intelligence-sharing General Security of Military Information Agreement (Gsomia) set to expire next month, are interlinked with Tokyo\u2019s call to resolve the forced labor rulings, while Seoul maintains it cannot intervene in the judicial branch because of the separation of powers.In June, Seoul proposed a joint fund comprised of voluntary contributions by companies from both countries to compensate the wartime forced labor victims, referred to as the one-plus-one plan. The proposal was immediately rejected by Tokyo.Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in a press conference last Thursday said on the forced labor issue, \u201cOur basic position is that the judicial process has to proceed along in a sound manner. We are considering the one-plus-one proposal along with various other ideas.\u201dA Seoul Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday that such a proposal was not exchanged, however, \u201cWe hold the fundamental position to narrow our difference and are in a situation where we are working toward finding a resolution.\u201dBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
