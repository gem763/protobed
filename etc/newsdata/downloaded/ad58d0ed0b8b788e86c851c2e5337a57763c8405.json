More than any other match he has played since his hip problem blew up in the summer of 2017, this was a drama-free saunter through to the next round.\n\nIt is too early to say that Murray is all the way back to his best. But the most encouraging thing about this win was its routine feeling. He faced only four break points, and saved them all \u2013 two with aces. The whole occasion could have been a flashback to the days when he was a fixture in the world\u2019s top four, and regularly squashed players without fuss.\u200b\n\nAsked if this was his most straightforward outing since he received the implant of a metal hip in January, Murray replied \u201cIn terms of matches that I have won, it would be, for sure. I hit the ball very clean from the beginning and I didn\u2019t have too many lulls, didn\u2019t let him have too many chances.\u200b\n\n\u201cI was talking after my first match this week [the contrastingly edgy 6-4, 7-6 win over local lad Kimmer Coppejans on Tuesday] about maybe lacking that killer instinct, not being focused for the whole match. So, that was a big improvement today. I didn\u2019t have too many moments where I let my concentration slip or my frustration get the better of me.\u201d\u200b", "description": "Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Andy Murray\u2019s 6-4, 6-3 win over Pablo Cuevas on Thursday night was that it did not seem remarkable at all.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/17/213320006_AFP_TENNIS-NED-ATP-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ0uWmx9aQAHUfGJx1PKUo8CUu9CoCd5Xq_1ONBAxaNQ.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
