Sharks patrol these waters so intensely that all the local sea otters have learned to steer clear. All of them, that is, except the adolescents.\n\nGroups of these young otters frequently swim into the Triangle of Death. Some are attacked, but most retreat safely to a nearby cove\u2014and then go back for more. The excursion might look like a death wish, but in the long run, these dangerous forays increase the odds that the otters stay alive. They start as \u201cpredator-na\u00efve,\u201d biologists say, and through these tests of daring they become \u201cpredator-aware\u201d and eventually \u201cpredator-experienced.\u201d\n\n\u201c At a moment of peak vulnerability, adolescent animals are hard-wired to take risks. \u201d\n\nThe two of us have spent the past decade studying the natural world for insights into human health. For the past five years, we have focused our research on how living creatures grow up. Comparing the life histories of young animals, we\u2019ve found striking similarities across species among those who are post-puberty but aren\u2019t yet mature adults. Adolescent animals are more likely to take risks, gravitate toward same-age peers, practice courtship moves and stray from home\u2014often sparking conflicts with parents and siblings. Transforming goslings to geese, joeys to kangaroos, pups to wolves and children to adults\u2014we are both mothers of teenagers\u2014is a common phase we call \u201cwildhood.\u201d\n\nWe identified four essential sets of life skills that all adolescent animals, including the human kind, must master during wildhood\u2014or else face serious, even life-threatening consequences. Whether high-school senior or humpback whale, the adolescent who doesn\u2019t acquire at least a basic competency in each of these areas will be disadvantaged as an adult or have difficulty making it to adulthood.\n\nSafety. Dying accidentally is a particular danger throughout wildhood. Adolescent humans are far more likely to be killed by car crashes, gun violence, poisonings, suffocation and electrocution than older or younger people. They\u2019re more likely to drink themselves to death and five times more likely to be the victims of homicide.\n\nTeenage skater in a skate park.

Wild animal adolescents crash into things, drown and get lost more often than their adult or juvenile counterparts. Physically big enough to be outside parental protection, but dangerously inexperienced, adolescent animals are, to put it bluntly, easy prey. Predators specialize in hunting them. What\u2019s more, because they\u2019re low in the social hierarchy, adolescents are pushed into jeopardy by older, bigger, bullying peers who exploit their naivet\u00e9.\n\nAt this moment of peak vulnerability, adolescent animals also are hard-wired to take risks. Brain and hormonal changes following puberty propel them out of dens, nests and bedrooms. A 16-year-old human who Parkours up a five-story building, and an adolescent gazelle who gallops toward a predatory cheetah instead of away, are driven by similar buzz-seeking physiology shaped by natural selection.\n\nA young cheetah chases a young Thomson\u2019s Gazelle in the Masai Mara, Kenya.

And a brush with death may be the whole point. The otters\u2019 death-defying encounters with sharks may teach them how their predators move, smell and hunt\u2014provided, of course, that the otters survive the experience.\n\nStatus. If you\u2019ve ever watched an eighth-grader labor over an Instagram post, you know that human adolescents often behave as if their status is a matter of life or death. For adolescent animals it is, quite literally.\n\n\u201c Rank achieved during wildhood can follow an animal throughout its life and even be passed on to offspring. \u201d\n\nReaching higher rank in the group gives an animal greater access to safety, food, territory and other resources like better sleep. Top-ranking pigeons get first dibs at available food. High-ranking lobsters swim in perfect-temperature water, conserving their energy while other lobsters waste theirs to heat or cool their bodies. Top-notch salmon have stronger immune systems.\n\nRank achieved during wildhood can follow an animal throughout its life and even be passed on to offspring. Adult status is shaped, sometimes permanently, during wildhood. Given these stakes, animal adolescents experience comparisons with others acutely.\n\nBrain chemicals, particularly serotonin, signal these status shifts. For decades, serotonin\u2019s role in shaping human mood\u2014chiefly depression and anxiety\u2014has been well known. We collected data on serotonin fluctuations in animals from crustaceans, fish and reptiles to birds and mammals, and found that, similarly, serotonin signals change depending on how animals compare to their peers. If the animals consistently fall to the bottom of their groups, they eventually display behaviors comparable to human depression and stop trying to compete. Animal biologists call this the \u201closer effect.\u201d\n\nSex. Before mating, bald eagles perform a skilled aerial courtship ritual: High in the sky, two raptors speed toward one another, lock talons in midair and plunge downward, whirling like figure skaters. Just before crashing, they release their grip and swoop back up to do it all again. Mature eagles can make it look easy, but adolescents miss the mark at first. They fumble; some even die trying. After months of practice, adolescent eagles are finally good enough to do a spiral that gets them to the next step: actual copulation.\n\nBald eagles practice a mating spiral\n\nThis practice period means that adolescent eagles often must wait to have sex until well after they are biologically able. Such delays between physical maturity and sexual activity occur commonly in the wild. Our study of sexual beginners, in animals ranging from moths to whales, shows a sexual learning curve across species.\n\nLess death-defying than eagle courtship, but every bit as complex, humpback whales sing to one another over thousands of miles of ocean. Tiny fruit flies dance and chase each other. These behaviors are a necessary series of \u201cshould-we-or-shouldn\u2019t-we\u201d questions between two animals. Studies of mammals that are separated from peers during adolescence show serious impairment in their ability to interpret sexual signals and to mate.\n\nSelf-reliance. Adolescent wolves and other predators often launch into the adult world without having the smarts or strength to take down prey. The need to feed themselves drives learning and innovation. Overprotected birds and fish, we found, don\u2019t learn to eat or defend themselves as well as peers that had less parental protection.\n\nYet, as we researched what biologists call \u201cdispersal\u201d\u2014that is, the process of adolescent animals leaving home\u2014it became clear that the launch into adulthood is far from a sudden sink-or-swim moment. Across species, it is often preceded by survival training. Australian possum mothers, for example, organize practice dispersals: They require an adolescent son or daughter to spend a day and night alone fending for itself. Wolf adolescents are invited on group hunts that wolf experts call \u201cfinishing\u201d school, where older wolves teach adolescents how to coordinate the pack.\n\nFor better or worse, wildhood doesn\u2019t last forever. But this phase is not a burden to be endured, a disease to be cured or an awkward period to be avoided. It has a purpose, shaped over 600 million years of evolution. To become mature, animal adolescents must use the time to learn and practice the key skills of life. To grow up into adults, our teenagers must do it, too.\n\n\u2014Dr. Natterson-Horowitz, a visiting professor in evolutionary biology at Harvard and professor of medicine at UCLA, and Ms. Bowers, an animal behaviorist and science writer, have taught together at both schools.
