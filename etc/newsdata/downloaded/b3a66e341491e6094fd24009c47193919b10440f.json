In a cycle where his party\u2019s candidates for president openly debate on the preferred method for eating the rich, Bloomberg reports this morning that Mayor Pete Buttigieg got lots of direction from them to start his campaign. And not just any ol\u2019 rich guy, but arguably the poster child for American oligarchs \u2014 at least to the Democrats in the 2020 sweepstakes:\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recommended colleagues as potential hires for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign soon after the South Bend, Ind. mayor launched his presidential bid in mid-April. Buttigieg campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed to Bloomberg News that Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, had initiated the contact by sending several emails recommending individuals as potential campaign hires. A Zuckerberg-Chan family spokesman said that the employees had asked to be recommended. Zuckerberg overlapped with Buttigieg at Harvard, where the two shared mutual friends, and Buttigieg was one of the first 300 users of Facebook. Zuckerberg visited Buttigieg in 2017 and live-streamed a tour of South Bend given by the mayor.\n\nAt least two Zuckerberg insiders still work with the campaign as a result of this consultation, Bloomberg notes:\n\nOf the several individuals recommended, two are currently on staff: Eric Mayefsky, senior digital analytics adviser, and Nina Wornhoff, organizing data manager. Mayefsky previously worked at Quora, a startup founded by former Facebook employees, while Wornhoff worked as a machine learning engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and in Democratic politics in Indiana, Buttigieg\u2019s home state.\n\nBloomberg News mostly focused on the novelty of Zuckerberg\u2019s direct involvement in electoral politics. His friendship at Harvard with Buttigieg no doubt played a large part in that decision, but even so, Zuckerberg insisted that he\u2019s still neutral in the Democratic primaries. After last week\u2019s Democratic debate, however, Zuckerberg at least had some thoughts on the matter.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s recall what happened in the debate, when Bernie Sanders declared that \u201cbillionaires should not exist.\u201d Even the billionaire on stage threw in with Sanders on that sentiment, but Buttigieg hedged a bit when it came to the subject:\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I\u2019m all for a wealth tax. I\u2019m all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live. Washington politicians, congressmen and senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn\u2019t even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad\u2019s Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school, I didn\u2019t know that wasn\u2019t every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It\u2019s a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers. But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It\u2019s because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. And while he\u2019s unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we\u2019re paying attention to the wrong things.\n\nWell okay, perhaps Zuckerberg is arguably the second-most unpopular billionaire in the world right now. Still, the Facebook mogul has been popular among Buttigieg\u2019s competitors for the nomination only as a favorite punching bag, especially when it comes to electoral influence. A number of them, Elizabeth Warren most prominently, have called for breaking up Facebook specifically along with other infotech near-monopolies in large part because of their influence on electoral politics and free speech. In this past debate, several candidates \u2014 Andrew Yang, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke all explicitly joined that call.\n\nNeedless to say, the news that Buttigieg got direction from Zuckerberg on his campaign hires gives all of these candidates a yuuuuuge stick with which to beat Buttigieg. They can use him as the poster child for how the oligarchs of Silicon Valley have gone from influence to direct political control of campaigns. It comes at a very bad time for Buttigieg as well, seeing as how he\u2019s starting to challenge the top tier of candidates, especially in Iowa, where he has surged to third place in a new Suffolk poll released today. How long will he maintain that position after Warren, Joe Biden, and others paint him as Zuckerberg\u2019s stalking horse in a populist-driven electorate?\n\nThe timing is curious indeed, actually. Did someone\u2019e campaign sit on this until now, deploying it only when it appeared Buttigieg\u2019s surge might be legit? Welcome to the big leagues, kid.\n\nButtigieg has gotten a lot of mileage out of his \u201cMayor Pete\u201d persona \u2014 an outsider, a fresh face, an unspoiled public servant with a backstory that fits the times more than Biden\u2019s or Sanders\u2019, or even Warren\u2019s. If those competitors can repackage Buttigieg as Zuckerberg\u2019s latest product line, though, that might be enough to send Mayor Pete back to deal with the woes in South Bend.", "description": "Will unfriending ensue?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zuckerberg-congress.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
