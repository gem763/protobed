And, having seen the detail, it confirms everything we thought about this rotten deal,\" he said.\n\n\"A charter for deregulation across the board, paving the way for Trump-style trade deals that will attack jobs, rights and protections, and open up our precious National Health Service and other public services for further privatisation.\n\nWhat is in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill is designed to give legal effect to the Brexit deal negotiated by Johnson and allow Britain to legally leave the EU while entering a 14 month transition period.\n\nThe bill is based on a previous agreement negotiated by Theresa May but with significant differences in the relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder the agreement, Northern Ireland would remain tied to EU customs rules after Brexit.\n\nThis measure has proved hugely controversial because it will mean new checks in the Irish Sea, something that has outraged unionists in Northern Ireland.\n\nOther aspects of the deal include provisions for the UK to pay its \u00a339 billion \"divorce bill\" to the EU as well as provisions to maintain the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit.\n\nOpponents of the bill are concerned about several other aspects of the agreement, including provisions which would allow the prime minister to take Britain out of the EU without a deal at the end of the transition period.", "description": "The House of Commons has voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, in a major boost for Boris Johnson's hopes of passing Brexit by October 31.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9504/2eb11bbce6494376820983462c8582bd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
