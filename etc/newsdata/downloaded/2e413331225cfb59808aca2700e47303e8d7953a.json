REUTERS/Aziz Taher\n\nThere was no comment from Hariri\u2019s office. He will deliver an address at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT), an official Twitter account said. Two official sources earlier told Reuters that Hariri was likely to resign.\n\nIn central Beirut, black-clad men wielding sticks and pipes destroyed the protest camp that has been the focal point of countrywide rallies against a political elite accused of rampant corruption and steering Lebanon toward economic collapse.\n\nThe show of force came after Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said last week roads closed by protesters should be reopened and suggested the demonstrators were financed by its foreign enemies and implementing their agenda.\n\nSmoke rose as some of the tents were set ablaze. Hezbollah and Amal supporters had earlier fanned out in the downtown area of the capital shouting \u201cShia, Shia\u201d in reference to themselves and cursing protesters.\n\n\u201cWith our blood and lives we offer ourselves as a sacrifice for you Nabih,\u201d they chanted in reference to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, head of the Amal Movement. \u201cWe heed your call, we heed your call, Nasrallah,\u201d they added.\n\nSecurity forces did not intervene to stop the assault, in which protesters were hit with sticks and were seen appealing for help as they ran, witnesses said. Tear gas was eventually fired to disperse the crowds.\n\nNationwide protests since Oct. 17 have paralyzed Lebanon at a time of deep economic crisis - banks were closed for a 10th day on Tuesday along with schools and businesses, with the pegged Lebanese pound weakening on a black market.\n\nHariri\u2019s resignation would defy the powerful Hezbollah - Nasrallah has twice said that he was against such a step, citing the risk of a dangerous void.\n\nRelated Coverage Lebanon banks to remain shut on Wednesday: statement\n\nHariri last week sought to defuse popular anger through a set of reform measures agreed with other groups in his coalition government, including Hezbollah to, among other things, tackle corruption and long-delayed economic reforms.\n\nBut with no immediate steps toward enacting these steps, they did not satisfy demonstrators whose demands include the resignation of his coalition government.\n\nOne of the sources, a senior official from outside Hariri\u2019s Future Party, told Reuters the premier would \u201cmost probably\u201d announce the government resignation on Tuesday.
