Reduced profitability among Chinese steelmakers has also been named as a factor reducing mills' ability to pay for the more expensive types of iron ore.\n\nMr Goncalves accused big corporations of putting profit before principle when it came to China.", "description": "US miner Cliffs says shrinking price premiums for high-grade iron ore are an admission by China that it does not care about the environment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f358262a98f1b52b8658d67cea5b6a18fd14f5c7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
