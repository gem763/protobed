The ship's captain was \"a Libyan from Benghazi\" who worked for the new Libyan government. The man who organized that shipment, Tripoli Military Council head Abdelhakim Belhadj, worked directly with Stevens during the Libyan revolution.\n\nStevens' last meeting on Sept. 11 was with Turkish Consul General Ali Sait Akin, and a source told Fox News that Stevens was in Benghazi \"to negotiate a weapons transfer in an effort to get SA-7 missiles out of the hands of Libya-based extremists.\"\n\n\n\nLast month The Wall Street Journal reported that the State Department presence in Benghazi \"provided diplomatic cover\" for the now-exposed CIA annex. It follows that the \"weapons transfer\" that Stevens negotiated may have involved sending heavy weapons recovered by the CIA to the revolutionaries in Syria.\n\nThe newest report comes days before the U.S. is expected to recognize the newest Syrian coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. The State Department has also indicated it will soon name the opposition's highly effective al-Nusra Front a \"terrorist organization\" for its ties to Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).\n\nBoth of these stipulations \u2014 recognition of a unified opposition and creation of distance from extremists \u2014 are pivotal in order for the Obama administration to openly acknowledge supporting Syrian rebels with heavy weapons.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael B Kelley", "Geoffrey Ingersoll"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2012-12-09"}
