It is now propelling costume sales at local Halloween and party supply stores, and has otherwise infected the greater D.C. area: through choral performances, horn quartet performances, organ performances, children\u2019s singalongs, D.C. Council jam sessions, team-branded merchandise and even religious-themed trash talk.\n\nAD\n\nWhat a night!!!! Nats you make us proud!!!\n\nFinish the Fight...and yes I wore my lucky clothes that haven\u2019t been washed since the wild card game underneath my shark costume. pic.twitter.com/oWff4HD0b3 \u2014 Joan Knisely (@rivahchick) October 24, 2019\n\nAnd now, Halloween is coming.\n\n\u201cI had to reorder [adult shark costumes],\u201d said Caltagirone. \u201cI think we have enough stocked, but I\u2019m not sure yet. You never know because there might be a mad rush for more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther popular costumes include clowns (referencing both \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cJoker\u201d), Captain Marvel, Aladdin and sexy policewomen, according to multiple retailers, but it is the shark outfit that has taken on a special meaning throughout the region.\n\nTodd Arcila, owner of Halloween Express in Falls Church, said the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d tune was so big that even some costumes there play the song.\n\n\u201cThat, in itself, has been a phenomenon,\u201d Arcila said. \u201cBut I have sold for the Nationals. I expected sales to be strong anyway because the song was big for kids.\u201d\n\nWhile kids\u2019 sizes have not sold as well as Arcila hoped, he said he has already sold out of inflatable shark outfits and only has one adult size left, which he figures could soon be gone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDefinitely I\u2019ve had some Nationals fans come in here and buy out more of the adult ones,\u201d Arcila said.\n\nInvited employees to bring their families to @USTreasury for early trick-or-treating. Always nice to have families here.

Some Boston Market restaurants in the region, for example, are hanging banners that read \u201cBaby Shark Market\u201d in place of their usual signs.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to celebrate the Washington Nationals and Baby Shark is one of their signs,\u201d said Waqar Rizvi, general manager of the Boston Market in McLean. \u201cWe are with our local team.\u201d\n\nRizvi said he is now trying to buy hats and jerseys for his crew. If he can\u2019t find any, he said, he is considering getting, yes that\u2019s right, shark costumes.\n\nShark hats and costumes intended for infants and toddlers are also available in some stores.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo if the whole family wants to get in the spirit of the Nationals\u2019 \u2018Baby Shark\u2019 craze, we definitely have that,\u201d Caltagirone said.\n\nAD\n\nJoe Figueroa, 31, bought a Nationals-inspired baby shark costume over the weekend for his eight-month-old, Emma.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got her daycare Halloween party on Friday,\u201d Joe said. \u201cShe may not be the only baby shark, but she will definitely be a baby shark.\u201d\n\nFigueroa doesn\u2019t have tickets to Game 3. Instead, he plans to watch the game elsewhere in the Navy Yard neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have [a shark costume] for myself, but I was thinking of maybe spontaneously getting a hat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very willing to put on a shark for this occasion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe won\u2019t be alone. With the Nationals leading the Houston Astros, 2-0, and pleasant weather expected, tens of thousands of fans are expected to stream into the Navy Yard neighborhood Friday night. Among that sea of fans, shark sightings are guaranteed.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Move over, sexy cops and scary clowns.
