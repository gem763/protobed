Those \"hate detectives\" begin with a team of cognitive and evolutionary scientists who dig into hate's origins.\n\nThe series searches for answers and brings hate alive with personal stories of haters \u2013 and those targeted by hate.\n\nSpielberg said he identified with \"what it feels like to be bullied, which I was as an elementary school and high school student for a while.\"\n\nSam Pollard and Geeta Gandbhir co-directed the series.\n\n\"I was told that I was different. I've been told to go back to where I came from,\" Gandbhir said.\n\n\"People around the world can watch this series and see some of themselves. And maybe rethink their own attitudes,\" Pollard added.\n\nTake sports. \"Why We Hate\" explores how rabid rooting for your team can spark tribalism \u2013 hatred on a group scale \u2013 the same us versus them mindset behind much of the world's misery.\n\n\"Did you say to yourself, you know what, if I'm being honest, I'm kinda guilty of that, too?\" Strassmann asked.\n\n\"I'm certainly guilty about snap judgments. I'm guilty about impulsive behavior. But some of that has led to interesting movies. So some of that has an application in my life which, I don't want to divest myself of,\" Spielberg said with a laugh.\n\nSpielberg and Gibney hope people will watch the series as critical thinkers of the world and of ourselves.\n\n\"The human brain is a changeable system. And we can unlearn hate just as quickly as we acquire it,\" Spielberg said.\n\n\"Our hope is our ability as human beings to access the better angels of our nature,\" Gibney said.", "description": "Hollywood legend and Oscar-winning documentarian are behind a powerful new documentary series, \"Why We Hate\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/95b6a6b1-1218-41a5-b56a-9c527012bb17/thumbnail/1200x630g3/fbfdcacadfc0decc51ebf05f21a99e47/1009-ctm-whywehate-strassman-1948927-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
