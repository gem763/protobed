He is currently said to fear Elizabeth Warren. \u201cAccording to three people who have spoken to Trump about Warren over the past two months,\u201d the Daily Beast reports, \u201cthe president has specifically highlighted what he views as her surprising political and populist talents during the Democratic primary, and has told multiple advisers and associates that he hears she could be \u2018tougher\u2019 in a general election than many initially expected.\u201d\n\nSeveral reports in this vein have emerged from inside the White House since last fall. I have tried to piece them together and construct Trump\u2019s general-election model. The pattern appears to be as follows: Trump considers the strongest candidate to be the one who is being talked about positively on television at any given moment.\n\nIn early January, Trump viewed Warren \u2014 who was then slumping in the polls \u2014 as \u201ceasy to beat,\u201d dismissed Bernie Sanders as too old, believed Cory Booker \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t end up running,\u201d and Kamala Harris was not \u201con his radar yet,\u201d Politico reported. When Harris announced her candidacy, drawing a large crowd with good visuals, Trump was impressed.\n\nIn March, Trump \u201cseemed to indicate to some of his confidants that he is concerned about the prospect of facing Biden.\u201d In April, Trump expressed \u201cbegrudging respect for his political acumen,\u201d reported the Daily Beast, noting that the president has cited Sanders\u2019s \u201cworking-class support\u201d and \u201cpopulist appeal.\u201d In May, Trump\u2019s campaign had \u201cprofound anxieties about Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nSo Trump calculates that his strongest opponent is either a centrist who can win the middle or a populist who can excite the base or an inspirational personality, that candidates who are rising in primary polls must be dangerous, and that anybody who disappears from cable television that week would be easy to beat or is not going to run. The Trump strategy, in sum, is based on having the memory of a fruit fly.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s assessment of the Democratic primary has changed repeatedly.
