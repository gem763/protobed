Recently, he told \u201cSubmission Radio\u201d that if he defeats Usman, he\u2019s not going to let UFC president Dana White wrap the championship belt around his waist, as is custom following title fights.\n\n\u201dI can tell you who\u2019s not wrapping it around my waist, and that will not be Dana White,\u201d Covington said. \u201cIf he tries to wrap it around my waist, I\u2019m gonna take the belt from him and slap him in the face with it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the comment at Friday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 post-fight press conference, White essentially said \u201cwe\u2019ll see about that\u201d and let Covington know that that dislike is a two-way street.\n\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d White said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big-mouth (expletive) idiot.\u201d\n\nMuch has gone wrong in the relationship between White and Covington since better days, when White arranged for Covington to have a White House visit with President Donald Trump. The UFC stripped Covington of the interim belt when Covington said he wasn\u2019t able to fight on a date the UFC wanted, and then attempts to put together Usman-Covington for UFC 243 fell through before the fight finally got made for UFC 244.\n\nCovington isn\u2019t afraid to give his side of the story.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between me and Dana White, and that\u2019s truth and lies,\u201d Covington said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t care what he says. He has a lot to say all the time, and I don\u2019t pay attention to him anymore. I don\u2019t follow him on any social media platform, so I could give a (expletive) less what he has to say. I\u2019m showing up, I\u2019m kicking ass, I\u2019m taking names, and I\u2019m cashing the biggest checks in the sport, and that\u2019s that. There\u2019s not a man alive that can stop me right now.\u201d", "description": "Appraised of Colby Covington's threat to slap him with the UFC belt, Dana White responded in kind.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dana-white-ufc-boston-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
