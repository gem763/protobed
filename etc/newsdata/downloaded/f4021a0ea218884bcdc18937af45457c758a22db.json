Well, that\u2019s not happening,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThis is some kind of ego wall for the president, and he will just make anybody pay the price.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump announced his plan to use his emergency powers to siphon $3.6 billion away from the Pentagon\u2019s facilities funds to make progress on border wall construction. The declaration was signed earlier this year, and the Trump administration already diverted $2 billion in other Pentagon funds.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer announced plans for his members to force a vote on a resolution that would terminate Mr. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. However, Mr. Trump used his veto powers to override.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s national emergency declaration was, and is, an outrageous power grab by a president who refuses to respect the constitutional separation of powers,\u201d he wrote in a statement.\n\nDemocrats can push this vote every six months under the National Emergencies Act of 1976.\n\nSix months ago, the Senate did vote to terminate the emergency declaration in a 59-41 vote, with 12 Republicans siding with the Democrats.\n\nMrs. Pelosi was confident Thursday that the Senate would move to terminate the declaration next week and said the House would act after the resolution passed in the Senate.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
