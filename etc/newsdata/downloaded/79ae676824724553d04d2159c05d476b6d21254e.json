(Photo: Hyde Park Entertainment)\n\nFew names in horror inspire more confidence than James Wan. Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring, the man has done it all. So, when any news breaks that Wan and his company are going to produce a new version of a classic comic book, fans have a right to be excited. Dylan Dog fans, we\u2019re talking to you.\n\nVariety reports that Wan and his company, Atomic Monster, will co-produce a 10-episode TV adaptation of Tiziano Sclavi\u2019s Italian horror comic, which was published by Dark Horse in the U.S. The comic, which is about a paranormal investigator who regularly deals with all kinds of monsters, was previously turned into a 2011 film starring Brandon Routh but... no one wants to talk about that. (It grossed just over $1.5 million in the U.S., topping out at $7 million worldwide and boasts a shocking seven per cent score on aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.)\n\n\u201cJames Wan and Atomic Monster are masters of the horror genre and have a proven sensibility on how best to adapt comics to the screen,\u201d Davide Bonelli, president of Dylan Dog\u2019s publisher, said in a statement. \u201cWe are so thrilled to have this dream team working on one of our most important characters.\u201d\n\nWith Wan\u2019s team on board, and a bit more space to develop the story on TV, we\u2019d imagine Dylan Dog will, at the very least, get a version that will clean the slate for the franchise after the film. From there, depending on who else gets involved, where it ends up living, etc., there\u2019s a chance it could even revive the franchise as a whole. That\u2019s a long way away, though. For now, we\u2019ll just keep an eye out to see how development moves on this project.\n\nWan is currently directing a new horror movie, Malignant, which is expected to release next year. He\u2019s then expected to move onto Aquaman 2, which is scheduled for release on December 16, 2022.", "description": "Few names in horror inspire more confidence than James Wan.
