Several were slouching slowly across the street while staring down at their hand-held devices. Another stopped, right in the middle of the busy thoroughfare, to use his phone to take a picture of an ordinary-looking building.\n\nAs it happens, I was on my way to meet two young entrepreneurs in SoHo who are trying to break our smartphone addiction. Thanks to the spaced-out, hooked-up, swiping, bent-over, oblivious smartphone addicts crossing the road, I was a minute or two late.\n\nJoe Hollier and Kaiwei (\u201cKai\u201d) Tang are classic technology industry disrupters. Joe Hollier, 29, is an artist and skateboarder who studied graphic design at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts and once ran a skateboard company. Tang is a tech expert who used to help design mobile phones. Tang, age 39, came to America from Taiwan when he was 20. He studied at the Institute of Design in Chicago, and used to work as a contractor in the mobile phone business.\n\nThey met on a Google-backed GOOG, +0.51% program in 2014 \u2014 in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca \u2014 that was aimed at attracting some fresh minds to the company\u2019s Android smartphone platform. \u201cIt was a pretty vague program,\u201d recalls Hollier. \u201cWe went in without knowing what we were trying to do,\u201d says Tang.\n\n\u201cVery quickly we learned they wanted us to develop smartphone applications,\u201d says Hollier. \u201cKai and I said, \u2018Jeez, the last thing world needs is another smartphone application.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair hit it off and began socializing after work. They found they were both disillusioned with the whole smartphone business model. Venture capitalists were looking for applications to be \u201csticky,\u201d so that users would spend as much time on them as possible. \u201cIt seemed very wrong to us,\u201d says Tang. They didn\u2019t have an \u201ca-ha moment,\u201d recalls Hollier. \u201cIt was more a \u2018Should I quit this?\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\nSo they hit on a radical idea. Instead of trying to design a new smartphone application, they decided to launch a counterstrike against the whole multi-trillion-dollar smartphone industry.\n\nSee also: 6 ways to make smartphones more humane \u2014 and less addictive\n\nAnd so they created the Light Phone, arguably the world\u2019s smartest dumbphone. Their company, launched with a fundraising campaign in 2015 on Kickstarter, has raised $8.4 million in total so far. And they\u2019re just rolling out the new Light Phone 2.0.\n\nIt costs $350.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t do very much.\n\nAnd it\u2019s sold out. The first models are shipping right now, but if you order one online you\u2019ll be lucky to get one before November.\n\nNaturally you could also buy a regular feature phone, like a flip phone, from someone else for a lot less. But I can testify personally that there are surprisingly few around that will work well on today\u2019s mobile phone networks. And, say Light Phone\u2019s founders, there are some subtle differences.\n\n\u201cThey actually come with Facebook FB, +1.06% and Twitter TWTR, -0.72%, \u201d says Hollier. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to be a \u2018limited\u2019 phone. They\u2019re just a nostalgic form factor. There\u2019s not a lot of good, simple phones around.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a \u2018dumb phone,\u2019\u201d adds Tang. \u201cWe think this is a step forward. This is not a Luddite thing.\u201d\n\nThe Light Phone 2.0 looks pretty neat, actually. It\u2019s small, with a low-power, black-and-white E Ink screen. And the company is customizing it so that they can add limited applications that you may want, while completely excluding apps that are addictive.\n\nFor example, whenever I\u2019ve tried to carry just a flip phone I\u2019ve found the biggest drawback is that I lost access to Uber UBER, -1.28% and Lyft LYFT, +1.42% . Hollier and Tang say they expect to add those services to the Light Phone by year-end. They\u2019re open to adding some other services that users have asked for as well, such as location and directions, and even a Wi-Fi hot spot. Hollier and Tang are giving a lot of thought to where to draw the dividing line.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re open to utility tools,\u201d says Tang, but \u201cnothing infinite, no infinite feeds.\u201d By that he means, mainly, no social media, email, or web browsing \u2014 things that can draw you in endlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s like a toolbox,\u201d he says of the phone. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t check your toolbox for two hours.\u201d\n\nThey are not alone in their concerns. A growing number of studies suggest that smartphones may be addictive to many, and that overuse can lead to depression and other social problems. Even Apple AAPL, -0.81% CEO Tim Cook is warning publicly that people are spending too much time staring at their smartphones\n\nBut the whole technology industry is built on a business model of sucking up our time. They need us online, staring at our screens, for hours at a time \u2014 even when crossing busy streets in downtown Manhattan. That\u2019s when we see the adverts.\n\nThe guys behind Light Phone say they aren\u2019t \u201canti-technology,\u201d they\u2019re just \u201canti-smartphone.\u201d They believe something fundamental and insidious changed when computing jumped from our desks to our pockets and began following us everywhere.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no separation,\u201d says Kai. \u201cWhen you get on a subway train or an a restaurant, everyone is on their phones. That seems so wrong, and these companies are getting all these profits from everyone\u2019s time and data. I enjoy FaceTime-ing with my family thousands of miles away. But there\u2019s a time and a place for everything.\u201d\n\nEarly on in the process, adds Hollier, he reflected on how his smartphone intruded into his life. He realized, \u201cWhen I\u2019m skateboarding I don\u2019t carry my phone \u2014 and those are the happiest days.\u201d\n\nThe pair began by handing out flip phones to colleagues on the Android program back in 2014 and asking them to use them, instead of their smartphones, for the weekend. Initially they encountered a lot of hostility and resistance. But afterwards they found that those who had participated had barely used their phones.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an initial friction, an anxiety,\u201d when you first give up your smartphone, says Hollier. \u201cI think, man, I can\u2019t stop tapping my pocket. It\u2019s really a nervous tick at this point.\u201d", "description": "The new Light Phone may capitalize on the backlash against smartphone addiction.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR674_arends_ZG_20190919151605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
