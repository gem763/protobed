Usually that's short term and the recovery once the issue is resolved ... happens very rapidly,\" said Joyce, speaking to CNBC after the airline posted results on Thursday. \"We are seeing around a 10% drop in our Hong Kong volumes.\"\n\nHong Kong has been crippled by protests which are into their 12th week. The rallies started out as a demonstration against a proposed extradition bill which has since been suspended. However, they turned increasingly violent and have disrupted various sectors \u2014 such as retailers and real estate \u2014 as well as the city's public transit system.", "description": "Flight bookings to Hong Kong have fallen 10%, hit by the unrest in the city, said Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Australian carrier Qantas Airways.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106076042-15656956171962019-08-13t102232z_873590634_rc12b8d9e2e0_rtrmadp_3_hongkong-protests.jpg?v=1565695673"}
