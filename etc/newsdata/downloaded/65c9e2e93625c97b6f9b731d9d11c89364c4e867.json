It described the suit as a \"cynical attempt to distract from Wayne LaPierre's documented mismanagement of the organization and the captive board's complicit behavior.\"\n\n\"In the final 18 months, AMc representatives progressively discovered that LaPierre and his executive team, with the board's oversight and approval, were marketing false products and narratives to NRA members, covering up sexual harassment, attempting to intimidate public officials, disrupting internal investigations about Russia, spending member money for personal benefit and more,\" the statement said.\n\n\"LaPierre controlled every aspect of NRATV for which he recruited talent, approved every budget, audited every metric and required ultimate confidentiality,\" the statement added. \"Ackerman McQueen routinely offered and toward the end of the relationship demanded that an outside firm audit NRATV performance but LaPierre refused.\"\n\nNRATV featured conservative media figures like Dana Loesch and Dan Bongino, who've garnered reputations for incendiary commentary. Loesch was widely criticized over a 2017 NRA ad that she starred in that was viewed by some progressives as an \"open call to violence\" against those who oppose President Donald Trump. The ad echoed language used by LaPierre at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier that year.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid a year of bad headlines for the NRA, including reports of infighting between leaders as well serious financial troubles.\n\nNOW WATCH: Here's how the top 7 Democratic presidential candidates want to transform the US economy", "description": "\"One particularly damaging segment featured children's cartoon characters adorned in Ku Klux Klan hoods,\" the court filing stated.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WjgxGHUoIjWnR_vE39R25Q--~B/aD02ODM7dz05MTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/9cf0f2680382bdce16e975d42a275f05", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
