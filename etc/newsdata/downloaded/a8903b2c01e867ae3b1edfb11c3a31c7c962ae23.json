The more you tax something, the less you get of it.\n\nOne of my many frustrations is that those politicians then conveniently forget that lesson when it comes to taxing things that are good, such as work, saving, production, and investment.\n\nAnd some countries are more punitive than others. There\u2019s some new research from the European Policy Information Center, Timbro, and the Tax Foundation, that estimates the \u201ceffective marginal tax rate\u201d for successful taxpayers for 41 major countries.\n\nAnd they don\u2019t simply look at the top income tax rates. They quite properly include other taxes that contribute to \u201cdeadweight loss\u201d by driving a wedge between pre-tax income and post-tax consumption.\n\nThe political discussion around taxing high-earners usually revolves around the income tax, but in order to get a complete picture of the tax burden high-income earners face, it is important to consider effective marginal tax rates. The effective marginal tax rate answers the question, \u201cIf a worker gets a raise such that the total cost to the employer increases by one dollar, how much of that is appropriated by the government in the form of income tax, social security contributions, and consumption taxes?\u201d \u2026all taxes that affect the return to work should be taken into account. \u2026Combining data mainly from international accounting firms, the OECD, and the European Commission, we are able to calculate marginal tax rates in the 41 members of the OECD and/or EU.\n\nThe main message of this research is that you don\u2019t want to live in Sweden, where you only keep 24 percent of any additional income you produce.\n\nAnd you should also avoid Slovenia, Belgium, Portugal, Finland, France, etc.\n\nCongratulations to Bulgaria for being the anti-class warfare nation. That\u2019s a smart strategy for a nation trying to recover from decades of communist deprivation.\n\nAmerican readers will be happy to see that the United States looks reasonably good, though New Zealand is the best of the rich nations, followed by Switzerland.\n\nSpeaking of which, we need a caveat for nations with federalist systems, such as the U.S., Switzerland, and Canada. In these cases, the top income tax rate is calculated by adding the central government\u2019s top rate with the average top rate for sub-national governments.\n\nSo successful entrepreneurs in those countries actually have the ability to reduce their tax burdens if they make wise decisions on where to live (such as Texas or Florida in the case of the United States).\n\nLet\u2019s now shift to some economic analysis. The report makes (what should be) an obvious point that high tax rates have negative economic effects.\n\nCountries should be cautious about placing excessive tax burdens on high-income earners, for several reasons. In the short run, high marginal tax rates induce tax avoidance and tax evasion, and can cause high-income earners to reduce their work effort or hours.\n\nI would add another adverse consequence. Successful taxpayers can move.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true in Europe, where cross-border tax migration is much easier than it is in the United States.\n\nBut even though there are odious exit taxes for people leaving the United States, we\u2019ll see an exodus if we wind up with some of the crazy tax policies being advocated by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nP.S. Today\u2019s column looks at how nations rank based on the taxation of labor income. For taxation of capital income, the rankings look quite different. For instance, because of pervasive double taxation, the United States gets poor scores for over-taxing dividends, capital gains, and businesses.\n\nP.P.S.
