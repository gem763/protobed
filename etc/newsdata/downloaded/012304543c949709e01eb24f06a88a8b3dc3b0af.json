St Mary's. I'm dead.\"\n\nThe operator asks him to be more specific, and Kobi answers again: \"I'm dead. N17 Tottenham.\"\n\nThe emergency services staffer reassures him that police and paramedics are on their way to him, and a weak Kobi whispers: \"Please... hello.\"\n\nKobi managed to make a final call to his brother Kojo and girlfriend Tracey, and Kojo raced to the scene in a desperate attempt to save his brother's life.\n\nKojo calls 999 again and is heard pleading with his dying brother to talk to him.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"Are you with him now?\" the operator asks.\n\n\"Yes,\" he sobs.\n\n\"Are the attackers still nearby?\"\n\n\"No he's by himself. It's serious there's a lot of blood,\" Kojo panics as his brother screams in pain next to him\n\n\"Kobi, Kobi... Kobi, Kobi, chat to me. Kobi. NO.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC months after his brother's devastating and senseless slaughter, Kojo revealed their final heartbreaking moments together.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\"I remember holding Kobi in my arms and telling him 'stay with me' and he was just nodding 'yeah yeah' and then he turned around and said 'pray for me, pray for me' and that at that point I kind of froze for a split second,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I gave him a hug. I saw that he was in so much fear so I thought I would comfort him.\"\n\nHe quietly added: \"The hardest thing is waking up knowing it's another day and Kobi's not here.\"\n\nThe brothers' mother managed to speak to her boy one last time before he succumbed to his wounds.\n\n\"That pain will never go away,\" she said, wiping away tears.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"Kobi was a very good person, he tried to help everyone, family and community. I don't know what's wrong with the people who killed him. I miss him. I miss him very badly.\n\n\"This is not a game, and I don't want anybody to count Kobi's death as number. This we are talking about a whole man's life. They killed Kobi for no reason. They killed the whole family, and friends, and community.\"\n\nThe months after Kobi's murder saw the London borough of Haringey descend into bloody violence, with 19-year-old Kelvin Odunuyi shot dead in Wood Green in what police suspected was a revenge killing.\n\nHis killers are yet to be caught.\n\n*The Met: Policing London continues next Thursday at 9pm on BBC1", "description": "Kobi Nelson's last conversation with emergency services aired as part of the BBC documentary The Met: Policing London", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Jmeyaanelsonxo", "Twitter", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560169.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Harrowing-999-call-of-murdered-teen-dying-on-the-street-airs-on-BBC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
