Photo: Columbia Pictures/Getty Images\n\nYou might think that shaving is as simple as grabbing the first pack of cartridge razors and can of shaving cream you see at a drugstore. And although that may work, getting a better shave \u2014 one that won\u2019t leave behind any inflamed bumps on your face or neck, or uneven-looking beards or stubble \u2014 often requires some research into the best tools to use. Well, we went ahead and did that research for you (you can thank us later), and after speaking to dozens of grooming experts and guys with great facial hair, put together the below list of everything you need for a proper shave. It includes expert-recommended products, things we\u2019ve tried and loved ourselves, and other stuff passionate reviewers swear by. Read on for all the creams, razors, combs, trimmers, brushes, cleansers, and aftershaves you need to get a barber-quality shave in your own bathroom.\n\nShaving creams\n\nTaylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream When we pored through hyperenthusiastic Amazon users\u2019 reviews of shaving creams, this one came out on top. It \u201clathers for days,\u201d according to one reviewer, while another writes \u201cthis is exactly what I would expect an old barber shop in 19th-century England to smell like.\u201d Other top-rated shaving creams on the list include recommendations for creams to buy in bulk, ones to use with cheap razors, fragrance-free options, and more. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nProraso Shaving Cream, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz. Another tried and true shaving cream, Proraso was the No. 1 pick when we surveyed grooming experts about the best shaving cream for men. It\u2019s made with glycerin, lactic acid, and menthol, which barbershop owner Russell Manley told us \u201cwork in combination to open up the pores and raise the beard hair. This helps to ensure a close shave with lower likelihood of ingrown hairs.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nCremo Original Shave Cream $5 (was $10, now 50% off) Writer David Walters swears by this Cremo Shave Cream, which he says gives him a surprisingly close and comfortable shave even on his sensitive skin. He also can\u2019t get over how long one bottle lasts him, especially at such an affordable price. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nCartridge razor\n\nGillette Mach 3 Razor with One Blade Refill $7 (was $8, now 13% off) Cartridge razors with disposable blades are often the most practical option for men who want a quick, safe, and close shave. The Mach 3 is a trusted classic, according to the experts we spoke to about the best razors for men, who note its three-blade cartridges are a happy medium between single-blade razors and newer, five-blade cartridge styles. Other expert-approved cartridge razors include Harry\u2019s and the Shick Hydro 5 (which one groomer recommends if you\u2019ve got sensitive skin). $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nStraight razor\n\nDovo Silver Shavette Satin-Finish Straight Razor If you want to try giving yourself a hot-towel-style shave at home, you\u2019ll need a good straight razor. When we asked experts to recommend their favorites, they told us that this \u201cshavette\u201d straight razor from Dovo \u2014 a German company famed for its straight razors \u2014 may actually be the best if you\u2019ve never used one, because it is \u201clightweight and easy to control\u201d but still allows for a nice, close shave. Our expert-approved list of straight razors also includes traditional options, less expensive alternatives, as well as styles from Japan. $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nSafety razor\n\nMerkur 34C Heavy-Duty Short Handle Safety Razor When we asked 13 grooming professionals about the best razors for men, 11 of them told us that a safety razor is actually a better style to use than the more ubiquitous cartridge razors. That\u2019s because, like straight razors, safety razors shave with one blade, which means there\u2019s less of a chance of causing ingrown hairs and razor burn. The German-made Merkur 34C topped our list of expert-recommended safety razors, because it has a shorter, \u201ceasier to grip\u201d handle and a closed comb, meaning it \u201coffers a more protected shave.\u201d $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nElectric razor\n\nPhilips Norelco Electric Shaver 5550 After testing more than a few electric razors, we deemed this Philips Norelco model the best. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, feels good in the hand, and catches hairs on the first pass with hardly any effort.\u201d Plus, it\u2019s easy to clean \u201cwith just a rinse under the sink.\u201d $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nBack-hair shaving tool\n\nRazorba Back Hair Shaver Walters, who turned us on to the Cremo shaving cream above, also swears by this plastic wand that securely holds a cartridge razor and allows you to shave hair from that impossible-to-reach, middle-back triangle all by yourself. With \u201ca few easy up-and-down swipes,\u201d the Razorba solves the unfortunate dilemma of back hair \u201cwith the ease of a back scratcher,\u201d he writes. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nManscaping tool\n\nPhilips Norelco Bodygroomer BG2040/49 If you\u2019re looking for a tool to manscape, experts told us this two-headed Philips Norelco shaver is the most essential. On one end, it has a foil razor, and on the other, a trimmer. According to groomer and hairstylist Ronnie Peterson, \u201cThe adjustable trimmer is better for sensitive areas like the crotch,\u201d and you can use the foil-covered end \u201con the chest if you want to go really clean.\u201d Our full list of expert-recommended manscaping tools also includes more specific picks for difficult areas like the nose and groin. $70 at Amazon Buy $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nBeard trimmer\n\nPhilips Norelco Beard Trimmer Series 7200 Vacuum Trimmer Writer Kurt Soller, who tells us he \u201chas the kind of stubble that\u2019s not quite a beard \u2014 but always verging on it,\u201d swears by this Philips Norelco electric beard trimmer for keeping that stubble at the perfect length. Among the reasons he loves it are a convenient radial dial that lets you easily choose lengths as short 0.5 millimeters, and a vacuum-suction feature that collects the majority of your shaven hairs. Soller tested a lot of beard trimmers to find his favorite, though, and discovered more than a few worthy options, including ultralight models, a travel-friendly one, and more. $55 at Amazon Buy $55 at Amazon Buy\n\nBeard combs\n\nKent Handmade Coarse and Fine Toothed Pocket Comb If you\u2019ve got a beard, grooming pros say its best to use a comb and a brush to maintain it (combs are good for detangling hair; brushes help exfoliate skin and move beard oil or beard balm through the hair). When we asked experts to recommend the best combs, the brand that came up more than any other was Kent, a British company that makes acetate combs known for their premium quality and versatility (because they\u2019re made from fancy plastic, the combs are slim and easy to slip into a pocket). $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Art of Shaving Sandalwood Beard Comb Wood combs, on the other hand, can be better for fuller or longer beards, according to the experts we spoke with. If a wood comb sounds more your style, the pros love this double-sided Art of Shaving model. On one side, it has wider teeth to \u201chelp with thick patches,\u201d and on the other side, \u201cthe narrower teeth help with thinner or finer hair,\u201d explains grooming-supply store owner Chad Beightol. For more expert-recommended beard combs, check out our full list. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBeard brush\n\nKent Boar Bristle Beard and Mustache Brush $48 (was $50, now 4% off) Professionals love that this brush is made of boars\u2019 hair, which they say has the right strength for facial hair and the best texture to help distribute essential and other oils throughout a beard. It took the top spot in our expert-recommended beard-brush guide, which also includes specific brushes for short beards, long beards, travel, and more. $48 at Amazon Buy $48 at Amazon Buy\n\nBeard and mustache scissors\n\nBeard shampoo\n\nBeard oil\n\nMustache wax\n\nWoody's Stache Wax, 0.5 Ounce Barbers told us Woody\u2019s Stache Wax is among the best you can buy because it\u2019s lighter than beeswax and has a medium hold for a more natural look that\u2019s comfortable and easy to wash out. But they also recommend other worthy mustache waxes, including more medium-hold waxes, high-hold options, and even some hair products you can use on your \u2019stache. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nRazor bump remedy\n\nAnthony Glycolic Facial Cleanser $24 (was $28, now 14% off) If you\u2019re looking for a product to get rid of razor bumps and the ingrown hairs that cause them, experts told us that a good exfoliating scrub is among best you can use. This Anthony cleanser is a solid option, according to the grooming pros we talked to, because it contains glycolic acid, which dermatologist Dr. Samer Jaber says is \u201cgood for gentle exfoliation,\u201d and cetyl alcohol, a fatty alcohol that is less irritating than other alcohols but \u201cstill has the effect of contracting the skin,\u201d according to barber David Rodriguez. Our full list of things to get rid of razor bumps includes less expensive exfoliating cleansers as well as spot treatments in both cream and liquid forms. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nAftershaves\n\nNivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm $11 (was $28, now 61% off) To refresh dry, sensitive skin post-shave, dermatologists and professional groomers point to this moisturizing Nivea aftershave that\u2019s light on fragrance and contains no chemicals or alcohol. It is one of eight expert-recommended aftershaves on our list that also includes options for acne-prone and oily skin. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nTend Skin Solution Another expert-recommended aftershave, Tend Skin is a great choice if you\u2019re looking for a product to treat razor bumps and burn, Jaber says. Dazed Editorial Director Bunny Kinney agrees, telling us that he now absolutely swears by this stuff to alleviate razor burn. \u201cLiterally overnight, shaving went from being the bane of my existence; painful, messy, traumatic \u2014 like a perpetual breakup lived out daily across my lower jaw \u2014 to baby smooth. Neck rash, begone,\u201d Kinney writes. $22 at Amazon Buy $16 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
