(AP) - It doesn\u2019t seem to matter who is running UCF\u2019s offense. The 17th-ranked Knights score points in bunches and keep winning.\n\nThree different quarterbacks have started games since two-time American Athletic Conference offensive player of the year Milton McKenzie was lost to a serious knee/leg injury late last season. But one of the nation\u2019s top offenses hasn\u2019t skipped a beat.\n\nWhether it is true freshman Dillon Gabriel, Notre Dame senior transfer Brandon Wimbush or Milton\u2019s backup from a year ago, Darriel Mack Jr., directing the attack, the Knights function well.\n\nStanford is the next team to take a crack at slowing down the defending AAC champions, who haven\u2019t announced which quarterback will take the first snap against the Cardinal on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have to prepare more for their scheme than who is playing quarterback,\u201d Stanford coach David Shaw said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very fast, very confident. They know what they\u2019re doing and are very aggressive,\u201d Shaw added. \u201cThey\u2019re snapping the ball fast and we need to try and keep up. We have to communicate quickly. That\u2019s the fastest tempo team we\u2019ve played in several years.\u201d\n\nWith Wimbush sidelined by an undisclosed injury and Mack on the mend from a broken ankle, Gabriel threw for 245 yards and two touchdowns to pace a 48-14 rout of Florida Atlantic lasts week.\n\nUCF coach Josh Heupel said Wimbush may be ready to play against Stanford. He also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of Mack, who\u2019s cleared to practicing again, seeing some action against the Cardinal, too.\n\nWimbush started and played well in a season-opening 62-0 victory over Florida A&M.; Mack replaced Milton during UCF\u2019s regular-season finale a year ago, then led the Knights to a victory in the AAC championship game the following.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s extremely comfortable with what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Heupel said of Mack, adding \u201che\u2019s in really good shape\u201d and throwing to receivers for a while.\n\nNot that Gabriel has done anything to put himself back on the bench. It\u2019s just nice to have options.\n\nThe freshman, who played at the same high school in Hawaii as Milton, has thrown for 372 yards and five TDs in two games.\n\nHIGH STAKES\n\nThis loomed as a matchup of Top 25 teams hoping to climb higher in the rankings until Stanford stumbled 45-20 at Southern California last week. It\u2019s still a big game for UCF, which for the third straight season is hoping to force its way into the national discussion about who is worthy of consideration for a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Knights haven\u2019t lost a regular-season game the past two years, but this figures to be as tough a test as any UCF has faced during the run.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty consistent the way we approach every week,\u201d said Heupel, adding the Knights haven\u2019t prepared any differently for Stanford than they do any opponent. \u201cOur players understand this is a big game.\u201d\n\nCOSTELLO RETURNS\n\nQuarterback K.J. Costello is back for Stanford after sitting out last week with a head injury suffered during the Cardinal\u2019s season-opening win over Northwestern In his absence, Davis Mills made his first career start against USC.\n\n\u201cCostello will get you fired up. He\u2019s an established leader and player,\u201d tight end Colby Parkinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get a captain back to play.\u201d\n\nDEFENSE SHINES\n\nUCF has scored at least 30 points in 28 consecutive games, the longest streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision since 1936. In outscoring their first two opponents - Florida A&M; and Florida Atlantic - 110-14, one aspect of the team\u2019s success that\u2019s been overshadowed is the defense, which had five sacks and 16 tackles for loss last week. The Knights forced at least one turnover in a nation\u2019s-best 32 straight games before the streak ended last week.\n\nHOME AND HOME\n\nStanford won the only previous meeting between the teams 31-7 at home in 2015. The game Saturday completes a home-and-home agreement.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bigger, faster, stronger than the team we played a few years ago,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a lot, won a lot. They play the game fast and they play the game well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It doesn't seem to matter who is running UCF's offense.
