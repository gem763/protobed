Those cuts have now been made, a spokeswoman said.\n\nAnnouncing the results, JLR chief executive Sir Ralf Speth said it was \"encouraging to see the impact of our Project Charge transformation programme and our improvement initiatives in the China market start to come through in our results\".\n\nIn April this year, JLR shut down production for a week because of uncertainties around Brexit.\n\nThe carmaker also plans to shut down UK factories for a week in November, to adjust production due to uncertainties including Brexit and lower demand for diesel cars, the spokeswoman said.\n\nWith roughly a fifth of its sales to Europe, the firm has previously called for tariff-free and frictionless trade after Brexit.", "description": "The UK carmaker sees sales in China up by almost a quarter, helping it report a profit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17A2D/production/_105131869_mediaitem105131868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
