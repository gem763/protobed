Jasmine (Sam Frost) has enlisted her advice about Robbo\u2019s (Jake Ryan) situation, and Raffy (Olivia Deeble) has been inspired to manage her epilepsy more proactively thanks to her input. Alex has also been getting closer to Willow (Sarah Roberts) after enlisting her as her personal trainer, and she\u2019s recently been surprised to discover that Mason (Orpheus Pledger) is a doctor.\n\nWhen Alex has the night off, she takes the opportunity to get social, spending time with Willow and Mason in Salt. Willow is full of anxiety about how Bella and Colby are doing with the trial, and Alex offers genuine support. Meanwhile, she encourages Mason\u2019s desire to transfer to Northern Districts for his internship instead of travelling to Western Australia and going to the Pilbara.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWillow is appreciative of the new friendship, especially as Dean (Patrick O\u2019Connor) has had his time taken up with Ziggy (Sophie Dillman) and the Astonis, and Colby (Tim Franklin) has been tied up with Bella (Courtney Miller) and Mackenzie (Emily Weir). Meanwhile, Mason is blown away by the gesture Dr Alex is offering when she offers to put in a good word for him at the hospital, realising she could change his life by helping him to progress his medical career instead of remaining at Summer Bay Fit.\n\nAlex is Tori\u2019s temporary replacement at the hospital (Picture: Seven)\n\nWhen Willow hears news about Colby and Bella following Irene\u2019s trial, she makes her excuses and leaves to find them for an update, leaving Alex and Mason alone. The pair continue to drink and talk, with Mason getting increasingly flirty. He says he\u2019s grateful to have her on his side, as it\u2019s been a while, and then tells her that he knows she\u2019s new in town, so probably isn\u2019t looking for anything serious.\n\nAlex realises Mason has interpreted her friendship and support incorrectly, so quickly stops him before he goes any further. She says she didn\u2019t mean anything like that, and he presumes she isn\u2019t into him. She clarifies \u2013 she isn\u2019t into any guys like that, as she\u2019s gay. Mason looks surprised, while Alex asks him if that\u2019s going to be a problem\u2026\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Karen asks Maggie if she can sleep with Ben\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Robbo attacks Dr Alex in terrifying scenes\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mason gets flirty with Dr Alex, but she has something to tell him.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-07-at-00.34.02-b227_1570449358.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
