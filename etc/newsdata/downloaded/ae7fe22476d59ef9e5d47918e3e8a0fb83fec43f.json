The pages, completed around 1280, were found being used as book binding for another document\n\n'Le Roman de la Rose' really was the blockbuster of its day,' Marianne Ailes, a medievalist at the University of Bristol in the UK who rediscovered the new fragments of the manuscript, said in a statement.\n\n'Le Roman de la Rose' (The Romance of the Rose), tells the story of a man (the lover) seeking the favour of a woman (the rose), which was a famous romantic story in its time \u2014 but the new pages show an x-rated side to their love affair.\n\nThe lover presents himself before a reliquary, equipped with his 'staff' and 'scrip' - a pilgrim's pouch or bag; the staff is described as 'stiff and strong'.\n\nHe tells the story about his past uses of equipment, of 'sticking it into those ditches' and kneeling before the relic 'full of agility and vigor, between the two fair pillars...consumed with desire to worship'.\n\n'We know how popular it was from the number of surviving manuscripts and fragments, a picture our fragment adds to, and from the number of allusions to the text in other medieval writings,' said Dr Ailes.\n\nThe poem was started in the 1200s by two authors who worked together to finish the piece by 1280, which is 22,000 lines long.\n\nI tells the story of a man (the lover) seeking the favor of a woman (the rose), which was a famous romantic story in its time -- but the new pages show an x-rated side to their love affair\n\n'The fragments I examined were not in great condition as the double sheet was probably used as a folder or binding for other documents,' she added.\n\n'This was very common at the time as parchment was expensive and very durable, so ideal for recycling for incidental purposes such as bindings or folders.\n\n'As soon as I saw the pages, I instantly recognised the allegorical name of 'bel accueil' \u2014 fair welcome \u2014 from \"Le Roman de la Rose\" and realised that we had something very special and unique on our hands.\n\n'I also could hardly believe how early the handwriting looked.'\n\n'They looked too early for the text they contain, something which was confirmed by Professor Emeritus Ian Short of Birkbeck, University of London, a specialist in medieval handwriting.'\n\nThe pages are said to conclude the story that describes a sexual encounter between the two main characters, the lover and the rose.\n\nAn early translation by the Victorian medievalist FS Ellis in 1900 refused to translate this section of the text but included it in Old French as an appendix noting that he 'believes that those who will read them will allow that he is justified in leaving them in the obscurity of the original'.\n\nThe manuscript is the conclusion to popular French poem entitled 'Le Roman de la Rose' and describes a sexual encounter between the two main characters. Marianne Ailes (pictured) discovered the manuscript\n\n'The Roman de la Rose was at the centre of a late medieval row between intellectuals about the status of women,' said Dr Ailes.\n\n'So we have the possibility that these specific pages were taken out of their original bindings and recycled by someone who was offended by these scenes.'\n\nSince identifying these fragments Professor Ailes has been asked to look at some other fragments of Old French recovered from a binding and held in Dundee City Archive.\n\nThese were of the French epic poem, Fierabras, which was composed around 1200.\n\nThe story of Fierabras concerns the legendary emperor Charlemagne and was translated into most medieval European languages.\n\n'Such fragments tend to be recovered from legal and similar documents and held in the kind of archives literary scholars will rarely need to consult,' said Dr Ailes.\n\n'This find was the result of an academic in another discipline asking me to identify a text, demonstrating how crucial it is for academics to work collaboratively and across the disciplines.'\n\n'No two copies of a text in manuscript are ever identical so each new find adds another piece to a jigsaw which helps us understand how these texts were read and re-interpreted in the Middle Ages.'", "description": "It was used for a book binding, but experts have determined that the scroll is missing lines of an ancient '50 Shades of Gray' novel describing the sexual encounters of the two main characters.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline", "Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19499248-0-image-a-13_1570635924314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
