I unblocked her because I wanted to know what she had to say and she kindly apologised for everything she had done.\n\n'She knew she was in the wrong with everything she had done to me.

'I\u2019m not dating anyone and I haven\u2019t since Megan on Celebs Go Dating. I\u2019m just waiting to see if anyone is going to surprise me around the corner.'\n\nAlthough Megan has apologised, Demi doesn't think she will ever be able to be friends with her ex because she may start to develop romantic feelings for her again.\n\n'The thing is, I don\u2019t know if I could ever be her friend because I had too many deep feelings for her,' she said.", "description": "The former Love Island contestant, 25, and footballer, 27, are said to both be 'upset' by their separation with the singer apparently busy concentrating on new music.", "authors": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/22/19903854-0-image-a-146_1571432993293.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
