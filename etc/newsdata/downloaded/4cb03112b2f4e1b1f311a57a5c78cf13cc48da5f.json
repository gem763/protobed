Those attacks involve an individual or group locking up a computer system and demanding payment before unlocking it, a type of attack that has been increasingly widespread this year across the country.\n\nRead Hassan's letter by kballuck1 on Scribd", "description": "Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dhshomeland_082517getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
