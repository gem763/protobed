A man full of courage and dedicated to the pursuit of fellowship, charity, and conscience, Newman is known for his highly influential writings, poems, meditations, novels, and sermons. One attendant of his services noted that \u201cit was for many of us as though God was speaking to us for the first time.\u201d\n\nSince his death, he has inspired Christians suffering under totalitarianism, and has been seen as a stronghold of continued faith in an increasingly secular world. He is also known for being the most famous convert to Catholicism in British history, and one of the most iconic in the world.\n\nAs an Anglican, Newman quickly rose through the academic ranks of 19th-century England. He was one of the leading members of the Oxford Movement. His following among Anglicans was enormous by religious standards, making him a sort of \u201crock star,\u201d as he\u2019s called in this beautiful BBC documentary on his life. While he argued for fundamental reforms of the Anglican Church, he still held, as was usual for the time, the Catholic Church in strong contempt. At one point, he even called the pope the antichrist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet as he increasingly studied Church history and, in particular, the early Church fathers, he became more skeptical of Anglicanism\u2019s claim to be the true bearer of Christian tradition. The hated Church in Rome, meanwhile, seemed to him to propagate Christian truth much more authentically. And so, in his own words, he decided in 1845 to become \u201cone who, in the middle of his days, is beginning life again.\u201d\n\nHis conversion to Catholicism caused a major uproar in British society, for which allegiance to Rome meant being a traitor to the empire\u2014and for which the conversion of one of its most respected religious thinkers caused great disappointment. As Catholics were barred from holding public office or working at universities, Newman lost his prestigious position at Oxford. Family and friends abandoned him\u2014one of his sisters never spoke to him again.\n\n\u201cPeople mocked him in the street,\u201d Brenden Thompson of Catholic Voices explains. More vocal critics called him a traitor, a liar, someone who had been a \u201ccloset papist\u201d all along.\n\nBut over time, he would change the attitude of the English vis-\u00e0-vis Catholics. In his Apologia pro vita sua, he recollects step by step how his religious views changed and why he eventually converted. In An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, he developed a theory of how dogmas in Catholicism come into being\u2014a theory that would later exert influence on the Second Vatican Council. He argued that simply because a Catholic dogma doesn\u2019t show up exactly as stated in Scripture, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong, as many Protestants would argue. Rather, \u201cexpansion of the Christian Creed and Ritual\u201d would develop slowly over time and further progress as new insights from the original texts were discovered.\n\nEver-continuing inquiry and the attainment of wisdom were essential for Newman, who put education at the forefront of his life, in order that he could get beyond \u201cthis half-knowledge of Christianity.\u201d For this purpose, he founded the Catholic University of Ireland and served as a teacher in Birmingham.\n\nHe surely wouldn\u2019t have expected his influence to extend beyond his death in 1890. In Nazi Germany, for instance, Sophie Scholl and her brother, who led the peaceful White Rose Movement against Hitler\u2019s regime, were \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by Newman\u2019s sermons, and according to scholars, resisted the fascist regime in large part because of his influence.\n\nIt was his work on conscience, which in many regards stood at the forefront of Newman\u2019s religious views, that had the biggest impact on them. For example, though a defender of papal infallibility, Newman would still say, \u201cI shall drink\u2014to the Pope, if you please\u2014still, to Conscience first, and to the Pope afterwards.\u201d\n\nAs Ryan Marr, the director of the National Institute for Newman Studies, argues: \u201cNewman\u2019s nuanced treatment of the role of conscience in the moral life provided the members of the White Rose resistance with the tools necessary to articulate reasons why their refusal to obey Hitler was not only a legitimate option, but morally obligatory.\u201d\n\nA young Joseph Ratzinger, himself no fan of the Nazis, also saw value in the cardinal\u2019s works.\n\nThe man who would later become Pope Benedict XVI is often mentioned in the same breath as Newman. It was Benedict who beatified him in 2010 and who decided to personally travel to England for the occasion. Many saw the beatification as a clear message by the pope at the time: a rallying cry against what he coined \u201cthe dictatorship of relativism.\u201d Both men fought throughout their lives\u2014the pope emeritus still does\u2014against this, in the words of Newman, \u201canti-dogmatic principle,\u201d which is \u201cthe doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion.\u201d\n\nWhen Newman became cardinal, he delivered the Biglietto Speech, a full-fledged attack on what called \u201cliberalism.\u201d As he said, \u201cfor 30, 40, 50 years I have resisted to the best of my powers the spirit of liberalism in religion. Never did Holy Church need champions against it more sorely than now.\u201d\n\nNewman\u2019s \u201cliberalism\u201d is not necessarily political and he certainly uses the term differently than we do in our own age. If we mean by liberalism simply that any human being has inalienable human freedoms and dignity that need to be honored, Newman would have had nothing to object to. Indeed, he says, \u201cthere is much in the liberalistic theory which is good and true,\u201d and arguing for any sort of theocracy would not only be unrealistic in our world but also wrong. Newman instead sought \u201csome way of uniting what is free in the new structure of society with what is authoritative in the old.\u201d\n\nLiberalism does become a problem, however, when it \u201cis intended to supersede, to block out, religion.\u201d It is a problem when the conventional view is that \u201cone creed is as good as another,\u201d that there is, in fact, no truth, but that everything, including God, is merely a matter of opinion, a sentiment, or a taste.\n\nAs the Acton Institute\u2019s Samuel Gregg notes, if there is no objective truth, then all Church teachings and everything in Scripture are \u201cessentially human historical constructs\u201d and thus adaptable to the zeitgeist in whichever way we like. Whereas Newman\u2019s theory of development says that a furthering in Christian doctrine is obviously always possible so long as it stays true to Scripture and earlier teachings, the relativist creed would lead to \u201cwholesale adaptations\u201d from one modernization effort to the next, losing Christian belief along the way.\n\nAs Pope Benedict puts it: \u201cHow do we recognize what is right? How can we discern between good and evil, between what is truly right and what may appear right?\u201d Christianity has natural law for that. But in a relativist mindset, this doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Because the teachings are not verifiable or falsifiable in the positivist creed, \u201cethics and religion must be assigned to the subjective field\u201d and are thus excluded from the public square. But \u201cwhere positivist reason considers itself the only sufficient culture and banishes all other cultural realities to the status of subcultures, it diminishes man, indeed it threatens his humanity.\u201d\n\nCardinal Newman\u2019s life-long endeavor was to bring back his audience to fundamental questions about and the search for truth in life. His work calls us to resist both the temptations of totalitarianism and relativism. Thus he challenges his readers. It is difficult to put him into a box. Instead one constantly feels outboxed by him. It is therefore easily understandable how he has had such a great influence, from British society in his own time to Sophie Scholl to Pope Benedict XVI to many Christians of our age. There is little doubt that we should rejoice for Saint John Henry Newman and his life fully devoted to Christ, despite the challenges we endure because of it.\n\nKai Weiss is a research fellow at the Austrian Economics Center and a board member of the Hayek Institute.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/john-henry-newman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
