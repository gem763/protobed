The move is nearly unprecedented in Canadian politics.\n\nKnown for his fondness for hand-shaking, Trudeau was notably less accessible to the 2,000 supporters who came to hear him speak at a rally in Mississauga, Ontario on Saturday. Photographs of the Canadian leader show Trudeau wearing body armor under his shirt as security personnel escorted him through the crowd. Tellingly, his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, was scheduled to introduce him before he gave his stump speech \u2013 but she failed to appear on stage.\n\nSenior Liberal sources tell CBC, Justin Trudeau was wearing a bullet proof vest on stage for tonight\u2019s rally, after a security threat.\n\nHe was delayed by 1.5 hours and much heavier security around him once on stage. Here\u2019s what our cameras picked up. #cdnpoli#elxn43pic.twitter.com/IZkRjO0bFl \u2014 Salimah Shivji (@salimah_shivji) October 12, 2019\n\nThe precautions were put in place after the campaign was made aware of a credible security threat, according to the CBC. Although the campaign event went smoothly, such security concerns are almost unheard of in Canadian politics. Unlike its neighbor to the south, there is almost no history of political violence in Canada.\n\nTrudeau faces a tight election on October 21, with the Liberals neck-and-neck with the opposition Conservatives, led by Andrew Scheer.\n\nIn a tweet, Scheer said that it was \u201cvery upsetting\u201d to hear that Trudeau had to wear a bulletproof vest. \u201cThreats of violence against political leaders have absolutely no place in our democracy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nVery upsetting to hear that Justin Trudeau had to wear a bulletproof vest tonight at a campaign event. Threats of violence against political leaders have absolutely no place in our democracy. Thank you to the RCMP for taking these threats seriously and keeping us safe. \u2014 Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) October 13, 2019\n\nWhile many on social media were similarly upset by the news, some members of the Twitterati speculated that the security threat was a ruse to drum up sympathy for the embattled prime minister. Several netizens even blamed Scheer for dividing the country and stoking the threat of political violence.\n\nYou helped with your message of division and hate so I am sorry it doesn\u2019t absolve you! \u2014 D S (@Danielle2671) October 13, 2019\n\nLike this story?
