There\u2019s no question that what happened is disturbing. It\u2019s unacceptable. And it needs to be looked into fully.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials on Friday said that they found 2,246 medically preserved aborted fetuses in the Illinois home of Klopfer, who died on Sept. 3. He operated three Indiana clinics in South Bend, Fort Wayne, and Gary, the last of which closed in 2016 in the midst of a state licensing board trial on documentation and reasonable care violations.\n\nButtigieg's campaign previously ignored inquiries from the Washington Examiner about the Klopfer revelations and faced pressure to speak out about the fetal remains. Fox News host Tucker Carlson featured Buttigieg's lack of a public statement in a Tuesday evening segment.\n\nRepublican National Committee spokeswoman Liz Harrington highlighted Buttigieg's \"extreme\" views on abortion . \u201cButtigieg invokes the Bible to justify abortion up until a baby takes a breath. Will he use it to condemn the evil acts of an abortionist who operated unlicensed out of his home town?\" Harrington said to the Washington Examiner, adding that for today\u2019s Democrats, \"nothing gets in the way of a radical, no-limits abortion agenda.\"\n\nButtigieg, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, declines to support any third-trimester abortion restrictions, saying, \u201cThese hypotheticals are set up to provoke a strong emotional reaction.\u201d Earlier this month, he used the Bible to support abortion: \u201cThere's a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath,\u201d Buttigieg said .\n\nRepublican Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski , who represents South Bend, said in a statement that Klopfer\u2019s \u201ccareless treatment of human remains is an outrage\u201d and called for state and federal authorities to conduct a full investigation.\n\nThe White House also called for an investigation to \u201cdetermine whether crimes were committed and if anyone else was involved,\u201d with White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere adding that the White House is \u201chorrified by the news that thousands of fetal remains have been discovered\u201d in Klopfer\u2019s home.\n\nRepublican Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, whose district encompasses Fort Wayne, told the Washington Examiner that he hoped Buttigieg would \"explain why he chose to oppose alternative pregnancy care options for women just after we learned some of Dr. Klopfer's violations.\"\n\nIndiana's health board suspended Klopfer\u2019s medical license in 2016 after it found that he did not give pain medication to all patients and failed to timely report abortions on two girls under the age of 14 within the required three-day time period, among other issues. Testimony revealed that Klopfer used \u201cthe same abortion and sedation procedures from the 1970s and 1980s,\u201d according to the South Bend Tribune.\n\nBanks said that Buttigieg\u2019s 2018 veto of a zoning change that would have allowed a pro-life pregnancy center to operate next to a new South Bend abortion clinic, Whole Woman\u2019s Health, \u201cdeserves a lot more scrutiny\u201d in light of the Klopfer revelations.\n\nButtigieg said at the time that \u201cit is far from clear that a neighborhood benefits from co-locating facilities with such opposite views,\u201d prompting some critics to say that the veto violated free speech. The pro-life clinic later found a new location close to the building it originally wanted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Pete had presidential politics on his mind when the veto occurred,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the larger issue here, is that Mayor Pete always tried to portray himself as more moderate.\u201d\n\nThe Indiana health department rejected a license for Whole Woman\u2019s Health, citing a failure to show \u201creputable and responsible character\u201d and disclose information, but the clinic is operating under a federal injunction.\n\nSouth Bend physician Laura McGuire in 2017 argued that Whole Woman\u2019s Health has \u201cthe same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer.\u201d Original state license application paperwork showed that the administrator for Klopfer\u2019s former clinic, Liam Morley, was listed as the administrator for the new abortion clinic. Whole Woman\u2019s Health told the Washington Examiner that Morley is no longer an employee and no other former Klopfer employees are or have been employees of the new clinic.\n\nDespite Whole Woman\u2019s Health\u2019s license issues, Buttigieg publicly supports the abortion clinic.\n\n\u201cThe mayor is deeply concerned by what he views as a new and extreme assault on Roe v. Wade in legislatures across the country,\u201d Buttigieg campaign national press secretary Chris Meagher told the Chicago Tribune in August. \u201cThe South Bend clinic would be the only one for a radius of several counties.\"\n\nThe new clinic on Tuesday addressed news of Klopfer keeping aborted fetuses in his home.\n\n\u201cAll of us at Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance are shocked by the news. We join the community seeking more information and awaiting the results of the investigation,\u201d Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, said in a statement.\n\nKerry Picket and Kimberly Leonard contributed to this story.", "description": "Following days of silence, 2020 Democrat Pete Buttigieg Wednesday addressed the discovery of thousands of fetal remains in the home of late abortionist Ulrich Klopfer, who worked in the mayor\u2019s hometown of South Bend, Indiana, for decades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64cb82d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1060x557+0+22/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F4d%2F2d%2F410bf5474ecfb8895550cce96868%2Fap-19259858926973.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
