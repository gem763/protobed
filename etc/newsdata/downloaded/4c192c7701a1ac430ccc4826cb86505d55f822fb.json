The spending includes $100 billion in \u201cExcellence Grants\u201d over a decade -- the equivalent of $1 million for every U.S. school -- and $50 billion to improve buildings and other infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe vastly unequal state of public school facilities is unacceptable and a threat to public education,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post Monday. \u201cWe cannot legitimately call our schools \u2018public\u2019 when some students have state-of-the-art classrooms and others do not even have consistent running water. The federal government must step in.\u201d\n\nWarren has been a long-time supporter of teachers, and on the campaign trail, she regularly recounts her job as a special-education teacher early in her career. She\u2019s also been vocal in her criticism of Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary -- a billionaire and advocate of charter schools and taxpayer-funded school vouchers.\n\nWealth Tax\n\nTo pay for her plan, the Warren campaign said the allocation from her proposed wealth tax will shift. The campaign estimates the tax will raise about $2.75 trillion over a decade. From that, Warren will cover her $1.07 trillion universal child-care plan, the cancellation of $640 billion of student debt, $610 billion for free-college tuition and now $800 billion for K-12 education.\n\nIf her plan for a 2-cent tax on fortunes above $50 million is enacted, the 75,000 richest U.S. families would be paying the costs of raising and schooling every American child.\n\nThe tax reallocation means her $100 billion opioids plan, $7 billion small-business equity fund and $20 billion election security and administration investment -- previously funded from the wealth tax -- will be covered by closing the \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d loophole in the tax on inherited assets, which will raise more than $100 billion over 10 years, the campaign said.\n\nStudent Data\n\nBesides her vow to bar Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google from collecting student data to market products, Warren would ban the sharing, storing and sale of data with information identifying individual students to block educational technology companies and for-profit schools from selling their data to corporations. She would also tighten restrictions for companies that lobby school systems that receive federal funding.\n\nWarren also would ban for-profit charter schools and halt federal funding to expand such schools, which she said have been an \u201cabject failure.\u201d She would toughen accountability requirements, direct the Internal Revenue Service to investigate any non-profit schools that break the law and expand enforcement of Justice Department whistle-blower actions for schools that commit fraud against taxpayers.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator said she\u2019d use some of the $450 billion in funding in her plan to increase teacher pay. She promised to replace DeVos with a former teacher and give public employees such as teachers more negotiating power while making it easier for them to join a union.\n\nWarren\u2019s vision for schools, outlined in a 17-page document released Monday, includes eliminating high-stakes standardized tests, ending zero-tolerance discipline policies and canceling student meal debt while boosting federal funding for free breakfasts and lunches, including meals over weekends and holidays for students who need it.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou in Washington at megkolfopoul@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Steve Geimann, Mark Niquette\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled an $800 billion plan to fund her progressive proposal for reshaping U.S. public education and disclosed that her signature wealth tax will pay for school and child-care initiatives -- in effect transferring the cost of raising a child from birth to college", "authors": ["Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
