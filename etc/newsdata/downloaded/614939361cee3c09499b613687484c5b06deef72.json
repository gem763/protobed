In the attorney\u2019s life, you can see the strange ease with which a sybaritic con man fit in with crusading social reactionaries. You see the glee Cohn derived from being an exception to the rules he enforced on weaker people. From him, Trump learned how, when he was in trouble, to change the subject by acting outrageously, to never apologize and always stay on the offense. When the Justice Department claimed that apartment buildings owned by the Trump family were discriminating against black renters, it was Cohn\u2019s idea to countersue the Justice Department for $100 million.\n\nIn the 1950s, as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy, Cohn wasn\u2019t just a key player in the anti-Communist witch hunts of the time. He also persecuted men in the State Department who were suspected of being gay, despite being a closeted gay man himself. Later, he became a consigliere to New York\u2019s mafia families, some of whom also had ties to Trump, even as he ranted about law and order.\n\nThe film\u2019s title comes from something Trump said when he was frustrated with then Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Cohn was Trump\u2019s template for what a lawyer is supposed to be. (In Attorney General Bill Barr, he seems to have found someone who satisfies him.) \u201cRoy was somebody that had no boundaries,\u201d a lawyer in his firm says in the film. \u201cAnd if you were on the right side of him, it was great. And if you were on the wrong side of him, it was terrible.\u201d", "description": "From McCarthyism to the mob to Trump, Cohn enabled evil.
