Influential proxy adviser ISS helped doom the deal by recommending shareholders oppose it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGET OUT OF JAIL FREE\n\n\"We regret cancelling the EGM. We have spent a significant amount of time engaging with our shareholders and continue to believe in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of the acquisition,\" Sunrise Chairman Peter Kurer said.\n\nNot even support from investment banks UBS, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs was able to help Sunrise get the deal across the finish line.\n\nAlthough the share purchase agreement technically remains in force until late February, Sunrise made clear the deal was effectively dead.\n\n\"Management is now really focused on implementing the standalone strategy. We respect the decision of the shareholders,\" Swantee told Reuters, adding he did not expect to resume negotiations with Liberty Global.\n\nAsked about his future after championing a deal that went awry, Swantee said only: \"Our priority is stabilizing Sunrise.\"\n\nKurer, who has said he would likely be voted out of office if the deal failed, was also under fire. \"We expect that he will now draw the consequences and immediately resign as chairman,\" activist AOC said.\n\nSunrise shares, which had fallen more than 10% this year, gained 2.7% by 1230 GMT.\n\nFreenet boss Christian Vilanek saw more room for them to rise. \"If we all pull together the stock can rise significantly over the next 12 to 24 months,\" he said, adding Freenet had no plans to divest its Sunrise stake.\n\nAnalysts said the collapse would ease pressure on prices in the Swiss market. \"Swisscom receives a 'get out of jail free' card,\" Berenberg analyst Usman Ghazi said.\n\nThe future of UPC remained in limbo. Ghazi said he doubted UPC would join forces with Salt, the third big Swiss player, but an investment banker involved in the deal said this was clearly a possibility, if not in the immediate future.\n\nLiberty Global, which is exiting several European markets, was unlikely to change course and become a buyer, analysts said.\n\nUPC Swiss head Severina Pascu said her operation remained a successful company with a strong standalone strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Michael Shields; Additonal reporting by Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, David Evans, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Jan Harvey)", "description": "Sunrise Communications Group  bowed to investor pressure on Tuesday and scrapped its 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.39 billion) acquisition of Liberty Global's  Swiss cable business UPC.
