They tangled first over the NAFTA trade agreement, later on immigration, nationalism and defense spending, in ways that sometimes reinforced Trudeau\u2019s appeal, but which also showed him to be just another prime minister coping with his big difficult neighbor.\n\nIn 2019 a more disturbing Trudeau track record emerged into public view: one of poor judgment, from a love of painting his face in racist makeup to seeking to shield a large Canadian company neck-deep in bribes from criminal charges.\n\nNow, in the heat of Canada\u2019s federal election campaign \u2014 early voting begins Friday \u2014 the question asked about Trudeau around the world is: does the emperor have clothes?\n\nWas the world really into Trudeau: or is his good brand \u2014 tangled up as it is with Canada\u2019s reputation on the global stage \u2014 disappearing like one of the fun memes it was based on?\n\nAs a member of the G-7 and G-20, Canada carries weight whoever leads it. But with one of the most recognizable and highly rated national brands, and with a campaign for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council underway, Canada also has a lot to lose.\n\nUltimately, Canada\u2019s reputation is bigger than Trudeau. But Canadians care deeply about their national brand. Everything from real estate advertising to the political parties themselves are swathed in red and white, the national colors. In case anyone in Ottawa forgets where they live, they are permanently reminded that the answer is \u201cCanada,\u201d thanks to the official government brand logo appearing on every second building.\n\nPOLITICO tested perceptions of Canada with 20 current and former ministers, commissioners, diplomats and trade negotiators from Europe, the United States, Middle East and Australia. Most did not want to speak on-the-record, for fear of being seen interfering in Canada\u2019s election process. A representative view of their opinions on Canada and Trudeau\u2019s role on several key issues appears below.\n\nWe also asked for opinions about opposition leader Andrew Scheer. The most common reaction around the world: \u201cWho?\u201d It turns out that Scheer is not merely an unknown quantity in Washington, D.C. (despite holding dual Canada-U.S. citizenship), but in all of the forums Canada deals in, with the exception of the U.K.\u2019s Conservative government.\n\nCorruption\n\nCanada has long enjoyed a relatively squeaky-clean image when it comes to corruption. But while Ottawa is not alone in lecturing the developing world about transparency and governance, this year\u2019s SNC-Lavalin scandal and Trudeau\u2019s defensive response to it have underlined a big gap between its contributions to anti-corruption plans at global summits and its weak laws and enforcement at home, according to Transparency International.\n\nThanks to SNC-Lavalin, which was involved in a conspiracy to pay more than $160 million in bribes to the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi over a bridge project in Bangladesh, Canadian companies now make up around half of the 250 companies blacklisted by the World Bank.\n\nThe scandal has \u201cput pressure on Canada in the multilateral processes,\u201d said James Cohen, spokesperson for Transparency International, because it builds on \u201ccriticism by the OECD over lack of adherence to convention against bribery,\u201d and compounds a money-laundering problem in Canada that TI has labeled snow-washing. \u201cCanada plays an active role in global corruption because of lax anti-money laundering laws,\u201d said Cohen.", "description": "After the election of President Donald Trump, Trudeau was cast in \u2014 and readily accepted alongside Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron \u2014 the role of Trump\u2019s foil.
