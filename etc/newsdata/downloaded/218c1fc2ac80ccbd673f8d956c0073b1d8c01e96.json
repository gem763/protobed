He blows in, fringe fluttering, suit flapping, his manager reeling behind him. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he barks when my translator stands up for the formal introductions. \u201cNo introductions, time is too tight.\u201d Ohata has a bullet train to catch after our interview, but the way he\u2019s moving it is like he is planning on overtaking it after it has left the station. Which fits. Because if you can picture Ohata, you will see him racing down the right wing past Allan Bateman maybe, or Tommy Bowe, or Christophe Dominici, or any other of the hapless backs he beat on his way to the tryline.\n\nOhata scored 69 tries in Test rugby, which is still the world record: six more than Shane Williams, five more than David Campese, two more than Bryan Habana. A lot of them were against teams way down the rankings \u2013 South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong \u2013 but still, he is in the World Rugby Hall of Fame, and in Japan he is a superstar. Not, he says, that it counts for much. \u201cLook, before this World Cup the word \u2018rugby\u2019 didn\u2019t even really register in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Ohata explains. \u201cYes, it\u2019s changing, but this kind of popularity we have now was unthinkable even a month ago.\u201d\n\nJapan want to reach World Cup last eight by beating Scotland, insists Joseph Read more\n\nBaseball is the big sport, and has been since before Ohata was a kid. \u201cAll my friends were playing it, and everyone was a Hanshin Tigers fan,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t like that, I wanted to build an identity for myself around doing something different and interesting, and that was rugby.\u201d\n\nOhata played for Japan between 1996 and 2006, all through the underdog years. He says he was never worried about the world record. \u201cIndividual tries aren\u2019t what rugby\u2019s about. What I really wanted to was to send a message that you can be small and still compete.\u201d\n\nThings only started to change for Japan in 2012, when Eddie Jones took over as coach. Ohata had retired by then because of a knee injury and his place had been taken by Toshiaki Hirose, who is from the same city as Ohata and played in the same position, but is a very different character. Hirose cheerfully admits he is enjoying this World Cup because he has been able to \u201cdrink beer and watch it on TV\u201d. But Jones saw something he liked in Hirose and made him captain. Hirose still shudders when he thinks about what it was like to play for him. \u201cVery tough. I don\u2019t want to do that again, no thank you.\u201d\n\nThey were close, Hirose says, but \u201cEddie was very hard \u2013 very, very hard \u2013 on me, on himself, and on everyone else.\u201d There is a famous video of a press conference from 2012, after Japan had lost to the French Barbarians. Jones spoke for three minutes about how badly they had played. Then Hirose laughed nervously, and Jones exploded. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d He spent the next 15 minutes tearing into the players, the press, and everyone else. \u201cThis is the problem with Japanese rugby!\u201d Hirose stared at the table.\n\n\u201cAt the time I was very angry about it,\u201d Hirose remembers, \u201cbut later I started to understand that he wasn\u2019t angry with me, he was angry with the union, the media, everybody.\u201d Hirose had to figure it out for himself. \u201cEddie never explained anything to me.\u201d\n\nHirose realised it was a calculated insult. Jones wanted to spur them into thinking differently. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a winning culture because we had been losing for 24 years, so Eddie had to change our mindset. And that was very hard for him. Japanese people tend to focus on the \u2018can\u2019t\u2019, Eddie taught us to focus on the \u2018can\u2019. He taught us that Japan may not be as big as other teams but we can still beat them because we have discipline, we have togetherness, and we work hard.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japan savour an impressive victory over South Africa in 2015, with then head coach Eddie Jones.

It was the beginning of the run towards that famous 2015 World Cup victory against South Africa in Brighton.\n\nHirose did not make it on to the field in that match. Jones, who once described him as \u201cthe best captain in the game\u201d, also decided he was not worth his place. Hirose retired soon after and has been working as an actor since, in a soap set in a rugby club, No Side Game; he is also running a project called Scrum Unison, which teaches Japanese fans to sing along to their national anthem and everyone else\u2019s too. The reason people in the stands during this tournament know all the words to, say, God Bless Fiji or the Himno Nacional de Uruguay, is because they have studied Hirose\u2019s videos.\n\nHis God Save The Queen makes me wince, but it is a brilliant project. It is like Hirose is running a one-man campaign to do everything he can for the game. \u201cI don\u2019t just want Japanese people to watch rugby,\u201d he says. \u201cI want them to understand its values too.\u201d He is worried that this World Cup is going to be a missed opportunity, just like the last one was. \u201cIn 2015 we beat South Africa and Samoa and maybe then lots of Japanese kids wanted to play rugby, but they had no place to go and play. This year we have another chance, so we have to take it.\u201d\n\nHirose and Ohata agree that Japan needs more games against the top countries. Hirose would like to see them play in the rugby championship alongside Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina. But more than that, he says: \u201cWe also need to develop a professional domestic league. Right now it\u2019s still amateur, even though we have some professional players in it.\u201d And below that \u201cwe also have to build up the grass roots, the schools, and clubs.\u201d\n\n'Re-written history': how Japan reacted to shock win over Ireland Read more\n\nFirst he would scrap the system that forces Japanese children to specialise in one sport from a young age. There are kids watching rugby for the first time now, Hirose insists, who cannot switch to it because they are already playing baseball. Maybe, he suggests, he will launch an academy himself. He has already launched Japan\u2019s first players\u2019 association.\n\nHirose believes there are things the Japanese people can learn from his sport. This team, he says, are role-modelling multiculturalism in a monocultural society. \u201cMaybe if our teams was just Japanese it wouldn\u2019t be so successful,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have Asian guys, Australian guys, Tongan guys, a real mix, not just Japanese. And outside of the sport, our population is shrinking, so we need foreigners to immigrate. So I think it\u2019s an important lesson not just for Japanese rugby but for Japan, because we can show people how you can make a successful team from a diverse mix of people.\u201d\n\nI am not sure Ohata would agree with all that. He talks instead about how, rather than rely on help from the rest of the world, he would like Japan to lead the development of the sport \u201cby sending a message to the other teams in Asia that they can do well too\u201d.\n\nWhere he and Hirose do come together, though, is in their disbelief at how much the game changed in the short time since they retired. Japan are not a team of underdogs anymore. \u201cIf they can beat Ireland, the world\u2019s No 1 team there\u2019s no limit to what they can do,\u201d says Ohata. \u201cIt\u2019s much bigger already,\u201d says Hirose. \u201cRugby\u2019s not a major sport in Japan yet, but if we get this right it can become one.\u201d", "description": "Former greats Daisuke Ohata and Toshiaki Hirose want this famous World Cup to change rugby\u2019s fortunes in Japan for good", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57541e4e36555671616a601fab4be2c421f4e112/0_57_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df145e9954ac44628c7dce65d5243e03", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
