Instead, we think the PBOC\u2019s other stated goal \u2013 to lower borrowing costs for firms \u2013 is a more important driver of the move.\u201d\n\nLowering borrowing costs is an important step for Beijing to take as it looks to inject liquidity into an economy that is growing at its slowest pace since 1992. The Chinese economy grew at a 6.2 percent rate in the second quarter, impacted by the more than yearlong trade war Beijing and Washington.\n\nThe tit-for-tat trade war has seen the U.S. slap tariffs on more than $350 billion of Chinese goods and China tax $185 billion of U.S. products. It has caused both foreign and local companies to divert production from China and establish new supply chains in other countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce announced the two sides will meet in Washington in October to work toward a trade deal. But many on Wall Street think a deal is far off on the horizon and that an elusive deal will take a toll on the Chinese economy.\n\nA team of Hong Kong-based economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts tariffs will remain in place until the end of 2020, causing China\u2019s economic growth to slow to 5.7 percent.\n\n\u201cWith more extensive and higher US tariffs activated, we expect stiffer headwind on Chinese exports, which will likely thwart capex demand further and become the catalyst for policy turnaround,\u201d they wrote.\n\nA team of Hong Kong-based analysts at Barclays agreed. They say Beijing won\u2019t take a more aggressive policy stance until further pressure is put on the Chinese economy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWe think China is saving more aggressive action (eg, raising LG special bonds quota in Q4, and cutting policy rates aggressively) should further downward pressure \u2013 eg from escalation of trade tension or a slowing global economy \u2013 on growth materialize,\u201d they wrote.", "description": "China just slashed its reserve requirement ratio to ignite economy.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/China-Xi-Speech_Limi.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
