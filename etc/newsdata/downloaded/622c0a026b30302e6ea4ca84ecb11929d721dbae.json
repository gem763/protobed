Defending sometimes causes him problems.\u201d\n\nWith Gnabry in top form and Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski making his best start ever in the Bundesliga with 10 goals from six games so far, the champions have every right to believe they are gradually hitting their stride.\n\nHaving won the last seven league titles in succession, early season slip-ups against Hertha Berlin and RB Leipzig initially raised questions regarding the team\u2019s commitment and drive to win an eighth league crown.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s victory in London is as big a confidence boost as they get.\n\n\u201cThere are many things that we still need to improve but such a game can carry us for the next few weeks,\u201d said defender Niklas Suele.\n\nSecond-placed Leipzig, on 13, travel to improving Bayer Leverkusen, who are unbeaten at home since April and are also on 13, in sixth place on goal difference.\n\nFreiburg, third also on 13, entertain self-proclaimed title contenders Borussia Dortmund, in eighth on 11 points and with only one win from their last four league games.\n\nBut Dortmund also head into the game with an improving confidence after their own 2-0 Champions League win at Slavia Prague on Wednesday ended a run of three straight draws in all competitions for the Ruhr valley club.", "description": "Bayern Munich winger Serge Gnabry's four-goal bonanza against Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League this week is an ominous warning for his former club Hoffenheim who travel to Bavaria on Saturday.", "authors": ["Karolos Grohmann", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436579847&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920MO"}
