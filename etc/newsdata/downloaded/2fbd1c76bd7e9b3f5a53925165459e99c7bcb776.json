I had taken out an ad in the student paper for the talk, it was all set to go, and then yesterday I got a notice for refund to my credit card from the assistant director of student life, a woman named Nanci Healey. This seemed odd. Had something gone awry? Sure enough, the ad had been canceled. Apparently, it doesn\u2019t meet the editorial standards of the paper, although no further explanation has been forthcoming.\n\nThe ad invited people to learn why their pre-conceptions about nationalism are incorrect:\n\nThat this is ruled out of bounds goes precisely to a point I make in my book. The greatest killer of the 20th century was trans-national ideology, especially Communism. But I\u2019m sure I could take out an ad for a laudatory talk about Karl Marx or socialism and no one would bat an eyelash, in fact would welcome it. But if you want to say, \u201cHey, Alexander Hamilton, arguably the greatest American nationalist, had a point,\u201d or \u201cYou know, nationalism has been part of the American mainstream, from the time of the American Revolution onward,\u201d or, \u201cGee, it\u2019s a very good thing that we live in a world of sovereign nation-states,\u201d no one wants to hear it.\n\nFor folks at NYU, by the way, the talk is Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Silver Center, Room 207.", "description": "That this ad is ruled out of bounds goes precisely to a point Rich Lowry makes in his new book.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
