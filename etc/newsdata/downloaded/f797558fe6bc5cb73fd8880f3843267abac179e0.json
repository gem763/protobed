Others use their platform to support their community; still others, social justice. Only one is going to the wall for a watch that costs as much as a house.\n\nCleveland, welcome to the OBJ Experience. You can\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOdell Beckham Jr., possessed of an infinite capacity to both outrun his defenders and infuriate his backers, has decided to make as his first cause of 2019 the right to wear a Richard Mille RM 11-03 McLaren watch while on the field of play.\n\nYes, really.\n\nThe watch retails for $191,500, but you might be able to knock a few bucks off that if you keep your eyes open for a Groupon. Only 500 were made, and possibly only one \u2014 the one on OBJ\u2019s wrist as he played Tennessee on Sunday \u2014 has a custom Cleveland Browns-orange band.\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nIt\u2019s a beauty of a watch, and a damn sight better for timekeeping than pulling out your phone every 10 minutes. But it\u2019s one hell of a curious talisman to bring onto a field if you\u2019re truly interested in winning football games. And it definitely doesn\u2019t pair well with victimhood ... which is exactly what Beckham, for whatever reason, is now doing.\n\n(Yahoo Sports illustration by Michael Wagstaffe)\n\nAt a Tuesday media session, Beckham was asked about his fashion future in regards to the watch. \u201cI\u2019ll still be wearing it,\u201d he replied. Asked to clarify if he meant during games, he added, \u201cThe same way I wear it every day, at practice, I go here, I go there. I\u2019ve been wearing it. Take a shower with it on. It\u2019s just on me.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe NFL forbids players from wearing watches on the field for the obvious reason that players on the field are running into each other at high speeds, and having a watch in the mix does nobody any good. There\u2019s a clock right there on the stadium wall, if Beckham\u2019s worried about missing a dinner reservation.\n\nOf course, Beckham has found a seam in the NFL rules and has proceeded to treat it the way he treats the Washington secondary: with total disregard.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look into the rulebook,\u201d he said, when asked specifically about the NFL\u2019s prohibition. \u201cIt says you can\u2019t wear any hard objects,\u201d he said. \u201cThe watch is plastic. But people have knee braces on that are hard and made out of metal and you don\u2019t see them taping it up, no jewelry on, so I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nTo paraphrase the esteemed dinosaur expert Dr. Ian Malcolm: OBJ\u2019s so concerned with whether he could bring a watch onto the field that he\u2019s not even thinking about whether he should.\n\nSeriously. Wearing a $200,000 watch on an NFL field? In what world other than Planet OBJ is this a good idea?\n\nCalled out on the absurdity of bringing a watch that\u2019s four times the value of the average Cleveland house into a game, Beckham retreated to an easy cliche: that he\u2019s the real victim here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to play football,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cI would love for them to talk about football and what I do on the field, if I messed up on the field or if I didn\u2019t do well on the field, talk about my performance. Don\u2019t talk about any extracurricular, that\u2019s just it. If anybody else would\u2019ve worn the watch, or if it was a $20 watch, it wouldn\u2019t have been no problem.\u201d\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. and his watch, on left wrist, challenge the Titans. (Getty)\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right. But this is Odell Beckham Jr., second-highest-paid wide receiver in the league. And this is a six-figure watch he made sure to wear so that it showed up on television and in photos. One does not do such things if one is interested only in playing football. You can\u2019t go blowing off fireworks in your backyard and get upset when the neighbors complain about the noise. You can\u2019t claim you\u2019re just interested in doing your job when you bring a Mardi Gras band with you to the office.\n\nNFL coaches love to talk about \u201cdistractions.\u201d A player speaking his mind isn\u2019t a distraction. A player losing focus because he\u2019s trying to find the pieces of his quarter-million-dollar watch that got stomped into the turf \u2026 now that\u2019s a distraction. The Browns play the Jets on Monday night, and every member of the Jets secondary has to be eyeing Beckham\u2019s left wrist the way Bill Belichick eyes reputation-damaged players.\n\nGood on Beckham for buying (or, at the very least, receiving) the watch; as one of the league\u2019s marquee players, he\u2019s earned it. Cleveland is going to get some astonishing production and some amazing catches out of him. But along the way, it might just find out why the Giants deemed him expendable, too.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
