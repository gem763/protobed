Born in Ukraine, his family fled the Soviet Union when he was three years old and has since specialized on U.S. relations toward his home country. After listening to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, he reported its contents to the NSC\u2019s top attorney.\n\nDemocrats are investigating whether Trump tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival Biden by withholding military aid from the country, which has been fighting a war with Russian-backed separatists in its eastern region since 2014.\n\nOn Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her intention to formalize the impeachment inquiry with a House-wide vote on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow representatives. \u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d", "description": "Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman will testify today that he believed Trump endangered national security during the call.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
