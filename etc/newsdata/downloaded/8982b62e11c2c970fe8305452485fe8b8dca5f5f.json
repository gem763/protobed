The survey polled 360 senior insurance executives, accounting for $16 trillion of industry assets, BlackRock said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we see some caution exemplified by a more selective risk appetite relative to 2018, particularly in Europe, we are still far removed from the risk aversion we saw in 2017,\u201d Charles Hatami, Global Head of BlackRock\u2019s Financial Institutions Group Global said in the report.\n\n\u201cThe shift toward monetary policy easing appears an important factor in explaining insurers\u2019 constructive mood this late in the cycle,\u201d he said.\n\nWith economic growth slowing around the world a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have tweaked policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over the last year.\n\nThe survey showed insurers intend to allocate more to private markets such as private equity and real estate equity.\n\nOn average, insurers expect to increase their private market allocations as a proportion of their total portfolio from 6.6% to 8.5% over the next three years, the survey found.\n\nAllocations to government bonds is one area where insurers have turned more cautious, as negative interest rates begin to pressure insurers looking to generate returns, the survey found.", "description": "While less sanguine about the macro risk than in 2018, global insurance companies remain optimistic about the investment outlook despite the late stage of the economic cycle and abundance of geopolitical risks, according to a survey released on Monday by BlackRock Inc .", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
