That compares with 2,933 citations in all of last year.\n\nThe Star Tribune says the Department of Transportation is testing a system of beacons and detectors during the morning rush hours on Intestates 35W and 35E. As a driver with a valid carpool tag passes an antenna, it flashes blue. An amber light flashes if the antenna does not detect a tag. A trooper must determine a vehicle has only one occupant before making a stop.\n\nA citation can cost carpool lane cheaters up to $300.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minnesota transportation officials are testing new technology to catch carpool lane cheaters.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
