Text messages between him, Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, and then-U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker suggest that Sondland was a key player in working to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden at President Trump\u2019s behest.\n\nREAD: How Gordon Sondland went from Trump critic to Trump's Ukraine whisperer.\n\nSondland was also mentioned by the anonymous intelligence-community whistleblower whose complaint launched this investigation \u2014 they said Sondland helped \u201c\u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSondland had been scheduled to testify earlier this week but was blocked by the State Department. Later that day, the White House announced it wouldn\u2019t cooperate in any form with the House\u2019s impeachment investigation, and planned to stonewall all requests.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how substantive the testimony will be or how open Sondland will be with the committees. Sondland\u2019s attorneys say he won\u2019t be able to produce the documents and materials relevant to the case that the committees have requested, arguing that federal law and State Department regulations bar him from sharing those materials without approval from the Secretary of State, though they request that his bosses agree to share the relevant information before his Thursday testimony.\n\nCover: BRUSSELS JULY 12 - New Ambassador of the United States to the European Union Gordon Sondland is talking to media prior an EU Energy Council, on July 12, 2018, in the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarter.
