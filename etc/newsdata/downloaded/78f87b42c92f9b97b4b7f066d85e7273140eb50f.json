So in honor of National Vodka Day, Fox News consulted a range of experts to deliver some insights \u2014 and recipes \u2014 regarding one of America's preferred spirits.\n\nBob Nolet, the vice president of marketing and the master distiller at Nolet Spirits, the producers of Ketel One, tells Fox News the drink has been \"popular in the U.S. for a very long time,\" but credits the \"cocktail mania\" of the '80s for inspiring his own mother \u2014 among other spirit innovators \u2014 to develop their brands suited to new tastes.\n\nWHISKEY VS. WHISKY: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nAnd after long and careful consideration, he's pretty confident that 007's preferred martini was made with vodka as opposed to gin.\n\n\"James Bond's preferred martini is a vodka martini, judging by how often he orders them in his novels,\" says Nolet says. \"He orders 19 vodka martinis, 16 gin martinis and one Vesper martini, made with both.\" (The website VinePair also credits 1962 film adaptation of \"Dr. No\" with popularizing the notion of a vodka martini, after Bond is provided with one at his request.)\n\nAnd not only is Bond fond of vodka \u2014so are Americans. In the United States, vodka commands about 33 percent of the market share (by volume) among all spirits categories, and it ranks as the largest spirits category in the U.S., by volume, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.\n\nThe popularity of vodka very much predates James Bond, however. Jonathan Hemi of Crystal Head Vodka says the spirit can be traced all the way back to the 15th century.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018vodka\u2019 has many different origin stories tracing back as early as 1405, and is said to be a Slavic word for water,\u201d said Hemi.\n\nLOOK: MAN DRINKS 'SOURTOE COCKTAIL' CONTAINING HIS OWN AMPUTATED TOE\n\nAs explained by Miguel Aranda, expert mixologist of Osteria 57, vodka became popular with monks and apothecaries in Eastern Europe around the 1800s. \u201cIt was used to cure illness, and was a very high-proof amount, and they used to give people a very little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nAranda added, however, that the history gets complicated when it comes to whether vodka was created in Russia or Poland.\n\n\u201cA monk from Poland went to Russia, and then from Russia, another monk perfected the recipe,\u201d said Aranda. \u201cSo both countries are really the motherland of vodka.\u201d\n\nSo how do Russia, Poland and the United States rank in vodka consumption? According to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the per capita adult consumption of vodka in Russia is 12.6 liters, versus Poland's 7.1 liters and the United States' 2.8 liters.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nWhen it comes to making vodka, Aranda says the spirit is typically made from grain or potatoes, but adds that vodka \u201ccan be made out of anything that produces sugar.\u201d\n\nJosh Gandee, the beverage director at Watershed Distillery in Columbus, Ohio, notes that his company\u2019s vodka focuses on Midwestern staples.\n\n\u201cThere are two ingredients that shine through in Watershed Distillery Vodka: corn and apples \u2014 sourced close to home in the Midwest,\u201d explained Gandee.\n\nCrystal Head Vodka\u2019s Hemi, meanwhile, says the company\u2019s original vodka uses Canadian corn while its Aurora vodka is distilled from English wheat. The founder of Empower cocktails, Tiffany Hall, opts for sweet potato vodka in her product, \"as it has a unique smoothness and pairs well with other ingredients.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nTo find out more about the history of vodka and the distillation process, watch the full video above.
