The incurable disease has spread in Asia. South Korea confirmed its seventh case on Thursday, just over a week after the virus was first detected.\n\nRising U.S. cash prices for pork confirm the recent increase in sales to China, Smith said. Hog carcass prices rose by 67 cents per cwt on Wednesday afternoon, according to USDA estimates.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the cash hogs bottom out,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing packers expand their kill schedule and there\u2019s only one reason they\u2019d do that. That\u2019s if they\u2019re feeling increased demand on their end.\u201d\n\nChina on Sunday plans to hold its third auction this month of frozen pork from its state reserves to ease domestic supply shortages from African swine fever. The meat was imported from the United States, Germany and other countries.\n\nA resolution to the bruising trade war could open the door for even more American pork exports to China. The countries\u2019 trade negotiators are expected to meet in Washington in about two weeks to determine if they can start to chart a path out of the dispute or are headed for new and higher tariffs on each others\u2019 goods.", "description": "China last week made its biggest purchase of U.S. pork in two weeks, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed on Thursday, as Beijing seeks to ease supply shortages caused by the spread of a fatal hog disease.", "authors": ["Tom Polansek", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
