Alongside partner-in-rhyme Timothy \u201cTimbaland\u201d Mosley, the Virginia Beach native has bridged gaps across genre lines, proffering a sort of creativity that gave us a glimpse of the sound of the future before it even happened. It\u2019s the type of genius that never got bigger than itself, eccentric and outrageous yet easily accessible, yielding mind-melding confections that challenged the notion of what mainstream pop music could be.\n\nSince transitioning from Fayze into the quartet Sista \u2014 whose New Jack Swing\u2013indebted 1994 debut, 4 All Da Sistas Around the World, was never officially released but is now available on streaming services \u2014 Elliott has always put one foot ahead of the rest. On her 1997 solo debut, Supa Dupa Fly, she diverged from the often stiff beats-and-rhymes template of the time for a sound that concentrated funk, soul, and late-20th century R&B into a surrealist sonic masterpiece, as weird as it was refreshingly palatable. Her obsession with all things future took firm hold on its follow-ups, 1999\u2019s Da Real World and 2001\u2019s Miss E \u2026 So Addictive, and inevitably doubled back on itself with the retro-leaning Under Construction and This Is Not a Test! It culminated in 2005\u2019s The Cookbook, an album that was a confluence of its predecessors \u2014 looking backward, moving forward, and upending the trends of the day.\n\nBeyond the individualized visions of her solo discography throughout the years, Elliott has become a songwriting and production titan, penning hits for 702, Aaliyah, and Monica, among many others. It\u2019s why earlier this year, she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame alongside Justin Timberlake and Dallas Austin. Most recently, she graced the MTV Video Music Awards\u2019 stage to accept the much-deserved Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, and delivered a career-reinforcing performance that recreated some of the iconic visuals that have elevated her catalogue. She easily eclipsed many of the younger artists who performed the same night.\n\nThough she\u2019s hinted at a new album for years \u2014 a better time than ever would have been after her spotlight-heisting appearance with Katy Perry at the 2015 Super Bowl \u2014 the 48-year-old most recently returned to form with a tight, surprise EP called ICONOLOGY, a five-track reminder of both the breadth of her talent and ability to wield it so effectively. Below we take a look back at the songs that line the path of Elliott\u2019s truly singular career, ranking her solo offerings, including album cuts, unreleased tracks, and original remixes.\n\n115. \u201cAin\u2019t That Funny,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nFuture-tech instrumentation goes awry on \u201cAin\u2019t That Funny,\u201d easily one of the least tangible tracks from Elliott\u2019s discography. Where she and Timbaland excelled was in finding the equilibrium between dark production and lighter melodies, but this ode to trifling men on the come-up missed the mark.\n\n114. \u201cJoy\u201d featuring Mike Jones, The Cookbook (2005)\n\nWho is Mike Jones? Easy to forget, but even easier to fast-forward through the opener to 2005\u2019s The Cookbook. \u201cI flow over a beat that make a chick weave blow,\u201d spits Elliott atop a breathy vocal sample that both grates on and detracts from her raps.\n\n113. \u201cDats What I\u2019m Talkin About\u201d featuring R. Kelly, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nCollaborations with R. Kelly are tainted, especially in hindsight. It adds a particularly acerbic shade to slow jam \u201cDats What I\u2019m Talkin About,\u201d on which Kelly croons blunt come-ons \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ma have you walkin\u2019 with a limp\u201d \u2014 on a track where the two vocalists didn\u2019t really connect to begin with.\n\n112. \u201cStep Off,\u201d Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nElliott plays the sidepiece on the flute-lined \u201cStep Off,\u201d confessing her love to the man whose heart she can never have. Where most of her songs feel flush with life and musically progress, \u201cStep Off\u201d plays like a first draft of an idea, never amounting to more than the four-bar template set up at the top.\n\n111. \u201cBest Best,\u201d single (2008)\n\nProducer Danja turns in a B-level take on Timbaland\u2019s clattering percussion, accenting the rumble below with Casio-type synths. The beat offers little to support the stuttering Auto-Tuned lyrics that come across as simple for such a dexterous lyricist: \u201cHe\u2019s the best, he bomb / He cute, he umm / He fly, he fresh / He give me, good sex.\u201d\n\n110. \u201cWe Did It,\u201d Da Real World (1999)\n\nUnlike \u201cStep Off,\u201d \u201cWe Did It\u201d sees Elliott rebuking the possibility of wading into side-chick territory as Timbaland drives on autopilot in a hi-hat-heavy, repetitive exercise. Though this deep album cut sounds dated, Elliott\u2019s off-beat meter keeps it somewhat suspenseful.\n\n109. \u201cHot,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nOftentimes, Elliott\u2019s limper fare can be traced back to Timbaland, who can fail to develop beat sketches with potential. Her obsession with all things heat (see also: \u201cI\u2019m Really Hot,\u201d \u201cHot Boyz\u201d) is invoked for \u201cHot,\u201d a paean to old-school hip-hop\u2019s simplistic beats-and-rhymes formula. It fits with parent album Under Construction\u2019s retro theme, but as a standalone, it\u2019s anticlimactic.\n\n108. \u201cClick Clack,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nRuling the club is nothing new for Elliott, but the swing-your-rag \u201cClick Clack\u201d feels somewhat out of character. Wheezing synthesizer booms and backing vocals lift the chorus, yet Elliott comes off as reductive of her own lyrical style: \u201c305-212-804 is my cell,\u201d she raps, number by number. \u201cY\u2019all must be dumb as hell if you think that\u2019s my cell.\u201d\n\n107. \u201cWhatcha Gon\u2019 Do\u201d featuring Timbaland, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nThe bumbling \u201cWhatcha Gon\u2019 Do\u201d arrived on Miss E \u2026 So Addictive, an album that sustained Elliott and Timbaland\u2019s future-sound streak. And it\u2019s why the track seems phoned in, with monotone flows and anxious instrumentation that belie the project\u2019s frothier zones.\n\n106. \u201cIt\u2019s Real,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nPart of what keeps Elliott from being totally reliable is the inability to keep schlock balladry to a minimum, something she did on releases prior to This Is Not a Test! It\u2019s why \u201cIt\u2019s Real\u201d comes off as a merely forgettable do-or-die pledge to a lover that plays far it too straight.\n\n105. \u201cHurt Sumthin,\u201d Honey soundtrack (2003)\n\nHoney, the 2003 film starring Jessica Alba, tried to step into the original-soundtrack bubble that inevitably burst in the years that followed. The issue with the trend was that artists often contributed leftovers, which feels like the case with \u201cHurt Sumthin,\u201d a thin, abrasive number that plays like template rap.\n\n104. \u201c9th Inning\u201d featuring Timbaland (2012)\n\nMeant to be Elliott\u2019s grand return from hiatus in 2012, \u201c9th Inning,\u201d one-half of a double A-side release with \u201cTriple Threat,\u201d lacked oomph, as well as the innovation of her more thought-out efforts. Instead of showing, she tells: \u201cThey think we done! All we do is make hits!\u201d\n\n103. \u201cX-Tasy,\u201d Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nUsing the sex-as-drug conceit, Elliott drifts along in a haze on \u201cX-Tasy\u201d \u2014 far from the twinkling euphoria of her turn on Ja Rule\u2019s \u201cX,\u201d released a few years prior. Recreational use can have its time and place, so long as its soundtrack isn\u2019t as flat as this floater with a chorus (care of her mentee, Tweet) that gets far more shine than the verses.\n\n102. \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel\u201d featuring Monica and Beenie Man, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of disjointment to \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel,\u201d and Monica and Elliott feel as though they\u2019re on an entirely different song than Beenie Man (the beat change halfway through doesn\u2019t help). At that, it does little to hook you in, with soft-boiled, distracting instrumental choices.\n\n101. \u201cIs This Our Last Time\u201d featuring Fabolous, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nElliott bends to musical conventions of the time on \u201cIs This Our Last Time,\u201d off 2003\u2019s This Is Not a Test! It makes sense that Fabolous, then in his mainstream prime, would be asked to contribute a verse to this lecherous tale of losing the flavor after the first night.\n\n100. \u201cTeary Eyed,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nLike with \u201cIt\u2019s Real,\u201d torch balladry was the Achilles\u2019 heel of The Cookbook, a surprising misstep for a token innovator. \u201cTeary Eyed,\u201d one of the singles from the set, falls into the same trap, albeit at a quicker pace, slotting this below her craftier conceptions.\n\n99. \u201cScream a.k.a. Itchin\u2019,\u201d Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nHollering on a track is an art. At its worst, it can pierce through the heart of an otherwise notable song, like on \u201cScream a.k.a. Itchin\u2019,\u201d where Timbaland confects a pattering assortment of stabbing synths and off-rhythm drums while Elliott\u2019s squelch takes her weirdness to a whole new level.\n\n98. \u201cNothing Out There For Me\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, Under Construction (2002)\n\nElliott and Beyonce\u2019s collaborative back-and-forth ambles along as a telephone conversation between the former, who attempts to coax the latter out of the house and spend a night at the club. Meanwhile, Bey passionately decries the peer-pressuring in favor of staying home with her man. The song\u2019s stagnancy makes it hard to sustain interest, but it\u2019s worth a spin for the fact that Bey rebukes Elliott by stating, \u201cGirl, I do not get high.\u201d (Sure.)\n\n97. \u201cMeltdown,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nDipping out on a relationship to get with another man who \u201cgot that magic stick to make my little pussy quiver\u201d is the driving point of \u201cMeltdown,\u201d set to an \u201980s-lite loop with little variation. At its surface, \u201cMeltdown\u201d is breezy and enjoyable, but like the aforementioned tracks, it doesn\u2019t do much to stand out.\n\n96. \u201cToyz Interlude/Toyz,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nElliott\u2019s ownership over her sexuality has consistently been expressed in smirk-worthy ways, like with \u201cPussycat\u201d or \u201cWork It.\u201d Perhaps the most overt articulation was with \u201cToyz Interlude/Toyz,\u201d extolling the pleasure derived from sex toys and encouraging all women to get one.\n\n95. \u201cBig Spender,\u201d Southern Hummingbird bonus track (2002)\n\n\u201cBig Spender,\u201d popularized by Shirley Bassey in 1967, went on to become a frequent staple in hip-hop (Freeway\u2019s \u201cBig Spender,\u201d Raekwon\u2019s \u201cBig Spender\u201d). It found its way to Elliott, who did a 6/8 time-signature version as a bonus track on Tweet\u2019s sorely underrated 2002 debut, Southern Hummingbird. It\u2019s typical braggadocio, but it\u2019s refreshing to hear Elliott ride a beat in a different rhythm.\n\n94. \u201cDon\u2019t Be Commin\u2019 (In My Face),\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nElliott and Timbaland are experts in matching toplines with percussive tones, but \u201cDon\u2019t Be Commin\u2019 (In My Face)\u201d off Supa Dupa Fly doesn\u2019t exactly align. Repeated thwacks of a pipe and clomping bass notes contrast Elliott\u2019s singing about a man trying to get back with her.\n\n93. \u201cPump It Up\u201d featuring Nelly, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that even at his most innovative, Timbaland can supply beats that somehow come across as mundane. It happened with \u201cPump It Up,\u201d a club scorcher littered with a rocking bass drum, hooting whistles, and a cringeworthy line from Nelly about his \u201cGo-Go-Gadget dick.\u201d\n\n92. \u201cShake Your Pom Pom,\u201d Step Up 2: The Streets soundtrack (2008)\n\nOne of two songs Elliott cooked up for 2008\u2019s Step Up 2: The Streets soundtrack (the other being \u201cChing-a-Ling\u201d), \u201cShake Your Pom Pom\u201d encourages booty-clapping as Timbaland sets off what sounds like drum sticks going wild in a boiler room.\n\n91. \u201cMommy,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nElliott redefines the term \u201cmommy\u201d as \u201cthe boss, the money-maker, the man-taker, the provider, the low-car rider\u201d at the onset of \u201cMommy,\u201d an amelodic, industrial shoutout to all the ladies handling their business.\n\n90. \u201cI\u2019m Better (Remix)\u201d featuring Eve, Lil\u2019 Kim and Trina\n\nCorralling longtime friends for the remix to \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d could have been a momentous event, but it fell short. All four rappers have distinctive deliveries, yet they feel shuffled together as they adopt the same stunted trap flow as Elliott on the original.\n\n89. \u201cWho You Gonna Call,\u201d Any Given Sunday soundtrack (2000)\n\nIncluded on the Any Given Sunday soundtrack in early 2000, \u201cWho You Gonna Call\u201d didn\u2019t age well. Unlike the boundary-snapping integrity of Da Real World, released the year prior, the song, co-produced by Elliott, Bink and Tony McAnany, relies on tired keyboard synthesizers and what sounds like a stock choral accompaniment.\n\n88. \u201cIt\u2019s a Woman\u2019s World,\u201d Reebok single (2001)\n\nA promo single for Reebok that most likely wasn\u2019t intended for commercial release, \u201cIt\u2019s a Woman\u2019s World\u201d was Elliott\u2019s reply to James Brown\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Man\u2019s World,\u201d and was included in a 2001 campaign for the brand. It\u2019s unclear if Timbaland handled the production \u2014 the synths don\u2019t line up with his previous sound banks \u2014 but the mid-tempo take accomplishes what it set out to do.\n\n87. \u201cAll N My Grill (Remix)\u201d featuring MC Solaar and Nicole Wray\n\nThe initial version of \u201cAll N My Grill,\u201d featuring Big Boi, had all the makings of a hip-hop classic \u2014 which is why it felt unnecessary to replace him with the French MC Solaar. Experimenting with cross-cultural collaborations was a bold move for Elliott, but listen closely and you\u2019ll hear the shoddy cut-and-paste job laying in Solaar\u2019s verse.\n\n86. \u201cTime and Time Again,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nA turn-down ballad with Tweet, \u201cTime and Time Again\u201d was all finger snaps and glib keys, shipping off a trifling lover who keeps coming back despite her rebuffs. Elliott slips into a rap verse at one point, only to catch herself: \u201cLet me stop playin\u2019 with y\u2019all mothafuckas, this ain\u2019t no rap record, get back to the hook.\u201d\n\n85. \u201cI\u2019m Not Perfect\u201d featuring The Clark Sisters, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nUnlike the requisite gospel songs that closed prior albums, \u201cI\u2019m Not Perfect\u201d serves more as an inspirational uplifter on This Is Not a Test!, pairing Elliott with The Clark Sisters for a gauzy Sunday morning testimonial.\n\n84. \u201cFriendly Skies\u201d featuring Ginuwine, Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nWhen Elliott is bent on soundtracking the party, the far corners of her personality truly bubble to the top. It\u2019s the slow jams where she shows a more sensitive side, like on \u201cFriendly Skies,\u201d an extended metaphor about being the passenger on the flight of a relationship, and persevering through the turbulence.\n\n83. \u201cPass Da Blunt,\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nExperimenting with reggae touchstones has been a constant in Elliott\u2019s career since the release of her solo debut Supa Dupa Fly, specifically on \u201cPass Da Blunt,\u201d a woozy nod to the Musical Youth\u2019s 1983 classic, \u201cPass the Dutchie.\u201d\n\n82. \u201cHigher Ground\u201d featuring Karen Clark Sheard, Yolanda Adams, Kim Burrell, Dorinda Clark Cole, Mary Mary and Tweet, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nElliott traditionally caps her albums with an ode to the almighty, and for \u201cHigher Ground,\u201d the hidden track on Miss E \u2026 So Addictive, she takes it to church with a robust lineup of some of gospel\u2019s finest. Each has a turn to outdo the other, making for a grand vocal spectacular.\n\n81. \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d featuring Lamb\n\nIn 2017, Elliott reemerged with what could have been a triumphant single, but it didn\u2019t feel entirely natural to her style. Flush with sirens and tip-toeing synths, \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d loses its footing with its trap-inspired meter \u2014 more Migos than Missy.\n\n80. \u201cViolator Run This,\u201d unreleased Violator: The Album, V2.0 track (2001)\n\nAt one point signed to Violator management, which counted 50 Cent and Diddy on its roster, Elliott cut this record for the second compilation the company released. For whatever reason, it didn\u2019t make the final cut, though it easily could have with its throwback beat and club-ready chorus.\n\n79. \u201cRemember When,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nOn this flushed, mid-tempo ballad, Elliott sings an R&B ode to a lover who, after discovering she cheated on him, forgave her anyway because his feelings for her are so strong. Its simplicity is its selling point \u2014 she knows when to go big, but also when to dial it back.\n\n78. \u201cChing-a-Ling,\u201d Step Up 2: the Streets soundtrack (2008)\n\nThere was something repetitive about \u201cChing-a-Ling\u201d that closely followed the blueprints Elliott had set before it: the reversed vocal lines, the whistles, the incessantly chanted chorus. It felt almost too familiar, and yet, still welcome as one of the liveliest of her post-Cookbook cuts.\n\n77. \u201cDrop the Bomb,\u201d Under Construction bonus track ( 2002)\n\nA bonus track on the Japanese edition of Under Construction, \u201cDrop the Bomb\u201d easily carries the same sonic heft as the rest of the set. Using synths relative to those that snake across the beat on \u201cWork It,\u201d \u201cBomb\u201d is a call to arms to everyone from Louisville to Las Vegas to get down.\n\n76. \u201cSmooth Chick,\u201d Da Real World (1999)\n\nReed instruments were rarely at the forefront in hip-hop at the time that Da Real World was released, and while they don\u2019t do much more than repeat on \u201cSmooth Chick,\u201d Elliott and Timbaland flipped a sax for the ages. The aerobic dance-stirrer pushed the tempo past the three-digit mark, something far too fast for anyone to dance to but enough to scan as notable on the track list.\n\n75. \u201cSwat Dat Fly,\u201d unreleased (2010)\n\nWeird for the sake of weird has always been Elliott\u2019s M.O. \u201cSwat Dat Fly\u201d is no exception: A bee literally zooms around the track as electro-synths gurgle beneath instructions to do as the title of the song suggests.\n\n74. \u201cGet Ur Freak On (Remix)\u201d featuring Nelly Furtado, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider soundtrack (2001)\n\nAt the time \u201cGet Ur Freak On\u201d was released, Nelly Furtado was percolating in the pop world thanks to her breakthrough hit \u201cI\u2019m Like a Bird\u201d and the hip-hop-kissed umbrella album Whoa, Nelly! Timbaland latched onto her sound \u2014 he remixed her follow-up hit \u201cTurn Off the Light\u201d and threw Ms. Jade into the mix \u2014 which makes sense that Furtado would show for the second take on \u201cFreak.\u201d Furtado, with a similar penchant for stretching out vowels and embracing gibberish, does the same with Elliott here, at times shrill but still compelling.\n\n73. \u201cOld School Joint,\u201d Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nInvoking the funk of One Way\u2019s \u201cPop It,\u201d Elliott takes it back to the \u201980s on \u201cOld School Joint,\u201d a song strictly for the dance floor. Simultaneously fresh and classically nostalgic, the feel-good fete of decades past bumps, halts, and grinds.\n\n72. \u201cTriple Threat,\u201d single (2012)\n\nSweeping strings introduce \u201cTriple Threat,\u201d the other A-side to 2012\u2019s \u201c9th Inning.\u201d Elliott isn\u2019t heard until a minute into the track, and aside from her palpable verses, Timbaland holds court for the majority, circling the hook, \u201cMissy and I going up, triple leader in our cup.\u201d\n\n71. \u201cU Can\u2019t Resist\u201d featuring Juvenile and B.G., Da Real World (1999)\n\nWhen she isn\u2019t giving in to her quirkier predilections, Elliott can spit a mean traditional 16, outshining her peers along the way. That\u2019s \u201cU Can\u2019t Resist,\u201d a later-album inclusion on Da Real World touting two Elliott verses that eclipse her guest features atop menacing instrumentation.\n\n70. \u201cBaby Girl Interlude/Intro\u201d featuring Mary J. Blige // \u201cOutro\u201d featuring Mary J. Blige, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nElliott bookends This Is Not a Test! with two crisp piano-kissed vignettes. The first is marked by a single but impactful verse about her imperfections while paying homage to those who are no longer with us, while the second plays as a defense of hip-hop culture: \u201cHip-hop is a freedom of expression / Not a freedom of depression,\u201d she says.\n\n69. \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know\u201d featuring Lil\u2019 Mo, Da Real World (1999)\n\n\u201cYou Don\u2019t Know\u201d marks one of two songs in Elliott\u2019s oeuvre where the track is framed as a phone call. The other, \u201cNothing Out There for Me,\u201d which appears higher on this list, was less concerned with fireworks than \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know,\u201d a raw-tongued spar between Elliott and Lil\u2019 Mo who learn they\u2019re sharing the same man. Things get heated \u2014 the beat flips, and Elliott turns to tough mode: \u201cYou be suckin\u2019 his dick, tastin\u2019 my clit, just a side chick, on the side bitch, I\u2019m the prize bitch.\u201d\n\n68. \u201cCrazy Feelings\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, Da Real World (1999)\n\nMarching slow-mover \u201cCrazy Feelings\u201d is framed around romantic hindsight, lifted up by hair-raising harmonies from two gifted singers. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s soprano glides over Elliott\u2019s stacked vocals, bringing a gospel element to the midnight-storm ballad.\n\n67. \u201cPartytime,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nElliott wastes no time setting the tone for The Cookbook with \u201cPartytime,\u201d washing away the bitter aftertaste of opening track \u201cJoy.\u201d The tinkering percussion is no match for her lyrical display, delivered with the sarcastic lilt of Slick Rick and impressive meter.\n\n66. \u201cPlay That Beat,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nThe old-school homage continued on Under Construction with \u201cPlay That Beat,\u201d which samples the vocals and adapts and slows the drum pattern from G.L.O.B.E. & Whiz Kid\u2019s 1983 track \u201cPlay That Beat Mr. D.J.\u201d It lacks the urgency of its source material but digs it up from the crates for a lively interpolation.\n\n65. \u201cSlap! Slap! Slap!\u201d featuring Da Brat and Ms. Jade, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nBad-girl posturing came naturally to Elliott, but always felt more emboldened when part of a triumvirate. (See also: \u201cStickin\u2019 Chickens.\u201d) \u201cSlap! Slap! Slap!\u201d had its fangs bared, and each rapper served up some spice: Brat snarled, \u201cWhen they see me, I permanently damage they shit internally\u201d; Jade spit, \u201cSmack the shit out of Clyde \u2019cause Bonnie should\u2019ve paid me\u201d; and, best of all, Missy went, \u201cTurn your man to an ass-licker.\u201d Way ahead of her time.\n\n64. \u201cLet Me Fix My Weave,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nElliott\u2019s ability to alter her accent and delivery at any given turn speaks to her versatility. \u201cLet Me Fix My Weave\u201d may be crass at times, but what makes it so commendable is how each bar is delivered in its own unique way.\n\n63. \u201cWork It (Remix)\u201d featuring 50 Cent, Under Construction (2002)\n\nElliott had a tendency to throw rappers-du-jour on her hits, possibly as a way of fleshing out the single\u2019s sphere of reach, which is why the addition of 50 Cent on \u201cWork It\u201d always felt ham-handed. Red-hot at the time, Fif swoops in with a verse that could never top the calamitous theatrics that Elliott brought to the original. It\u2019s fine that it exists, but it didn\u2019t necessarily need to.\n\n62. \u201cCool Off,\u201d Iconology (2019)\n\nAfter all these years, Elliott is still a dance-floor commander. \u201cCool Off,\u201d which borrows the thrum of 808s driving her newest EP\u2019s single, \u201cThrow It Back,\u201d is sweat-breaking mayhem, a booty-bouncer that spins round and round \u201clike a ceiling fan.\u201d\n\n61. \u201cIzzy Izzy Ahh,\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nThe sound of \u201cIzzy Izzy Ahh\u201d is an extension of Elliott\u2019s growth out of the New Jack Swing era, when Timbaland ghost-produced songs for Jodeci\u2019s DeVante Swing while Elliott was in Sista. \u201cIzzy\u201d has an early \u201990s sound \u2014 the beat\u2019s sway is a reflection of what came before it \u2014 and offers a window into the lyrical gymnastics of projects to follow.\n\n60. \u201cSlide,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nOne of the more dizzying, loop-based burners on Under Construction, \u201cSlide\u201d sees Timbaland drawing from Middle Eastern strings for a dance-floor instructional. \u201cSlide, slide, dip, dip, shake / Move it all around, move it all around,\u201d raps Elliott, who drops a laughable hi-hater: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to sound too petty, but they used to call me Fatty until I got with Puff Daddy.\u201d\n\n59. \u201cThe Right One For You,\u201d The Cookbook bonus track (2005)\n\nA rarity in Elliott\u2019s discography, \u201cThe Right One For You\u201d was originally included as a Target bonus track on The Cookbook. It\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t make the regular retail release; it flows in the same R&B vein as \u201cTeary Eyed\u201d with a far more pleasant aesthetic.\n\n58. \u201cWe Run This,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nThe Sugarhill Gang\u2019s \u201cApache,\u201d which became one of the most effervescent hip-hop songs of all time after they mined a break from Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s song of the same name, makes a reappearance on \u201cWe Run This,\u201d Elliott\u2019s single that continues the tradition. Hers is just as upbeat and chaotic \u2014 the reintroduction of a classic to the next generation.\n\n57. \u201cIrresistible Delicious\u201d featuring Slick Rick, The Cookbook (2005)\n\nSlick Rick\u2019s slippery flow has unquestionably played a heavy influence on Elliott\u2019s delivery \u2014 check \u201cJoy,\u201d the opening track on The Cookbook, the parent album that also features their duet, \u201cIrresistible Delicious.\u201d A callback to Ricky D\u2019s \u201cLick the Balls,\u201d the \u201980s big-up is all rhymes and chorus, the latter of which cuts to a tranquil slice of R&B.\n\n56. \u201cKeep It Movin\u2019\u201d featuring Elephant Man, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nElephant Man steps into Missy\u2019s world for \u201cKeep It Movin\u2019,\u201d a cut off The Cookbook with vamping chord stabs, airy snare taps, and just a touch of sitar. Elliott commands listeners to \u201cwine ya waistline down to the bassline,\u201d warming up the pot for the dancehall star to step in and polish it off.\n\n55. \u201cTouch My Body,\u201d unreleased (2009)\n\nWith the alternate title \u201cAct a Fool,\u201d \u201cTouch My Body\u201d is an unreleased loosie that hit the internet around 2009. It gallops with the urgency of \u201cPass That Dutch\u201d without so much as breaking a sweat, all while Elliott plays the club ringleader.\n\n54. \u201cMy Struggles\u201d featuring Mary J. Blige and Grand Puba, The Cookbook (2005)\n\nLeave it to Elliott to put Grand Puba back on the same track as Mary J. Blige, and then coax out her lyrical side. This rap-attack over a twanging guitar melody jacked from Smokey Robinson & the Miracles\u2019 \u201cYou\u2019ve Got the Love I Need\u201d is a classic posse cut, in theme with The Cookbook\u2019s throwback lean.\n\n53. \u201cStickin\u2019 Chickens\u201d featuring Aaliyah and Da Brat, Da Real World (1999)\n\nPutting a two-timer on blast is a constant theme in Elliott\u2019s discography, and the trio of her, Aaliyah, and Da Brat made \u201cStickin\u2019 Chickens\u201d all the more attacking. Harmonies abound as Elliott and Aaliyah take turns bemoaning the wrongdoer, culminating in a double-time shakedown from Da Brat.\n\n52. \u201cGo to the Floor,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nA standard Timbaland beat of bee synths and quick-hit bongos introduces Under Construction, an album of out-there tracks as left-field as opening cut \u201cGo to the Floor.\u201d The LP was all about celebrating hip-hop\u2019s past and having a blast in the present, duly noted on this dance floor commander.\n\n51. \u201c4 My People\u201d featuring Eve, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nAn international hit, \u201c4 My People\u201d was as close to EDM as Elliott has gotten in her career thanks to the dance remixes that took hold overseas. (Discounting, of course, her remix of Jack \u00dc\u2019s \u201cTake U There\u201d with Kiesza.)\n\n50. \u201c4 My Man\u201d featuring Fantasia, The Cookbook (2005)\n\nDulcet plucks on a harp and a thwacking backbeat ground \u201c4 My Man,\u201d a traditional, blissful love song of allegiance to a significant other. Elliott exudes confidence in her relationship through peacocked rhymes, giving way for a full-bodied chorus from the American Idol alum.\n\n49. \u201cMr. D.J.\u201d featuring Lady Saw, Da Real World (1999)\n\nElliott\u2019s use of digitized computer voices on the reggae-tinged \u201cMr. D.J.\u201d helped further Da Real World\u2019s tomorrowland theme. Twangy instrumentation plays the background to Elliott\u2019s boasts of sipping Alize in the club, turning it over to Lady Saw to provide some island flavor to the bizarro club cut.\n\n48. \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d featuring TLC, Under Construction (2002)\n\nOne of Elliott\u2019s several homages to the late Aaliyah, \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d was a somber elegy with the surviving members of TLC, who joined her to pay respects to Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes. The forthright tribute came off as both vulnerable and uplifting, all at once.\n\n47. \u201cOne Minute Man (Remix)\u201d featuring Jay Z, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nOne of three remixes of Elliott\u2019s track, this version rotated Ludacris for Jay Z, who drops a shrewd, self-referential verse that hat-tips lyrics from his single \u201cDo It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)\u201d and makes a comical nod to Destiny\u2019s Child: \u201cI\u2019m tryna give you cab fare and directions / Get your independent ass outta here, question?\u201d\n\n46. \u201cBest Friends\u201d featuring Aaliyah, Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nFew Aaliyah collaborations made it to Elliott full-lengths prior to her passing, which is why hearing the two trade fluttering vocals on \u201cBest Friends\u201d is so heartwarming. Each sings of getting good advice from a companion about a disrespectful man; the chemistry between the two is undeniable.\n\n45. \u201cRather,\u201d unreleased\n\nRumored to be intended for Block Party, the long-awaited follow up to The Cookbook, \u201cRather\u201d is yet another shimmering example of Elliott\u2019s prowess as an R&B singer-songwriter. The gentle ballad is tantamount to her work on Tweet\u2019s Southern Hummingbird: starched fingersnaps, warm harmonies, and strums on an acoustic guitar.\n\n44. \u201cPep Rally\u201d (2016)\n\nElliott chased the release of \u201cWTF (Where I\u2019m From)\u201d with the wobbling \u201cPep Rally\u201d in 2016, a drumline knocker released via an Amazon Echo commercial. It\u2019s more in line with the late-era, party-starting fare of her catalogue, with bits of Bounce thrown in for good measure.\n\n43. \u201cThrow It Back,\u201d Iconology (2019)\n\nOff the recent Iconology EP, \u201cThrow It Back\u201d doesn\u2019t overcomplicate itself, a remarkably restrained comeback single by Elliott\u2019s standards. It\u2019s a sparse, thinly instrumented reinforcement of what the world has come to love about her: big boasts, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reminders (\u201cI did records for Tweet, before y\u2019all could even tweet\u201d), and flecks of her patented brand of weirdness.\n\n42. \u201cBad Man\u201d featuring Vybez Cartel and M.I.A., The Cookbook (2005)\n\nTeeming with fervent energy, \u201cBad Man\u201d is a dip into dancehall with palpitating results. Elliott spits her verses in patois, freeing up space on the track for the drums to get some before Cartel and M.I.A. slide through.\n\n41. \u201cOn & On,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\n\u201cOn & On\u201d served as the wonky buzz single for her last album, The Cookbook. Pharrell Williams constructs a beat with booming bass notes and zippy bubble synths, topped by high-level boasts.\n\n40. \u201cGettaway\u201d featuring Space and Nicole, Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nTimbaland refined his beatboxing skills throughout his career, and this stood as one of the first tracks where it took firm hold on an Elliott solo release. \u201cGettaway,\u201d featuring an out-the-gate verse from Space (who?), adapts the chorus from Mary J. Blige\u2019s \u201cLove No Limit\u201d and interpolates Aaliyah\u2019s \u201cOne in a Million,\u201d yet still plays like the soundtrack to a 22nd-century dungeon.\n\n39. \u201cOne Minute Man\u201d featuring Ludacris, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nThe three versions of \u201cOne Minute Man\u201d are all dynamite, but in the case of the album version featuring Ludacris versus the remix featuring Trina, the remix offers a more rounded-out perspective in the battle of the sexes. It\u2019s hard to argue that without her, it has the same spark.\n\n38. \u201cWhy I Still Love You,\u201d Iconology (2019)\n\nElliott is an R&B singer through and through, which is why \u201cWhy I Still Love You\u201d is such a satisfying conclusion to her Iconology EP (an a cappella tacked on as an extra track just goes to show how forceful a vocalist she remains). It\u2019s a brassy doo-wop number where, amid a stack of lush harmonies, Elliott rebukes a love interest in the face of how powerless she is to the attraction.\n\n37. \u201cBring the Pain\u201d featuring Method Man, Under Construction (2002)\n\nTimbaland dove straight into the old-school theme of Under Construction with \u201cBring the Pain,\u201d the first full-length track on the album, where he flips RZA\u2019s beat from Method Man\u2019s quick-tongued 1994 single of the same name. Elliott ushers his hit into her world, repurposing lyrics from the source material for a satisfying redo.\n\n36. \u201cSpelling Bee Interlude/Spelling Bee,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nNervous synths zip across octaves on the alphabetically-inclined \u201cSpelling Bee Interlude/Spelling Bee,\u201d an approach that numerous artists have taken (Lil\u2019 Kim\u2019s \u201cSpell Check,\u201d XTC\u2019s \u201cYour Dictionary\u201d) but Elliott made her own, her flow relaxed yet unpredictable.\n\n35. \u201c\u2026 So Addictive (Intro)\u201d featuring Tweet, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nArguably her greatest album intro, \u201cSo Addictive\u201d is a supple ballad, one that welcomes the listener into Miss E \u2026 So Addictive with ease. \u201cI know some of y\u2019all sick of songs that you heard on the radio (oh) / So me and Timbaland gon\u2019 give you shit you never heard (shit you never heard before),\u201d she sings in a trade-off with Tweet, a rare brief tune that begged for an extended version.\n\n34. \u201cDangerous Mouths\u201d featuring Redman, Da Real World (1999)\n\nElliott has a proclivity to lean X-rated, like on \u201cDangerous Mouths,\u201d a moody, pouncing duet with Redman on Da Real World. \u201cLet me intervene, come between like dick through your jeans, hang down to your knees,\u201d she raps, the minor-key bass line slithering below.\n\n33. \u201cPut It On Ya\u201d featuring Teyana Taylor and Pharrell, unreleased (2008)\n\nWhere she flipped it and reversed it on \u201cWork It,\u201d this unreleased track with Teyana Taylor and Pharrell guns for obscurer areas of gibberish: Pig Latin. The Neptunes supply a rapid-fire beat that toggles between an EDM-inspired attack to gushy R&B, making for one of her better 2008-era works.\n\n32. \u201cThey Don\u2019t Wanna Fuck wit Me,\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nMuch of Elliott\u2019s debut was spent justifying her own credibility as an artist. That codependency took form in numerous songs on the album, like on \u201cThey Don\u2019t Wanna Fuck wit Me,\u201d where Elliott stretched words and stuttered lyrics about her swagger.\n\n31. \u201cWTF (Where They From)\u201d (2016)\n\n\u201cWTF (Where They From)\u201d compounds all of Elliott\u2019s strong suits: lyrics that easily toy with meter, corkscrew percussion, and coded taunts that, upon release, had the internet typing in caps lock. After 2012\u2019s so-so \u201cTriple Threat\u201d and \u201c9th Inning,\u201d this felt more like a grand return.\n\n30. \u201cDripDemeanor\u201d featuring Sum1, Iconology (2019)\n\nElliott dips her quill back into the sensual well for \u201cDripDemeanor,\u201d an Iconology ballad featuring newcomer Sum1 who fills the requisite role of butter-toned hook slinger. It\u2019s arguably the best of her latest material, a coy hand-reveal for any man attempting to woo her and a catalogue of the rewards he\u2019ll receive.\n\n29. \u201cTake Away\u201d featuring Ginuwine and Kameelah, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nA precursor companion piece to \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d featuring TLC, \u201cTake Away\u201d came shortly after the untimely death of Aaliyah, who passed in a plane crash in 2001. On its own, the lush, heartfelt ballad screens as an unrequited love song, but the video tribute in which Kameelah was replaced with Tweet made it a touching homage to the late singer.\n\n28. \u201cI\u2019m Talkin\u2019,\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nTough talk comes easily to Elliott, who has the catalog to back it up. At the time when she dropped Supa Dupa Fly, though, her solo output was thin, which is why the shots-firing \u201cI\u2019m Talkin\u2019\u201d stood out. Over a guitar-plucked Timbo beat, she spits barbed takedowns on the verses (\u201cYou would think there\u2019s fuckin\u2019 ten of me when I\u2019m sendin\u2019 these blows\u201d) and, on the chorus, sweetly sings, \u201cI\u2019m such, such, such a good rapper.\u201d\n\n27. \u201cWhy You Hurt Me,\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nA lesson in trifling friendship, \u201cWhy You Hurt Me\u201d is a cautionary tale in trusting the wrong people, filtered through the lens of a character named Cutie Tootie. Her storytelling skills on display, Elliott raps of a \u201cnasty friend\u201d who \u201cturned tricks to get some Gucci\u201d and gave \u201cfreebies underneath the staircase in Brooklyn.\u201d\n\n26. \u201cBack in the Day\u201d featuring Jay Z, Under Construction (2002)\n\nUnder Construction was intended as an homage to hip-hop\u2019s past, and \u201cBack in the Day\u201d took the literal and best approach to it. A feel-good block-party banger, the low-end-heavy track is bright and snappy, replete with cultural references to Kango hats, British Knights, and MC Lyte.\n\n25. \u201cCan\u2019t Stop,\u201d The Cookbook (2005)\n\nAt his peak, Rich Harrison was an unstoppable percussive force, lacing artists like Amerie and Beyonc\u00e9 with breathless, stars-shooting instrumentation for some of their greatest hits. His collaboration with Elliott on \u201cCan\u2019t Stop,\u201d tucked near the center of The Cookbook, was more flash than flesh: the rapper rides the beat with expert ease, but it\u2019s Harrison\u2019s clanging cowbells and riotous snares that push this into the green.\n\n24. \u201cFunky Fresh Dressed\u201d featuring Ms. Jade, Under Construction (2002)\n\nBar for bar, Elliott spits lines that somersault atop the next on \u201cFunky Fresh Dressed,\u201d a classic rebuking of bum emcees in exchange for self-inflation. There\u2019s an old-school flavor to the track, one that takes a literal turn when the beat turns into that of Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cPaul Revere\u201d during Ms. Jade\u2019s verse.\n\n23. \u201cDog in Heat\u201d featuring Redman and Method Man, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nBarring album intros, the first track on each of Elliott\u2019s albums establish the tone for the records, like with the bopping \u201cDog in Heat,\u201d featuring Redman and Method Man. A neck-cracking groove, it\u2019s the token scene-setter, all flickering bass notes and cherry-sweet synths that cozy up to gut-busting guest verses from the rap duo.\n\n22. \u201cBeat Biters,\u201d Da Real World (1999)\n\nSame goes for \u201cBeat Biters,\u201d the first full-length track from Da Real World. Elliott and Timbaland slid into the year 3000 on the project, a glimpse into what they interpreted as hip-hop\u2019s progressive future. \u201cBeat Biters\u201d drove their sound to a darker, more experimental zone, one that reverberated as the album progressed.\n\n21. \u201cHot Boyz,\u201d Da Real World (1999)\n\nAs a solo track \u2014 removed from its remix featuring Nas, Eve, and Q-Tip \u2014 \u201cHot Boyz\u201d stands strong, maintaining the momentum with Lil\u2019 Mo, who peppers the chorus with candy-sweet falsetto runs. Elliott hit the nail with this individual version, but it\u2019s a standard case of the remix outshining the original.\n\n20. \u201cHit Em Wit Da Hee (Remix)\u201d featuring Lil\u2019 Kim and Mocha, Can\u2019t Hardly Wait soundtrack (1998)\n\nThroughout her career, Elliott often didn\u2019t tamper with original versions of her tracks when it came to remixes, instead tacking on a guest verse, sometimes to little effect. The remix for \u201cHit Em Wit Da Hee\u201d is a rare exception, executed well. This haunting retake, featured on the soundtrack for 1998\u2019s Can\u2019t Hardly Wait, transitions midway through with a chilling sample from Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s \u201cJoga\u201d and a freshly recorded addendum.\n\n19. \u201cLet It Bump,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nTimbaland\u2019s abilities to shellac the rhythmic sound of someone beating on a lunchroom table and use a siren as an accent are just some of the glimpses of his genius. And that\u2019s just the instrumentative side of \u201cLet It Bump,\u201d a barebones pairing of nostalgic rhymes (\u201cRemember when Shant\u00e9 was live on stage?\u201d asks Elliott) and a knocking throwback beat.\n\n18. \u201cBusa Rhyme\u201d featuring Eminem, Da Real World (1999)\n\nElliott has always had a penchant for nosing talent at the start (see: Tweet, Nicole Wray, Lil\u2019 Mo). Eminem was just starting to terrorize the hip-hop game when she tapped him for \u201cBusa Rhyme\u201d (initially a demo recorded by Em called \u201cTylenol Island\u201d), giving him the first two verses before hopping in for a back-and-forth. Slim Shady is in full force on \u201cBusa Rhyme,\u201d which transitions into a brooding paranoia hellscape in which he details killing a hospital staff and Elliott lines up sucker emcees for execution.\n\n17. \u201cPussycat,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nWhen she lets her freak flag fly, Elliott often produces her cleverest work. Such is the case with \u201cPussycat,\u201d an extended metaphor that personifies her downtown area; she prays it will satisfy her man to the point that he would never cheat. A filthy concept this catchy gets gold stars.\n\n16. \u201cWake Up\u201d featuring Jay Z, This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nThis call to arms was intended as a state of the union for hip-hop, one where Elliott and Jay Z took turns spitting over dank percussion of clanks against metal and underwater bleeps. It\u2019s hip-hop in its best form: whip-smart couplets, compelling instrumentation, and legitimate demands for change.\n\n15. \u201cRagtime Interlude/I\u2019m Really Hot,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nTangential to \u201cLose Control,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Really Hot\u201d is an unstoppable destructive force on the dance floor. Timbaland\u2019s programming is at warp level, with pattering percussion across drum heads, yielding a crowd-pleaser that Elliott carries at a galloping pace.\n\n14. \u201cAll n My Grill\u201d featuring Big Boi and Nicole Wray, Da Real World (1999)\n\nCheesy synth strings strut up a few octaves on \u201cAll n My Grill,\u201d giving a symphonic element to Elliott\u2019s call to men who can provide more than just conversation. Outkast\u2019s Big Boi joins in for an overstuffed verse echoing the sentiment: \u201cYou be tryin\u2019 to kill my ho, my girlfriend / And people around me is tellin\u2019 me that you\u2019s a stalker, like Darth Vader chasin\u2019 Skywalker, I told you I was a street talker.\u201d\n\n13. \u201cOne Minute Man (Remix)\u201d featuring Ludacris and Trina, Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nElliott and Ludacris had a standalone version that was fiery on its own, but it\u2019s the appearance of Trina that bumps this up the list. The Diamond Princess takes Elliott\u2019s softer innuendo and kicks it up to full throttle: \u201cYou know lil\u2019 mama ain\u2019t with that quick shit / You better break me off, stiff tongue or stiff dick.\u201d\n\n12. \u201cLick Shots,\u201d Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nTimbaland\u2019s taste for sweet-and-sinister led to \u201cLick Shots,\u201d one of the greasiest productions in his portfolio. It was the addendum to the video for \u201cGet Ur Freak On,\u201d portraying Elliot cruising in a low-rider \u2014 a suitable location for this grimacing, itchy trigger-finger taunt.\n\n11. \u201cGossip Folks\u201d featuring Ludacris, Under Construction (2002)\n\nThe retro \u201cGossip Folks\u201d coasted on off-measure downbeats, bleating reed instruments, and an upper-register snarl from Elliott, who sustains the tone for most of the track. Timbaland crept in a sample from Frankie Smith\u2019s \u201cDouble Dutch Bus\u201d for the chorus, echoing the disorienting reversed hook on \u201cWork It.\u201d\n\n10. \u201cSock It 2 Me\u201d featuring Da Brat, Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nThe orchestral overtone of \u201cSock It 2 Me\u201d made it stand out from the rest of Supa Dupa Fly. Timbaland didn\u2019t go overboard with samples on the project, which created a thread through the latter half of the LP where his sound was accentuated. But with \u201cSock It 2 Me,\u201d he isolated the horns from The Delfonics\u2019 \u201cReady or Not Here I Come (Can\u2019t Hide From Love)\u201d to great effect: Elliott laces this bopper with a melody line that completely warms to it \u2014 a middle ground they seldom didn\u2019t find \u2014 giving Da Brat a layup for one of her best guest verses.\n\n9. \u201cHit Em Wit Da Hee\u201d featuring Lil\u2019 Kim, Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nOpening her career-defining debut Supa Dupa Fly with a spoken-word intro from Busta Rhymes, Elliott isn\u2019t the first voice you hear on a full-length track on the project \u2014 rather, it\u2019s Lil\u2019 Kim, lined up for what she terms the \u201cmillion bitch march.\u201d Unlike with \u201cHot Boyz,\u201d which equates men\u2019s worth with their possessions, \u201cHit Em Wit Da Hee\u201d disassociates materialism from attraction, instead winning over suitors with innuendo for music as currency. \u201cI hit \u2018em with the hee, I hit \u2018em with the / I stop \u2018em with the ha,\u201d she sings on the chorus \u2014 a nonsensical way of, perhaps, saying she conquers with her style.\n\n8. \u201cBomb Intro/Pass That Dutch,\u201d This Is Not a Test! (2003)\n\nGunning at the speed of a double-dutch rhythm, \u201cPass That Dutch\u201d is wildly weird, surrealist hip-hop that mercilessly pummels, taking only a few gasps of air. Lyrically, Elliott steamrolls her way across the bass-inflected soundscape, spending a wowing inaugural eight bars rhyming on the same consonant variation. What makes it even stranger, though, is the constant offering of sit-downs: Rarely do songs stop in their own tracks numerous times for a reprieve, and Elliott takes several, to accept an award and catch her breath as a clock ticks down the seconds.\n\n7. \u201cLose Control\u201d featuring Ciara and Fatman Scoop, The Cookbook (2005)\n\nWhen it comes to party jams, Elliott has planted the flag as a master, particularly on her post-Miss E \u2026 So Addictive releases. The self-produced \u201cLose Control\u201d is the penultimate of the selections, a Ritalin-chomping whirlwind that pays little mind to structure and bounds from one flaming segment to the next. With Fatman Scoop playing hype man, samples of Cybotron\u2019s \u201cClear\u201d and Hot Streak\u2019s \u201cBody Work\u201d intertwine as Elliott and Ciara sass at breakneck speeds, making for the former\u2019s most tireless dance number yet.\n\n6. \u201cBeep Me 911\u201d featuring 702 and Magoo, Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nToggling between acid-tongued rapper and volumizing R&B singer came naturally to Elliott, most likely attributed to her experience with girl group Sista, in which she juggled both. \u201cBeep Me 911\u201d was the all-sung single from Supa Dupa Fly, one where she carried over the meter of her staggered raps to Timbaland\u2019s funk-whispered beat, her vocals dancing just outside of time signature. It culminated in a wall-of-harmony chorus accentuated by 702, giving way to a typically nasal cameo from Magoo.\n\n5. \u201cHot Boyz (Remix)\u201d featuring Nas, Eve, and Q-Tip, Da Real World (1999)\n\nThe fetishization of men, and equating their worth to the materialistic goods they possess, is what made \u201cHot Boyz\u201d such a standout to begin with. (Not to mention the stuttering beat, its doomsday-esque bounce all chords and kicks.) But the remix leveled the playing field, and the audacity of slotting two men on a song about appreciating a man\u2019s appearance wasn\u2019t lost here.\n\n4. \u201cShe\u2019s a Bitch,\u201d Da Real World (1999)\n\nElliott\u2019s introduction to the world with Supa Dupa Fly was a game-shifter, but her futuristic vision concretely materialized with Da Real World, so concerned with sounding beyond the time and seemingly approximating it. \u201cShe\u2019s a Bitch,\u201d its lead single, followed a formula that Timbaland often employed \u2014 booming bass and kicks, ratatat bongos, cherry-sweet synths on top \u2014 and unapologetically functioned as a reclamation of the word \u201cbitch\u201d as terminology for a strong woman, something that Lil\u2019 Kim reiterates on the album\u2019s interludes. It was a tool of empowerment, delivered through some of Elliott\u2019s most impeccable rhymes.\n\n3. \u201cGet Ur Freak On,\u201d Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001)\n\nTimbaland often experimented with global sounds; he explored much of them on his own projects with Magoo. But mainstream radio was relatively bare of them until \u201cGet Ur Freak On,\u201d a bhangr\u0101-indebted wallop of plucks on a tumbi, accented by relatively constrained percussion. Elliott\u2019s delivery is elastic yet controlled, sliding from indoor voice to whisper to open-throated howl, with a chorus hung on slang that was instantly etched in the contemporary lexicon.\n\n2. \u201cThe Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),\u201d Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nRedefining what the world already knows about hip-hop is what continues to make Elliott a recurring figure in the genre, and her entry point into the solo world was a remarkable glimpse of her capacities. Atop a throbbing beat constructed around a sample of Ann Peebles\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Stand the Rain,\u201d Elliott casually declares her lyrical prowess by rapping at a shrugging pace, unfurling line after line that often didn\u2019t call back to the one before it. Still, out of that dissonance came an aesthetic cohesion for one of the most consummate rap songs of 1997, and of her career.\n\n1. \u201cWork It,\u201d Under Construction (2002)\n\nUp until her fourth album Under Construction, Elliott and Timbaland confected a sound that consistently nudged toward the future. They were obsessed with it: Elliott explored the galaxies in the Mega Man-inspired video for 1997\u2019s \u201cSock It 2 Me,\u201d Da Real World was set in the year 3000 (and referenced The Matrix throughout), and even the cover of Miss E \u2026 So Addictive looked like Elliott was suiting up for intergalactic battle. But when it came to Under Construction, they did the opposite. Instead of making the present sound like the future, they harnessed the past, sealing it in an album that appreciated the roots of the culture from which it was birthed while concurrently pushing it forward.\n\nThe crown jewel of the collection \u2014 of her discography \u2014 was \u201cWork It,\u201d a song that blurred the decades that came before and after it. On paper, \u201cWork It\u201d was musically crowded: there are four samples, a lot for any song, including Run-D.M.C.\u2019s \u201cPeter Piper,\u201d Bob James\u2019 \u201cTake Me to the Mardi Gras,\u201d Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three\u2019s \u201cRequest Line,\u201d and Blondie\u2019s \u201cHeart of Glass.\u201d But Timbaland plays master surgeon brilliantly, setting the framework of a synth that sounds like birds hitting power lines in rhythm, a ghostly Theremin stretching octaves like putty, and trademarked Timbo percussion that kept the beat moving in time. He spliced in each sample and break at just the right moment, giving consistent nods back to the golden era of hip-hop before it in a hyper-futuristic context.\n\nWhat defined the song beyond that, though, was Elliott\u2019s ability to toss around language like a rag doll and unashamedly wearing her sexuality proud. \u201cWork It\u201d is, on the surface, a song about getting laid. It\u2019s carefree, fun, and ceaseless, packed with tasty one-liners (\u201cGo downtown and eat it like a vulture,\u201d \u201cGive you some some some of this Cinnabon\u201d) and comedic quips at every turn. But at its heart, it\u2019s about conveying ownership over one\u2019s sexuality. Elliott rebukes the stigma attached to sex workers for using their body to make a means of living (\u201cGirls, girls, get that cash, if it\u2019s 9-to-5 or shakin\u2019 your ass / Ain\u2019t no shame ladies do your thing, just make sure you\u2019re ahead of the game\u201d). She spends an entire verse seducing a lover so she can \u201ctake my thong off and my ass go boom.\u201d The chorus is about scouring the land for a \u201cbig dick,\u201d censored by an elephant\u2019s honk.\n\nSexuality is often narrowly interpreted as threatening, particularly when it\u2019s deemed too salacious, especially if it\u2019s a black woman wielding it. But Elliott and Timbaland made it impossible to deny, in a year when the closest analogue was Tweet\u2019s \u201cOops (Oh My),\u201d a masturbation celebration they wrote and produced. \u201cWork It\u201d also happened to be the most innovative, boundary-shattering single to be released that year, and marked the beginning of a new era for Elliott, ever the creative expansionist, and proverbial genius the world can\u2019t ever seem to truly figure out.", "description": "We take a look back at the songs that line the path of Elliott\u2019s truly singular career, ranking her solo offerings, including album cuts, unreleased tracks, and original remixes.", "authors": ["Steven J.
