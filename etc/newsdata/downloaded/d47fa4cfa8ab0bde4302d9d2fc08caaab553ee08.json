Home sellers near a Trader Joe\u2019s saw an average return on investment of 51%, while those near a Whole Foods saw a 41% increase, the study found\n\nAccording to Zillow, houses near Trader Joes or Whole Foods began to appreciate more quickly after those stores moved in than before \u2014 and that they appreciated twice as quickly as the average home in the United States.\n\n\u2018Chicken or egg question\u2019\n\nHaving a fancy grocery store in the neighborhood adds to a debate about gentrifying neighborhoods, where upscale establishments increasingly cater to an influx of higher-income residents \u2014 all of which puts upward pressure on housing prices.\n\n\u201cWe have the Trader Joe\u2019s downstairs in our building we are selling at 100 West 93rd Street [in New York], and a Whole Foods a few blocks away,\u201d said Susan Fishman, an agent at Warburg Realty.\n\nAfter a year, she said, the price per square foot for an apartment located by Trader Joe\u2019s rose by more than $300.\n\nYet in a city that\u2019s as expensive as New York \u2014 where affordable housing is in short supply and residents all across the five boroughs lament surging prices \u2014 it\u2019s unclear clear how much of rising prices can be linked to just the presence of an upscale grocer.\n\n\u201cPeople would pay more to live near a nicer grocery store. But, I think this might be more of a chicken and egg question,\u201d said Steven Gottlieb, another agent at Warburg Realty.\n\n\u201cPeople of means are more likely to demand nicer neighborhood amenities and higher end market chains are attracted to more expensive/upwardly mobile areas,\u201d he added.\n\nNEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES - 2018/07/08: Trader Joe's store in New York City.

The streets used to be kind of empty around here on the weekend and now it is filled with people with their TJ's bags,\u201d she added.", "description": "Organic foods may be costly in more ways than one.", "authors": ["Calder Mchugh", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p_yFAqE1k5__WRs74cMQWQ--~B/aD0yOTM4O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/707389c0-c2b5-11e9-abff-d297f25614f2", "published_at": "2019-08-25"}
