Plus, Cara Reedy on what it means to be a person with dwarfism\n\nBoris Johnson has spent frantic hours trying to get a Brexit deal that would be acceptable to the EU as well as a majority of MPs in parliament. Late discussions centred on the arrangements for Northern Ireland, which have long been a stumbling block for a deal.\n\nJoining Anushka Asthana are the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin and columnist Polly Toynbee. If a deal can be agreed at this week\u2019s EU summit, the focus will switch to parliament where the prime minister cannot guarantee a majority. So is there still a path to a final Brexit deal by the end of this month as Johnson has promised?\n\nAlso today: Cara Reedy on what it means to be a person with dwarfism and how she explored the issue in her Guardian film.", "description": "Jennifer Rankin and Polly Toynbee discuss the dilemma facing MPs as the government edges towards a Brexit deal.
