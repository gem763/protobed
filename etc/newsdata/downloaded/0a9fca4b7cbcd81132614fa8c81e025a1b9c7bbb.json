There are those on the younger side who do it for the flexibility or because they think they might not be able to find work otherwise. And there are those on the older side who are more likely to freelance because they want to do so.\n\nAnd although 60% of freelancers 65 and older surveyed by Freelancers Union and the online freelance platform Upwork are happy with how much they work, only 48% of those 50 to 64 say they have all the work they want. Freelancers Union and Upwork broke out its findings for people 50+ exclusively for Next Avenue.\n\nThe low percentage for freelancers in their 50s and early 60s having all the work they want could be troubling, considering they\u2019re at a time of life when saving for retirement is so important, said Cal Halvorsen, who studies later-life employment as an assistant professor at Boston College\u2019s School of Social Work.\n\nFreelancing in America by the numbers\n\nBecause there\u2019s a 50/50 chance of losing your job involuntarily after 50, it\u2019s possible that people in this age group are freelancing because they \u201cmight have been pushed into it,\u201d Halvorsen said.\n\nRead more: You\u2019re likely to be out of a job in your 50s \u2014 4 ways to prepare and minimize the pain\n\nThe Freelancing in America: 2019 report is based on an online survey conducted this summer of 6,001 U.S. adults who did paid work in the past 12 months. Of the 2,117 freelancers in the study, 583 were 50 and older. The report defines a freelancer as anyone who\u2019s done supplemental, temporary, project or contract work on a full-time or part-time basis. That can mean everyone from Uber UBER, +2.35% rivers to freelance writers to consultants to people selling items on eBay EBAY, +0.44%\n\nLife expectancy has improved so much that retiring at 65 doesn\u2019t make as much sense as it once did, and that\u2019s reflected in how many people continue to freelance past that age, said Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel. \u201cIn some cases, people go back to work and do something radically different from their previous profession,\u201d he noted.\n\nNearly a third of people over 50 freelanced in the past year, according to the report. That\u2019s a tad under the 35% for all age groups. A slightly larger percentage of people over 65 worked for themselves (34%) than people 50 to 64 (27%).\n\nFreelancing by choice or necessity?\n\nAlthough the number of U.S. freelancers hasn\u2019t risen in the past few years \u2014 hovering around 57 million \u2014 the percentage who do it by choice, rather than out of necessity, has increased, from 53% in 2014 to 60% in 2019, according to the report. The same trend holds true for older workers. In 2019, close to six in 10 freelancers age 50 to 64 and 73% of those 65+ do so because they want to, the researchers found.\n\nOne reason freelancing is so enticing to many people 50 and older: the flexibility to work when you want, where you want.\n\nAlso see: Out of a job after age 50? Here\u2019s what to do\n\nA substantial portion of older freelancers surveyed (42%) say they work for themselves because they can\u2019t work for a traditional employer. This group includes people with physical or mental health issues that would make it difficult to work in a traditional office setting as well as those caring for older or younger family members.\n\nTransitioning to retirement\n\nLate-career freelancers see freelancing as a transition toward retirement, including 60% of those 50 to 64 and 69% of freelancers 65 and older.\n\nSince it\u2019s still rare for employers to offer phased retirement programs where people gradually shift from full-time work to working part time or not at all, freelancing could be an alternative to that, said Jeri Sedlar, a retirement expert and author of \u201cDon\u2019t Retire, Rewire.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the data that many Americans freelancing after 65 are doing so because they enjoy it, while some do so because they need the money for retirement. \u201cThere are people who don\u2019t have enough money for retirement\u201d who continue to work, Sedlar said. \u201cBut others are still in the game because they want to be in the game, not because they have to.\u201d\n\nQuite a few freelancers in their 50s and early 60s might be tempted to become employees again. The survey found that only 55% of them say they would never go back to being an employee.\n\nOne likely reason: benefits.\n\nWhat about benefits?\n\nFreelancers generally aren\u2019t eligible for employee benefits, so the onus is on them to find and pay for health insurance and to save for retirement. Only about 13% of America\u2019s solo self-employed participate in retirement savings plans at their current jobs, according to a recent Pew Charitable Trusts survey; that compares with almost three-quarters of traditional workers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why working has become the new retirement\n\nThe Freelancing in America: 2019 report didn\u2019t break out health insurance data for freelancers by age, but found that 83% of full-time freelancers carry health insurance. Put another way, 17% of full-time freelancers lack health insurance.\n\nIn addition, 21% of full-time freelancers surveyed say they get health coverage through Medicaid, the government program primarily for low-income people.\n\nIf freelancers, including those in their 50s and 60s, aren\u2019t earning enough to buy health insurance, let alone save for their retirement, \u201cit leads me to be concerned about their future,\u201d Halvorsen said. \u201cThe requirements of Medicaid are becoming more stringent. So to even be eligible tells me that [some] freelancers are earning incredibly low amounts of money.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the median hourly rate for skilled freelancers is $28; for unskilled freelancers, it\u2019s $20.\n\nMaking health care more available and affordable was the top factor freelancers think politicians should focus on to attract self-employed people to move to their city or state, according to the report.\n\nThe advantage older freelancers have\n\nFreelancers of all ages are most likely to find work through previous clients, friends and family, professional contacts and social media, the report found. Being older helps, because it\u2019s likelier that you\u2019ve established relationships to draw on for freelance work, Upwork\u2019s Kasriel said. \u201cYou have a larger network, and that can pay off,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe vast majority of all freelancers surveyed believe having the right skills is essential to their work and that keeping skills up-to-date is key to remaining marketable.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important for older workers who are freelancing or thinking of doing so to keep up with the latest skills in their field, Sedlar said.\n\n\u201cIf you want to stay in the game, you have to make sure you have the latest game book,\u201d she said.", "description": "A new report on freelancing reveals some surprising facts.", "authors": ["Michelle V.
