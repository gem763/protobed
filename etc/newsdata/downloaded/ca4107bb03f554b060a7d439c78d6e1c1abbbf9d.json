The letter also calls on Congress to investigate Ring's practices.\n\nThe open letter escalates the petition campaign that Fight for the Future launched in August, which called on civilians to petition their local officials to stop, halt, or ban any police partnerships with Ring.\n\nThe signatories of the open letter include privacy advocacy groups like Media Justice, the Tor Project, and Media Mobilizing Project, and racial justice coalition like The Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Mijente, and the American-Arab Anti-Discriimnination Committee. The open letter points out that the proliferation of privatized surveillance cameras like Ring, which make it easy for law enforcement to request footage without a warrant, disproportionately puts marginalized and over-policed communities of color at risk.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of reporting and general discussion about these surveillance partnerships and the potential risks to privacy and civil liberties,\u201d Evan Greer deputy director of Fight for the Future, said in a phone call. \u201cBut this is the first time that a major coalition of significant organizations are explicitly calling on elected officials to do something about it.\u201d\n\nWhen Ring partners with police, the company provides police with a tool called the Law Enforcement Neighborhoods Portal. This tool is an interactive map that shows the approximate location of all Ring camera owners in the area, and allows police to request footage directly from residents, streamlining the process of voluntary evidence sharing.\n\nAs reported by Motherboard, police then have to make an exchange. Some police have to promote Ring either implicitly, through only speaking about Ring in company-approved statements and providing download links to Ring\u2019s \u201cneighborhood watch\u201d app, Neighbors. Others must promote it explicitly, by signing agreements stipulating that police must \u201cencourage adoption\u201d of Ring cameras and Neighbors.\n\nThe open letter points out that some cities subsidize discounts on Ring cameras. As reported by Motherboard, some cities have paid up to $100,000 of taxpayer money in order to fund these discount programs.\n\nGreer said that the letter acts on an urgent need for local lawmakers to ask questions about Ring, and federal lawmakers to formally investigate the company\u2019s practices.\n\n\u201cOur elected officials in Congress, at the very least, have to be asking what the implications for our country are if a company like Amazon is able to exponentially increase the number of cameras in our neighborhoods, and at the same time, enter into these cozy partnerships with law enforcement,\u201d Greer said. \u2018\u201cThere\u2019s no oversight for what [police] can do with [data] once they collect it.\u201d\n\nSee Motherboard\u2019s Ring topic page for our most recent reporting about the company.\n\nGot a tip about Ring discount programs, police partnerships, or something else?
