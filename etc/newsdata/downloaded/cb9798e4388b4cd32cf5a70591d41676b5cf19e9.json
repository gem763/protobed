Gildernew regained the seat in 2017.\n\nFoster said on Friday that she would not be a candidate if a general election was called. There had been speculation that she could seek a Westminster seat.\n\n\u201cMy focus is very much on the return of devolution and the return of Stormont, that\u2019s what I am focused on,\u201d she said. \u201cThat and the fact that I want to see a deal to leave the European Union, I think those two big issues will be taking up a lot of my time over the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFoster said that she believes the focus should be on a Brexit deal, rather than a general election. But she added: \u201cIf an election is called, we\u2019ll be ready to fight the election and we will go forward on our record of delivery.\u201d\n\nGildernew claimed Foster and her party were \u201crunning scared\u201d of a general election. \u201cArlene Foster claims she wants to concentrate on restoring the powersharing institutions at Stormont. She cannot be serious, given the fact she\u2019s had two-and-a-half years to work on restoring the political institutions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe DUP are currently not engaged meaningfully in any talks process [to return to power-sharing] \u2013 and have previously walked away from a deal. Their toxic pact with the Tories has brought chaos and dysfunction to politics here in the north and politics in Britain, while actively working against the interests of citizens. Arlene Foster and the DUP are running scared from the electorate.\u201d", "description": "Moves follows speculation Northern Irish party leader could stand in snap election", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083e63a33a592b8ed1a62b8d8a3945b5d61473bc/145_0_1247_748/master/1247.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a4e067ee97216c59ea88d55b5df6d2f", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
