REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nA deal for the plants would be strategic for U.S. aerospace components maker Spirit, which is diversifying its customer base. But an agreement for the plants has not been concluded and talks could break off, said one of the sources, who discussed the private negotiations on condition of anonymity.\n\nBombardier said in May it would sell off the two aerostructures operations, including a wing-making facility in Belfast, as the Montreal-based company sheds its commercial aviation businesses to focus on more profitable corporate jets and passenger rail cars businesses.\n\nReuters could not ascertain a value for the deal.\n\nBombardier and Spirit both declined to comment.\n\nSpirit, which analysts have speculated as a possible buyer for the plants, has said publicly its acquisition criteria includes diversification away from Boeing Co (BA.N).\n\nOther potential suitors named by analysts and in media reports have included Europe\u2019s Airbus SE (AIR.PA), Spain\u2019s Aernnova and GKN Aerospace.\n\nOne of the sources said Airbus is not bidding for Bombardier\u2019s facilities.\n\nAn Airbus spokesman declined to comment on speculation but said that Bombardier\u2019s aerostructures and engineering services is a key supplier to the company.\n\n\u201cWe of course monitor the situation to ensure the supplies and competitiveness are maintained,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nAirbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in September the planemaker wants to lower A220 costs from suppliers by 20% over three years.\n\nAernnova and GKN Aerospace could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe Belfast plant, which produces wings for Airbus\u2019s A220 jet, is considered politically sensitive as the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland with a workforce of around 3,500. Bombardier is also selling a wing component plant in Morocco.\n\nSpirit is Boeing\u2019s largest supplier, but has plans to grow its business with Airbus with the 2018 announced acquisition of supplier Asco Industries for $650 million.\n\nIn May, Spirit, which makes the fuselage, structural engine components and wing parts for Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX, suspended its full-year outlook following the global grounding of the jet in the wake of two deadly crashes involving the model.\n\nBut Spirit has continued to produce parts for the MAX at a rate of 52 units per month, even as Boeing cut production of the plane to 42 per month. It cut overtime, froze hiring and other costs to offset impact of MAX grounding, the company has said.", "description": "Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc has emerged as the front-runner to acquire Bombardier Inc's aerostructures facilities in Belfast and Morocco, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.", "authors": ["Allison Lampert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436772770&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921PH"}
