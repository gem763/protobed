(Mark Zaleski/AP)\n\nNew England Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski has been placed on injured reserve and will miss the remainder of the season with a left hip injury, ESPN reported Wednesday. He will be replaced by veteran Mike Nugent, whom the Patriots signed on Thursday.\n\nGostkowski, 35, has served as the Patriots kicker since 2006 and is the team\u2019s all-time leading scorer \u2014 a mainstay at a position that typically features a lot of turnover for NFL teams. The Patriots, however, have fielded just three kickers in the past 24 years, dating back to Adam Vinatieri\u2019s first season with the team in 1996. In 2010, Gostkowski went on IR in November with a thigh injury, and veteran Shayne Graham filled in for the second half of the season.\n\nThe hip injury, which will require surgery, might explain Gostkowski\u2019s relatively difficult start to this season. Though the Patriots are undefeated heading into Sunday\u2019s game at the winless Washington Redskins, the kicker has missed four extra-point attempts and made 7 of 8 field goals. He hadn\u2019t missed more than three extra points in any of the previous 13 seasons and has completed more than 87 percent of his career 428 field goal attempts.\n\nWith Stephen Gostkowski headed to IR, Patriots are going to be signing just their FOURTH kicker since 1996. Chargers are on their 4th kicker since 2018.\n\n\n\nPats kickers for the past 23 years:\n\nVinatieri: 1996-2005\n\nGostkowski: 2006-2019\n\nShayne Graham: 2010 (8 games)#Patriots \u2014 John Breech (@johnbreech) October 2, 2019\n\nThe Patriots typically thrive on special teams, an often-overlooked advantage for the six-time Super Bowl champions. Coach Bill Belichick seems to value continuity, but the Patriots also turned over at punter before the season, dumping Ryan Allen after six seasons in favor of rookie Jake Bailey of Stanford. Belichick praised Bailey in a radio appearance Monday.\n\nESPN reported Wednesday the Patriots worked out a number of free agents to replace Gostkowski \u2014 including Nugent and Kai Forbath, who emerged as finalists. Nugent was the pick. The 37-year-old has spent time with seven NFL franchises, including the Oakland Raiders, for whom he briefly played last season.\n\n\u201cWhoever the next guy is that comes in here, he doesn\u2019t need to try to be Steve or try to be Adam Vinatieri; he just needs to be himself,\u201d special teams captain Matthew Slater said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here for a reason and that reason will be because Coach Belichick thinks he\u2019s going to give us the best chance to help this team win games. We\u2019ll support him. We\u2019ll do what we can to help him adjust.\u201d\n\nRead More on NFL:\n\nDerek Carr defends Vontaze Burfict, \u2018one of the most misunderstood people in the NFL\u2019\n\nKirk Cousins apologizes to Adam Thielen as the NFL\u2019s 2018 QB carousel sputters\n\nFantasy football cheat sheet: Week 5 injury updates on Davante Adams and Sam Darnold", "description": "After missing four extra points, Stephen Gostkowski, the franchise's all-time leading scorer, will have season-ending hip surgery.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Michael Brice-Saddler Is A General Assignment Reporter.
