The montage of lap dances and then getting shut down. Management being sh*tty. Bouncers saying they won't help if you don't tip.\n\nI've seen people point out that the movie shames [dancers who sell] \"extras\" and full-service work (strippers who sleep with clients). I'm torn on that because I don't want civilians to see that and think the only heroic strippers are the ones who don't give blowjobs. On the other hand, a lot of strippers are really sh*tty to workers who do that, so how it was presented felt like an accurate representation.\n\nI took a lot of joy in watching sex workers flat out steal from a-hole men. It was a power fantasy for me and I think a lot of us dancers. [Sex workers] are already criminals [in most people's eyes, so I guess I'm not as offended by us being presented as criminals if we're also being presented as real people.\n\nIt did need to be more gay though. I don't buy that a group of sex workers that big didn't contain a single queer person.\n\nThe club [where I worked] had some of the highest house fees in the country. It was already hard to work in for lots of reasons but then there was this few months where people weren't coming in. There wasn't much money for anyone. And management was just pumping us for more fees, talking about raising house fees, yelling at us for not working harder, good security guys were leaving. I knew if I didn't leave I was going to wind up hating my job. I transitioned to full-service sex work (both independently and in legal brothels). I've been doing that since, along with some porn and sugaring here and there. I like my job. It's right for me. It's also just part of my life. It's one of the least interesting things about me, but it's the thing I find myself explaining to people the most.\n\nRead more: A legal sex worker shares what it's really like to work in a brothel", "description": "Three women who worked as exotic dancers during the same era reflect on the accuracy of the hit movie \"Hustlers,\" starring Jennifer Lopez.", "authors": ["Melissa Petro"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7e23a72e22af2cbc7e3235-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
