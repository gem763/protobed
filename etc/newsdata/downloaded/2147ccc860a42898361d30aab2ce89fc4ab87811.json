But the effects of the thunderous vote could be heard for years to come.\n\nSo where, exactly, does Tuesday\u2019s vote leave Boris Johnson, Brexit and Britain?\n\n\n\nBORIS\n\nThe vote means the embattled British prime minister could become the shortest-serving tenant of No. 10 Downing Street since the office was created in 1721. (The Duke of Wellington, who famously defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, served 23 days as a caretaker prime minister in 1834).\n\nTraditionally, if a British prime minister loses their ability to win votes in Parliament, they are ejected via a vote of no confidence, or they call for an early election to decide their fate.\n\nJohnson\u2019s preference is for an election on Oct. 14, hoping that his Conservative Party would gain more seats in the House of Commons and give him more backing for his preferred approach to Brexit.\n\nCalling an election would be a big risk, though. It would essentially amount to a second referendum on Brexit in all but name, and serve as a first referendum on Johnson. The previous prime minister, Theresa May, called an early election in 2017, only to have it misfire badly, leaving her with a wafer-thin majority.\n\nWhile Conservatives top national opinion polls, that support is stuck in the low 30s and they face surging opponents on both their left (Liberal Democrats) and right (Brexit Party) in addition to their traditional rivals, the left-wing Labour party.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has flip-flopped on whether he would support such a move. After insisting for months on calling an early general election, he backtracked on Tuesday. His new condition: no-deal Brexit must be off the table before he agrees to an election.\n\nParliament could also attempt to remove Johnson without turning to the voters \u2014 via a vote of no confidence. But because Johnson succeeded in getting the Queen to suspend Parliament for five weeks starting on Sept. 9, there\u2019s likely no time for Johnson\u2019s Parliamentary opponents to pull off that maneuver.\n\nWho could replace Johnson?\n\nIf there\u2019s no election, but Johnson goes down via a no-confidence vote or resigns, a frontrunner to lead a temporary administration to handle Brexit would be Kenneth Clarke. A former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, Clarke is a moderate Conservative who supports EU membership, but has three times voted for softer forms of Brexit out of respect for the 2016 referendum result.\n\nIf the Conservatives lose any election, the most likely new prime minister would be Corbyn from the Labour party. Corbyn would either run a minority government or unite with other pro-EU parties like the Liberal Democrats to lead a coalition government.\n\n\n\nBREXIT\n\nWill Brexit be delayed? That depends on whether there\u2019s an election and how far Johnson is willing to push constitutional norms. With no written constitution, Britain is on shaky ground here.\n\nJohnson has said Britain is leaving the EU on October 31, regardless of what Parliament says. If he sticks to that line of defying Parliament, and avoids an October election, the Queen is likely the only person who could stop Johnson. While \u201cThe Queen versus Boris Johnson\u201d is a dream storyline for scriptwriters at \u201cThe Crown,\u201d it\u2019s far-fetched scenario, given it would represent the most direct political play by a British monarch in nearly 200 years.\n\nIn any October election the three choices for voters are: back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit-by-any-means policy; elect a Labour-led government that would pursue a managed Brexit; or enter the uncharted territory of a minority government led by a pro-EU party such as the third-placed Liberal Democrats.\n\nCan Brexit be stopped? Probably not.\n\nOpinion polls show the country to be as divided as it was in 2016 on Brexit. The official opposition leader, Corbyn, has committed to deliver Brexit since the referendum. Meanwhile, the nationalist Brexit Party has at times risen to the top of national polls in recent months. In addition: most other leading Conservatives are also committed to Brexit, though many want it to be softened and managed in cooperation with the EU.\n\nPro EU campaigners demonstrate outside the House of Commons in London on Tuesday. | Peter Summers/Getty Images\n\nDoes that mean Britain is headed for a managed Brexit? That is a message Parliament has regularly sent to Downing Street, and is the preference of EU officials. That\u2019s why May\u2019s government and the EU spent two years working towards the deal agreed to in December 2018.\n\nBut to ultimately get there, the EU may have to smooth the edges of the existing deal \u2014 something it has so far refused to do.\n\nWhat does the EU think?\n\nThe EU looks on with sadness and fear in equal measure, and will not alter the core elements of the existing deal. The bloc prizes maintaining the integrity of its single market system over all else, and has been keen to make an example out of Britain\u2019s choice to leave \u2014 so other EU members aren\u2019t tempted to follow.\n\nGiven those fundamentals, the EU has shifted to treating a no-deal Brexit as its default expectation.\n\nOfficials in Brussels on Wednesday will propose two new budget instruments to support the companies and workers most affected by a no-deal Brexit. The EU\u2019s goal: prevent the U.K. tearing a hole in its single market.\n\nIn contrast, Michael Gove, Britain\u2019s minister in charge of preparing for Brexit refuses to publish his own governments\u2019 planning scenarios \u2014 known as Operation Yellowhammer. The presumed reason, based on leaked versions of the plans, is that they paint a devastating picture of the impact of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\n\nBRITAIN\n\nThe long-term effects of this week\u2019s debate could be significant. It\u2019s now clear that Boris Johnson will not be able to unite his country, even if he can hang on and find a way to deliver Brexit.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government now has a choice between fermenting a constitutional crisis (if the government ignores Parliament) or managing a policy crisis (given Parliament is on track to overturn the government\u2019s key policy in a second critical vote Wednesday).\n\nThe political and cultural divisions run deep across Britain.\n\nModerate Labour MP Liz Kendall tweeted Tuesday that she had \u201cnever seen such cold hard anger\u201d among her Parliament colleagues, as she did watching Conservative moderates react in fury as the leader of the House of Commons, hardline Brexiteer Jacob-Rees Mogg, addressed Parliament Tuesday.\n\nThe politically neutral Queen is also getting uncomfortably close to the action: last week she was roped into suspending Parliament for five weeks, via a secretive constitutional forum known as the Privy Council, convened at her summer castle in Balmoral, Scotland\n\nWhile protesters have reached for extreme daily slogans like \u201cStop the coup\u201d, there are plenty of other sharp realities at hand that require no exaggeration.\n\nThe Scottish government, which has similar powers to the state government in the United States, is pushing for a new referendum on leaving the U.K. London, a bastion of pro-EU support, is splintering further from the rest of the country. And the inability to avoid recreating a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is threatening to destabilize a peace agreement reached more than 20 years ago.\n\nIn other words, the longest-term Brexit effect could be the break-up of the United Kingdom.", "description": "The House of Commons on Tuesday took the unprecedented step of usurping government control of Parliament \u2014 a dramatic move that raises more questions than it answers.", "authors": ["Ryan Heath"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/66/c9/9f61f54447579e55e39ffae73f66/20190903-boris-johnson-head-gty-773.jpg"}
