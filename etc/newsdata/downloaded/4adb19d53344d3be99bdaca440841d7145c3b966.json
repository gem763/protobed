She noted that she did say some of the darndest things when she was a kid and people asked her about her dreams for the future.\n\n\u201cI knew that I wanted to do something really cool and when people asked me, 'Tiffany, what do you want to be when you grow up,' I'd be like I wanna be a horse farmer or I want to work in a Snickers factory or in a beef jerky factory,\u201d Haddish told reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.\n\n\u201cAnd they would be like, \u2018Why would you want to do those things?' And I'm like, because my grandma said do what you love, and I love horses, I love Snickers, love beef jerky, so there you have it. So, I was a talker,\u201d Haddish joked.\n\nTIFFANY HADDISH CANCELS COMEDY SHOW IN ATLANTA OVER GEORGIA HEARTBEAT ABORTION LAW\n\nThe \u201cLast Black Unicorn\u201d author told the room she begged her mother and grandmother to somehow get her on the show, adding that when the idea was floated of a possible return for the program, she immediately jumped at the opportunity-- but under one condition.\n\n\u201cWhen I met these guys and they were saying they wanted to bring the show back, I was like let's do it. I would love to do it on my terms, my way,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I said I would only do it if I could be an executive producer, that means I'm a boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Girls Trip\u201d star reflected on her comedic influences growing up, and how she intently studied the works of Art Linkletter and many of the great comedy legends of her time and past eras.\n\n\u201cI used to watch Red Skelton and Milton Berle and all those greats. That's probably why I'm the way I am,\u201d the \u201cNight School\u201d star explained. \u201cI mean, I love Charlie Chaplin and they're all like really cool guys. They're all cool.\u201d\n\nTIFFANY HADDISH RECALLS BEING 'HOMELESS AND SCARED' IN INSTAGRAM POST: 'I'M SO HAPPY WE HAVE COME THIS FAR'\n\nHaddish said her turbulent upbringing, in which she and her siblings were placed into foster care, helped her mature early on as an adolescent and groomed the wittiness and comedic timing she often displays in her stand-up comedy routines and sketch pieces.\n\nWhen by a reporter if her rebuttals to the children on the show could be considered too risqu\u00e9 for kids or the audience, Haddish quickly sullied the sentiment, adding that the words that permeate out of her mouth or any of her guests is nothing compared to the content kids have access to on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cDo you watch cartoons? Do you watch [what] these kids are watching?\u201d Haddish asked the reporter. \u201cI watch cartoons on a regular basis, I'm a big kid myself and I'm like how did they get away with that? How are they letting this fly on 'Teen Titans?\u2019\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThe show is not for kids,\u201d Haddish added. \u201cThe show is for adults and it happens to have children on it.
