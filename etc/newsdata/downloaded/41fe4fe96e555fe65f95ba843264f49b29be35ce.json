With no functioning water systems in accessible areas, workers had not been able to establish a permanent rescue site on the Abacos.\n\nThe US Coast Guard had rescued 114 people by Wednesday afternoon. A spokesman told the Guardian that six helicopter rescue crews had rescued around 60 critically injured people by Tuesday evening.\n\nWhat to expect next from Hurricane Dorian Read more\n\nLt Keith Webb, a Royal Marines helicopter co-pilot, said that his crew had rescued a seven-week-old baby girl who suffered from acute sepsis in the aftermath of Dorian. The crew had also rescued two children, aged six and seven, suffering from hypothermia.\n\nOther recently evacuated Bahamians said they had endured days without food and, in one case, had witnessed a neighbour die in front of them from cardiac arrest.\n\nMinnis said he had spoken to Donald Trump earlier in the day. The US president has suggested he may visit the Bahamas in the wake of Dorian.\n\n\u201cI guess you would call it a British protectorate, but I will do a lot,\u201d Trump told reporters earlier on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for a call \u2013 they\u2019re having a lot of trouble with the telephones over there as you can imagine \u2013 from the prime minister and we\u2019re helping a lot.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Survivors of the hurricane in Nassau.

On Wednesday evening it was a category 3 storm with sustained winds of 115mph, regaining strength after previously being downgraded to a category 2.\n\nForecasters warned of near-record water levels and millions of people are under evacuation orders. Businesses are boarded up around the city and some people have been in shelters for days. South Carolina\u2019s governor Henry McMaster warned residents in evacuation zones to \u201cget out now\u201d. There was still time for people to leave at-risk areas, he said, but they should do so immediately.\n\nAdam Gabbatt contributed reporting", "description": "Officials expect the number of dead will continue to rise as large parts of some islands remain inaccessible to rescue crews", "authors": ["Oliver Laughland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b230f4c5607c1b6ef0ca34748b2592b3cb3546b0/0_104_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78c1fcad60b44d81f277b080296b7429"}
