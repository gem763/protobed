I just don't want them to get sole custody of my name.\"\n\nImage caption Rats often appear in Banksy's work\n\nImage caption Tony the Tiger, a character used on a cereal box, is depicted as a rug\n\nIt comes as one of Banksy's paintings which shows the House of Commons packed with chimpanzees is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's on Thursday.\n\nKevin Zuchowski-Morrison, owner of street art gallery Rise, said: \"It's incredible that we have this work, very clearly the work of a very famous artist who we all kind of love. It couldn't be any more authentic.\"\n\nA Banksy collector who came to see the display, said: \"It's brilliant. So good that it's happening.\n\n\"I doubt he (Banksy) will turn up and go 'hello lads, how are ya?' But he's obviously around.\"\n\nJohn, another Banksy enthusiast, who is on holiday in the UK from the United States, said: \"It has all the earmarks of Banksy's work.\n\n\"It's graphic, it's cheeky, it's intelligent.\"", "description": "Stormzy's stab vest and a cradle surrounded by CCTV cameras appeared overnight at a shop in London.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B378/production/_109044954_mediaitem109044953.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
