Their findings were published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a publication of the American College of Physicians, last week \u2013 to howls of protest from the scientific and nutritional establishment.\n\nOne of the largest scientific evaluations ever attempted cancels the red alert concerning red meat, finding it was based on bad data. https://t.co/5K0SAJ9lv2pic.twitter.com/qbGCLtLtHu \u2014 Rolf Degen (@DegenRolf) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cThis report has layers of flaws and is the most egregious abuse of evidence that I have ever seen,\u201d declared Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nHarsh words, to be sure, especially since one of the study\u2019s authors is Gordon Guyatt, a professor of medicine at McMaster University in Canada and one of the creators of GRADE, a strict methodology for assessing the certainty of scientific evidence.\n\nGuyatt said the reactions to the study are approaching levels of what he would call \u201chysteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the emperor, and somebody points out that you haven\u2019t any clothes, this is not going to be a very appealing situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very threatening, and people are defending their territory.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Willett is a leading member of the EAT-Lancet Commission, which advocates for a plant-based diet for the sake of the environment \u2013 and Harvard is the institution behind the infamous \u201cfood pyramid,\u201d used for decades by the US government to advise its citizens to eat less meat and fat in favor of grains and carbohydrates.\n\nHealthy Eating Pyramid:The Nutrition Source | Harvard School of Public Health http://t.co/NORsHPxgbQ via @HarvardHSPHpic.twitter.com/liwGrhvISL \u2014 healthypath (@healthypathco) January 11, 2014\n\nThose guidelines have been a smashing success \u2013 in driving up the rates of obesity and diabetes, that is. If you want to see a real \u201chockey stick\u201d graph, look at the percentage of overweight Americans skyrocket since 1980, when the US government began promoting the Harvard food pyramid.\n\n2/19 For nearly five years, there has been a growing chorus of scientists, doctors, patients, policy makers, journalists & public health experts questioning the quality of official (and unofficial) diet/nutrition advice against the backdrop of an escalating public health crisis. pic.twitter.com/WUoPLdqBxj \u2014 Erica Hauver (@EricaHauver) October 3, 2019\n\nThe study also comes at the worst possible time for the scientific establishment, right amid its global crusade against farming and ranching in the name of saving the planet. One after another, scientists have argued that raising cattle destroys forests and releases carbon, so humanity must change its way of eating to focus on vegetables and insects \u2013 by force, if need be.\n\nSome governments have already imposed a \u201cmeat tax\u201d on behalf of the environment, and there has even been talk of outlawing meat for promoting \u201cecocide\u201d and being as dangerous to public health as smoking.\n\nAlso on rt.com UN climate report urges people to stop eating meat & abusing land to save planet\n\nNo surprise, then, that Harvard has attacked the study as ignoring the environmental impact of meat, because \u201cclimate change and environmental degradation have serious effects on human health\u201d and are therefore \u201cimportant to consider when making recommendations.\u201d\n\nOne California public health official echoed the same line of reasoning in a comment to the Annals of Internal Medicine, arguing the research shouldn\u2019t have been written, let alone published, \u201cwithout concern for the environmental effects of food choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease let us, as physicians, wake up to the fact, that our climate crisis poses the most profound risk to individuals and public health and that we have a responsibility in guiding the public on how to confront this threat: in part, with food choices,\u201d wrote Henning Ansor of Santa Barbara.\n\nIn other words, it doesn\u2019t matter if the science is solid, the higher moral calling demands that the scientists lie \u2013 or stay silent \u2013 in the name of Mother Earth? That\u2019s not how science works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT\n\nLike this story?
