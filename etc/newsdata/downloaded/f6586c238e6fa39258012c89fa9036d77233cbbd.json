Firstly, I arrived as Rod\u2019s girlfriend and I leave as Rod\u2019s fianc\u00e9! I cannot wait to become Mrs Higgins!\u201d Ashleigh wrote on Facebook .\n\n(Image: ashleighpetrie/Instagram)\n\n\u201cIt started with a crush and now I have a ring on my finger. The love of my life asked me to marry him and I said YESSSS.\u201d\n\nThe couple were targeted by cruel trolls over their significant age gap which even prompted calls for an investigation into Mr. Higgins' conduct.\n\n\u201cJudicial officers hold a very high and important office within the Victorian community, and the standards of conduct and integrity to which they are held are so much higher,\u201d wrote shadow attorney-general Ed O\u2019Donohue.\n\n(Image: ashleighpetrie/Instagram)\n\nIt was later reported Ashleigh had been placed on leave in work after Mr Higgins popped the question.\n\nMr Higgins was appointed to the bench in 2017 and has three grown daughters of his own, as well as one grandchild.\n\nPrevious social media posts from Ashleigh show the couple taking part in various activities and she regularly described him as the love of her life.\n\nMs Petrie shared an image of Metung Pier from Metung Hotel to her Instagram shortly before her death.\n\nHer family say they are still looking for answers as social media users expressed their shock over her death.\n\n\u201cShe was so full of life to have it end this soon. Condolences to family and true friends... she will be sadly missed,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n(Image: ashleighpetrie/Instagram)\n\n\u201cSuch a sad loss of a beautiful young lady,\u201d another said.\n\n\u201cSo very sad. Young life cut short. You obviously had a lot of support out there in this trying time. Pity they didn't express their support sooner,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nPolice confirmed the 23-year-old's death and will now prepare a report for the coroner.\n\nPolice said a driver stopped at the scene to assist and was uninjured.", "description": "Ashleigh Petrie had expressed her delight after partner Rodney Higgins, 68, proposed during a holiday to Fiji", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Ashleighpetrie Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Woman-23-killed-in-car-crash-weeks-after-engagement-to-love-of-her-life-magistrate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
