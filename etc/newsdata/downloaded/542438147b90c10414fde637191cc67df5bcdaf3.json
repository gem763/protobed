That is an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nCops will absolutely be biased in favor of cops.\n\nThere should be a mix of people from various professions sitting on these police review boards. That\u2019s just common sense.\n\n\u2014Brian Harris\n\nCivilians who have no knowledge of the law, police codes, training and guidelines have no place on the trial boards.\n\n\u2014@joyabsalon\n\nA gun, a badge and a uniform do not give cops justification to violate the constitutional rights of citizens.\n\n\u2014Charles Patterson\n\nWhenever a suspect is not cooperating, that suspect places officers in danger.
