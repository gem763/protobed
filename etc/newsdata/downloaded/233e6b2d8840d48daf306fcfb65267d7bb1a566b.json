AP\n\nKanye West is opening up about his spiritual outlook, as well as some very personal requests he had for people working on his upcoming religious album.\n\nThe rapper discussed his musical and personal turn to Christianity, as well as the inspiration behind his upcoming album \"Jesus is King,\" due Friday, in an interview with DJ Zane Lowe on Apple Music Thursday.\n\n\"Now that I\u2019m in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me,\" West told Lowe during a nearly two-hour conversation.\n\nThey touched on many topics, including what went into making West's new album, which will debut along with an IMAX film of the same title.\n\nWest described how he wanted to make sure everyone working on \"Jesus is King\" was committed to the project.\n\n\"There were times when I was asking people to fast during the album,\" he said. \"This is gonna be radical what I'm about to say ... There were times when I was asking people to not have premarital sex while they were working on the album.\"\n\nKanye West's 'Jesus is King' inspires mosh pits, strong emotions at LA preview event\n\nIn addition to requesting people avoid premarital sex, West said there were \"times when I went to people that were working on other projects and said, 'Could you just work and focus on this?' \"\n\nHe added: \"I thought if we could all focus and fast, I mean it's known families that pray together stay together.\"\n\nKanye West drops 'Jesus Is King' film trailer; fans are not believers in release date\n\nIn a video clip of his interview with Lowe, the rapper described how being hospitalized gave him opportunity to reflect.\n\nIn 2016, reports emerged saying West had been hospitalized due to exhaustion. In subsequent interviews with TMZ and \"Breakfast Club\" radio host Charlamagne tha God in 2018, West discussed how liposuction, opioid use and his wife Kim Kardashian\u2019s Paris robbery contributed to a downward spiral that landed him in the hospital.\n\nKanye West: I was 'drugged out' on opioids leading up to 2016 hospitalization\n\n\"The most space that I had to think is when I went to the hospital,\" West told Lowe. \"One of the things that happened when I went to the hospital is I started reading the Bible and I started writing, copying out Bible verses, and a person came to my house that wasn\u2019t a Christian and told me come over, and 30 minutes later I was in handcuffs headed to the hospital.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Now this person very well may have saved my life because, when you\u2019re in an episode you could jump off the side of a balcony, you can stab your eye out ... You can do a lot of things when you\u2019re ramped up like that, but one of the things that people do now is they try to discriminate against my mind and my thoughts because of that moment.\"\n\nWest also described how his life has improved through religion.\n\n\"There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me. I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me,\" he said, \"But now I\u2019m letting you know what Jesus has done for me, and in that I\u2019m no longer a slave. I\u2019m a son now, a son of God. I\u2019m free.\"\n\nHere's every word of Kanye West's bizarre meeting with President Trump\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/24/kanye-west-asked-jesus-king-collaborators-avoid-premarital-sex/4090322002/", "description": "Kanye West revealed to Zane Lowe he asked people not to have premarital sex while working on \"Jesus is King.\"", "authors": ["Charles Trepany", "Published P.M.
