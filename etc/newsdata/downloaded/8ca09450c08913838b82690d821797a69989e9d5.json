That\u2019s a forgivable vanity, even for our current narcissist in chief. But it nearly led President Trump to make an unwise deal on Afghanistan with a Taliban that continues to use terror as its chief weapon.\n\nTrump\u2019s closest Republican allies, such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), have been warning him for weeks that the Afghanistan pact was a bridge too far. Graham was uncharacteristically critical of Trump in two recent interviews with me, arguing that the agreement that special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was negotiating with a still-unreconstructed Taliban would leave the U.S. homeland vulnerable to attack.\n\nBut Trump ordered Khalilzad to conclude the deal, and he added the surprise fillip of the Camp David signing. Perhaps the president is suffering from a case of Nobel Peace Prize-itis. (Didn\u2019t Barack Obama get one of those?) In Trump\u2019s negotiations with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and the Afghan Taliban (and his flirtation with Iran), he wants agreements \u2014 and he wants the personal photo opportunity, too.\n\nTrump backed out of this self-aggrandizing spectacle before it was too late. The problem wasn\u2019t simply that he would have been embracing Taliban leaders who have blood on their hands; that problem arises with most peace agreements between bitter combatants. No, the defect here was that the Taliban hasn\u2019t demonstrated that it was committed to breaking with its terrorist roots.\n\nI thought Trump said it pretty accurately in his Saturday night tweets scuttling the Camp David meeting after the Taliban had taken credit for a car bombing in Kabul that killed a U.S. soldier and 11 others. \u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? . . . If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks . . . then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.\u201d\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to Trump. Khalilzad has been pushing the Taliban to stop such bombings and demonstrate that it was willing to work with the Afghan government to reduce violence. The Taliban negotiators refused; they evidently believed that such terror tactics were their leverage. The past few weeks, Afghan sources tell me, they\u2019ve been holding what amounted to a victory party. Now those celebrations have been derailed.\n\n\u201cWe dodged a bullet here,\u201d Graham told me in an interview Monday. He described the planned Camp David meeting as \u201ctoo much, too soon,\u201d and said Trump \u201cmade the right call\u201d in canceling it.\n\nTrump has an opportunity now to reset the table in Afghanistan without committing any more U.S. troops \u2014 by increasing the political pressure on a Taliban whose terror tactics have backfired. The elections scheduled for later this month should go forward, and President Ashraf Ghani (whose position has been enhanced by Trump\u2019s newly stiffened spine) is likely to emerge with a stronger mandate. The Taliban will try to terrorize voters and disrupt the election, but that will only deepen its unpopularity with most Afghans.\n\nAfghanistan is a different country from the one the Taliban ruled until it was toppled by the U.S.-led campaign that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It\u2019s more urban, modern and connected than the hyper-traditional, tribal society that came before. Afghans want peace, but they have also wondered why Trump was negotiating with killers. The New York Times quoted a doctor who treated one of the victims of last week\u2019s car bombing: \u201cI\u2019d like to ask Mr. Trump why he didn\u2019t stop the peace talks after all those attacks when the Taliban killed so many civilians.\u201d\n\nA second way to enhance leverage against the Taliban is to strengthen U.S. ties with Pakistan by negotiating a free-trade agreement and greater security cooperation. Pakistan\u2019s duplicity \u2014 secretly supporting the Taliban even as it nominally endorsed the U.S. war against it \u2014 has been one of the root problems in the long Afghanistan war. It needs to be fixed.\n\nThere\u2019s an opportunity now for a reset: The current Pakistani leadership \u2014 Prime Minister Imran Khan and Army Chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa \u2014 might be the best potential partners the United States has had in years. It\u2019s time to test whether they can deliver. As Graham says, closer U.S. ties with Pakistan \u201cwould rattle the Taliban.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity for peace in Afghanistan is too precious to squander with a not-fully-baked, premature agreement. Just in time, Trump sent Khalilzad back to negotiate a better one. That spares Trump a Camp David embarrassment, but more important, it opens the way for a better peace pact that might really curb terrorism.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "His Camp David cancellation opens a door with Pakistan.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs", "September At Pm", "David Ignatius Writes A Twice-A-Week Foreign Affairs Column."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fLMWiXQGTefVmPcPxS7Dv_swSnM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ILKES7GLPMI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
