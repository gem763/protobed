The Dow Jones Industrials Index is full of companies that traditionally perform better in a consumer-based economic contraction for investors \u2013 which is why we believe the YM will present a very unique opportunity going forward for skilled traders.\n\nFAS DAILY CHART, THE DIREXION FINANCIAL BULL ETF\n\nThis first FAS Daily Chart, the Direxion Financial BULL ETF highlights the price channel in YELLOW and highlights the recent price rotation near the $80 price level which constitutes a potential \u201cnew lower high\u201d price rotation. Our longer-term cycle analysis tools predict a downside price move initiating over the next 7 to 10 trading days. We believe this new downside price trend could push price levels below the lower price channel level if this move is associated with external news or economic data that panics the markets.\n\nIWM, RUSSELL 2000 ETF, DAILY CHART\n\nThis IWM, Russell 2000 ETF, Daily chart highlights an \u201cisland Doji top\u201d formation that is setting up as a very unique price formation. When Doji type candles form with a gap above the previous bars, this is often considered an \u201cisland top\u201d type of formation. Doji candles represent indecision and uncertainty. They are often found near-critical top and bottom formation. In this current formation, we believe the island top formation is a very clear warning that a major price top is setting up in the Mid-Caps which would also be considered a \u201cnew failed price high\u201d formation. Ultimately, the $144.50 level becomes critical support if price falls.", "description": "As we near the end of October 2019, a very interesting price setup is taking place across many of the US market sectors recently. We only have a total of about seven trading days left in October 2019 and the Financial Sector ETF is rolling over with what appears to be an Engulfing Bearish price pattern", "authors": ["Chris Vermeulen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LcmCDl5oNgsay4STpadBtw--~B/aD00Mjk7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9dc337c9fd8844041bb72e9bb2d6137b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
