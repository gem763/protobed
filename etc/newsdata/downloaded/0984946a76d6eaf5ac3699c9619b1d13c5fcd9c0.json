In the hand-held section, we were treated to everything from chilli beef burgers through to lamb sheesh kebabs with pickled red cabbage and chipotle steak tacos with guacamole as well as pork banh mi.\n\nWe enjoyed that although everything was designed to be cooked on a BBQ, recipes are inspired from around the globe and rather than focusing on simple slabs of meat, recipes include instructions for every component of the dish \u2013 including marinades, dipping sauces and any accompanying veg it should be served with.\n\nPerhaps our favourite chapter was From The Sea, which includes treats such as tandoori sea bream, lobster rolls and Galician octopus. Photography is beautiful throughout, ending with chapters on cocktails, desserts (toasted marshmallow ice-cream anyone?) and brunch dishes including our favourite, smoked pork beans on toast.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Charred\u2019 by Genevieve Taylor, published by Quadrille: \u00a39.54, Amazon\n\nVeggies so often get a raw deal when it comes to barbecues. But with an ever-rising number of people choosing to shun meat, it seems silly that they should never get anything more exciting than a plate of halloumi or a dry veggie burger.\n\nCharred is an absolute treat of a book. Each and every recipe is suitable for vegetarians, making us completely rethink what it means to be a veggie during BBQ season. From the multitude of kebabs \u2013 Moroccan spiced aubergine and tomato with minted yoghurt dressing \u2013 to the low, slow and smoked parmesan parsnips with fennel butter and hazelnuts, there wasn\u2019t a dish we didn\u2019t fancy trying.\n\nInstead of one token veggie burger, there\u2019s an entire chapter, suggesting the likes of a white bean, grilled pepper mozzarella burger with fresh tomato relish that will have your meat-eating mates wanting in on the action. There are more than 70 recipes, all of which come with a photo and a helpful key that tells you how a recipe can be cooked \u2013 barbecue, griddle pan, frying pan or in the oven \u2013 which gives this book real longevity.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018The Barbecue\u2019 by Alex Hamilton, published by Harper Collins: \u00a314.99, Harper Collins\n\nThis clever little cookbook takes the BBQ foundations \u2013 think burgers, steak, chicken and ribs among others \u2013 and provides multiple marinades, salsas and salads to serve alongside them.\n\nVeggies and fish are given their own chapters so we didn\u2019t feel the book was too heavily weighted towards meat, which made for a refreshing change.\n\nIn place of starters, there\u2019s a section on skewers, which we\u2019d happily serve to our guests before the main course. There\u2019s even a BBQ dessert section that features griddled fruits and more chocolatey options too. If you\u2019re not sure how best to put everything together, the book finishes with a suggested combination of dishes to make the ultimate steak dinner or taco feast. In short, it really felt there was something for everyone without anything being overly complicated to prepare.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018The Burger Book\u2019 by Christian Stevenson aka DJ BBQ, published by Quadrille: \u00a36.82 Amazon\n\nThis little book of burgers talks you through every element of what makes an exceptional burger.
