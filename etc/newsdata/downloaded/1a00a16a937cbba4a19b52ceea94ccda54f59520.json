The trio must work together to figure out how to stop the invasion from taking over the planet.\n\n\"You won't look at so much as a houseplant the same way again,\" said HarperCollins editor Suzanne Sutherland in a press release.\n\nThe first novel in the trilogy, Bloom, will be followed by Hatch in September 2020 and Thrive in May 2021.\n\nOppel is a bestselling author whose books include the Silverwing trilogy, which has sold over a million copies worldwide, and Airborn, winner of the Governor General's Literary Award. His most recent books include Inkling, Every Hidden Thing and The Nest.\n\nRead an excerpt from the opening of Bloom below.\n\nAir tumbled into the helicopter as the soldier shoved the door open. Anaya looked down at the island's rocky slope. She spotted a scrawny goat standing on a boulder, and then they were over forest, the helicopter's shadow flashing across treetops.\n\nImpatiently, she searched for a break in the tree line. A marshland, a lake \u2014 that's where they'd find Dad.\n\nHer insides gave a twist when she remembered how he'd looked on the video call. His wild, dirt-streaked face. The things he'd said.\n\nCan't get off...\n\nThey're everywhere...\n\nAbove the pounding of the helicopter's rotors, the soldier shouted, \"I'm not seeing any lake!\"\n\nNeither was Anaya. Her eyes skittered anxiously across the forest.\n\nAnd then the helicopter dropped suddenly, like something was yanking it from below.\n\n\"Thought you said you knew where this place was.\" The soldier sounded testy.\n\n\"I do. It's sort of bean-shaped. I've seen pictures.\"\n\n\"You said you'd been there.\"\n\n\"It was awhile ago.\" Years ago, actually, when she was just five. \"It's on the northeast end of the island,\" she said.\n\n\"Should've seen it by now,\" the soldier told her. \"This place isn't that big.\"\n\n\"It can't have just disappeared!\" Anaya said firmly.\n\n\"One more circle,\" the soldier told the pilots over his headset.\n\nAnaya shook her head in frustration. \"It should be right here!\"\n\n\"All I see are trees,\" said the soldier.\n\nAnaya stared down, then stared harder. Cold electricity prickled across her skin. \"Those aren't trees,\" she said.\n\nAnd then the helicopter dropped suddenly, like something was yanking it from below.\n\nFrom Bloom by Kenneth Oppel \u00a92020.
