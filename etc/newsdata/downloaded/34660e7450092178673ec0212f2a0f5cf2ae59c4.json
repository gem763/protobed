The National Weather Service issued a total of 43 tornado warnings across both states, with the threat of tornadoes lasting into the night.\n\nAt least two deaths have so far been reported on the US mainland, in Florida and North Carolina, as a result of the storm, both involving men who fell while making preparations against the storm.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre has predicted Dorian will pass near or over the Outer Banks on Friday, lashing the thin line of islands off the US coast.\n\nOver Labour Day weekend, the Bahamas was pummelled with Category 5 winds up to 185 mph for more than 20 hours.\n\nRead more\n\nAerial footage shows 'unprecedented' destruction of Bahamas\n\nHubert Minnis, the Bahamas\u2019 prime minister, said the devastating destruction caused by the storm was \"one of the greatest national crises in our country's history\".\n\nThe storm weakened earlier this week before strengthening again late on Wednesday.\n\nAbout 830,000 people have been put under mandatory evacuation orders in South Carolina alone.\n\nPatrick Dowling, a spokesman for the port city of Charleston, said the hurricane had spun off at least one tornado in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, damaging several homes.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nHundreds of shelter animals from coastal South Carolina were transported to Delaware from areas at risk of flooding ahead of the storm\n\nThe News Journal newspaper in Wilmington, Delaware, said 200 animals were airlifted early on Tuesday and about 150 more were expected to arrive via land.\n\nIn Georgia, hundreds of thousands of people were ordered off the Georgia coast \u2013 although the mayor of Tybee Island, a small beach community on the coast, said little damage had been inflicted overnight by Dorian.\n\nMayor Jason Buelterman said the storm spared the 3,000 residents from flooding as high tide was about 3 feet lower than expected.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\n\"If the worst that comes out of this is people blame others for calling evacuations, then that's wonderful,\" Mr Buelterman said.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Aerial footage shows 'unprecedented' destruction of Bahamas\n\nPete Buttigieg calls Trump\u2019s fake Hurricane Dorian map 'pathetic'\n\nAerial footage shows impact of Hurricane Dorian on Abaco Islands\n\nDeath toll in Bahamas reaches 20 and is expected to rise", "description": "At least one tornado has swept through South Carolina as up to three million people were warned to evacuate from the possible path of a re-energised Hurricane Dorian as it pounded the US southeast coast.Authorities warned of the potential for deadly floods, record rainfall and a path of destruction across", "authors": ["Chris Riotta", "Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4cstJ0VaVCYs6UEZBrNqUg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/824f7d3db7d9dbc86cea493582b1523d", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
