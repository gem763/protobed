Unfortunately, this is just the latest example of Trump claiming the mantle of anti-war president, while instituting policies that actually encourage the killing of civilians.\n\nTrump\u2019s calls for an end to American involvement in armed conflicts are a far cry from what he\u2019s actually done as Commander-in-Chief. He has only expanded the so-called \u201cwar on terror,\u201d bombing everywhere from Somalia to Libya to Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan, all while deliberately making U.S. actions far more brutal for the people living in these countries.", "description": "Trump calls himself the anti-war president, but his policies are killing civilians.", "authors": ["Daphne Eviatar"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_844,w_1500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571886165/191023-Eviatar-Trump-tease-small_nl7qkb", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
