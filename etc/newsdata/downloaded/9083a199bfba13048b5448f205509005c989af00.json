Trump\u2019s declaration followed a series of violent attacks in the Afghan capital that killed several people, including a U.S. soldier.\n\nDuring their meeting Monday, Khan called on all sides in Afghanistan\u2019s protracted war to reduce the violence.\n\nCivilian casualties have been rising fast in recent months, according to the United Nations which blames both insurgents and U.S. and Afghan government security forces. So far this year there have been more than 8,000 casualties.\n\nFor the first time the United Nations reported earlier this year that U.S. and Afghan security forces killed more civilians than insurgents.\n\nKhan said in a statement that it was \u201cimportant for all sides to take practical steps for the reduction of violence in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s political spokesman Suhail Shaheen said Saturday that if the United States signs the agreement Trump declared dead there will be a cease-fire first with U.S. and NATO troops followed by a negotiated cease-fire with Afghan Security Forces.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. returns to the negotiation table and signs the agreement then there will be a cease-fire and reduction of violence,\u201d Shaheen said.\n\nKhalilzad arrived in Pakistan from Afghanistan, where he met with leaders including President Ashraf Ghani, who has mostly dismissed any talks not led by his government.\n\nBut Afghanistan\u2019s leadership has just come out of a presidential election that has been marred by allegations of corruption and fraud and nearly a month after Afghans went to the polls, in seemingly low numbers, no results have been released. Preliminary results are now expected on Nov. 14.\n\nGhani and his current partner in a so-called unity government, Abdullah Abddullah, are the leading contenders for president. The two men jointly lead Afghanistan\u2019s unity government cobbled together by the U.S. after the 2014 presidential elections were so deeply flawed a clear winner could not be determined.\n\nBefore his stop in Afghanistan, Khalilzad was in Moscow meeting with Chinese and Russian representatives as well as holding yet another meeting with Pakistani officials.\n\nFollowing that meeting a statement was released calling for all sides to reduce violence and get back to talking about finding a peaceful end to a devastatingly long war.", "description": "ISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 Washington's Afghan peace envoy remained in Pakistan on Tuesday as part of efforts to find a negotiated end to Afghanistan's 18 -year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/6b9404_afghanistan-peace-talks-10346-zalmay-khalilzad-in-feb-2019-file-photo-special-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
