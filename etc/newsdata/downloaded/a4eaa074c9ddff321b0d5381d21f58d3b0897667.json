Tom Watson, the deputy leader, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, are among those pushing for a referendum to be the priority, but Jeremy Corbyn and his team insist an election must come first.\n\nMr Corbyn is expected to face a major rebellion from his MPs if he agrees to Boris Johnson's plan for an early referendum, without first having guaranteed a Brexit referendum.\n\nSir Keir's claim that another public poll is the \"only\" solution will be seen as him siding with other shadow cabinet ministers warning that an election before a referendum could lead to Britain crashing out of the EU.\n\nSpeaking at the Co-operative Party conference in Glasgow, Sir Keir said: \"Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit, but of course we have to recognise, important though that is, preventing a no deal Brexit is not an end in itself.\n\n\"It won\u2019t break the deadlock, it won\u2019t allow the country to move on. After three and a half long years of failed promises, failed deals and Tory divisions, there is only one way out: put it to the people.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured, or whether they wouldn\u2019t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say. It is only by asking the people that we can draw a line under this.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
