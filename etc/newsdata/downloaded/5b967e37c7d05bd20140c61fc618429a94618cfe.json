Anywhere from 50 to 80 miles an hour,\" Correa told KTVX-TV.\n\nIn the dashboard video, lights from the front of a train can be seen growing brighter as it gets closer.\n\nThe video shows Correa reaching the car and tugging on a person in the vehicle. Correa said later during the news interview that the driver was unconscious.\n\n\"Let's go! Get out of here! We've got a train coming! We've got a train coming!\" he can be heard yelling desperately as the train sounds its horn. \"We've got a train coming!\"\n\nWith just seconds before the train struck the vehicle, dragging it along the tracks, Correa could be seen pulling the man's body from the car. The two tumbled down the embankment and rolled into a fence. The train could be seen stopping.\n\n\"Come on! Come on!\" Correa tells the man, who has started to move and walk, as the two try to get away from the train.\n\n\"I got the driver out,\" he can be heard saying on his radio.\n\nCorrea estimated that the car had been thrown about 30 feet in front of him and the driver.\n\n\"I was within seconds of that collision. Maybe just a second later it would have been a different outcome,\" he said.\n\nKTVX-TV said there were no known injuries to the driver or to those on the train. Correa said it appeared that the driver of the vehicle, who has not been identified, had been suffering an \"unknown medical condition.\"\n\nHe said the driver was grateful for being rescued and a little confused about the incident. As for Correa, he said he was just doing his job.\n\n\"I'm still trying to process everything that happened,\" Correa said. \"I\u2019m just very grateful I was able to get him out alive. He's back with his family now.\"", "description": "Utah Trooper Ruben Correa said he was just doing his job when he was seen on dashboard video pulling a man from a car stuck on tracks right before a train hit it.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
