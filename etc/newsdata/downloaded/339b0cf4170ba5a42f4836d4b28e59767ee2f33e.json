There are three things Beto and his fans would like to see by the end of this year. One, obviously, is him becoming the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Next is him conceding defeat in the presidential race but swooping into Texas with the party enthusiastically behind him for a Senate rematch, this time with John Cornyn. And if neither of those things are in the cards, there\u2019s always the third option \u2014 some sort of meaningful gun-control reform in Congress to move the left\u2019s agenda forward, however incrementally.\n\nHe may have screwed himself on all three last week at the debate when he warned Americans he was coming for their assault rifles. His polling hasn\u2019t budged so he hasn\u2019t helped himself any towards winning the nomination. An aggressive gun-confiscation plan is obviously \u2026 problematic in his home state of Texas, such that O\u2019Rourke may now be seen by local Democrats as damaged goods. And for the past week he\u2019s had senators on both sides of the aisle who have been trying to midwife a compromise on background checks insisting that he\u2019s done more harm than good by spooking righties into not giving an inch on new regulations.\n\nNow here comes the president to inform the world that, yes, Beto may have killed a gun-control bargain.\n\nDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal. Convinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away. Will continue forward! https://t.co/87jvaYUkyn \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nDiehard O\u2019Rourke fans might argue that there\u2019s actually a fourth possible good outcome from this mess, namely that the buzz over Beto\u2019s call for a mandatory buyback program might end up pressuring the eventual Democratic nominee into being bolder on gun control next year. It\u2019s true that polls have showed broad support within the party for the idea, but most of the presidential field has kept its distance from the plan. Pete Buttigieg even anticipated Trump\u2019s critique, accusing O\u2019Rourke of potentially wrecking chances of a deal in Congress. The top tier of Biden, Warren, and Sanders have each kept their heads down about it. Only Cory Booker and the increasingly desperate Kamala Harris, both of whom are polling in the low to mid-single digits, backed O\u2019Rourke. The eventual nominee might conclude that the politics of this issue are just too dicey to go all-in the way Beto has. And if compromise efforts in Congress collapse, Beto himself may end up sharing the blame with Trump, damaging his chances to be a Democratic standard-bearer down the road in Texas.\n\nI mean, that\u2019s some own-goal. Imagine wrecking your entire political future with one debate answer. Short of saying, \u201cI support ISIS,\u201d it\u2019s almost impossible.\n\nIn fairness, Trump is probably scapegoating O\u2019Rourke here for his own reluctance to make a deal, knowing that he\u2019s bound to royally piss off one side or the other no matter what he does. But there might be a deal on the table anyway: The Daily Caller is reporting that Bill Barr has been shopping a White House proposal on expanded background checks to members of Congress. If I\u2019m reading the fact sheet correctly, it\u2019s basically Toomey/Manchin \u2014 all commercial sales, but not private sales, would now be required to undergo checks \u2014 except unlicensed commercial sellers wouldn\u2019t be required to report the name of buyers to the federal government. That\u2019s the White House\u2019s way of trying to reassure gun-rights supporters that this won\u2019t lead to a federal registry.\n\nThis is the broad outline of the background-checks proposal that the White House and Bill Barr are giving Republicans on the Hill. Document, first reported by @amber_athey, here: pic.twitter.com/BLS5bfGIjD \u2014 Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 18, 2019\n\nAn interesting detail from the Caller:\n\nOne source familiar with the meetings said that Barr pitched the legislation by warning that a lack of action could electrify the Democratic base prior to the 2020 election. Barr also did not consider the background check legislation a gun control measure, instead painting it as a tool to assist law enforcement in cracking down on gun smugglers, the source explained.\n\nThe president likes Barr a lot thanks to his handling of Russiagate. If Barr\u2019s telling him that expanding background checks is no big deal, that\u2019s significant. The problem with negotiating with Trump, though, is that he\u2019s apt to change his mind repeatedly depending upon whom he\u2019s talked to last. Everyone remembers that gun-control summit he held with members of both parties in the White House last year, where he sounded like he\u2019d be willing to sign anything they could agree on. Later, after Wayne LaPierre and his friends at Fox had gotten done talking to him, he was firmly pro-Second-Amendment again. In fact, White House aides are *already* hedging on the document that Barr is showing to people. Supposedly, spokesman Hogan Gidley is telling reporters that Trump hasn\u2019t committed to it.\n\nSo imagine now that you\u2019re Cory Gardner, facing reelection in a purple state and verrrrry nervous about having to cast a tough vote on gun control. Here comes Bill Barr to pitch you on a version of Toomey/Manchin. What do you do when you still can\u2019t be sure what Trump will do? The president\u2019s own AG is showing you a plan that the president may support today but might not support tomorrow after Tucker Carlson or Hannity or whoever gives him an earful about it on the phone tonight. If you commit to voting for it and then Trump turns around and says, \u201cOnly gun-grabbing cucks would vote for this!\u201d, suddenly all the Trumpers in Colorado will think you\u2019re a RINO. If you decide to oppose it in the expectation that Trump will oppose it too, suddenly everyone who supports expanded background checks \u2014 which is 90 percent of the country \u2014 is mad at you instead. Republicans need clarity from Trump here but they\u2019re not getting it, as usual.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, here\u2019s a new ad for, uh \u2026 see, it\u2019s about \u2026 well, just watch.
