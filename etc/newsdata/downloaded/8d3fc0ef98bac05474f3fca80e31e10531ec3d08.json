Will Hurd\u2019s \u201ctough seat\u201d in Texas.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to continue to be able to be the very best \u2014 new individuals, new ideas, and new energy is what really we need,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McCarthy gave a long list of issues his party plans running on, including pushing for stronger border laws and the continued high cost of health care.\n\nShould Republicans retake the House in 2020, Mr. McCarthy said their first priority would be tackling the rising debt, after news broke Thursday that the national deficit passed $1 trillion this month.\n\nMr. McCarthy defended the GOP\u2019s role in the mounting debt, arguing that while mandatory spending rose, they tried to limit discretionary spending.\n\n\u201cSo not only am I fearful that the debt is out of control, because every society has collapsed when they\u2019ve overextended themselves, I watched the Democrats expand it further,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
