The Kurdish-led militias, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, said they had only partially completed their withdrawal from an area that stretches roughly 70 miles along Turkey\u2019s border, and 20 miles deep into Syrian territory.\n\nMervan Qamishlo, an SDF spokesman, blamed what he said were ongoing attacks by Turkey and allied forces for the delay and said Kurdish-led forces had withdrawn only from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt seems that Turkey is not serious about the agreement,\u201d he said in a text message on Tuesday morning. \u201cUntil now, there is no withdrawal from other areas.\u201d\n\nOne of Putin\u2019s other difficult tasks is to broker an accommodation between Erdogan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who have been adversaries throughout Syria\u2019s eight-year civil war. Russia has used its military power to help Assad beat back the Syrian rebellion and is trying to ensure that his government regains control over the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe Russian military cannot give permission for the Turkish forces to either stay or leave the Syrian territory. Only the legitimate government of the Syrian Arab Republic can do that,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a press briefing in Sochi.\n\nAD\n\nErdogan\u2019s desire for a \u201csafe zone,\u201d stretching across much of northern Syria, complicates that plan. Assad, during a visit Tuesday to his troops in Syria\u2019s northern Idlib province, called Erdogan \u201ca thief\u201d who has stolen Syrian land.\n\nAD\n\nPutin\u2019s role as Syria\u2019s central power broker was bolstered after the Trump administration announced it was withdrawing its remaining troops from the north. The announcement \u2014 shortly after Erdogan spoke with Trump earlier this month \u2014 cleared the way for the Turkish offensive against the SDF, the main U.S. military partner fighting the Islamic State militant group.\n\nA large convoy of U.S. military vehicles left Syria on Monday and crossed the Iraqi border. The convoy was heckled in places by Kurds who accused the United States of betrayal, and hurled rocks and vegetables at the vehicles.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Iraq\u2019s military said the newly arrived U.S. forces would have to withdraw from the country. \u201cThere is no agreement for these forces to stay in Iraq,\u201d a military statement said.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said the arriving troops would not remain in Iraq \u201cinterminably\u201d and that the aim was to eventually get them home. The details would be worked out in discussions with Iraqi officials, he said during a visit to an air base in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAD\n\nDadouch reported from Beirut.
