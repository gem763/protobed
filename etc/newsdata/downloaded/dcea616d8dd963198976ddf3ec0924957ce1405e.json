The application, focused on providing an early warning of production downtime and operational risk, is called BHC3 Reliability.\n\n\n\nC3.ai and Baker Hughes forged a joint venture in June to advance machine learning and artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry. Baker Hughes is majority owned by GE, which has a platform called Predix and competes with C3 on some levels.\n\nUnder the joint venture:\n\nBaker Hughes GE took a minority equity position in C3.ai;\n\nBaker Hughes GE plans to accelerate its use of C3 AI Suite;\n\nC3.ai leverages BHGE's existing digital portfolio;\n\nAnd the companies will target customers such as Shell.\n\nPrimers: What is AI? | What is machine learning? | What is deep learning? | What is artificial general intelligence? | Analytics, digital twins separate pack in industrial IoT, says Forrester\n\n\n\nBHC3 Reliability uses machine learning models to identify anomalous conditions that can upend equipment and processes. The applications alerts operators to take action to prevent downtime. BHC3 Reliability aggregates and analyzes data from sensor networks, enterprise systems, maintenance notes and information from piping and other infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe application also applies to offshore and onshore production platforms, refineries, ptetrochemical plants and other infrastructure.\n\n\n\nBHC3 Reliability was built on C3's AI Suite as well as Baker Hughes industry knowhow and expertise.\n\n\n\nAI and machine learning firms and cloud computing vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have been targeting the oil and gas industry for its deep pockets and rich data sets.", "description": "3.ai and Baker Hughes forged a joint venture to advance machine learning and artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/13/69419122-0b57-40ba-a4d3-bf54810f7652/thumbnail/770x578/cf12d2097c4840683200f7b2328dab57/oil-refinery.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
