We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government; TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future,\" it said.\n\nThe firm operates a similar but separate version of the app in China, known as Douyin.\n\nTikTok said all US user data is stored in the United States, with a backup in Singapore.\n\n\"Our data centres are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law.\"\n\nThe fast-growing social media app has about 500 million regular users, though TikTok doesn't disclose its user base.
