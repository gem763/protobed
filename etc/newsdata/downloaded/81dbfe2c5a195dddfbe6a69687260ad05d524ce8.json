Theresa May never was.'\n\nTheresa May told the government that Boris Johnson's proposed points-based immigration sustem was 'not an answer' to controlling immigration\n\nMrs May said there were 'many' draft laws set out in the Queen's Speech worthy of praise.\n\nBut turning to immigration, she said one of the challenges she faced when she became home secretary in 2010 was abuse which had arisen in the immigration system - something she claimed was 'largely enabled' by Labour's 'points-based immigration system'.\n\nShe continued: 'So, it is possible that the Home Office has come up, the best brains have come up, with the best scheme.\n\n'But I would simply urge the Home Secretary and the Home Office to look very carefully at the lessons which have been learned in the past in relation to points-based systems which, in themselves, are not an answer to controlling immigration and can allow abuse to take place.'\n\nThe Australian immigration system upon which the UK's new system will be based was designed to allow people into the country who the government believes will contribute to the economy and fill skills shortages.\n\nMr Johnson has vowed to end freedom of movement and roll out a new Australian-style immigration system from 2021\n\nSkilled worker visas are available to people if they score enough points across a number of categories in a points-based assessment with 60 the magic number.\n\nOne of the key categories is age, with all applicants having to be under 50.\n\nYounger applicants are automatically awarded 30 points while those approaching the age of 50 get zero, making it much harder for them to be accepted.\n\nThe UK government is also considering awarding bonus points in the application process if they are willing to live outside of London.\n\nMrs May questioned the viability of rolling out what she described as 'regional visas'.\n\n'I would urge my right honourable friend to look very carefully at how that can operate logistically, because it has some very real challenges,' she said.", "description": "Mr Johnson unveiled draft legislation in the Queen's Speech this week which would end freedom of movement to the UK and introduce a new, purely merit based system from 2021.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19791848-0-image-a-59_1571237676108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
