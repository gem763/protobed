Before him were two paths, a highway through town or a bypass around it\u2014which one shall we build, the city asked? Marohn, a planner and engineer, was startled by what he saw. Every road led to civic suicide, either losing money or surrendering to the state\u2019s control. He began modeling dozens of other streets, including his own\u2014none of them could be built from their own tax base, let alone repaired.\n\nWhat followed for Marohn was \u201csix years in the intellectual wilderness\u201d whereupon the revelation came on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis: \u201cthe more our cities build, the poorer they become.\u201d From this insight emerged a grassroots media network and now a book, Strong Towns: A Bottom-Up Revolution to Rebuild American Prosperity. It distills years of writing on how communities of all sizes can draw on the \u201cspooky wisdom\u201d of the past to become solvent and resilient.\n\nMarohn wasn\u2019t always a prophet or a revolutionary. As a municipal engineer in his hometown of Brainerd, Minnesota, he helped lay the roads, pipes, and wires to sustain the booming 1990s. \u201cI built sprawl,\u201d he once confessed. Every new mile was to be paid for by the next mile\u2019s promised growth. Yet somehow their dollars always fell short of their debts.\n\nWhat he began to see was an America living in a post-World War II experiment to pour trillions of dollars into new homes and highways for the middle class. Gone were the small steps of man; this was one giant leap for mankind. We drove this growth machine out from old downtowns to shiny new suburbs, and when they faded we fashioned new rings of neighborhoods. On and on we went, easy money rolling out new towns preserved by regulation in their finished, \u201cperfect\u201d state.\n\nIn one example, in 1949, the city of Lafayette, Louisiana, had five feet of underground pipe per person. By 2015, each resident claimed 50 feet of pipe, a growth of 1,000 percent. The number of fire hydrants per thousand residents grew by 2,140 percent over the same period. Yet median household income grew by just 160 percent from 1949, while personal savings fell and debt ballooned. Today, Lafayette has one dollar of taxable wealth for every two dollars spent in public investment.\n\nThis is why America\u2019s experiment in sprawl has failed, in Marohn\u2019s view. His judgement is not of markets, but math. \u201cNew growth provides local governments an opportunity to receive additional cash in the short term in exchange for taking on unpayable, long-term liabilities,\u201d which in turn can only be paid for by yet more outward growth. City leaders are often so desperate to cover their \u201cMunicipal Ponzi Scheme\u201d that they throw tax subsidies at \u201cshiny and new\u201d fast-food joints and strip malls whose value per acre is a fraction of what the \u201cold and blighted\u201d blocks boasted. And in the end, it\u2019s the public that pays for private overreach.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t more cities gone belly up? For one thing, state and federal government largesse has long helped paper over local financial shortfalls. And for another, infrastructure is accounted as an asset, not a liability. \u201cWith this approach, the more roads a city has, the more pipes in the ground, the more public buildings and pumps in its inventory, the richer that city is. It\u2019s backward.\u201d\n\nAmerica is, in short, becoming Detroit. Our decline will, like all bankruptcies, happen slowly and then all at once, in Marohn\u2019s view. The signs are there, for those with eyes to see. Take any big city in America today and watch as growth becomes a zero-sum equation, with battles over the protected classes of renter and homeowner alike\u2014as the NIMBYs cry \u201cNot In My Backyard!\u201d There is now a \u201cmalaise that creeps across society,\u201d Marohn writes, and somewhere Jimmy Carter smiles.\n\nThere is something very American about these fears. Every generation since this country\u2019s founding has worried that we are on an \u201cunsustainable economic path\u201d whose fiscal sins we will pay for, one way or another. The fact that Marohn is writing after the 2008 recession makes these fears all the more salient. This impression of Americana is aided by Marohn\u2019s folksy writing style, sprinkled with homespun wisdom and timeless truths.\n\nAmerica has always been saved by its frontier, and when one closed another opened; first the West, then the industrial city, and now followed by the suburb and the gentrifying urban neighborhood. These American frontiers are closed now, and there is little chance of going back. But Strong Towns still answer to the past. What this democracy of the dead gifts us is a certain small-c conservative vision of society emergent from a complex order, an arrangement that we barely understand and therefore must respect. For the first time in our nation\u2019s history, by this light, the frontier starts at our front porch.\n\n***\n\nIf, dear reader, you are looking for a grand solution or big idea from Charles Marohn, you will be sorely disappointed. The Strong Towns book is bereft of the hard data or models that we moderns delight in. You will not find out, for instance, how many cities are functionally insolvent and by how much. As this is a book built from the bottom-up\u2014over years of observations poured into blog posts\u2014it reads more as a series of insights strung together by an ethos, a belief. To tell towns what to do would be to deny them the bottom-up innovation they will need to minimize risks and maximize their strengths. \u201cBuilding a prosperous America is a hyper-local undertaking,\u201d and this is the heart of the Strong Towns approach.\n\nNevertheless, Charles Marohn gives readers rules of thumb to govern their towns. The greatest of these is profit: every community must operate in the black, with wealth exceeding liabilities and revenues surpassing expenses. Every dollar of public infrastructure liability must be backed by 20 to 40 dollars of private wealth. And the best way to determine if a new investment will sustain its infrastructure is measuring its projected value per acre. Even better, put infrastructure to the market test; if a public project costing a million dollars can easily recoup that sum (and more) through tolls, value capture, or some other levy on its actual users, all the better.\n\nMarohn further calls for \u201ctriage\u201d on infrastructure, starting with fixing up and maintaining the roads, sidewalks, pipes, and wires in high-value-added neighborhoods, which are invariably the older ones closer to the core. \u201cWe\u2019re done adding new infrastructure,\u201d he proclaims, though just how politically feasible such a proclamation will be remains an open question. Nevertheless, to the cycles of growth, stagnation, and decline afflicting America\u2019s cities, Marohn would like to add another: renewal.\n\nYet too many neighborhoods are sealed in regulatory amber. Zoning codes do not allow places to naturally, incrementally evolve, let alone renew or reinvent themselves. So Marohn proposes a modest form of the pro-growth faction known as YIMBYism: for the next increment of development in a neighborhood to be allowed \u201cby right, but no more.\u201d That is, a single-family home should be able to add an accessory dwelling unit or convert to a duplex without any special approvals or conditions. Allowing such evolution in our regulatory code should be true for businesses too, whether it\u2019s the brewery struggling to renovate an old warehouse or a food truck seeking to vend in a vacant lot.\n\nSuch reforms will be hard to achieve because the will of local governments to survive is greater than the desire for their own towns to endure. Which is why Marohn concludes with a simple plea for subsidiarity: \u201cInstead of policies, how about talking to your neighbor?\u201d Decisions should be devolved to the \u201csmallest, lowest, or least-centralized level of decision-making\u201d that can competently handle a decision. Of course, such subsidiarity runs against the liberal individualism that entrusts our communities and markets to lawyers and regulators; liberalism demotes our neighbors or family, enriching economic man whilst starving the social animal.\n\nStrong Towns is then, perhaps unwittingly, written for a post-liberal moment questioning the atomism, materialism, short-termism, and civic infantilism that is the corrosive logic of our age. Every ideal of stability and tradition extolled by Marohn is a gift of our pre-modern or unchosen inheritances, as Patrick Deneen\u2019s Why Liberalism Failed has written and Alexis de Tocqueville cautioned before him. Strong Towns also then risks catching the ill afflicting liberalism\u2019s critics; that is, its specific cures are rarely cited or risk being worse than the liberal disease.\n\nWhich is why Charles Marohn concludes that redemption for America\u2019s towns must ultimately well up from some vision of the common good, one that historically has only come from religious roots. As a professed Catholic, Marohn writes that while he would never \u201cseek to structure my city to reinforce Catholic practices,\u201d he sees how \u201cit\u2019s clear that as our religiosity fades, there is no cultural structure providing equivalent meaning and guidance for our lives.\u201d Somehow then, we must still \u201cbind us together as people\u201d in the pursuit not of consumption but of virtue. It is the \u201cburden\u201d of every strong town, Marohn believes, and \u201cit\u2019s also our path to salvation.\u201d\n\nNo prophet is welcomed in his hometown. But if Marohn\u2019s message of financial strength and resilience resonates in this time and place, it is because we feel something is deeply amiss in the American experiment, and that a solution is to be found somewhere at home. Strong Towns is a conservative vision for community that has not been tried and found wanting, but found difficult and left untried. It\u2019s time we tried.\n\nMichael Hendrix is director of state and local policy at the Manhattan Institute. This New Urbanism series is supported by the Richard H.
