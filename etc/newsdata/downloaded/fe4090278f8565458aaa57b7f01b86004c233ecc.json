REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nIt was hard to pick which was weighing on sentiment more in early European trading. The pound was yanked down to $1.2850 from $1.30 GBP= after UK lawmakers put the brakes on the government's Brexit plans again on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe\u2019s tech sector .SX8P fell 1.4%. STMicroelectronics (STM.MI), Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) and Infineon (IFXGn.DE) all dropped after Texas Instruments slumped 10% (TXN.O) in after-hours Wall Street trading.\n\nMajor Asian chipmakers, including Taiwan\u2019s TSMC (2330.TW) and South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix (000660.KS), had fallen on worries the industry was being squeezed both by a downturn in global demand and by the U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\u201cWhen there are tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious. And they pull back,\u201d Rafael Lizardi, Texas Instruments\u2019 chief financial officer, said after the company\u2019s results.\n\nWith investors seeking out safer assets again, the Japanese yen climbed to a one-week high of 108.25 per dollar JPY= and the Swiss franc CHF= gained early in Europe. [FRX/]\n\nAdam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said Brexit was driving a \u201cgeneral risk-off tone\u201d. Others pointed to the growing likelihood UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would now push for a snap election.\n\n\u201cThings could change very quickly today, depending on the EU response,\u201d Cole said, referring to how long EU leaders would extend the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. But he added he didn\u2019t see \u201cmuch downside\u201d risk for sterling now, with a no-deal Brexit off the table.\n\nThe pound has surged 4.5% this month which, if it holds the gains, will be its best month since January last year.\n\nReceding worries about a no-deal Brexit also underpinned the euro at $1.1122 EUR=, just below a two-month high of $1.1180.\n\nThe dollar was subdued before a Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, where policymakers are expected to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage point.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices fell after data showed U.S. crude inventories grew more than expected last week. But prices generally held firm after China signalled hopes for progress in upcoming trade talks with the United States and OPEC and its allies considered deeper cuts in production.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 0.52% to $59.39 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 lost 0.81% to $54.04 per barrel.", "description": "World stock markets fell on Wednesday, as hopes faded that a Brexit deal would be wrapped by next week and a profit warning from Texas Instruments pulled down tech shares.", "authors": ["Marc Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444052277&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0ND", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
