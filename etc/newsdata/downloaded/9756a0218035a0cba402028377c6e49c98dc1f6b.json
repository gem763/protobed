I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u2018I loved mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese, cheese toasties and cheese and pasta, but it didn\u2019t love me. I\u2019d eat things like pasta, bread and cheese-based meals several times a week because it was quick, cheap and convenient.\n\n\u2018But now I know these foods weren\u2019t agreeing with me at all.\n\n\u2018For me, I\u2019m able to function better at work. I can focus more and I\u2019m not as tired and brain foggy after eating lunch, which is huge for me.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have to worry about a small headache turning into something crippling.\u2019\n\nFor Leia, a substance called \u2018tyramine\u2019 \u2013 which can be found in certain cheeses such as cheddar, Stilton and camembert \u2013 as well as cured meats, can also be problematic.\n\nEven in her teens, she endured migraines so agonising that she\u2019d often be reduced to tears.\n\nLeia coped by taking high-dose painkillers before attempting to sleep it off, sometimes for 24 hours or more, but the migraines continued.\n\n\u2018My family started to worry it was something more serious, especially when several of my \u201cattacks\u201d would last well over a couple days, at their worst,\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018One of my great uncles passed away from a brain tumour and had a lot of severe headaches before being diagnosed \u2013 that\u2019s something that stuck with me when I was feeling unwell.\n\n\u2018More recently, an attack came on just as I was leaving work.\n\n\u2018I was helpless. I was in my car at the time and had the worst driving experience I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 to the point I had to pull over and stop after nearly crashing.\n\n\u2018It was awful. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it home.\u2019\n\nShe was suffering from crippling headaches (Picture: Leia Harrison /SWNS)\n\nIt\u2019s thought that around six million people in the UK suffer from migraines.\n\nThe condition made headlines last month after the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said a revolutionary new migraine drug \u2013 Erenumab \u2013 would not be made available to NHS patients outside of Scotland.\n\nThis decision has been attacked by charities, with The Migraine Trust labelling it a \u2018very bad day for chronic migraine patients\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole host of potential \u2018triggers\u2019, according to the NHS, including stress, depression, tiredness, poor posture, dehydration, changes in climate or very cold temperatures.\n\nIt\u2019s said that diet can also play a key role \u2013 with alcohol, caffeine, chocolate and common citrus fruit all potential culprits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Hart, scientific director at YorkTest Laboratories, said: \u2018There\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all as your diet is unique to you.\n\n\u2018So, it\u2019s crucial to understand your own food intolerances and the effects it may have on your life.\n\n\u2018The prevention of migraines can be problematic. It\u2019s important sufferers realise how diet can play a role, particularly for those where medicines are not eliminating the issue.\u2019\n\nMORE: Girl designs Christmas cards to raise money for accessible room for disabled brother\n\nMORE: Autistic man unable to communicate about his distressing eczema finds relief in \u00a34 moisturiser\n\nMORE: The health dangers of not getting enough sunlight\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Woman ditches dairy after suffering chronic migraines, thinking it could be due to her diet.
