A move which would make the scholarships subject to taxation.\n\nIf college athletes are going to make money off their likenesses while in school, their scholarships should be treated like income. I\u2019ll be introducing legislation that subjects scholarships given to athletes who choose to \u201ccash in\u201d to income taxes. https://t.co/H7jXC0dNls \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) October 29, 2019\n\nThe new NCAA rule is unlikely to impact a large majority of college athletes, considering there\u2019s only a relatively small percentage who have enough face and name notoriety to gain endorsements. Though, many see the move as a prelude to doing away with amateurism in college sports altogether, and placing the athletes on salary.\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s Sean Davis criticized Burr\u2019s proposed legislation, noting that the North Carolina Senator has never taxed the institutions those athletes have made rich.\n\nAnd yet you've never proposed to tax the institutions that are making billions of dollars off the athletes whose bodies are broken and bloodied on behalf of their schools. Strange. https://t.co/WZLHnMPeMO \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 29, 2019\n\nDavis also asked whether Burr\u2019s legislation would apply to those on academic scholarships who work while in school:\n\nFollow-up for @SenatorBurr: would you also tax the non-athletic academic scholarships of students who work while they're in school, or is this a special penalty for the handful of football and basketball stars whose efforts fund every athletic department in the country? \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd the grand finale:\n\nAs Senate Intel Chairman, Burr hasn\u2019t lifted a finger to get to the bottom of the biggest government spying scandal in history. The prospect of college athletes being compensated for their efforts, however, got a legislative proposal from him w/in minutes. https://t.co/WZLHnMPeMO \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 29, 2019\n\nWhile one could make the case for taxing the income earned off of any endorsement deals, it\u2019s more complicated to say that the athlete\u2019s entire scholarship should be taxed. Not to mention other potential complications that could arise once room and board, food, medical, and transportation costs are factored in.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "The sports world received a significant jolt on Tuesday, when the NCAA announced that they had taken the unprecedented step of allowing", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Richard-Burr-2018-640x479-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
