Just 25 minutes later, the Post contributing columnist was dead, and a noise that Turkish authorities later described as a bone saw could be heard.\n\nA year after Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Saudi Arabia still hasn\u2019t provided a clear explanation of what happened. But Saudi, U.S. and European sources, amplifying a June report by U.N. investigator Agnes Callamard, helped reconstruct the events leading to the shocking murder of Khashoggi, my colleague and friend.\n\nThe Saudi prosecution of this crime remains \u201cepisodic, haphazard and ad hoc,\u201d a State Department official told me, but most of the facts are hiding in plain sight. This is a murder story that hasn\u2019t died for a simple reason: It describes a macabre plot by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saud al-Qahtani, his media and covert-operations adviser in the royal court, to silence a brave critic.\n\nMBS, as the crown prince is known, has offered a general statement of responsibility. \u201cIt happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,\u201d he told Martin Smith of PBS in a December interview that was released last week. He gave a similar interview to CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that was broadcast Sunday.\n\nWhat happened on the way to Khashoggi\u2019s horrifying final seconds? The journalist\u2019s criticisms had angered MBS and Qahtani for more than a year, and U.S. and Saudi sources say the two began talking in 2017 about ways to muzzle him. But the operation that led to his murder in Istanbul began Sept. 28, 2018, when Khashoggi first visited the consulate there to inquire about legal arrangements for marrying his Turkish fiancee.\n\nMBS\u2019s team moved quickly. The afternoon of Sept. 28, according to Callamard\u2019s report, a Saudi security officer in Istanbul called Maher Mutreb, an intelligence officer who worked for the crown prince and Qahtani. The security officer explained that Khashoggi would return to Istanbul on Oct. 2 to complete his paperwork, providing a fortuitous opportunity to confront \u201cone of the people sought\u201d in Qahtani\u2019s campaign against dissenters.\n\n[Read more about Jamal Khashoggi: A missing voice, a growing chorus]\n\nLater that evening, the consul general in Istanbul talked with a colleague in Riyadh who told him that a \u201ctop secret mission\u201d was underway, Callamard reported, based on a recording of the call.\n\nThe formal order for the Istanbul operation came from Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, deputy chief of Saudi intelligence. Assiri told the Saudi court on Jan. 31 that \u201che had ordered the team to convince Mr. Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia, but had never ordered the use of force,\u201d Callamard wrote.\n\nThe authorization to kill Khashoggi, if that became necessary, came in a second order, from Qahtani, a Saudi source with contacts in MBS\u2019s palace told me. The Saudi prosecutor himself has alleged that Qahtani \u201cmet with the \u2018negotiation\u2019 team in advance of the mission and sought Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s return, saying that he was a \u2018threat to national security,\u2019\u201d according to the U.N. report. But Qahtani has ignored the Saudi prosecutor\u2019s request to testify, the Saudi source said.\n\nMutreb and his team arrived in Istanbul on a private jet from Riyadh at 3:30 a.m. on Oct. 2. Drafted at the last minute was Dr. Salah Tubaigy, a forensic expert who had experience dissecting bodies. After checking into their hotel, the team went to the consulate to wait.\n\nIn the hour before Khashoggi\u2019s arrival, Mutreb and Tubaigy talked about what they would do. A book by Turkish journalists who have reviewed consulate surveillance tapes says Mutreb advised: \u201cWe will first tell him that we are taking him to Riyadh. If he fails to comply, we will kill him here and get rid of the body,\u201d according to an English translation.\n\nA grisly discussion followed in which Tubaigy explained the dissection and disposal: \u201cJoints will be separated \u2026 If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished,\u201d Callamard wrote, quoting the tape.\n\n\u201cWe will have to take you back,\u201d Mutreb told Khashoggi when he arrived, according to the tape. He ordered Khashoggi to text his son Salah in the kingdom to say that he would be away for a while. Khashoggi refused, and Mutreb warned him: \u201cIf you don\u2019t help us you know what will happen in the end.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi refused to go quietly. \u201cAre you going to give me drugs?\u201d he protested. Then the tape records a conversation turning to struggle, perhaps as he\u2019s being sedated. Someone asks, \u201cDid he sleep?\u201d and a voice urges, \u201cKeep pushing.\u201d There\u2019s a gasping sound, probably after a bag is placed over Khashoggi\u2019s head, then silence. And then the sound of bones being cut.\n\nWhat does Qahtani say about whether the crown prince authorized these actions? We don\u2019t know, because he has never been compelled to testify in the Saudi trial; Qahtani was fired from his job in the royal court, but a U.S. official says he lives comfortably and continues to advise some of his former colleagues. MBS, embraced by President Trump, travels the world as if the murder never happened.\n\nBut perhaps we can be guided by a Twitter message that Qahtani sent back in August 2017 when questioned about his activities: \u201cI am a trustworthy employee who carries out the orders of my boss.\u201d\n\nRead more about Jamal Khashoggi:\n\nA missing voice, a growing chorus\n\nRobert Menendez: Trump betrayed U.S. moral leadership with Saudi Arabia.
