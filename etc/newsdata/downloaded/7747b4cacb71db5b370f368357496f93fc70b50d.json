With the arrival of European settlers, that all changed.\n\nAs the grassland ecosystem was plowed and agricultural crops were planted, the bears were pushed from the open plains of the prairies to the mountains, where we find them today.\n\nBut just south of the border, grizzlies are making a return. In Grasslands: A Hidden Wilderness, we watch as a mother grizzly and her cubs emerge from their den, possibly the first to be born on the prairies in 150 years.\n\nMORE:\n\nCanada's beautiful prairie grasslands are among the most endangered ecosystems in the world\n\nFerrets, foxes and the fringed orchid: Species that suffer when grasslands are threatened\n\nBut they have to live on a different prairie than their species once knew. Their reclaimed home is inhabited by families like Trina Bradley\u2019s who are showing us how to live peacefully with bears. Watch video above to see their story.\n\nWatch the full documentary Grasslands: A Hidden Wilderness on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/Grasslands_Grizzly_1920.jpg"}
