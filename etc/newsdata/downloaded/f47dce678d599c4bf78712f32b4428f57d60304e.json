Photo: Todd Williamson/JanuaryImages/Shutterstock\n\nSometime on Monday morning, the day after the 2019 Emmy Awards, out of the ether emerged a stunning visual that has entranced basically every person who has laid their eyes on it: a photo of Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, elegantly reclined in a chair and surrounded by her three Emmys at the Chateau Marmont, taking a drag from a cigarette in one hand, and clutching a coupe with the other.\n\nmy vision board is just this photo 500 times pic.twitter.com/pOJdnUPx4f \u2014 Dana Schwartz (@DanaSchwartzzz) September 23, 2019\n\nThe photo, which has been shared repeatedly on Twitter with captions like \u201chappy bi visibility day\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m unWELL,\u201d captured a beautiful, rare sight \u2014 a rightful award-winner basking in the glory of their deserved recognition. Earlier in the night, Waller-Bridge had won three of the four Emmys for which she was nominated, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy. So of course, at the conclusion of the awards show, she was ready to party. So she smoked. And she had at least one drink, though probably more like two or six. And throughout it all, she looked incredibly cool. (Alas, this is also where I must emphasize that smoking is bad.)\n\nWhile the aforementioned photo has garnered the most adulation on social media, every photo and video to have surfaced of the Fleabag celebrating her multiple wins have been glorious.\n\nWatch her hold back uttering \u201cfuck\u201d after winning one of her three awards.\n\nphoebe waller-bridge swallowing a \"fuck!\" is extremely fleabag energy #Emmys pic.twitter.com/VsMG3SCSVM \u2014 Morgan A Baila (@morganbaila) September 23, 2019\n\nAnd juggle them at the show\u2019s conclusion.\n\nPhoebe collecting her Emmys \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc98 pic.twitter.com/1vxwPyOq1e \u2014 Phoebe Waller-Bridge Source (@phoebewallerbr1) September 23, 2019\n\nAnd smile alongside the Hot Priest, who can pull off a suit just as well as he can a clerical robe.\n\nThey were so happy \ud83e\udd70 pic.twitter.com/gQfm1oI06x \u2014 Esm\u00e9e (@ninjatulp) September 23, 2019\n\n(And one more smoking picture, for good measure.)\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge with a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other whilst surrounded by her Emmys...art. pic.twitter.com/fdQkeNSoaV \u2014 sunny (@weiszexual) September 23, 2019\n\nTo the higher power who bestowed upon us these joyous images of Phoebe \u2014 and for Phoebe herself, for giving us a truly perfect season of TV \u2014 we are eternally grateful.\n\nStay in touch.
