He initially continued to play the piano but since 2017 has concentrated on conducting and composing.\n\n\u201cRenouncing the piano isn\u2019t such a heavy weight,\u201d he said. \u201cI always considered myself to be a pianist \u2018by chance\u2019. My true vocation is the podium and writing music. I turned 48 on 13 September \u2013 I consider it the beginning of a second life, all dedicated to my orchestra.\u201d\n\nBosso, who is from Turin but lives in London, made the comments during a discussion about society, music and orchestras. He later sought to reiterate to his fans that he wasn\u2019t abandoning music altogether after he accused the media of \u201clooting\u201d his words.\n\n\u201cI only replied that I would no longer play the piano solo as I would [play] worse than before,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI already announced this two years ago \u2026 but I didn\u2019t retire, I continue to make music, and better than before! I am very happy with what I do, but it pains me when you insist on the piano as I struggle a lot, because I don\u2019t have the same quality.\u201d\n\nBosso has conducted several orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, and won several awards for his compositions, which have also featured in films and theatre productions.", "description": "Bosso asks fans to stop begging him to play as two of his fingers \u2018no longer respond well\u2019 due to neurodegenerative illness", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8facef957954c46433cd7d3649b4690255a362/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=52ad2b436f070bd43a035fccc8d87abf", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
