Here's our roundup of his best movies you should watch for the holiday.\n\n1. Beetlejuice (1988)\n\nAdam and Barbara are a normal couple ... except that they\u2019ve already died in a car accident. Their spirits continue to live in their house and they are unable to leave. But when a new family moves into the place they\u2019ve spent years decorating, they try to drive them out, seeking help from another ghost named Beetlejuice. The film is funny, bizarre, at times a bit much, but fantastic in every way. Hands down the Banana Boat (Day-O) number in the film, where they dance around a table and suddenly raw, fleshy hands appear out of nowhere and grab them by the face, is a scene that has made a mark on pop culture.\n\nVideo of Beetlejuice (1988) Trailer #1 Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\n2. Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nOur favorite on the list is Edward Scissorhands, starring Burton\u2019s longtime muse Johnny Depp, who plays an artificial, Frankenstein-style man whose hands are scissor blades. With blades as hands, he seems to wreak havoc wherever he goes. However, he soon finds that he could embrace his quirks and weirdness and inability to fit in by embracing his talent - shaping trees, carving ice sculptures, etc. The film has so much heart to it, and shows how a \u201cmachine\u201d without a heart has a sense of righteousness and is capable of loving a human being.\n\nVideo of Edward Scissorhands (1990) - Trailer (HD/1080p)\n\nThrowback to the time Tim Burton talked to us about his quirky characters and why he always uses Johnny Depp\n\n3. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nWidely regarded as one of the best Halloween films ever, The Nightmare Before Christmas features Burton\u2019s signature dark, fantastical cinematic style as well as his ingenious stop-motion techniques, in which objects in an animated film appear to have the ability to move on their own. While the film wasn\u2019t directed by Burton himself, he was involved throughout the creative process and the film is still as Burtonesque as it gets.\n\nVideo of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) Official Trailer #1 - Animated Movie\n\n4. Corpse Bride (2005)\n\nThis is another movie featuring the amazing Johnny Depp. I realise this list is quickly becoming a \u201cBest Johnny Depp Movies List\u201d! Anyway, Corpse Bride is an animated movie about a man named Victor, who is set to marry Elizabeth. He sets out into the woods to practice his vows, but the Corpse Bride mistakenly thinks he is marrying her and she rises from the grave. Victor is now faced with two brides at one time and more craziness ensues throughout the movie! It\u2019s a great film for the whole family to watch on a nice, cool, calm night!\n\nVideo of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride - Trailer\n\nTim Burton, director of Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, explains why being different isn\u2019t a bad thing\n\n5. Dark Shadows (2015)\n\nThere is an obvious trend here - again, Johnny Depp is his leading man. Other members of this amazing cast also include greats like Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, and Chloe Grace Moretz. Although most critics weren\u2019t fans of this one, the film still went on to be a box office hit overseas. Depp plays 18th century aristocrat and vampire Barnabas Collins, who gets unearthed almost two centuries later after being trapped by his former lover, a witch named Angelique, and finds his estate in shambles. He then tries to restore his home to its former glory and tries to get even with Angelique.\n\nVideo of Dark Shadows - Official Trailer #1 - Johnny Depp, Tim Burton Movie (2012) HD\n\n6. Frankenweenie (2012)\n\nAnother Frankenstein-style stop-motion masterpiece by Burton, this film follows the story of a boy named Victor\u2019s best friend, a dog named Sparky, who also happens to star in his home videos. However, whilst chasing after a ball, Sparky gets hit by a car, but ends up being resuscitated by Victor. His other schoolmates soon follow suit, and one by one they bring dead creatures back to life.\n\nVideo of Frankenweenie Trailer\n\nA 101 on how to fangirl Tim Burton \u2013 the greatest director ever\n\n7. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)\n\nAfter hearing miraculous stories from his grandfather, a teenager named Jacob sets out to find Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, a safe haven for kids born with all kinds of \u201cpeculiarities\u201d and extraordinary abilities, with some having incredible strength and others being able to transform objects into stones. These kids are unable to leave the orphanage, as throughout the years, they\u2019ve been subject to persecution. With the arrival of Jacob comes the disruption of order, but he soon finds out about his own unique peculiarity and befriends other kids at the orphanage.\n\nVideo of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children Official Trailer [HD] 20th Century FOX", "description": "The famous American director, who often works with Johnny Depp, is a master at quirky, gothic films", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/tim_burton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
