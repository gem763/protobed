So he posted a selfie to Snapchat with the caption \u201cYou arent even prepared for tomorrow\u201d followed by a smiling emoji with sunglasses. Within an hour, Jarrett says, friends started texting him to warn that people might take his post the wrong way and think he was threatening to do something to the school.\n\nThe previous school year, Jarrett had been forced to attend an alternative off-campus education program and serve three months on probation after being arrested in May 2018 for sharing a screenshot of a text message he had sent stating that he would \u201cshoot the fucking school up.\u201d Jarrett, now 16, says he was being sarcastic, though he and his parents admit that it was a dumb thing to say, and understand that it scared people. This time, Jarrett said nothing about hurting anyone, not even as a joke\u2014he was discussing his outfit. Afterward, he sent messages to the principal and the principal\u2019s daughter, who happened to be a classmate, insisting that his post wasn\u2019t a threat and that he didn\u2019t want people \u201cfreaking out.\u201d Kids already treated him like an outcast due to the earlier incident, Jarrett would later tell police. Jarrett says he deleted the selfie from his Snapchat Story.\n\nA couple of hours after he posted the Snap, sometime after 9 p.m., police officers arrived at Jarrett\u2019s house in Oakwood, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. Someone had called 911, worried that Jarrett was making a threat against the school. \u201cIt could mean nothing and it could mean a lot,\u201d the caller had said. The cops left his home shortly after arriving, once they\u2019d spoken with Jarrett and his parents, who said they didn\u2019t have any weapons in the house. A police report noted that Jarrett had appeared upset, but had been \u201cfriendly, respectful and cooperative.\u201d Meanwhile, Oakwood City School District administrators sent a message to parents saying that they \u201cdon\u2019t believe there is an existing threat,\u201d but that the student who made the social-media post\u2014Jarrett\u2014wouldn\u2019t be on campus the next day. Jarrett hasn\u2019t been allowed in class since.", "description": "Teens are paying the price for school-shooting threats\u2014whether they\u2019re real or not.", "authors": ["Tyler Kingkade"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Selfie_expulsion/facebook.jpg?1571495495", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
