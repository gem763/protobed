He has earned my respect,\u201d Baker said \u2014 but added that he did not think the former UKIP supremo would \u201cever earn the respect of the Establishment\u201d he has caused so much trouble for.\n\nIndeed, with the current term of the Jean-Claude Juncker-led European Commission \u2014 part unelected executive, part legislator, part enforcer for the European Union \u2014 due to expire on October 31st, when Britain is supposed to finally leave the bloc, Baker now believes Boris Johnson\u2019s government should put Farage forward as its next Commissioner if Remain MPs succeed in delaying Britain\u2019s exit deadline yet again.\n\nLabour Leavers Switching to #Brexit Party, Not Tories; ERG Urge Boris to Agree Election Pact https://t.co/HtfjM2kZxJ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 14, 2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should leave ourselves in a position where we don\u2019t appoint a Commissioner. I think we should appoint a Commissioner. I think we should appoint somebody with about 20 years\u2019 experience, we should appoint somebody who is incredibly well known throughout the institutions. Somebody who will be absolutely relied upon at all times to support our exit from the European Union,\u201d he teased.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore I unashamedly back Nigel Farage to be our next EU Commissioner in the unfortunate event that it transpires \u2014 though I think it unlikely \u2014 that we have to remain in [the EU for longer].\u201d\n\nBaker joked that the idea was \u201cinspired by the film Armageddon\u201d starring Bruce Willis, recalling scenes where the protagonists \u201care trying to save the world and so what they do is they land on the asteroid and they put a nuclear weapon into the heart of the asteroid.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigel Farage is that nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nFarage Urges Boris to Agree Election Pact, or Tories Will Be Responsible for \u2018Saddling Country with Corbyn Govt\u2019 https://t.co/dgr1qPQPT7 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 20, 2019\n\nBritain\u2019s current European Commissioner, career bureaucrat Sir Julian King, has proven less than supportive of the British government, chastising Prime Minister Boris Johnson as \u201ccrass and dangerous\u201d with reference to \u201cextreme language\u201d \u2014 criticism he did not make of the European Parliament\u2019s representative in the Brexit negotiations, for example, when he suggested Johnson and two other prominent Tory Brexiteers, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Gove, could end up \u201con the guillotine\u201d.\n\nBaker\u2019s dream of Commissioner Farage could run into difficulty, however, insofar as the European Commission\u2019s incumbent president Jean-Claude Juncker has already revealed that he can and has blocked the appointment of many proposed Commissioners who in his view promoted \u201cfoolish nationalism\u201d.\n\nEuropean Commissioners also have to be approved by the European Parliament, which includes such figures as the aforementioned \u201cguillotine\u201d Brexit negoitiator, Guy Verhofstadt.\n\nCourt Documents Reveal UK Preparing For Brexit Delay if Deal Rejected https://t.co/Klncj4iDQP \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 4, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "ERG leader Steve Baker wants Britain to appoint \"nuclear weapon\" Nigel Farage as its next European Commissioner.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/farage-juncker-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
