Alright \u2026 Once they explained to me the way that they wanted to do it, I thought it was interesting.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Disney announced a star-studded cast would lead their first-ever television musical production in \u201cThe Wonderful World of Disney presents The Little Mermaid Live!\u201d in honor of the film\u2019s 30th anniversary.\n\nQueen Latifah stars alongside actress Auli\u2019i Cravalho who will play Ariel and reggae singer Shaggy who will play Ariel\u2019s friend, Sebastian.\n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid Live!\u201d will be different from other live television performances because it will be a hybrid production where performances of the songs by the actors will be shown with clips from the animated film and puppets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to literally show the movie in front of a live audience of at least 500 people. And then when it comes to musical performances, it\u2019s going to cut to the live performance of those songs and then it\u2019ll go back into the movie and the audience will take part in it and be participants in the actual performance of it,\u201d Latifah said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be under the sea with us.\u201d\n\nLatifah, who has never been a part of a production like this before, told \u201cGMA\u201d how she\u2019s preparing for Ursula\u2019s big number from the film, \u201cPoor Unfortunate Souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious song,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I listen to it, you know - you think you know every Disney movie to watch it again and or you think you know a song until you actually have to sing it and you\u2019re like, oh my god.\u201d\n\nThe song, which comes up in the film when Ursula tries to convince Ariel into trading her voice for the chance to become human temporarily, was performed by voice actress and singer, Pat Carroll, in the film\u2019s 1989 version.\n\nLatifah commented on Carroll\u2019s iconic version and said, \u201cThis person went every possible direction that you could go with a song. I mean, the diction, you know, the notes that she hit, just being a bad villain \u2026 So I got my hands full.\u201d\n\nSince signing on to the role, Latifah has been working tirelessly to get the part right but is taking it all in stride, making sure to enjoy the process.\n\n\u201cYou know, you got one shot at this thing. You got to make it right. You know you cannot blow it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you prepare. You practice, practice, practice. Lots of rehearsal. And then you - just like for me, I just let it go.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges of the new role, Latifah is excited about the production and the costume she\u2019ll be wearing. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a blast to play this character with this hair. Black purple, sort of. Skin dress. I don\u2019t even know what to call it with my tentacles and all this \u2026 I think it\u2019s going to be amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wonderful World of Disney presents The Little Mermaid Live!\u201d will air at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 5, live on ABC.\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC News and \"Good Morning America.\"", "description": "Queen Latifah opened up about her new role as Ursula in ABC's live presentation of", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/queen-latifah-little-mermaid-abc-jef-191028_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
