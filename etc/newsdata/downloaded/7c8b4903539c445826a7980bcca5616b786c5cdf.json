It was just for things like offsides and everything like that.\"\n\nThe most recent time the rivals clashed was at Twickenham last autumn when a controversial offside decision against Courtney Lawes meant Sam Underhill's late try that would have clinched a famous victory was disallowed.\n\n\"Everything gets checked now, just to make sure for confirmation, so you've got to be absolutely on it,\" Youngs said.\n\n\"Sam's try is a very good example where you are just a little bit off and you don't get the rewards.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"It's no different to how we've approached every game this tournament. You've got to make sure you are accurate and you are disciplined.\"\n\nEngland forwards coach Steve Borthwick revealed that England expect to have all 31 players available for selection on Thursday.\n\nWings Jack Nowell and Jonny May have made good progress in their recovery from hamstring injuries and are on course to be included in the matchday 23.\n\nJones' 'Kamikaze Kids' Tom Curry and Underhill will continue in the back row after outclassing the famed 'Pooper' combination of David Pocock and Michael Hooper in the quarter-final victory over Australia.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCurry, at 21 England's youngest player at the World Cup, was named man of the match following a colossal display of defensive ferocity and breakdown expertise and Youngs believes the Sale flanker is destined for the very top.\n\n\"Tom's an unbelievably special player. He works incredibly hard. Nothing seems to faze him. He's in this bubble and he's just loving every moment of it,\" Youngs said.\n\n\"Things like that are infectious. And Underhill, although he looks a lot older isn't too old himself.\n\n\"Both those guys and the energy they bring - I'm just pleased and proud of them. As characters they're good boys. They get a little bit of heat, but they're top boys.\n\n\"Being an older member of the squad you see these young guys come in and you want them to be successful.\n\n\"Tom's been incredible like that and I'm sure he'll continue to grow and grow as a player. I'm sure he'll go on to be one of the greatest back-rowers England have ever had.\"", "description": "The Red Rose take on New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup 2019 semi-final on Saturday", "authors": ["Duncan Bech", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704095.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RUGBYU-WC-2019-ENG-TRAINING.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
