'I was a kid once, it's always one more - that's the problem with William - working out how to get him away from that without getting annoyed.'\n\nHowever, a visit from Jackie - a friend of the family - reveals she similarly struggles to cope with how much her own son uses his devices.\n\nShe explains that when the boys are together, they spend most of their time playing games - without even communicating.\n\n'Will is brilliant, he's hilarious he's huge as a character - it's hard to pry him away from his tablet sometimes,' explains Professor Green, to which Jackie quickly responds:\n\n'If you have boys of that age it's a massive problem at the moment. I don't know what we should do about it.'\n\nAfter switching off the television, Professor Green takes a stricter approach and proceeds to take away Will's devices. Pictured together\n\nA family friend expresses concern that her 12-year-old son is constantly on his electronic device too - and adds he and Will would barely communicate with each other when they're together (pictured)\n\nFollowing the conversation the musician attempts to lure Will away from his console and tells him: 'Be here, be present, get out the game, get out of The Matrix'.\n\nLater, Stephen even tries to inspire Will to do his homework by sharing details of his own autobiography.\n\n'I was thinking about your autobiography,' he says. 'I wrote one a few years ago and I started with where I was born and what the areas were like. What lessons do you like at school?'\n\nBut Will, who once again loses focus to his video game, replies: 'I don't remember stuff though.'\n\nHaving none of the youngster's excuses, the songwriter quickly tells him: 'You can if you try,' to which Will replies: 'I just don't. When the next game is over I can focus on it.'\n\nStephen struggles to get Will to do his English homework - and admits he's keen to find a way of prying the child away from his devices without becoming frustrated\n\nLater, Professor green - whose real name is Stephen Manderson - tries to inspire Will to do his homework by sharing details of his own autobiography\n\nWhen his approach fails, Professor Green enlists the help of Will's older brother James, and asks him whether Will is 'properly addicted' to Fornite.\n\nAfter being told by James to be stricter with his brother, Stephen turns off the TV and takes away Will's tablet.\n\n'Mate you have to, I haven't asked much of you have I?' says Professor Green. 'Just put it down for a bit. Just be here - I go home tomorrow.'\n\nWith Will getting visibly upset, the star asks: 'Why do you look so hard done by?'\n\nAs the child breaks down in tears, a shocked Stephen asks: 'Are you really that upset? I didn't take it off you to upset you or to make you cry.'\n\n'I just took it of you because it's really hard to talk to you when you're looking at the screen and also you've been on it all day.'\n\nThe rapper reflects on the dangers of electronic devices, insisting that children can become 'isolated'.\n\n'The real danger around tablets is the isolation of them,' he explains. 'You're in a room full of people but you're completely on your own because you're engaging with a device and not the people around you.'\n\nMy Famous Babysitter airs tonight on W at 10pm.\n\nHowever. after confiscation the twelve-year-old's devises, Will (pictured) breaks down in tears and a shocked Stephen asks: 'Are you really that upset?'", "description": "In tonight's 'My Famous Babysitter,' Will, 12, who is described as being 'addicted' to video games' is left in floods of tears after his games console and tablet is confiscated by Professor Green.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19994016-0-image-a-107_1571667481789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
