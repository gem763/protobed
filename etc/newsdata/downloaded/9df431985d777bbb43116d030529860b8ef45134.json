In the early 90s, before Pence had ever been elected to office, he spoke out against efforts to ban discrimination against gay people, CNN reports.\n\nBack when Pence ended his unsuccessful run for Congress in Indiana and went on to host conservative radio shows in the state throughout the 90s, he argued that gay people choose to be gay, unlike black people.\n\n\"I do not choose whether I am a black American,\" Pence said, according to CNN, which found the quote in local newspapers. \"The great vast majority of the psychological community says homosexuality at a very minimum is a choice by the individual, and at the maximum, is a learned behavior.\"\n\nU.S. Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence pose for a photo with Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and his partner Dr.Matt Barrett at Farmleigh House in Dublin, Ireland September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Lorraine O'Sullivan\n\nPence's past claim that being gay is a choice or learned behavior contradicted psychological research that existed at the time\n\nWhen Pence made his comments in the 90s, the American Psychological Association and other mental health groups had already established findings that contradict his claims.\n\nStarting in 1973, homosexuality was no longer considered a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual used by most psychiatrists.\n\nStarting in 1988, the APA labeled discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation irrational and officially opposed exclusion and dismissal from the armed forces based on sexual orientation in 1990.\n\nThroughout the 90s, the APA went on to advise against discrimination in immigration and naturalization processes based on sexual orientation, along with encouraging members to prevent and respond to incidents of bias against gay people. By 2000, the APA formally opposed conversion therapy.\n\nPence's visit to Ireland was tense, Irish newspapers pointed out, given his support of Brexit, which is unpopular in the region. His anti-gay position didn't seem to help either, as multiple reports recalled that while serving as governor of Indiana, Pence signed a controversial bill into law that opponents said enabled discrimination against LGBTQ people on the basis of religious freedom.\n\nRead more:'He shat on the new carpet': Mike Pence accused of humiliating and betraying hosts during his visit to Ireland\n\nThe vice president has also been opposed to same-sex marriage, same-sex civil unions, and LGBTQ military service.\n\nDespite his record on LGBTQ issues, special assistant to the president and deputy press secretary Judd Deere tweeted that, because the vice president and Second Lady Karen Pence met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his partner Dr. Matthew Barrett for lunch in Ireland, that meant Pence could no longer be called \"anti-gay.\"\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "The White House said Mike Pence couldn't be called 'anti-gay' after dining with the Irish prime minister and his partner despite Pence's track record.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d0fa38be3ecba589f72e722-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
