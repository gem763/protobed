Some is currently tied up in CDs at 2.5% for a few more months. I'm looking for places to put money in exchange for bonuses, higher interest rates, etc.\n\nCITI has a bonus being offered of $500 on a minimum $15k deposit to a new checking account for 60 days. Initial deposit has to be made within 30 days of opening and $1.5k after the 60-day period to avoid fees (fees also waived for those over 62, I believe). That one seems like a no-brainer to me.\n\nSomeone recently mentioned a 4% interest-bearing account I'd like to look into, but I can't seem to find that post again!? Can anyone point me to that? Anyone have some other opportunities they know about? Can set up a direct deposit/direct payment pair if required.\n\nHow about cash in a brokerage? Anything useful aside from something like FZDDX? Inquiring minds and all that....\n\nI could envision (envisage?) this as a continuing thread in this climate especially!", "description": "Solved: RMDs coming up, and I've accumulated some other cash in standard savings/checking accounts.
