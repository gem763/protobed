Then, Foster tweeted:\n\nJohnson needs the DUP votes in London if he is to get his deal through Parliament in London. But the party has been opposed to the concessions the prime minister offered to get the EU\u2018s support for his proposed Brexit accord -- in particular putting a customs border in the Irish sea and diluting the Northern Ireland Assembly\u2019s veto over the arrangements.\n\nKey Developments\n\nJohnson to brief his cabinet at 2:30 p.m. London time and his backbenchers at 4:30 p.m.EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier is set to brief EU27 diplomats at 5 p.m. Brussels time.Johnson needs a deal approved this Saturday or he will be told to seek an extension; that will likely prompt a legal battle with the risk of a no-deal exit\n\nPound Whipsawed (2:05 p.m.)\n\nThe currency market hasn\u2019t been this twitchy over Brexit since the aftermath of the referendum that set off the process in 2016. For the pound, today is all about volatility: The currency has swung between gains and losses as traders track every headline out of Brussels, London and Belfast. On Wednesday, sterling touched a five-month high as an end to the Brexit saga appeared to be in sight -- before paring those gains.\n\nJohnson to Visit Brussels? (2 p.m)\n\nThe prime minister may travel to Brussels this evening if a deal is reached this afternoon, according to EU officials.\n\nIrish PM to Brief Party Leaders Today (1:45 p.m.)\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar will brief opposition party leaders later today on the state of the Brexit negotiations. That\u2019s usually a sign of progress -- though he went on to tell lawmakers that a legal text had yet to be \u201cstabilized.\u201d In recent years, that sort of language has preceded the various accords that have been reached.\n\nDUP Accepts Latest Proposals on Consent: RTE (1:22 p.m.)\n\nConsent Needs to be Revisited, Irish PM Says (1:05 p.m.)\n\nIn comments unlikely to calm the DUP, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the suspended Northern Ireland Assembly\u2019s controversial consent mechanism should be re-examined as part of efforts to revive the body.\n\nUnder current rules, a third of assembly members can effectively block a measure they don\u2019t like, using the so-called petition of concern, which could theoretically allow the DUP to veto any measures designed to install a border in the Irish Sea as part of a Brexit deal.\n\nSammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman today fired a warning over the issue, saying U.K. & EU negotiators \u201chave no business interfering in the processes for consent as currently set out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers in Dublin, Varadkar said the device had been \u201cused in a way that I don\u2019t think was ever anticipated,\u201d though any reform needs the assent of the region\u2019s biggest parties.\n\nDUP\u2019s Wilson Warns Over Consent (12:15 p.m.)\n\nDUP Brexit Spokesman Sammy Wilson says the Good Friday Agreement \u201crequires cross community consent for all controversial issues\u201d passing through Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing Assembly.\n\nU.K. Wants N Ireland in Customs Territory (12 p.m.)\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay reiterated Johnson\u2019s commitment to keeping Northern Ireland in the U.K. customs territory, but refused to be drawn on whether discussions in Brussels include customs checks between the province and the rest of the U.K.\n\n\u201cIt is essential that Northern Ireland is part of United Kingdom customs territory,\u201d he said in a question and answer session with a panel of MPs. \u201cOnce we start to get into the details, that is an issue that is part of the negotiations.\u201d He said \u201csensitivities\u201d over negotiations with the EU meant he couldn\u2019t talk further about the government\u2019s plans.\n\nBarclay dodged a series of questions from the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson, in which he was asked if the government would ensure \u201ccross-community\u201d consent for any agreement on the Irish border. That would effectively give a veto for the DUP, which Wilson told him would be in line with the agreement that ended violence in the province.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Democratic Unionist Party Leader Arlene Foster dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d a report it was close to dropping its opposition to Boris Johnson\u2019s latest Brexit deal and opening the way to a historic agreement with", "authors": ["Ian Wishart", "Nikos Chrysoloras", "Dara Doyle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9Dj8iggz2kYXfkw90ZJafA--~B/aD0xOTI4O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0ee9102920a821b1f32bf9b1f784b8b9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
