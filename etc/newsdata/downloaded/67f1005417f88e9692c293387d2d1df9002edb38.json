REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nVLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russia\u2019s natural resources and environment minister said on Wednesday he supported allowing private oil and gas companies to work on the Arctic shelf.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at an economic forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, the minister, Dmitry Kobylkin, said he supported \u201cany decision linked to an increase in investment in projects related to hydrocarbons.\u201d\n\nThe Russian economy is heavily reliant on natural resources and the Arctic\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves are expected to become more accessible as climate change melts the ice and technology advances.\n\n\u201cWe clearly understand that Russia\u2019s Arctic zone has not been studied enough,\u201d Kobylkin said in separate comments to TASS news agency. \u201cOf course we would like to study it more, but the government cannot allow itself to make such investments. It\u2019s very expensive.\u201d\n\nIn August deputy prime ministers Dmitry Kozak and Yuri Trutnev proposed that Russia\u2019s Arctic shelf be opened to private investors and proposed to draft legislation to expand access to it.\n\nOnly state-controlled Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) are currently authorised to operate on Russia\u2019s Arctic shelf. Kobylkin told TASS that his ministry was also in talks with Gazprom and Rosneft to increase their Arctic exploration.", "description": "Russia's natural resources and environment minister said on Wednesday he supported allowing private oil and gas companies to work on the Arctic shelf.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425962507&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83070"}
