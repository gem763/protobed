Protesters took to the streets daubed in fake blood and carrying signs in various languages which said \u201cYou Run. Bulls Die.\u201d\n\nThey argue they want tourists to know that what may look like harmless fun ends in huge suffering for the bulls.\n\nAll of the 48 bulls which run through the streets in the mornings are later killed in the bullring in a long, drawn-out process where they are speared and stabbed.\n\nThe official bullfighting begins on Monday (July 7), and the festival lasts for nine days.", "description": "The famous Spanish festival of San Fermin was declared open in Pamplona \u2013 155km south-east of Bilbao \u2013 on Sunday.\n\n\tThe traditional \u2018Chupinazo\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2014-07-06"}
