Not this time.\n\nHaunted by their overexpansion during the last gold boom\u2014which saddled the sector with high debts and hit share prices when prices collapsed\u2014companies are shunning spending and taking a more conservative approach.\n\n\u201cMiners weakened their businesses,\u201d said Sean Boyd, chief executive of Toronto-based Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. \u201cIf it is a repeat of that last time, we are done as an industry.\u201d\n\nGold has risen about 25% over the past 12 months to trade above $1,500 an ounce\u2014around a six-year high\u2014as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low. Unlike most metals, gold is more an investment than a raw material. Prices tend to go up when rates are low because it has less competition from yield-bearing securities like Treasurys. Worries about the health of the global economy also spur demand.\n\nWith the Fed unlikely to raise rates soon, and U.S.-China trade tensions persisting, analysts predict further gains. BNP Paribas sees gold hitting $1,600 an ounce by the first quarter of 2020, while J.P. Morgan predicts the metal will average around $1,724 next year.\n\nDespite that optimism, gold miners say they aren\u2019t planning the same sort of megaprojects and acquisition sprees that characterized the last ramp up in prices in the years ahead of 2011. Instead, wary of volatile prices, they plan to pay down debt and return money to shareholders.\n\nMany companies, including the world\u2019s largest gold miner, Newmont Goldcorp Corp., say they will only approve new projects if they can make money with gold at $1,200, about 20% below where the metal currently trades. Gold prices also have spent the majority of the eight years since 2011\u2019s bust trading above that level, underscoring how conservative companies have become.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t push ahead with investments that would struggle to sustain themselves if the gold price trades lower,\u201d said Kelvin Dushnisky, chief executive of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. \u201cThis was a common mistake for many gold producers in the previous upcycle.\u201d The South African miner, whose share price has risen 62% in the year to date, is among the companies sticking by the $1,200 threshold for new projects.\n\nMiners are reluctant to green light new mines because they take up to a decade to build. New mines also have become more expensive as the easy-to-reach, quality deposits run out. Miners can, though, turn to deposits that are within their current operations but were previously considered uneconomic. And production has risen steadily for much of the past decade, but miners say they don\u2019t plan to turbocharge that by bringing once-uneconomic gold into their reserves.\n\nSpending on mergers and acquisitions in the sector has been sluggish. Even with Newmont Mining Corp. \u2019s $10 billion all-stock takeover of Goldcorp Inc. in January, the value of acquisitions so far this year is at $19.2 billion, less than half the level it was for the same period in 2010, according to Dealogic.\n\nJames Bell, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, said that, for investors, the gold sector is in a sweet spot in which companies can use the high gold price to return cash to investors without throwing money around on new projects and acquisitions.\n\nStill Mr. Bell believes that discipline will only last for the next six to 12 months.\n\n\u201cI think they will start spending,\u201d he said.\n\nGold hit a record of $1,891.90 in August 2011. That triggered a rush of mergers and acquisitions as miners tried to increase their production. Miners also embarked on costly projects that were only economic at high gold prices. That was the case across the mining industry, with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP calculating in 2016 that, overall, big miners had written off $200 billion of the value in acquisitions and projects over the previous five years.\n\nDuring the last gold rally, miners were planning their projects around an assumption that the price of gold would stay between $1,400 and $1,800, said Cobus Loots, chief executive of Pan African Resources PLC.\n\nGoldcorp's Borden all-electric underground gold mine in Canada.

He added that his company was focusing on returning money to shareholders and reducing debt.\n\nMr. Loots said that at a mining conference in Florida this February, all miners began their presentations to investors with the same promise: capital discipline.\n\nThat is the way a lot of investors like it.\n\n\u201cI think that the market wants to see cash flow first and foremost,\u201d said Chris Mancini, an analyst with Gabelli Gold Fund. Mr. Mancini said investors need to feel that the gold price will consistently stay above $1,500 for the foreseeable future before they want miners to start spending again.\n\n\u201cWe might have a better sense of this in six months or so,\u201d he said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Are gold miners right to be cautious of expansion?
