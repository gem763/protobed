With US diplomats placing renewed focus on the energy-rich eastern Mediterranean \u2013 an area they readily admit has been vastly overlooked, allowing \u201cmalign actors\u201d to compete for power \u2013 Greece, geopolitically, has attained a new status as a key partner on Europe\u2019s strategic southern flank.\n\n\u201cWe are opening a new chapter in our history,\u201d prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Pompeo. \u201cOur relationship has truly never been as strong as today.\u201d\n\nNo US secretary of state has spent as much time in Greece in years.\n\nThe trip partly reflects the cooling in ties with Ankara under the unpredictable stewardship of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Talk of the US removing military installations from Turkey has been muted. Greek-US relations have warmed as tensions have risen in the eastern Mediterranean between Cyprus and Turkey over offshore gas rights.\n\nBut in substance, as much as feel, analysts say Pompeo\u2019s tour also highlights the choice the Orthodox nation has made to align its interests with Washington at a time when Greece, Cyprus and Israel have also formed a tripartite energy alliance, to the delight of the Trump White House.\n\n\u201cThe time when many Greeks wanted to minimise the US military footprint in their country is well and truly over,\u201d said international relations professor Aristotle Tziampiris at the University of Piraeus. \u201cWhat we are witnessing is a dramatic improvement in ties especially on the military, energy and political fronts. For Greek standards this is happening at the speed of light.\u201d\n\nIn a society where anti-Americanism has never been far from the surface, it is a choice that has been all the more extraordinary for its cross-party embrace.\n\nMitsotakis\u2019 centre right government is to a great degree building on the legacy of his leftist predecessor Alexis Tsipras. In office until July, Tsipras actively sought to promote bilateral links despite opposition from cadres who had not forgotten US support of authoritarian governments following the country\u2019s bloody 1946-49 civil war and Washington\u2019s backing of the ruthless military regime that ruled between 1967-74.\n\nIndicative of that sentiment, diehard leftists protested in Athens Saturday deploring a defense accord that will see US bases expand across Greece and vigorously chanting \u201cAmericans, Murderers of the People.\u201d\n\nTechnical teams fly in this week to put the final touches to the open-ended military agreement, one that will allow the US to further expand a deep-water naval base used by the Sixth Fleet on Crete, create facilities for helicopter pilots and bases for drones. As part of the pact, Greek armed forces hit by steep budget cuts during the country\u2019s long-running debt crisis, will also benefit.\n\nThe upgrading of ties will also see US influence expand in both the economic and energy sectors, where Washington is keen to upgrade Greece\u2019s role as a regional supply hub of natural gas. \u201cAfter years of taking the eastern Mediterranean for granted, the United States has stepped back to take a considered, whole-of \u2013government look at how we advance US interests and build peace and prosperity in this crucial region,\u201d the US ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, said last week. \u201cTogether with Greece and other democratic partners, we are working to push back on malign actors like Russia, China and Iran [that] have different interests and values and different visions for the future of this region.\u201d\n\nBefore arriving in Athens on Friday, Pompeo visited the Balkan states of Montenegro and North Macedonia. Moscow\u2019s meddling in the area \u2013 one it has long viewed as falling within its own orbit \u2013 assumed brazen overtones last year when it tried to thwart resolution of the decades-long name dispute between Skopje and Athens in a bid to stop Macedonia joining Nato.\n\nDespite once warm relations with the Kremlin, the Tsipras government pushed through the deal.\n\nUnder the new military accord, the US will invest heavily in setting up a new naval and air force base in Alexandroupolis, which is also emerging as a regional energy centre with plans to supply US liquid natural gas to southeastern Europe via the emerging regional pipeline network. Russia had also expressed interest in developing the Aegean port.\n\n\u201cAlexandropoulis symbolises the new Greek- American commercial and military relationship,\u201d said professor Tziampiris. \u201cTens years ago none of this would have been feasible.\u201d", "description": "US secretary of state indulged in a rare charm offensive during two-day visit amid Trump impeachment scandal back home", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77fa72e1b0baec6f844c2f1f1f92b20f5dc92a0d/0_39_3063_1837/master/3063.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c6c07d2f2b061a8a7ca1361a197b013", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
