If you think extreme language doesn\u2019t fuel political violence across Europe, including UK, then you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d\n\nMr King, a civil servant by profession was originally appointed by David Cameron in July 2016, following the EU referendum.\n\nFollowing up on Mr King\u2019s comments on Thursday, a spokesperson for the European Commission said: \u201cI think respect is the key word. We would remain everybody that respect is a fundamental value of all our democracies and it is the responsibility of each and every politician to uphold our values. History has shown us what happens when they are not respect. That is what I would have to say from our side.\u201d\n\nThe assassination of Jo Cox did not go unnoticed in Brussels: last year the city named a square in its old town after her. The Labour MP had spent several years living in the Belgian capital while working for Oxfam.\n\nEarlier this month Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament Brexit\u2019s coordinator, also took Mr Johnson to task for his rhetoric, telling a press conference that \u201copposing a no-deal is not surrender\u201d.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Nothing is further from the truth,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest he is the establishment and we are still people.\u201d\n\nShe added. \u201cAs the woman who has taken over the seat left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him in all honesty as a human being, please, please will he, going forward, moderate his language so we will all feel secure when we are going about our jobs?\u201d\n\nMr Johnson responded: \u201cThe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nAsked by another Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, why delivering Brexit would honour Ms Cox\u2019s memory, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI believe that the continuing failure to deliver on the mandate of the people has greatly exacerbated feelings and the best way to reduce that tension is to get it done.
