Hundreds, if not more, are still missing in the country of about 400,000 people, and officials say the death toll, which stands at 30, is likely to shoot up as more bodies are discovered in the ruins and floodwaters left behind by the storm.\n\nRelief groups were focusing on getting doctors, nurses and medical supplies into the hardest-hit areas and helping survivors get food and safe drinking water.\n\nAbaco resident Jerrod Green is among those who would welcome aid. He told CBC News he's depended on the kindness of his boss, who's shared supplies and food with some of his workers.\n\n\"There's no power, there's no water,\" he said. \"So you got nothing else. But you know, I'm just hoping that someone will come along and help us.\"\n\nThe Bahamian Health Ministry said helicopters and boats were on the way to help people in affected areas, though officials warned of delays because of severe flooding and limited access.\n\nResidents and visitors hope to catch a flight from the island devastated by Hurricane Dorian at the airport in Treasure Cay, Abaco, Bahamas, September 5, 2019.

The expectation from officials is that the death toll will climb significantly.\n\n\"You smell the decomposing bodies as you walk through Marsh Harbour,\" said Sandra Sweeting, 37, in an interview with Reuters amid the wreckage on Great Abaco Island. \"It's everywhere. There are a lot of people who aren't going to make it off this island.\"\n\nThose who planned to leave \u2014 to find work, child care and medical services \u2014 included residents whose houses survived.\n\n\"There is simply nothing left there,\" said Anita Pinder, a 38-year-old mother of two, told Reuters. \"It has vanished. It's just rubble.\"\n\nOthers got a head start. With a few meagre possessions stuffed in plastic bags, many Bahamians waited at the small airport in Treasure Cay, a sliver of land connected to Great Abaco which was known for its resort, now in ruins,\n\nSome of the waiting masses were promised a departure on Bahamasair, others on relief flights from volunteer groups or charters. Some were simply at the airport without a plan, hoping to find a ride to Nassau or the United States, and still others were there seeking supplies.\n\nThis week, Hurricane Dorian delivered catastrophic damage to the Bahamas. It was a Category 5 storm when it hit the island nation, with winds of up to 295 km/hr, and Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said it left \"generational devastation.\" Today on Front Burner, in the age of intensifying storms, two very different portraits of hurricane recovery. Janise Elie of the Guardian describes the devastation of the Caribbean Island of Dominica by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Then, Rice University assistant professor Max Besbris talks about how Houston, Texas rebuilt after Hurricane Harvey that same year. 24:26\n\nThe Treasure Cay airport has no lights, so planes cannot take off after sunset. Crowds began to gather by the runway as early as 4 a.m on Friday, a mix of those unable to catch a flight the previous day, as well as a new crop of evacuees.\n\nAround 250 evacuees arrived in Nassau, the capital, by boat on Friday afternoon, and a further 250 were expected later in the day, the National Voice of the Bahamas radio station reported, citing a NEMA spokesperson.\n\nMental health a concern\n\nSurvivors will also grapple with the emotional trauma triggered by the horrors of the preceding days, experts say.\n\nThe Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), which helps Caribbean nations finance social and economic programs, said this week it would provide almost $1 million in relief funds to the Bahamas. That's in addition to the traditional financial assistance it offers in the wake of such storms.\n\n\"Mental health is a new area for [the bank] and it has come out from close work with other countries in the region that have experienced natural disasters,\" its president William Warren Smith told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Friday in a phone interview.\n\n\"The ferociousness of these events has a major impact on people, not only on their day-to-day life but also their psychological conditions,\" he said.\n\nOn a flight to Nassau, which included three Reuters reporters, 22-year-old Paul Manochka worried about the future.\n\n\"Nassau is so small, so overpopulated already, I don't know if we'll find anything,\" Manochka said.\n\n\"We might have to go to another island, but there are no jobs on the other islands.\"", "description": "Residents of northern Grand Bahama island and the Abaco Islands have been forced to make very elemental decisions in the wake of Hurricane Dorian \u2014 whether to stay put and wait for aid, or to try and find a means of transportation to Nassau or even the U.S.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5274346.1567808222!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/storm-dorian.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
