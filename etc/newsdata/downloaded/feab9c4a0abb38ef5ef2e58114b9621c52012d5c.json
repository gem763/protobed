Jobs growth is averaging just 158,000 per month this year, compared with 223,000 in 2018.\n\nBut what\u2019s the problem? Is it a lack of demand for labor, or is it a lack of supply of qualified workers to fill positions?\n\nAlso read: Jobs report called \u2018meh\u2019 as hiring slows\n\nThe supply-side argument has supporters. Business groups have been complaining for years about the dearth of good applicants, which makes sense considering that the economy has created more than 21 million jobs in the past 10 years. At this point, there are few well-qualified people who haven\u2019t found work, which is why there are more job openings than unemployed workers.\n\nIt\u2019s demand, not supply\n\nThe payroll figures can\u2019t answer that question: supply or demand?\n\nBut the data on the number of hours worked suggest that the problem with the labor market right now is more a matter of weaker demand than weak supply. The logic here is that if businesses needed more labor but could not find anyone qualified to hire, they could always just give their existing staff more shifts or longer shifts.\n\nThe data demolish the supply-side arguments. Despite some small improvement in August versus July, the average workweek is down from 33.8 hours a year ago to 33.6 hours in August. In manufacturing, the average workweek has declined from 42.2 hours to 41.6. (This number is part of the index of leading economic indicators that signals turning points in the economy.)\n\nIn the hospitality and food service sectors, the average workweek is down from 24.9 hours to 24.6.\n\nA broadest gauge of the health of the labor market \u2014 the total number of hours worked by all employees \u2014 has increased by just 1.2% over the past year, down from a peak of 2.5% in September of last year. Aside from a couple of months during the slump of 2016, this is the slowest growth of aggregate hours since 2010.\n\nHours worked in manufacturing are stagnant.\n\nIf you look at hours worked by sector, you can see clearly where the problems are: Manufacturing hours are up just 0.1% over the past year, including a 0.4% decline in nondurable manufacturing. A year ago, manufacturing hours were rising 2.6%, the fastest pace in six years.\n\nHours in the related industries of transportation and warehousing are up just 0.4% after a 5.3% increase a year ago.\n\nRetail is another sector that\u2019s hurting, not because consumers aren\u2019t shopping, but because of the secular shift toward buying online and in big warehouse stores that don\u2019t require as many workers. Hours worked in retail have fallen 0.8% in the past year, even as sales have risen 3.4%.\n\nEven so, the services side of the economy is holding up better than the goods-producing sectors. Total hours worked in services are up 1.5%, compared with 2.1% a year ago. Two of the largest sectors \u2014 professional and business services and education and health services \u2014 haven\u2019t slowed much at all.\n\nReversion to mean, and something more\n\nThese data confirm what we\u2019ve seen in other reports. The economy is slowing from a 3% annual pace to something closer to 2%. That\u2019s exactly what was predicted when the big tax cut bill of 2017 was passed.\n\nWe\u2019ve reverted to the baseline growth rate. But something else is happening \u2014 the slowdown in global growth and trade, the lack of capital spending by businesses, and the tariff wars are taking a big toll on manufacturing, and that\u2019s rippling through the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates again in a couple of weeks in an effort to stimulate demand. But it\u2019s hard to fathom what lower rates would do to resolve the tariff wars or the generalized global slowdown. And capital spending surely won\u2019t perk up until those fundamental headwinds are resolved.", "description": "Job growth is slowing as predicting.
