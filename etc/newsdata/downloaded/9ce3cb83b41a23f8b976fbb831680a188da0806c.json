The secret growth of this dangerous mass surveillance tool is undemocratic and unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThere must be an urgent stop to this privacy disaster before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nAnna Bacciarelli, technology and human rights adviser at Amnesty International, said the technology may also threaten freedom of expression, association and assembly.\n\n\u201cYet this technology is being used across the UK without adequate oversight and accountability,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cGiven the huge risks to human rights, we urgently need a public debate about how and why this technology is being used \u2013 and who stands to benefit from its use.\u201d\n\nThe government said a new Biometrics Oversight Board would oversee the technology, and it is working with police to produce operational guidance.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe support the police as they trial new technologies to protect the public, including facial recognition, which has helped them identify, locate and arrest suspects that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have been possible.\n\n\u201cThe government welcomes the recent judgment which confirms that there is a clear and sufficient legal framework for the use of live facial recognition technology, including primary legislation.\n\n\u201cThe government is always willing to consider specific proposals to improve the legal framework to promote public safety and confidence in the police.\u201d", "description": "The Labour Party has pledged to regulate facial recognition if it wins power at the next election amid concern over the spread of the \u201clawless\u201d technology. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, told The Independent its use by both police forces and private companies threatens the public\u2019s right to privacy.", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/09/13/facialrecognition-ban.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
