According to the Amazon CEO, the company's fixed cost business model would bring long-term success, and he was correct.\n\n\"We had gone public on a split-adjusted basis, $1.50 a share in today's terms, and the market became very quickly an internet bubble kind of market,\" Bezos said at the Bush Center Forum on Leadership in 2018. \"The stock prices went up very, very high.\"\n\nBut even when the stock went far down, Bezos said he always \"preached\" to employees at all-hands meetings, telling them to not worry.\n\n\"I liked our business, and I liked the fundamentals of our business, but I also knew that the stock price was disconnected from what we were doing on a day-to-day basis,\" he said at the forum.", "description": "You probably won't find Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos stressing over stock price.
