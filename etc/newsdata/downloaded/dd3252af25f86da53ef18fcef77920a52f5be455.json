REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said the company\u2019s public policy team is working on proposed regulations around facial recognition, a fledgling technology that has drawn criticism of the technology giant\u2019s cloud computing unit.\n\n\u201cOur public policy team is actually working on facial recognition regulations, and it makes a lot of sense to regulate that,\u201d Bezos told reporters at the company\u2019s annual Alexa devices launch in Seattle on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of something that has really positive uses, so you don\u2019t want to put the brakes on it. At the same time, there\u2019s lots of potential for abuses with that kind of technology, and so you do want regulations.\u201d\n\nCritics have pointed to technology from Amazon and others that struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin in recent studies. That has prompted fears of unjust arrests if the technology is used by more law enforcement agencies to identify suspects.\n\nAmazon has faced more criticism than rivals in part because it has marketed the technology to police, and it has defended its practices. The company has said all users of its service, known as Rekognition, must follow the law.\n\nThe growing interest in regulation underscores discontent in the United States over the technology, which government agencies have used for years and now has become more powerful with the rise of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies. San Francisco and Oakland voted this year to ban city personnel from using it.\n\nMicrosoft Corp executives, including its president Brad Smith, have also called for regulation of the technology.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said the company's public policy team is working on proposed regulations around facial recognition, a fledgling technology that has drawn criticism of the technology giant's cloud computing unit.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Dastin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433943570&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O2FE", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
