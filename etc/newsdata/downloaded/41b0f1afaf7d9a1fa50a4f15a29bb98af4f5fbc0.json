Jets already down Darnold, lose Siemian at QB", "language": "en", "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - First, Sam Darnold. Then, Trevor Siemian.\n\nWell, now what?\n\nThat\u2019s the question Adam Gase and the struggling and short-handed New York Jets are faced with at the quarterback spot just two games into the season.\n\n\u201cObviously, it always causes a problem when a quarterback changes,\u201d running back Le\u2019Veon Bell said after a 23-3 loss to Cleveland on Monday night. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t how the quarterback played. We just didn\u2019t execute enough for us to get a win today.\u201d\n\nLuke Falk, the Jets\u2018 No. 3 quarterback, was promoted a few hours before the game - and found himself on the field as the only healthy player at the position after Siemian went down with an ankle injury in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a weird week,\u201d Falk said. \u201cA week ago, I was on the practice squad and then tonight I\u2019m standing in front of you guys after playing in a game.\u201d\n\nIt certainly was an unexpected development, and sent the Jets into quite a quarterback quandary. New York will likely be in the market to sign another passer or two this week as it prepares to play at New England next Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe might have to,\u201d Gase said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re down to one.\u201d\n\nDarnold was diagnosed with mononucleosis last week and will likely miss several more games while recovering.\n\nThat was the reason Siemian got the start against the Browns. But, his Jets debut ended painfully.\n\nSiemian threw a long incomplete pass to Ryan Griffin, but Cleveland\u2019s Myles Garrett slammed into him and fell on top of him - and the Browns defensive end was penalized for roughing the passer.\n\nSiemian stayed down for several minutes as trainers attended to him on the field. The quarterback was able to get up under his own power, but very gingerly and with a limp. He was officially ruled out for the rest of the game when the second half began and was scheduled to have an MRI on Tuesday morning.\n\nSiemian was seen on crutches and his left foot in a walking boot in the locker room after the game.\n\nFalk replaced Siemian with 7:58 left in the first half and helped the Jets get their first points on a 46-yard field goal by Sam Ficken, the team\u2019s fourth kicker since July.\n\nSiemian finished 3 of 6 for 3 yards, while Falk was 20 of 25 for 198 yards in his NFL debut as the Jets lost their seventh straight at home, dating to last season.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at it, we\u2019re going to have to look at all of our guys and see who\u2019s doing their job and who is not,\u201d Gase said of his offense. \u201cDo we have to move pieces around? Do we have to change some things up?\n\n\u201cI thought Luke did a really good job tonight. He started off kind of slow. I was just trying to ease him into the game a little bit. He was on the practice squad yesterday.\u201d\n\nNew York rolled up just 262 total yards, went 2 for 14 on third downs and made it into the red zone just once.\n\nThat was when Falk led the Jets on their longest drive of the night - 60 yards - but Bell could only get 1 yard on a fourth-and-2 pass, turning the ball over on downs at the Browns 11.\n\nOn the next play, Baker Mayfield hit Odell Beckham Jr. with a slant pass, and the receiver outran the Jets\u2018 defenders all the way to the end zone for an 89-yard TD that put Cleveland up 23-3 with 3:32 remaining in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cLuke played well,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThe quarterback situation wasn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s guys getting on the details. \u2026 We were hurting ourselves, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThat meant too many penalties - 12 for 89 yards - too many drops, not enough blocks and too few plays made. The Jets also allowed four sacks, and eight quarterback hits.\n\n\u201cWe have to take a hard look at this,\u201d Gase said, \u201cand figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nNOTES: CB Trumaine Johnson was replaced in the starting lineup by Nate Hairston, a move Gase simply said was \u201cjust our decision.\u201d Johnson entered the season as the Jets\u2018 top player at the position, and said he was \u201cin and out\u201d all week with the first-team defense during practice, so he was surprised he didn\u2019t play until late in the game. \u201cOf course I was upset,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about me. I was supporting my guys out there today.\u201d Gase said Johnson\u2019s benching was not disciplinary. \u2026 LB Jordan Jenkins left with a calf injury, but he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s serious.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "First, Sam Darnold.
