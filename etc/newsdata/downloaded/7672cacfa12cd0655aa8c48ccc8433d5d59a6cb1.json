According to CNN, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer is looking for a personal lawyer. Though he did not comment to the network whether or not he hired new representation, CNN reports that he has been in contact with at least three defense attorneys and that \u201cpeople close to [him]\u201d have been advising him to lawyer up.\n\nThere are many reasons for Giuliani \u2014 who, according to former National Security Council member Fiona Hill, was running a shadow State department in Ukraine \u2014 to have a robust legal team, let alone a single personal lawyer. There\u2019s the criminal investigation conducted by the FBI and his former office at the Southern District of New York, determining if he broke any laws while lobbying in Ukraine with his two recently arraigned associates and all-around-stand-up-guys Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. There\u2019s also the reported counterintelligence investigation, determining if his actions have undermined national security \u2014 perhaps the greatest bit of irony in the Ukraine scandal, considering Giuliani was brought on to defend Trump against similar charges in the Russia investigation.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that the State Department has 30 days to release records related to the Ukraine scandal, including any forms of communication between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani. In the next month, lawyers at State and from the watchdog group American Oversight will determine which documents will be released, and which will remain redacted.\n\nGiuliani, positioned outside the administration, is expected to be particularly vulnerable to having his communication made public. \u201cThe judge zeroed in on communications with Rudy Giuliani to be most subject to public disclosure,\u201d said American Oversight executive director Austin Evers. \u201cWhy? Because he doesn\u2019t work for the government.\u201d Considering how damning the communication already released in the Ukraine scandal has been, it may be time for Giuliani to stop ignoring his friends\u2019 advice and to start retaining a lawyer.", "description": "According to CNN, Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is shopping for lawyers again, as he faces a criminal and a reported counterintelligence investigation into his actions in Ukraine with his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/giuliani.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
