It is the highest amount of pre-orders ever for the Galaxy series in its home country.\n\nConsumers at the end of their 2-year contracts, as well as a lack of available 5G smartphones, are thought to be why demand has been so high for the Galaxy Note 10 devices.\n\nThe main competitor against the Galaxy Note 10 devices, LG's V60 ThinQ, is expected to be unveiled at the IFA tradeshow next month and will only go on sale in September at the earliest.\n\nOnly the 5G versions of the Galaxy Note 10 devices are currently being sold in South Korea, with the LTE-only devices not being available.\n\nSee also: Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus vs Note 9 - Is it worth the upgrade?\n\nOn the same day, South Korea's incumbent telco SK Telecom also announced that it had secured 1 million 5G subscribers.\n\nRunner-up KT, meanwhile, has secured 750,000 5G subscribers so far while third place LG Uplus -- which has not revealed its numbers -- is estimated to have up to 600,000 subscribers.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant is also set to launch the long-awaited Galaxy Fold in September. The company's mobile boss has previously said it would only launch the 5G version of the foldable device in South Korea, citing further growth in South Korean 5G subscription numbers as the motivator behind the decision.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Fold's success will be crucial for Samsung as its second quarter profit was halved from the year prior due to slower smartphone sales and a dramatic decline in memory semiconductor prices.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSamsung boss calls for software talent boost\n\nSamsung boss JY Lee is calling out for the recruitment of software talent in a rare visit to one of the conglomerate's education centres.\n\nJapan approves material for Samsung chips: Report\n\nJapan has approved the export of another batch of photoresist to South Korea, a key material needed for Samsung's EUV chip process.\n\nGalaxy Note 10 Plus: So far I'm undecided and here's why\n\nA few thoughts after using the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for 24 hours.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus first look: Design, productivity, creativity, and performance\n\nSamsung just announced its yearly Galaxy Note series update with the Note 10 and Note 10 Plus.
