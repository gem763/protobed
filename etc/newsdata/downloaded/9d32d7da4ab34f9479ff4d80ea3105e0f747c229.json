All six friends in Friends, ranked from worst to best 1/6 6. Joey Tribbiani Sure, over the years, Joey provided the show with some of its best-known one-liners (see: \u201cJoey doesn\u2019t share food!\u201d and \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d). He was also a recurrent source of situational comedy (see: Joey locking himself into his media unit to prove a point, only for all his and Chandler\u2019s belongings to get robbed). Still, it\u2019s hard to compare his goofiness to Chandler\u2019s dryness or Phoebe\u2019s knack for the absurd. Getty Images/NBC/Newsmakers 2/6 5. Ross Geller (tie) Ross probably thought he was a good guy, but his record shows otherwise. He cheated on Rachel (no, they were not on a break) then tried to get her back; he dated one of his students; he challenged Phoebe\u2019s belief that her mother had been reincarnated in a cat (which, sure, he\u2019s entitled to his doubts, but could he not just drop it?); and he wasn\u2019t the best brother to Monica, nor was he the best father to his son Ben. Getty Images/Warner Bros Television 3/6 5. Monica Geller (tie) This might be an unpopular opinion, since Monica is such a beloved character, but: I have never found her laugh-out-loud funny. Sure, her excessive competitiveness and cleanliness were amusing, but it was no match for Phoebe\u2019s otherworldliness or Chandler\u2019s bitterness. Sorry. Getty Images/Courtesy of Warner Bros 4/6 3. Rachel Green Rachel had her moments \u2013 and boy, were they great moments. She sang \u201cCopacabana\u201d in that terrible bridesmaid dress at her ex-fiance\u2019s Barry\u2019s wedding, for one. She fell violently to the ground while trying to escape from Ross and his new girlfriend Julie during an ill-fated attempt to welcome Ross at the airport. She unsuccessfully tried to woo her crush Joshua with a cheerleading routine at a party. Let\u2019s make it official: Rachel was a hoot. Getty Images/NBC 5/6 2. Chandler Bing Chandler\u2019s friends derided Chandler\u2019s humour pretty much every time as they acknowledged it \u2013 undeservedly so. The man was a master at banter! Sure, he used it as a defense mechanism, but who could blame him? Plus, he wasn\u2019t great at the advice, but he could always interest you in a sarcastic comment. Getty Images/Paul Drinkwater NBC/Delivered by Onile USA Inc 6/6 1. Phoebe Buffay Phoebe was so wonderfully weird in a way that made her one of the funniest of the bunch. Remember when she sang along to Ross\u2019s terrible attempt at playing the bagpipes? What about when she told Rachel her maternity trousers would be great for shoplifting melons? Good times.
