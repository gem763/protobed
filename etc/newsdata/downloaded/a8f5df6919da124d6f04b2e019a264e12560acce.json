It automatically syncs your saved credit cards wherever your Google account is logged in for quick payments, and it will import loyalty cards, tickets, and offers from your Gmail account. Google Pay is supported at most major markets, gas stations, and department stores.\n\nSetting up Google Pay is straightforward.\n\nWhat do I need to set up Google Pay?\n\nYou need a debit / credit card or PayPal account, a Google account, and a supported Google Pay device (a non-rooted Android phone using KitKat 4.4 and up, a Wear OS watch, or a desktop / laptop computer). You can even use it with an iOS device (although you can only use the account to pay online, not in a store).\n\nHow do I add payment accounts to Google Pay?\n\nIf you only plan to use Google Pay online to pay for, say, Google Play movies or apps, then you can set up your account from your Google Play app. Just tap on the menu icon (the three parallel lines) in the upper left corner, and select \u201cPayment methods.\u201d This is where you can add a PayPal account, a credit card, or debit account, which Google Pay will use whenever you buy something like an app directly through Google. You can add several accounts if you want.\n\nIf you want to change or remove a payment method \u2014 for example, a credit card that you\u2019re no longer using \u2014 it\u2019s not difficult. Just go to the same \u201cPayment methods\u201d page, and tap on \u201cMore payment settings\u201d at the bottom of the page. You\u2019ll see a list of your current payment methods, with buttons to \u201cRemove\u201d or \u201cEdit\u201d at the bottom of each.\n\nOn the other hand, if you plan to use Google Pay on your phone to make payments at a store, you\u2019ll need to use the Google Pay app. (Chances are, it\u2019s already on your phone.)\n\nDownload the Google Pay app from the Play Store. If you have more than one Google account, you\u2019ll be asked which account you want to use with it.\n\nAgree to the Google Pay terms of service and the Google privacy policy. (You can click on the links to find out more.) Otherwise, click on \u201cGet started.\u201d\n\nAdd a payment method by tapping on \u201cSet it up.\u201d This will take you to the \u201cChoose a card\u201d screen; if you\u2019ve already registered a card or PayPal account with Google (via the above method), it will be listed. Otherwise, you can add a payment method at this point.\n\nNote: You can\u2019t add PayPal to your Google Pay account through the Google Pay app. However, you can add it via the web page or through your Google Play app. Once you do that, your PayPal account will appear as a method of payment in the Google Pay app itself.\n\nYou\u2019re set. From the main screen, you can send money using Google Pay, watch a video about the security methods involved, and see your recent payment activity, among other things.\n\nIf you want, you can also manage your account on the web by going to the Google Pay account page.\n\nWhere can I use Google Pay?\n\nIn the real world, you can use Google Pay just about anywhere you see a credit card terminal with these above symbols. From there, all you need to do is move your phone or watch up to the terminal\u2019s contact point, then wait for the blue checkmark to indicate that your Google Pay account info has been received.\n\nIf I can\u2019t pay in store with an iPhone, what can I do with Google Pay?\n\nThere\u2019s only one current workaround to use Google Pay with an iPhone, and it requires a paired and supported Wear OS watch with an NFC chip. Otherwise, you can only send and receive payments between Google Pay users.\n\nIs Google Pay secure?\n\nFor those of you worrying about merchants having your credit card number when you tap to pay, here\u2019s how Google protects your info: a temporary, encrypted number is shared with merchants, never the actual number.\n\nIf you lose your phone, the Android Device Manager can be accessed from any computer with your Google account. From there, you can lock, locate, or remotely wipe your phone and all of its contents.\n\nUpdate August 29th, 2019, 5PM ET: This article was originally published on May 16th, 2018.
