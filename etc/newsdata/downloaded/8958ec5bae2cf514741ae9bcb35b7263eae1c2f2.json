Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs area along with the rest of the United Kingdom - and the province's institutions would be able to opt to exit the regulatory zone - a step too far for Ireland and the EU.\n\nIt was unclear what Johnson agreed with Varadkar.\n\n\"If Barclay delivers the detail of what Johnson discussed with Varadkar yesterday, we may go into more intense talks over the weekend,\" one senior EU diplomat said.\n\nBritain's Northern Ireland minister said that no single party in Northern Ireland would be given a veto in any Brexit deal, but that an agreement was now \"a distinct possibility\".\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which supports Johnson's minority government, would have an effective veto on post-Brexit customs checks on the Irish border under proposals put forward by Johnson last week.\n\nEducation minister Gavin Williamson restated the government's line that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may, telling ITV: \"We need to see the European Union shift.\"\n\n(Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "description": "The chief Brexit negotiators of the European Union and Britain were meeting for breakfast on Friday, hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart unexpectedly said they had found a pathway to a possible deal at last-ditch talks.
