Or at least, he hadn\u2019t until now.\n\nThis was a watershed moment for the finally fully fit No 8, who coach Jones says he cannot wrap in cotton wool because it does him more harm than good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then he tweaked his left ankle, had it heavily strapped, and did not emerge after half-time.\n\nThe glib Jones response to a question about him afterwards \u2013 \u2018I think he had too much Kobe beef, mate\u2019 \u2013 will not calm any nerves.\n\nJoe Marler, who covers both prop positions, limped off too with a worrying-looking hamstring problem.\n\nCourtney Lawes\n\nCourtney Lawes has an all-too familiar conversation with the referee (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhen Courtney Lawes gets it right, he\u2019s one of the most destructive players in the world. When he gets it wrong, the most self-destructive.\n\nLawes had barely been on the pitch a few minutes when he jumped into a forlorn charge-down and caught Argentine full-back Emiliano Boffelli on the way through.\n\nHaving left the ground, he was lucky not to have caught the kicker worse, which would surely have seen Owens reproduce a card.\n\nOwen Farrell\n\nFarrell showed plenty of guile and quality with ball in hand \u2013 a beautiful flat pass to Jack Nowell gave him the space to wriggle free \u2013 but from the tee he was woeful.\n\nOne correspondent suggested that Lavanini\u2019s hit on the captain may have accounted for his four missed first-half kicks but he had already sclaffed one wide by that point.\n\nHis next was horribly hooked from the middle of the field and by the time Ben Youngs scored, you had no confidence in Farrell making it one from four.\n\nHe finally rectified the situation after the break but admitted afterwards he would be working on his kicking this coming week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeroes\n\nNigel Owens\n\nNigel Owens did his best to keep the peace in a highly-charged encounter (Picture: Getty)\n\nNot so much a hero for England, but certainly a hero for the game. This was a potential powder-keg of a fixture and World Rugby put their best man on duty.\n\nOwens was at his brilliant best early on \u2013 \u2018a little bit less talking now lads and a little bit more scrummaging please\u2019 \u2013 and was cool, calm and collected when required to dismiss Tomas Lavanini, admitting his initial view was wrong and agreeing with the replay.\n\nEven when it threatened to boil over, as it did on three separate occasions, he managed to keep the two teams away from out-and-out violence. If Wales do not make the final, he must be a shoo-in for the gig.\n\nSam Underhill\n\nRightfully given the official Man of the Match award for his tireless efforts at openside , the Bath flanker showed the other side of his game today.\n\nHe was aptly described on commentary as a \u2018truffle pig\u2019 of a player in recognition of his work at the breakdown, but he unleashed the warthog against Argentina, showing he can be the powerful carrier that some fear a combination of he and Tom Carry lack.\n\nHe topped the England tackle count with 16 and produced six powerful carries and an offload.\n\nGeorge Ford\n\nEddie Jones may always have intended to return to the Ford-Farrell axis, as he did for the first time in a year against Ireland over summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf so, it is a stroke of genius. Ford showed all of his play-making abilities against Argentina, his cultured boot ensuring England exploited the space offered by the one-man advantage properly.\n\n\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f Go Jonny, go, go!
