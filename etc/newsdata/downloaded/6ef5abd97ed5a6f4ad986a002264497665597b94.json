But he insisted there was no economic crisis right now.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"We have a federal budget that works without new debt. Our massive investments and expansionary fiscal policies of recent years have worked without new debt - and will do so for the time to come,\" Mr Scholz said.\n\n\"But of course in case of an economic crisis, which so far is not emerging, we have all fiscal options on the table,\" Mr Scholz said, suggesting that Germany's mantra of no new debt to finance a fiscal stimulus package was not set in stone.\n\nThe German government will lower its 2020 forecast for economic growth to 1.0 per cent from an earlier estimate of 1.5 per cent, a source familiar with the projection told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe source said Germany still expects this year's gross domestic product to grow 0.5 per cent. The government is expected to update its economic growth projections on Thursday.\n\nUnder the German debt brake rule, the federal government can take on new debt of up to 0.35 per cent of economic output. That would be roughly 5 billion euros (S$7.5 billion) in 2020 after special factors such as growth and the outflow of earmarked money from special-purpose funds have been taken into account.\n\nThe permitted debt would rise to 8.4 billion euros in 2021 and 9.7 billion euros in 2022, according to budget experts.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BERLIN] Germany intends to stick to its balanced budget rules for now and boost spending without incurring new debt, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that the government would use all fiscal options in a severe economic crisis. .
