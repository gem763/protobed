(And those \u201cinternationals\u201d must always be so right, eh?)\n\nIt was one of those days, frankly, where one astute observer\u2019s eight out of ten in the scrumhalf\u2019s case might have another acceptably cerebral individual\u2019s four. (I wouldn\u2019t hang either for their views.)\n\nI landed, for my heinous sins, somewhere in between with a 6.5 for the former Lions sparkplug, making due acknowledgement of his energy-laden display, including a very vital role in the Boks\u2019 committed, often physically punishing rush-up defence.\n\nBut I also felt compelled to moderate my hero worship on the grounds that De Klerk\u2019s kicking also went to extremes, while - not irrelevantly, surely? - only an unsatisfactorily small percentage of his hoists were actually retrieved back by the Boks in contestation.\n\nAgainst the co-cream of Test teams, and with due respect to the still-emerging Japanese, I remain hugely less than convinced it would be a passport to Bok success on the scoreboard after 80 minutes.\n\nEven if box-kicking surfaces again from the Springboks in the genuinely red-letter phase now of RWC 2019, I suspect it will be on a more toned-down basis against teams far likelier to punish them emphatically for inaccuracy in execution.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to brand the tactic at least some degree of a passion-killer in rugby, a cop-out; dour invitation to the opposition to be the ones \u201cplaying the rugby\u201d.\n\nBut I also feel it extremely necessary to add this much: it hasn\u2019t, for the large part, prevented the Erasmus-era Boks from being very comfortable, often enough thrilling strikers in the try column (while also letting little in the other way, of course: only three tries against them at RWC so far).\n\nThis year alone, in both pre-World Cup Tests and at the tournament itself, South Africa have amassed 49 tries from 10 matches, so an average of a shade under five per game.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as many as 19 of them have gone to wings (38.77 percent) - the position where you\u2019d most expect tries to commonly come from if many of your attacking systems are firing with pleasing smoothness.\n\nDespite the low-risk, suffocating approach of the Boks for large tracts of the quarter-final, they got the seriously prolific Makazole Mapimpi over the whitewash twice amidst their three dot-downs overall and the second was especially easy on the eye: a long-range raid sparked by a Handre Pollard break from well in the Bok half and also featuring deft link-up from the previously error-prone Willie le Roux.\n\nIt would warrant consideration among any \u201ctop 10 tries of the World Cup\u201d sort of compilation.\n\nSouth Africa aren\u2019t winning Tests - as they occasionally weren\u2019t averse to in days past, remember? - by eight penalties to two tries.\n\nNo, you can\u2019t really accuse the Rassie-generation Boks of that.\n\nThose bloody box-kicks and all \u2026\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "While the obvious conservatism of box-kicking isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, it hasn\u2019t thwarted the Boks from regularly scoring sparkling tries, reminds <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Comment", "Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/4526796c451a46d2aef7249c53afd39f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
