We don't think it's ill, it's diving and surfacing pattern is normal for the species.\n\n'It doesn't look fully grown, but there's nothing we can do ourselves as the humpback is a protected species.\n\n'But there's plenty of food in the Thames it can eat so we just have to wait and see what happens.'\n\nThe whale is pictured in the Thames Estuary over the weekend\n\nThe charity tweeted yesterday: 'We observed the humpback whale in the Thames estuary for just just over 3 hours today, the whale was diving and surfacing at approximately 5-6 minute intervals, slowly moving down river with the outgoing tide.'\n\nThe mammal was first seen after midnight, between Crayford Ness and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, Dartford, Kent - more than 60 miles in land from the sea.\n\nPolice Constable Dempster, a member of the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit witnessed the sea creature, which in adult form can weigh up to 30 metric tons, during an overnight patrol.\n\nHe tweeted: 'It was spectacular! Was gobsmacked it was so big. Would estimate about 15 meters.'\n\nDavid Callahan, who spotted the whale further along near Rainham, Essex tweeted: 'It looked to be about eight metres long.\n\nA map shows where the humpback whale has been seen in the past few days\n\n'Remarkably undisturbed by container ships going up and down. Just kept on diving. It's hard to imagine much food for it there.'\n\nThe RSPCA said at the time there were 'no major concerns' for the creature.\n\nBenny the Beluga was spotted regularly by boat crews and local residents after he first appeared in the water in September.\n\nHe appeared to be happy living around London and Kent, but finally returned to the sea in May after eight months in the area.\n\nHe had a Twitter account dedicated to him with almost 80 followers, with a local brewery even named a beer after him.\n\nBenny even prompted a local council to postpone Bonfire Night celebrations out of fears for his safety.", "description": "The aquatic mammal was first seen by several people near the Dartford Bridge in Kent on Sunday and then again in Erith and Dagenham this morning.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390026-0-image-a-35_1570443388580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
