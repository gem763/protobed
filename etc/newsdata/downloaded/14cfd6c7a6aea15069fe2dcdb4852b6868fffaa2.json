The equation is simple: without cash, the budget cannot be properly implemented.\"\n\nUN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement published Tuesday that, by the end of September, member states had paid only 70% of the total assessment for the regular budget.\n\nThat compares with 78% at the same time of year in 2018.\n\nThe UN said that while 129 member states had paid their dues for the organization's 2019 budget by Tuesday \u2014 the most recent being war-torn Syria \u2014 64 others were still required to pay \"urgently and in full.\"\n\nIt said there is an outstanding amount of $1.3 billion for the year.", "description": "The United Nations (UN) is facing its \"worst cash crisis\" in nearly a decade, according to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106171946-1570612313708gettyimages-1170693364.jpeg?v=1570612394", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
