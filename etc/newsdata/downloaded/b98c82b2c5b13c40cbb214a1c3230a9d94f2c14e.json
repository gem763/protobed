Cory Booker of New Jersey, another of more than a dozen candidates currently seeking the Democratic nod, similarly said last week that he will likely exit the race if he falls to reach a fundraising goal at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue this without more support,\u201d Mr. Booker said over the weekend. \u201cI won\u2019t continue this unless I can look people in the eye and say we have a chance to win it.\u201d\n\nTwelve candidates so far have qualified to compete in the fourth debate next month, including Mr. Castro and Mr. Booker, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Bernard Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, businessman Andrew Yang, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, activist Tom Steyer and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nAn exact date and location for the fifth debate have not yet been announced. Candidates will have up until a week beforehand to qualify to compete, according to the DNC.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
