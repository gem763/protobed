The new company leaders, the former Chief Financial Officer Artie Minson and Vice Chair Sebastian Gunningham, are looking to focus on WeWork\u2019s main business of leasing office space, refurbishing it and renting it out to businesses on shorter terms.\n\nWeWork is also planning to sell three businesses acquired in recent years: event organizing platform Meetup, office management startup Managed by Q and marketing company Conductor, according to the person. There is interest already in buying Conductor, the person added. In addition to the potential sales, WeWork may also turn to job cuts, which one person familiar with the matter said could number in the thousands for a staff of more than 12,000. WeWork declined to comment for this story.\n\nWeWork is still seeking sources of cash. Its initial public offering, originally planned for September, was meant to provide the company with $3 billion and give it access to another $6 billion in a credit facility, enabling continued breakneck global growth. Instead, the IPO went up in flames in the past two weeks over criticisms of WeWork\u2019s corporate governance, its rapidly growing losses and its sinking valuation expected in the public markets. The tumult after Neumann\u2019s departure on Tuesday has likely pushed the IPO back to 2020, according to people familiar with the matter. That would threaten the credit facility, but the company is in talks with investment banks about a new $3 billion loan contingent on raising new equity.\n\nBusiness Insider earlier reported news of the possible jet sale.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Robin Ajello\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- After the sudden ouster of WeWork Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Adam Neumann on Tuesday, the co-working giant\u2019s two new co-CEOs pledged in an email to staff to \u201cstrengthen our core business.\u201d They\u2019re starting by selling Neumann\u2019s private jet.WeWork parent We Co. is selling the $60 million Gulfstream", "authors": ["Ellen Huet"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
