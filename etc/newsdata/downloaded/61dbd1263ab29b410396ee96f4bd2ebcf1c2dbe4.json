And for a while, Peterson did just that, churning yards and barreling his way past defenders in the open field, en route to a 1,000-yard rushing season.\n\nNow, so much has changed.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJay Gruden\u2019s tone toward Peterson\u2019s presence has noticeably shifted. And the importance of the seven-time Pro Bowler in Washington\u2019s offense has diminished \u2014 so much so, that Peterson was a healthy scratch in Washington\u2019s season opener at the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAdrian Peterson is once again the workhorse running back for the Redskins. But how much work is he going to get? (Getty Images)\n\nMore telling: Had it not been for Derrius Guice\u2019s knee injury, Peterson likely would have been a non-factor for a second straight week, an afterthought in Gruden\u2019s system. But with Guice, their promising 2018 second-round pick sidelined six-to-eight weeks, the Redskins coach was left with no choice but to start the aging wonder against the division-rival Dallas Cowboys.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\n\u201cObviously, being a veteran guy and coming off the year I had last year it wasn\u2019t the most pleasant situation,\u201d Peterson told Yahoo Sports after the Cowboys\u2019 31-21 win. \u201cBut it was what it was at that time, so I just had to control what I could control. And that was helping the guys out as much as possible during the week and trying to be a coach on the sideline and let them know what I see. So, that\u2019s all I could do. Now that things have changed, I\u2019m just trying to focus on what I can do to help this team win.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBut on a day in which he passed his longtime idol, Jim Brown, for fifth on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing touchdowns list, Peterson\u2019s noticeable absence on the field as the game wore on spoke volumes.\n\nIn a game the Redskins desperately needed to win, on an afternoon when half of the FedEx Field crowd was clad in blue and white, and at a time when Washington\u2019s roster is depleted by injury, the 34-year-old Peterson was rendered a spectator as the game wore on.\n\nHis 1-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter gave the Redskins a 7-0 lead and placed Peterson (107) behind only Walter Payton (110), Marcus Allen (123), LaDainian Tomlinson (145) and Emmitt Smith (164) on the all-time rushing TD list. The milestone was bittersweet because of the loss \u2014 which dropped Washington to 0-2 \u2014 and the precarious position Peterson now finds himself in.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer smiled when asked how he went from \u201cRB 1\u201d to inactive so seamlessly. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know,\u201d replied the running back, who rushed 10 times for 25 yards and caught two passes for seven yards against the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure many people were trying to understand it. An unfortunate injury and things just kind of shifted back. It sucks that [Guice] had to go down. He got injured and it was like, bam, now I guess we\u2019re going to the \u2018next man up.\u2019\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, it was a different Guice injury that had paved the way for Peterson\u2019s arrival last summer. When the rookie running back tore his ACL in the team\u2019s preseason opener against New England, the Redskins signed Peterson.\n\nIn his Washington debut, he rushed 26 times for 96 yards while hauling in two receptions for 70 yards to pace the Redskins to a 24-6 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIt was vintage \u201cAP.\u201d\n\nPhysical.\n\nRelentless.\n\nHe would finish 2018 with 1,042 rushing yards and seven rushing TDs. He also caught 20 passes for 208 yards.\n\nA year later, his head coach can no longer hide what little use he has for Peterson.\n\nAsked last week to explain why the veteran running back didn\u2019t suit up against the Eagles, Gruden uttered words that already have come back to bite him: \"If we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in a game in I-formation then sure,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ll get him up.\"\n\nBut without the shifty, speedy Guice, Gruden has no choice but to put in Peterson. Begrudgingly.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s Fox broadcast, sideline reporter Pam Oliver said on air that Gruden feels Peterson\u2019s \u201cNorth-South\u201d running style \u201climits the offense and gives the defense way too many opportunities.\u201d\n\nThat begs the question: If Gruden isn\u2019t enamored with Peterson, why is he still on the roster?\n\nWith Guice coming off ACL surgery, Gruden saw Peterson as an insurance policy \u2014 one the coach never anticipated needing to use. But now, the presumed backup is again a starter.\n\nFor now.\n\nAs the Cowboys increased their single-digit, second-quarter lead to a 21-7 margin in the third, the Redskins relied less on the run. And less on Peterson.\n\nAsked about the sudden status change, going form inactive to being a starter again, Peterson replied: \u201cTo be honest with you, it is what it is now.\u201d\n\nHe smiled again.\n\n\u201cWhen the injury happened, it was like, OK. It\u2019s next man up. It is what it is now, so. I\u2019m still locked in on what we had to accomplish. And now it\u2019s just get back into rhythm.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "If Gruden isn\u2019t enamored with Peterson, why is he still on the roster?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oxYLyBLw1jDUDGPPeylDLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODguNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bRplkbqw8ikWIGhNFG0O.g--~B/aD0xMjEwO3c9MTc0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/afc11ca0-d82c-11e9-befd-cdf643e236b8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
