And Japan said Monday that capital spending by the country\u2019s manufacturers fell 6.9% in the April-June quarter, the first decline in two years, as companies grappled with a nearly double-digit decline in exports to China.\n\n\u201cGiven that there is no sign of recovery in Japan\u2019s exports due to the U.S.-China trade friction, the downtrend in manufacturers\u2019 profits and capital expenditures is expected to continue,\u201d said NLI Research Institute analyst Taro Saito.\n\nOn Sunday, the U.S. went ahead with new tariffs of 15% on clothing and other imports valued at $111 billion last year, on top of 25% tariffs previously imposed on about $250 billion of Chinese imports.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s industry minister, Sung Yun-mo, cited the rising tariffs as a warning sign alongside other regional tensions including Japan\u2019s tighter restrictions on exports to South Korea. Tokyo attributed the restrictions to its lack of trust in Seoul after disputes over Japan\u2019s colonial legacy.\n\n\u201cThe growing trade feud between the United States and China, along with Japan\u2019s export curbs and the Hong Kong crisis sparked uncertainties in the global business environment,\u201d Mr. Sung said.\n\nBoth Japan and South Korea have said the effect is particularly pronounced in high-tech parts and materials purchased by factories in China, such as Japanese auto parts and South Korean semiconductors. The Chinese factories use those products to manufacture finished goods, some of which are exported to the U.S.\n\nManufacturers\u2019 profits are falling. Kobe Steel Ltd. in August cut its profit forecast for the year ending March 2020 by 60% to about $95 million. It said tech companies were expected to buy less aluminum and copper, and that sales of hydraulic excavators were likely to drop in China.\n\nParcel company Yamato Holdings Co. took a special loss of nearly $30 million in July related to a Chinese affiliate that handles parcels at Chinese airports. \u201cThere has been deterioration in the logistics market due to the U.S.-China trade friction, and uncertainty over the outlook for this market is growing,\u201d a Yamato spokesman said Monday.\n\nEven after decades of growing economic interdependence, exports to China by themselves account for a small portion of the total output of countries like Japan and South Korea. In Japan\u2019s case, exports to China equaled 2.8% of gross domestic product in the year ended March 2019. But a falloff in exports could trigger a broader downward cycle by leading companies to slash investment or by making consumers more cautious.\n\nThe Port of Busan in South Korea.

The economies of Japan and South Korea both grew in the April-June quarter, while Germany\u2014another big exporter of high-tech goods to China\u2014shrank slightly. Japan\u2019s exports to the U.S. rose 8.4% on year in July, making up the losses from China.\n\nChina itself has yet to show a dramatic effect from the trade conflict. Its economy grew 6.2% in the April-June quarter, according to official figures, which was the lowest growth in decades but only slightly down from the previous quarter. A private gauge of China\u2019s factory activity rebounded in August to a five-month high, although a subindex for new export orders dipped to its lowest level this year.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy showed signs of a short-term recovery, but downward pressure remains a long-term problem. Amid unstable Sino-American relations, China needs to step up countercyclical policies,\u201d said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, a Chinese research firm.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s central bank in July made the first cut to its benchmark interest rate in three years, and some economists expect another cut by the end of the year.\n\nYoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said measures to counter the impact of trade conflicts were likely to fall short. \u201cWe continue to believe the Japanese economy will fall into a mild recession in the October-December period,\u201d Mr. Maruyama said.\n\n\u2014Grace Zhu in Beijing contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com and Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com", "description": "The trade war is beginning to crimp the economies of China\u2019s neighbors, starting with manufacturers of high-tech equipment.", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa", "Kwanwoo Jun", "Megumi.Fujikawa Wsj.Com", "Kwanwoo.Jun Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103250/social"}
