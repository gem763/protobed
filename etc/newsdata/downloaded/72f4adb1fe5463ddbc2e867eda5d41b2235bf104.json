Photo: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\n\u201cHighwomen,\u201d the opener and cornerstone of country supergroup the Highwomen\u2019s self-titled debut, is a chilling montage of destruction. In five verses, vocalists Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Yola, and Natalie Hemby take turns recounting the moment the life was snuffed out of an ambitious woman. Each story is more crushing than the last. After Carlile\u2019s character gets caught up in the Nicaraguan revolution, and Shires\u2019s New England mystic is hung in Salem, Massachusetts, Yola plays a freedom fighter who risks everything to fight for equality, and Hemby embodies a preacher killed for daring to take a role in church leadership as a woman. Verse five is the kill shot: \u201cWe are the daughters of the silent generations / You send our hearts to die alone in foreign nations / It may return to us as tiny drops of rain / But we will still remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighwomen\u201d is a sister song to Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings\u2019s 1985 single \u201cHighwayman,\u201d \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d writer Jimmy Webb\u2019s lurid dream about a life on the run. Played by outlaw country elders in a commercial lull, it is a word about resilience. The updated version scans over 300 years of oppression in less than four minutes, the message being that in spite of radical changes in the human experience, the main theme \u2014 people in power keeping other people out of power \u2014 endures. These women just wanted to live, love, and be loved, but the planet couldn\u2019t handle that. Coming from musicians working in an industry so hungry for fresh perspectives on gender that it\u2019s spawning singles like \u201cDifferent for Girls,\u201d \u201cWoman, Amen,\u201d \u201cSpeak to a Girl,\u201d \u201cWoman,\u201d \u201cGirl,\u201d \u201cWomen,\u201d and \u201cGirl in a Country Song,\u201d \u201cHighwomen\u201d is protest music. Hegemony is a business not just of egotism but of the fear of loss of power. Evening the field means ceding a measure of control. Most people believe in equality, but their numbers tend to thin when you ask what they\u2019re willing to sacrifice to secure it.\n\nHighwomen\u2019s depth of perspective is vast because each of the group\u2019s members occupies a unique space in country music. Maren Morris is a petite country radio star with a titanic voice; her triple-platinum certified Zedd collaboration \u201cThe Middle\u201d is proof she could follow Taylor Swift in hopping the fastest train to the top of the pop charts whenever she pleases, but she\u2019s sticking it out with Nashville. Brandi Carlile is a veteran queer singer-songwriter whose refined lyricism and arresting vocals got noticed in a major way this year, when she was nominated for six Grammys, including Record and Album of the Year, and took home three. Natalie Hemby is the sought-after writer behind gems like Miranda Lambert\u2019s \u201cAutomatic\u201d and Kacey Musgraves\u2019s \u201cButterflies\u201d (and a formidable solo artist in her own right). Amanda Shires is a Texas writer, vocalist, and fiddle player who divides her time between elegant roots-rock solo albums and stints as a player in the Texas Troubadours and the 400 Unit, her husband Jason Isbell\u2019s backing band.\n\nThese intersecting experiences shine in Highwomen\u2019s songwriting. It\u2019s informed by the road and the writers\u2019 room, the Music City mainstream and the woolier scenes outside of it. It celebrates heterosexual romance and same-sex love, family life and freewheeling self-sufficiency, churches and honky-tonks. Highwomen is an ambitious, panoramic exploration of these women\u2019s stories and more. \u201cRedesigning Women,\u201d a nod to writer and director Linda Bloodworth-Thomason\u2019s brilliant southern workplace comedy Designing Women, crystallizes the spirit of the album in its chorus: \u201cSome of us are saints and some of us are surgeons / Made in God\u2019s image, just a better version.\u201d Highwomen deals in dualities. \u201cLoose Change\u201d escapes an unhealthy relationship, and \u201cCrowded Table\u201d fantasizes about settling down. \u201cMy Only Child\u201d radiates first-time-parent joy, but \u201cMy Name Can\u2019t Be Mama\u201d stresses about responsibility, and \u201cOld Soul\u201d cuts a path down the middle, reminiscing on a youth enriched by the wise words of elders.\n\nAnchoring these stories is a palette of stately traditional country workouts aided by friends of the band. Isbell plays guitar, as do Carlile\u2019s friends Tim and Phil Hanseroth. Hotshot producer and regular 400 Unit collaborator Dave Cobb produces. Hemby corrals Miranda Lambert for a co-write on \u201cMy Only Child.\u201d The music is a launchpad for remarkable vocals; the Highwomen sound great on their own and transcendent together. Miles of gorgeous harmonies set this album in the direct lineage not just of the Highwaymen, whose legends traded verses the way rap-posse cuts do, but also of Trio, the album-length collaboration between Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris, which scaled back the pop and country-rock directions the singers pursued in the \u201980s in favor of covers and intricate vocal interplay. (The Highwomen know their shit; the quartet was joined at its Newport Folk Festival debut by Dolly, who led them in killer renditions of hits like \u201cEagle When She Flies\u201d and \u201cJust Because I\u2019m a Woman.\u201d) Highwomen soars thanks to a fighting spirit, a love of singing, and a refined sense of its place in history. It\u2019s a dream team-up by turns uplifting enough to elicit good-spirited chuckles and gutting enough to bring you to tears, sometimes in the space of a single song. Great country ushers you into your feelings and coaches you out of them. Highwomen excels at the job.", "description": "It\u2019s a dream team-up by turns uplifting enough to elicit good-spirited chuckles and gutting enough to bring you to tears.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/06/06-the-highwomen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
