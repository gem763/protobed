West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, -1.43% was up 13.7% at $62.31 a barrel.\n\nRead: Global oil surges by most in a decade\n\nThe boost in oil prices will benefit manufacturing, the sector that has been the weakest for the U.S. economy, and crimp consumer spending, the part of the economy that has been robust.\n\nThe inflationary impact of higher oil prices is seen as temporary in nature and won\u2019t derail the Fed from easing policy this week or later this year if needed.\n\n\u201cAny increase in inflation that may result from higher oil prices won\u2019t scare the Fed \u2014 if anything, it will reassure it that it has to worry less about inflation staying persistently under target,\u201d said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now a partner at Cornerstone Macro, an economic policy research firm.\n\nIt is not to say that economists are complacent about the oil-price jump. Alexander said there was some risk that consumer spending could cool off markedly.\n\nCarl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics, said he was watching for signs that fear of supply interruptions will trigger speculation about price increases.\n\nAnd there is a risk of a more protracted conflict in the Middle East that could push oil prices above $100 a barrel.\n\nA team of Goldman Sachs analysts said oil prices could shoot above $75 a barrel if the Saudis get oil production fully back online soon. Economists at UBS saw the upside price risk at $80 a barrel if there was a significant OPEC outage.\n\n\u201cHigher oil prices for a long time becomes a problem because it will start to affect consumer confidence,\u201d Perli said.\n\nAmid the concern about oil supplies and prices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52% was down 155 points in midday trading.", "description": "The spike in oil prices is \u201ca wash\u201d for the U.S. economy that now produces roughly as much oil as it consumes.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ740_powell_ZG_20180926152700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
