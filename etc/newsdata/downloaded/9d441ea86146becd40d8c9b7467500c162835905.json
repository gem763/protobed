She was found dead about five hours later.\n\nNSW Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Don Harwin on Tuesday said Ms Maher's death was a \"terrible tragedy\".\n\n\"We don't want to see these horrific circumstances repeated, which is why we are acting to provide better protection for First Nations people,\" Mr Harwin said in a statement.\n\nState coroner Teresa O'Sullivan in July said that, if an ambulance had been called for Ms Maher when it was clear she was stumbling and incoherent, \"expert evidence suggests that (she) would have survived\".\n\nMs O'Sullivan said it was dangerous and inappropriate for police to believe an intoxicated person could just \"sleep it off\".\n\nMs Maher's state of intoxication was such that she should have been taken immediately to hospital, she said.\n\nAn autopsy revealed the Wiradjuri woman died from mixed drug toxicity after taking a combination of alprazolam and other benzodiazepines, methadone and an antidepressant, which led to respiratory failure.\n\nFollowing the inquest, the NSW government has expanded the Custody Notification Service, which is run by the Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT and provides 24-hour legal advice and an R U OK phone line for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people taken into police custody.\n\nPolice are already required to notify the ALS if an indigenous person is taken into custody in connection with an offence.\n\nThe reform requires police to also call the service if an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person is taken into protective custody for intoxication, Attorney General Mark Speakman said.", "description": "NSW Police will be required to notify an Aboriginal legal aid service if an indigenous person is taken into protective custody for intoxication following an...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
