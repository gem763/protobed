I know she had a good time.\n\nAccident: Chloe cut a fashionable figure in tight leather trousers and the draped top while Pete looked suave in a white t-shirt and leather jacket\n\n'I think he lives in a different country so I don\u2019t know when they\u2019re planning on seeing each other again.\u2019\n\nAdil parted ways with Pamela this summer following her allegations of 'mental abuse' and accusations of violence and cheating - all of which he has strenuously denied.\n\nMeanwhile, Chloe has had a tough year after her ill-fated romance with co-star Dan Edgar left her heartbroken when he went crawling back to his ex Amber Turner.\n\nFeeling like a protective big brother, Pete said: \u2018Chloe deserves to be happy and whatever makes her happy, I\u2019m there for.\n\nPose: Chloe added some height to her frame by donning pointed heels with a clear strap\n\n\u2018I am quite protective over Chloe, she has been messed around a bit and she deserves all the happiness in the world. Hopefully, one day she\u2019ll find her prince charming!\u2019\n\nChloe and Pete recently had a psychic reading after the blonde became convinced they were soulmates and discovered they had supposedly known each other in their past lives.\n\nBut in this lifetime, romance is off the cards \u2013 despite the pair looking very cosy during a boozy night out last week.\n\n\u2018Right now me and Chloe are good friends and that\u2019s the way we like it. If it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it\u2019, Pete said.", "description": "Chloe Sims, 36, spilled out of her plunging top as she arrived at\u00a0Cirque nightclub in Manchester with pal Pete Wicks on Saturday.", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20228630-0-image-a-25_1572130273786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
