It looks like a tablet, and is focused on making your life easier, from organizing your schedule to making grocery lists.\n\nHere's what else you should know about the smart device.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nWhat is a Google Home Hub?\n\nAt a basic level, it's the next step in the Google Assistant, and it has the Assistant built in so you can use those voice commands while using the Hub.\n\nThe Google Home Hub also has Chromecast and Bluetooth 5 built in, and is compatible with Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, and Chromebooks.\n\nThe device itself has a seven-inch LCD touchscreen display and built-in, full-range speakers. It retails for $129 and comes in four colors: Chalk, charcoal, aqua and sand.\n\nWhat can the Google Home Hub do?\n\nThe Google Home Hub can do things like:\n\nAllow you to view your daily schedule, commute, and reminders\n\nControl compatible lights, cameras, and TV's\n\nAccess \"visual, immersive\" answers to your questions about things like recipes, local weather and businesses, and more\n\nPlay music\n\nSee your photos in Google Photos\n\nWatch the news\n\nMake calls (in the U.S., these only work domestically)\n\nCreate shopping lists\n\nSecure your house and control your thermostat (if your systems are compatible)\n\nControl other compatible smart devices, like Google Home\n\nHow the Google Home Hub compares to other similar products\n\nCompared to Google's other Home products, the Hub is the most robust, offering both the voice commands of Google Assistant (a common thread for the Nest line) as well as a touchscreen interface, thereby increasing its possibilities for use to things like videos and text-based tools.\n\nBut it can take up more counter or surface space than the smaller products, like the Home Mini.\n\nWhen you look outside of the Google Home line at comparable visual smart home products, there are more factors to consider.\n\nAmazon's Echo Show, for example, maintains the voice-assistant trend, offering Alexa as its assistant. The display is smaller at 5.5 inches, and still lets you do things like check out your calendar, control your compatible smart home devices, watch videos, and call or message friends and family.\n\nYou can also turn off the camera \u2014 which the Home Hub does not have \u2014 and mic with the touch of a button for privacy. It retails for about $65 on Amazon.\n\nWhether the Nest Hub is right for you will depend on your values and budget. But for those who are a fan of Google's products, it may be a good option.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "A Google Home Hub is a visual touchscreen that helps you navigate daily life.
