The company had previously relied on the group\u2019s Malaysian subsidiaries\u2019 management accounts for its preliminary results as the audit for Malaysian subsidiaries were still in progress.\n\nOther reasons include reversal impairment on a related party of the company previously provided, and a reclassification of accounts between subsidiary and other receivable relating to Cocosa Export.\n\nThere was also a S$4.3 million variance on the company\u2019s total non-current assets, most of which came from the reclassification of accounts between subsidiary and other receivable relating to Cocosa Export.\n\nOn a group level, S$5.2 million in variance was also observed under total liabilities and equity after the group saw a variance of S$6.1 million under accumulated losses. This was due to revaluation of assets by the company and Malaysian subsidiaries, and reversal impairment on other receivables in relation to Cocosa Export previously provided.\n\nSakae has requested for a trading halt called on Oct 17 to be lifted. Prior to the halt, Sakae shares last closed at S$0.0812 on Oct 8, up S$0.028 or 45 per cent.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - THE Singapore Exchange has approved Sakae Holdings\u2019 application for an extension to hold its annual general meeting (AGM) originally scheduled for Oct 29. .
