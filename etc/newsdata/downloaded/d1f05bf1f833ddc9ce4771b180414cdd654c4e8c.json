And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action.\"\n\n'I want you to take action': Greta Thunberg testifies before Congress\n\nCalling the outspoken teen one of her favorite \"gutsy women,\" Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, encouraged her Twitter followers to join in the Global Climate Strike set for Friday.\n\n.@GretaThunberg\u2014one of my favorite gutsy women\u2014will help lead global climate strikes that start tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\"I want you to act as if our house is on fire,\" she has said. \"Because it is.\"\n\n\n\nJoin a strike near you: https://t.co/BxyQ88dz2v pic.twitter.com/nx66mlYsWF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 19, 2019\n\nTuesday, Thunberg met with former President Barack Obama during her visit to Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to lobby lawmakers on environmental issues and protest outside the White House.\n\nIn a tweet, Obama called Thunberg one of the \u201cplanet's greatest advocates.\"\n\nIn a video of their short meeting released by the Obama Foundation, Thunberg says, \u201cAll of these young people [in the United States] seem so eager, very enthusiastic. Which is a very good thing. I mean, no one is too small to have an impact.\u201d\n\nJust 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action.

Don\u2019t invite us here to tell us how inspiring we are without doing anything about it. It doesn\u2019t lead to anything.\"\n\nToday I and other young activists visited US Congress...
