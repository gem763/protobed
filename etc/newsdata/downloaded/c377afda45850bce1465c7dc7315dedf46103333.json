But what's really true about guns there?", "language": "en", "text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Amid an impeachment inquiry in Washington and an ongoing strike by more than 32,000 teachers and school staff, President Donald Trump is likely to make his first presidential visit to Chicago on Monday, a city that he often ridicules for how its leaders handle gun violence.\n\nTrump is scheduled to attend a fundraiser Monday morning hosted by Todd Ricketts, Cubs co-owner and Republican National Committee Finance chairman. Later, he will speak at the largest annual gathering of law enforcement leaders in the world, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson, this year's conference host, said he plans to boycott the president's remarks, a move that pushed Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police board to issue a vote of no confidence in Johnson.\n\n\"As police officers, our job is to be the voice for the voiceless and ambassadors to the communities that we serve,\" Johnson said in response to the vote. \"I can't in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the oval office or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on new Americans.\"\n\nChciago teachers strike: When will it be over?\n\nIn this March 26, 2019, file photo, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson speaks during a news conference in Chicago. More\n\nKevin Graham, president of the Chicago's FOP, called Johnson's boycott an \"insult\" to the president.\n\n\"I think Superintendent Johnson should not walk out of the president's speech, particularly when the federal government has sent federal agents and prosecutors to assist the Chicago Police Department with our gun and drug problems,\" Graham said.\n\nEven when Trump spoke at last year's conference in Orlando, Chicago played a central role in his speech.\n\n\"There's no reason for what's going on there,\" Trump said at the time, adding, \"The crime spree is a terrible blight on that city.\"\n\nTrump has frequently taken aim at Chicago over the years. In a January 2017 interview with ABC, Trump compared Chicago to Afghanistan, saying, \"Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago.\" Trump said he would \"send in the feds\" to fix the city's \"horrible carnage.\"\n\n\"People are being shot left and right, thousands of people over a short period of time,\" Trump said, adding, \"Chicago is like a war zone.\"\n\nPres. Trump says he wants Chicago to fix violence problem: \"Afghanistan is not like what\u2019s happening in Chicago.\" https://t.co/44NFiXe2ao pic.twitter.com/C1IdeWQTDp \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) January 26, 2017\n\nHow Chicago has responded to Trump\n\nChicago hasn't taken too kindly to Trump's comments.\n\nDuring a campaign visit in March 2016, Trump was essentially booted out of the city: Protests at a rally at the University of Illinois Chicago prompted organizers to cancel the event half an hour before it was scheduled to begin.\n\nAnti-Donald Trump protesters and his supporters confront during a Trump rally at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago on March 11, 2016. More\n\nThat same year, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Chicago would remain a sanctuary city, defying the president-elect's hardline immigration stance. The city later sued the Justice Department over a plan to withhold federal public safety grants from sanctuary cities.\n\nChicago's new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has similarly defended her city against criticism from the president and his supporters. In August, when Ivanka Trump tweeted about a weekend of shootings in Chicago, Lightfoot fired back, saying Ivanka Trump had misrepresented the events and had not reached out to city officials.", "description": "Donald Trump will make his first presidential visit to Chicago on Oct. 28, a city he often ridicules\u00a0for how its leaders handle\u00a0gun violence.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TKomGYBhogcDP5.GnKLMRw--~B/aD0yODMyO3c9NDI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/c313f588a6dcfd13e2a2647790a51fd3", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
