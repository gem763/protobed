But Democrats aren\u2019t faring that much better.", "language": "en", "text": "Of course, judging by the results, voters aren\u2019t overly fond of the Democratic candidates either. Half of polled voters rated both former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unfavorably. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), with 43 percent favorable and 44 percent unfavorable split, appeared to do a bit better, but it\u2019s also possible that she, and the rest of the Democratic field, is being saved from similarly high unfavorables by the substantial number of voters who say they\u2019ve never heard of them.\n\nAs pollster Celinda Lake said during a Tuesday briefing, if you had to choose, you\u2019d much rather be a Democrat than a Republican this cycle. But Republicans and Trump both have strong advantages over their Democratic rivals in a few areas: jobs, taxes, the economy, national security. Unfortunately for Democrats, those areas are rather key.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimple presidential election models that look mostly at economic fundamentals can explain almost half of the variation in election results, without looking at any details of the candidates or their performance in office. Those are obviously fundamentals you\u2019d like to have with you \u2014 as Trump mostly does, for the moment. Indeed, in many ways it\u2019s a testimony to how bad Trump is in other ways that with record-low unemployment, solid GDP growth and low inflation, he has nonetheless managed to pull only a 42 percent favorable overall rating.\n\nStill, if you\u2019re a Democrat, you have to recognize that while Trump\u2019s favorables are low, they were also low in 2016, and he nonetheless eked out a victory by the simple expedient of running against a candidate just as unlikable as he was. Too, you\u2019ll remember that it\u2019s quite difficult to unseat an incumbent president who has presided over a strong economy \u2014 even if his administration has otherwise seemed less than glorious. And you presumably know that while a convenient recession would seal Trump\u2019s fate, no one can predict when a recession might occur.\n\nSo even if you can\u2019t entirely erase the more than 10-percentage-point gap between Republicans and Democrats on economic issues, you\u2019d really like to narrow it a little.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have their own strengths, of course: education, health care, climate change. The good news for Democrats is that health care ranks right up there with the economy as a matter of voter concern. The bad news is that global warming does not \u2014 in one 2018 poll, it registered barely above \u201cproviding relief after natural disasters\u201d \u2014 and the people who say that it\u2019s a very important issue for the government to address tend to already be solidly Democratic voters.\n\nThe temptation for Democrats on the debate stage Tuesday night will be to stay in that comfort zone where they already do well. The Battleground Poll suggests that this is the right approach to winning a primary; 78 percent of respondents said that when choosing a presidential candidate, the most important thing is picking a \u201ccandidate whose views match your own\u201d rather than one \u201cwho beats the other side.\u201d Candidates would be crazy to ignore that reality.\n\nBut given the importance of the economy to the coming election, Democratic voters might want to reassess their priorities. To be sure of beating Trump, Democrats need to convince voters that they, too, can be able stewards of the economy. It will be difficult to do that if the base forces them to spend the next six months trying to outflank each other to the left, and risk losing moderates by ceding strategically vital economic terrain to the Republicans.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "There are areas in which the president and Republicans hold a distinct advantage.", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xCKye75VE8O1WiCgL1Ch58V9sxQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H6Q5G6W6IMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
