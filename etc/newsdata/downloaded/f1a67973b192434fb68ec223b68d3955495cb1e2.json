Others cite Rudy\u2019s marriage in 2003 to Judith Nathan, his soon-to-be third ex-wife, as transformational. Rudy was a pizza and Diet Coke guy when I met him in 1992. But he became an Upper East Side and Hamptons socialite and, worse yet, a Palm Beach neighbor of Donald Trump.\n\nAfter his mayoralty ended in 2002, Rudy went to work for what seemed like every rich bad guy and tinpot dictator who called. (So going to work for Mr. Trump made sense.) He charged $100,000 for self-aggrandizing speeches about his heroic leadership after Sept. 11. He became a multimillionaire.\n\nIn perfect political symmetry, Rudy Giuliani now does Donald Trump\u2019s dirty work: Vainly trying to cover up the Ukrainian cover-up and attacking a Democratic presidential front-runner, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.\n\nWatching and reading Rudy\u2019s ferocious lying for Mr. Trump, whether on Fox or CNN, forced me to re-examine his last 25 years, especially the profiteering from Sept. 11. But Ukraine was the coup de gr\u00e2ce. We who admired him for so long expected much more from Rudy Giuliani and his legacy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ken Frydman", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Giuliani-Trump-Ukraine.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
