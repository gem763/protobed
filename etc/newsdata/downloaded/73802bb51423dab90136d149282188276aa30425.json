What the Hell Happens Now?", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats woke up Thursday aiming to answer the question at the heart of their impeachment inquiry: Did President Trump use foreign aid to pressure Ukraine into launching a politically helpful investigation?\n\nThen acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney straight-up admitted it, and argued there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little quid pro quo between allies.\n\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney told a room of stunned journalists. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nThe bombshell comments scrambled an already-chaotic House impeachment process \u2014 and left Democrats wondering what they had left to prove.\n\n\u201cThe president pleaded guilty to the crime. It\u2019s really a matter of what the sentence is\u201d\n\n\u201cMulvaney apparently decided it was okay to admit to an impeachable offense,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), a member of the House Oversight Committee who was chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee when it was hacked, told VICE News as she exited the room where European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland was testifying on his role in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nSo what are the investigators trying to get to the bottom to now, if Mulvaney just gave up the goods?\n\n\u201cAn inquiry is ongoing and, you know, you need corroborating evidence. You have to stitch together the timeline and make sure we have a clear understanding of what led to the impeachable offense,\u201d she replied.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), another senior Oversight member, saw a shift in White House strategy.\n\n\u201cHaving failed at discrediting the facts of this case, they\u2019ve decided on a new tactic, which is to admit them and basically say: So what? And the answer to that is, well, the \u2018so what\u2019 is, \u2018you\u2019re going to be impeached.\u2019 Because that\u2019s abuse of office. And extortion, last time I checked, is still a crime,\u201d he told reporters Thursday afternoon.\n\nRead: Ambassador Sondland Just Threw Rudy Giuliani Under the Ukraine Bus\n\nOn Thursday evening, Mulvaney tried to walk-back his comments by claiming he\u2019d been misunderstood, insisting he\u2019d never said there was an explicit quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption,\u201d Mulvaney said in an after-hours statement.\n\nBut the damage was already done.\n\n\u201cThings have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said about Mulvaney\u2019s admission, calling it \u201ca phenomenal breach of the president\u2019s duty to defend our national security.\u201d\n\nDuring his explosive press conference, Mulvaney said that hundreds of millions in aid to Ukraine was held up in part due to concerns about corruption in Ukraine, which included, he said, Trump\u2019s concerns about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it, that\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nThat ties almost $400 million in aid money to Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 to launch an investigation on that same topic.\n\nSuch a probe would appear intended to dig up evidence in support of a long-ago debunked conspiracy theory Trump has entertained: That Russia somehow wasn\u2019t really behind hacking the 2016 election.\n\nThe only claim Mulvaney rejected was that the pressure was about targeting the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\u201d he said.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s bluster follows a pattern of Trump and his allies at first denying they\u2019d done something then admitting it and acting as if everything was above-board. That happened most recently when he decided to release the transcript of the call he had with Ukraine\u2019s president immediately after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it\u2019d be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to do so.\n\nBut even Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders in Congress seemed blindsided by Mulvaney's comments, refusing to talk to reporters (like Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who claimed he didn\u2019t do hallway interviews) or insisting they hadn\u2019t heard what Mulvaney had said.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has been so locked in on following and discrediting Democrats\u2019 impeachment push that he tried to fight his way into a closed deposition earlier this week only to be ejected for breaking the House rules. But he claimed he\u2019d had no time to review Sondland\u2019s public statement from the morning or Mulvaney\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in other meetings,\u201d he said, scurrying down the hall of the Capitol Building Thursday afternoon.\n\nOther key Trump allies sought to distance themselves from the remarks.\n\n\"The legal team was not involved in the Acting Chief of Staff's press briefing,\u201d Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s personal attorney (who unlike his other personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, hasn\u2019t been implicated in Ukraine), told CNN.\n\nDemocrats pledged to keep investigating to lay out the exact details of quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe president pleaded guilty to the crime. It\u2019s really a matter of what the sentence is,\u201d Oversight Committee member Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said. \u201dWe should still give him a fair process \u2014 but he pleaded guilty to the crime.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump speaks as he arrives at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, Texas, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.
