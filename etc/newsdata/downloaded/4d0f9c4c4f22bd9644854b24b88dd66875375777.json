The work of the US military, intelligence agencies and partners on the ground made this possible. And as much as Trump wants to claim personal credit, the success of the raid only highlighted the dangers of his haphazard withdrawal of US troops from Syria: the New York Times reports that the success of the raid occurred \u201cin spite of\u201d Trump\u2019s recent Syria moves, as the Kurds were the key partners providing intelligence and the US military was concerned they wouldn\u2019t get another shot at Baghdadi because intelligence would be significantly reduced after the US withdrawal.\n\nBut the circumstances surrounding the raid and its announcement raise broader concerns about the nature of America\u2019s counterterrorism policies.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement itself was disturbing \u2013 even setting aside the completely inappropriate description of the death, the unnecessary divulsion of details about the raid and Trump\u2019s self-congratulatory comments making the event about himself. The very fact that we treat the killing of a single terrorist like a national event reveals how our national security priorities are sometimes out of order. Obama\u2019s announcement of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden seemed appropriate, as it felt in part like closure after 3,000 Americans were killed on 9/11 (and Obama\u2019s solemn remarks marked it with the right tone). But presidents hardly ever address the nation when a climate deal is reached or a peacekeeping mission helps deter violence. This may be because presidents feel the need to garner public support for the use of the military abroad, but it\u2019s just as easily chalked up to the overly militaristic approach the US has adopted to counter-terrorism, and how deeply leaders feel the need to look tough in the face of terrorism.\n\nThe announcement also reinforced how the fear factor of terrorism can dominate US national security policy and how irresponsible politicians like Trump use that fear to pursue dangerous policies. The rise of Isis \u2013 the gruesome videos of murder, attacks abroad, and the fact that Isis controlled territory \u2013 was deadly serious. While pursuing a military campaign along with allies, Obama was criticized for trying to keep the threat in perspective for Americans. During the 2016 campaign and since Trump on the other hand has played on the public\u2019s fear, linking Isis to immigration to scare people. And the public\u2019s fear of terrorism, despite the chances of being hurt by terrorism are virtually none, keeps counter-terrorism efforts at a much more prominent place in national discourse and policy making than they should be.\n\nThe raid was possible because of a US military presence in the area, but the global war on terror has driven the US to have a significantly expanded global military presence for counter-terrorism purposes \u2013 a trend that should concern Americans. While the US has improved its intelligence and other capabilities to detect and prevent terrorism since 9/11, it has often used the military as a tool of first resort, from Afghanistan to Iraq and beyond. The US military is sometimes the only option for going after terrorists, but we are not nearly cautious enough about its use. Not only does this approach militarize US relationships with countries, but it also means that the military tools end up with outsized influence in determining US policies. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way: A new Cap study shows that Americans want leaders to focus on terrorism, but don\u2019t want to treat it like a military problem.\n\nMoreover, almost every time we announce a military operation today it is a stark reminder that Congress likely has not voted to use force in those countries. Congress has never explicitly voted to authorize military operations in Yemen or against Isis in Iraq or Syria. While Congress has appropriated funds to fight certain conflicts \u2013 and thereby could be construed as approving them \u2013 the 2001 AUMF is being stretched to justify CT efforts almost 20 years later. No wonder the US military\u2019s global footprint looks the way it does \u2013 with Congress unwilling to vote on military conflicts, there\u2019s little standing in the way of a president who wants to expand that presence.", "description": "The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is an important milestone in the fight against Isis, but also illustrates much of what is wrong about America\u2019s approach to fighting terrorismDonald Trump monitors developments in Syria from the Situation Room of the White House.
