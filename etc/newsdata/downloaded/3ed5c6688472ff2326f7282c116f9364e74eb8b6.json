The demonstration disrupted traffic around The Hague for hours, forcing police to block the main highway into the city to prevent even more trucks from arriving.\n\nThe industry is protesting government limits on nitrogen emissions and rules about transporting sand and earth contaminated with tiny amounts of chemicals known as PFAS , which are used in firefighting foam, nonstick pots and pans, water-repellent clothing and many other household and personal items.\n\nThe protests underscore how difficult it is for the Dutch government to push through reforms aimed at cleaning up the environment and reducing emissions without hurting essential industries like construction and agriculture.\n\nIn recent weeks, Dutch farmers also have staged two demonstrations against government environmental rules. German farmers held similar protests last week.\n\nMaxime Verhagen, chairman of an umbrella organization for the construction industry told the demonstrators on Wednesday: \u201cWe want to work. Cabinet, do something about it now.\u201d\n\nHis organization carried out a survey of its members that showed some 308 projects worth more than 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) have been affected by PFAS limitations.\n\nThe government has pledged to relax some of its guidelines to help builders.\n\n\u201cThis country is not going to be locked up,\u201d Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten told the construction workers.\n\nTeachers also are planning a nationwide strike next month to protest their working conditions.", "description": "Thousands of Dutch construction workers converged on The Hague on Wednesday to protest restrictions they say are crippling their industry.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dutch-construction-workers-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
