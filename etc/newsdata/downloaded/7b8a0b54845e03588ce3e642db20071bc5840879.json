The good news is I\u2019ve got deep experience with both copper and PEX water supply lines.\n\nI could write an entire book on the topic of copper vs. PEX water lines. There\u2019s that much information to know about both products when considering the pros and cons to each. Another thing to keep in mind: There are different types of plastic PEX piping and different systems. Having said that, I\u2019m going to give you the CliffsNotes version. You\u2019ll be able to make a sound decision for sure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI cut my teeth as a young plumber using copper. PEX hadn\u2019t been invented at the time. Plastic PEX tubing first was introduced into the U.S. market as a radiant floor heating product in the 1980s. In the 1990s, PEX started to appear as piping material for use in domestic potable drinking water supply.\n\nCopper is a time-tested water supply line material, but it\u2019s not immune to trouble. There are places in the United States where the water chemistry is aggressive. The water can dissolve the copper and cause pinhole leaks and other catastrophic failures. Copper is also liable to splitting if the water in tubing freezes and expands.\n\nCopper is easy to work with. Believe it or not, a homeowner with just a little practice and inexpensive tools can cut and solder copper, creating leakproof joints. It may seem intimidating, but I recorded a video years ago showing how to solder copper in just minutes. You can watch it on my AsktheBuilder.com website.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe issue with copper is that it takes quite a bit of time to install a water line from one part of a home to another. You might have five or more fittings to get from point A to point B. Each fitting requires you to cut and clean the pipe, clean the fitting, apply flux and solder. Working with a hot propane torch around wood can be dangerous. Myriad house fires have been started by plumbers and DIYers who underestimate how fast a torch can ignite nearby combustible materials.\n\nThere\u2019s a newer system to attach fittings to copper tubing without solder. The fittings have a rubber O-ring inside them, and an expensive tool crimps the fitting onto the end of the tubing to make a leakproof connection. I doubt you can afford to purchase the required tool. The fittings are also expensive, compared with those you solder.\n\nPEX tubing is a magical material. For the most part, you install it like you\u2019d run an electric cable from a circuit-breaker panel to a wall outlet. You snake the PEX tubing through floors and walls from a manifold or adapter in your basement or crawl space and then end the tubing at the fixture. There are no joints at all that can leak between the two points.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI prefer the Uponor PEX system. You create a leakproof connection using a small PEX collar that slides over the end of the tubing. A tool is used to expand the PEX so it can slide onto the end of a fitting. It's far easier to create a joint using PEX than it is using copper, and I created a \"Connect PEX\" video at my website to show you just how easy it is to do.\n\nThe PEX tubing has a memory and wants to go back to its original shape, so it starts to squeeze very hard onto the ridges on the fitting. After a short time, it's impossible for me to try to pull the tubing off a fitting. I've never ever had a leak with PEX tubing.\n\nAnother benefit to PEX is its resistance to splitting when water freezes inside the tubing. In my current home, which I did not build, a second-floor water line to a sink always freezes in bitterly cold weather because the builder and plumber goofed up installing the PEX. The tubing has never split and leaked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can purchase electric tools that expand the PEX, or you can use hand-powered versions. Cutting the PEX accurately is important, and a simple hand tool cuts the tubing square and perfectly each time.\n\nYou can install PEX as you would a traditional copper system, where a larger-diameter pipe supplies water to all the fixtures as the large line snakes through the house. Or you can install a separate water line from a manifold to each fixture. The manifold method ensures you have no hidden joints or fittings hidden in walls or ceilings, but you end up using much more tubing material.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in PEX. And because it\u2019s so easy to install, I\u2019d use it in any new home I\u2019d build. I just installed more than 6,000 feet of hePEX in my daughter\u2019s home for radiant heating, and I installed about 1,500 feet of PEX for her hot and cold water lines. We went with the manifold system because I didn\u2019t want any hidden fittings anywhere.\n\nSubscribe to Tim\u2019s free newsletter and listen to his new podcasts.
