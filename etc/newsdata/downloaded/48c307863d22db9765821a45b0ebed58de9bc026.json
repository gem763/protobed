I asked her ages ago if something was going on between you two. She said 'no'.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDaniel then made a worrying error when he claimed \"there wasn't\" anything going on, before quickly correcting himself with \"there isn't\".\n\nHe gave a knowing look that indicated that he had made a grave error, while Sinead's suspicions started to grow.\n\n\"What is it you're hiding from me,\" asked Sinead, but Daniel continued to insist nothing had happened.\n\nDemanding the truth, Sinead said: \"If we can\u2019t be honest now then when can we, hey?\n\n\"Do you really want me going to my grave knowing that there\u2019s something you\u2019re keeping from me?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nRealising he could not go on any longer, Daniel finally admitted that he kissed Bethany Platt.\n\nWith a sigh, he said: \"Alright. We kissed.\"\n\nSinead looked horrified as she tried to process that her supposedly loving husband had kissed Bethany while she was dying at home.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCoronation Street viewers took to Twitter after watching the heartbreaking scene develop to question the latest twist.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Why do #Corrie have to do this with Sinead and Daniel. She's about to die any day now and this is just cheapening the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Why have they done this? No need. Storyline needs to be out there for awareness but this is so wrong,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"What a horrible thing to bring into the sinead/daniel storyline\"\n\n\"This is daft now. Sinead on her death bed having a go at Daniel over Bethany. Gone are the emotional death scenes like when Hayley Cropper died. That was so much better written and acted and I was a wreck after. With this I just don\u2019t care and that makes me sad,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis came after Ken Barlow strongly warned his son not to say a word to Sinead about his kiss with Bethany.\n\nKen gave his son a stern telling off, but told him to keep quiet when Daniel claimed he was going to reveal all.\n\nWhen Daniel asked how Ken thought he was feeling, his dad replied: \"Terrible, I imagine. But that's the burden you have to bear. You have no right to ease it by passing it onto her.\"\n\n*Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays on ITV at 7.30pm and 8.30pm", "description": "Daniel Osbourne made a sickening confession to his dying wife that horrified Coronation Street viewers", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20709566.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Coronation-Street-Sinead-and-Daniel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
