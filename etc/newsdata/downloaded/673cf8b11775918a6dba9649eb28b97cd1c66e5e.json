We continue to believe looking at fundamentals and investing longer term is the right way to invest money.\n\nThat said, these style metrics give great insight into what is going on within markets. We can say that the current growth/momentum trend is one of the longest we have seen with some valuation differentials between growth and value style indices approaching the record levels seen in 1999-2000 TMT (technology, media and telecom) boom.\n\nMy view is that this will return to an equilibrium more consistent with what we have seen through history. That said, I have no view on whether this will happen in three months, or three years; timing these cycles is incredibly difficult. You do often hear the view that low interest rates cause growth outperformance. It is interesting that for the market where we have the longest history of low rates, namely Japan, exactly the opposite has happened.\n\nWhat's a tell-tale sign of a value trap in 2019?\n\nA key thing to look for is a product, or business model, that no longer warrants a place in a market. Although that is more of a flag than a fatal diagnosis. You need to ask many more questions from that point.\n\nOthers signs are high debt levels with insufficient cash flow as well as a board or management team pursuing a flawed strategy. That said, I think the most likely place to lose significant money in today\u2019s market is amongst some of the currently high revenue growth companies that and have been priced on huge multiples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, can you make peace with owning something trading on more than 20 times earnings?\n\nAbsolutely! Some businesses clearly deserve higher multiples, and historically we have owned many of them. The danger is when the price of a business becomes disconnected from any valuation anchor.\n\nOf the many stocks that have seen astronomical share prices rises over the last three years, a few will continue to make people rich, many will see share price falls but remain good businesses and many others will implode and really hurt those who jumped on the bandwagon. Late in the cycle all that glitters isn\u2019t gold.\n\nWe're always looking for new TV to stream. Anything new or old caught your eye?\n\nIf you are into history I thought Ken Burns' documentary on the Vietnam War was excellent with a great mix of US, South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese perspectives. For those not into history, Dave Chappelle\u2019s Sticks and Stones was very funny although not a family viewing option.\n\nFinally, a recommendation for a good value quick bite in [Sydney].\n\nMy three-year-old daughter and I like to go to Douce France on Darlinghurst Road in Potts Point and share an \u00e9clair over a flat white and a babycino.", "description": "AFR Markets Live catches up with the Lazard fund manager about Flight Centre, Telstra and how to spot a value trap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9972%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_935%2C$y_52/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b0b37a968cbe209ec0437fe601159531635079a2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
