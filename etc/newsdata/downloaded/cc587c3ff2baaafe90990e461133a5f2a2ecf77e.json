Our daughter Charlotte was born seven weeks early, with a cleft palate and while doctors were running tests, more issues emerged. Charlotte was diagnosed with a chromosome 11 abnormality, and was totally deaf in one ear and partially deaf in another.\n\n\u201cThe first eight months of her life were spent with repeated hospital visits, and as Amy\u2019s maternity pay was due to end, the cost of getting to hospital in London, train and parking fares added to our worry. I was working six days a week and an extra 60 hours a month because money was so tight.\n\n\"I played the National Lottery online, so my first thought when I realised I\u2019d won was \u2018We won\u2019t have to worry about paying the mortgage.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy next thought was that Amy didn\u2019t have to worry about returning to work.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\u201cThe money meant we could swap our two-bed terraced house for a four-bed detached home, which is just 400 yards from the special school that Charlotte will attend.\n\n\u201cBefore, we had put a little tent and a few sensory lights in the cupboard under the stairs for Charlotte.\n\n\u201cBut after the win we could spend \u00a31,500 building a special sensory room in the spare bedroom. Charlotte loves this room, and she\u2019s started to reach out for the lights.\n\n\u201cShe loves the tubes with bubbles and fish and we can see her making huge progress.\n\n\u201cBetter still, it\u2019s a space which makes her so happy \u2013 she laughs and chuckles and doesn\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a gorgeous little three-year-old girl who loves her cuddles and her music \u2013 George Ezra in particular. \u201dWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future holds for her, but we know it\u2019s far brighter than before.\n\n\u201cAnd when Charlotte\u2019s old enough to stand up and look in the mirror in her sensory room, she\u2019ll see a little girl who\u2019s truly loved.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tommy Reynolds Photography)\n\nLesley, 58 and Fred Higgins, 69, of Dundee, Scotland, won \u00a358million on EuroMillions last July\n\nLesley, 58, said: \u201cOnce the shock of our win had settled \u2013 and it took ages to stop watching the pennies \u2013 we decided to help out projects that would last, and span generations.\n\n\u201cI was a member of an amateur dramatic group, and knew that another member,\n\nChris Duke, was crowdfunding to raise the \u00a32,000 he needed to pay an illustrator for a children\u2019s book he\u2019d written, helping youngsters to deal with emotions.\n\n\u201cIt was about a little girl who woke with blue hair, and whose hair changed colour to match her feelings \u2013 blue for depression, red for anger, green for envy.\n\n\u201cChris himself had suffered post-natal depression and designed his book to help young people talk about their feelings.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cBack in our day, you\u2019d feel blue but be expected to snap out of it.\n\n\u201cWe spent around \u00a336,000 helping to get the book published and holding one of the first ever copies in my hand sent tingles up my spine.\n\n\u201cIn fact, to read the inscription naming us and thanking us brought a tear to my eye.\n\n\u201cOne young woman who read the book said she wished she\u2019d had it as a teenager, as it would have helped her cope with mood swings.\n\n\u201cShe was so impressed she planned to keep her copy until she had children herself, so she could read it to them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also funded harps for a local harp group. But we\u2019ve still got our old Volvo car.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nRuth Doyle, 55 and husband Peter, 64, of Lyneham Wiltshire won \u00a31 million on Euromillions in June 2015\n\nRuth, 55, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve travelled to amazing places like Japan, the Maldives, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but our most important trip came two years after our win, when we drove a van to Romania to rescue 13 dogs who had been abandoned or left to die.\n\n\u201cWe were only able to go on our mission because we retired after the win.\n\n\u201cI was an accountant, and Peter a consultant decorator trainer.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to Romania and reached the charity\u2019s shelter, Happys, we helped walk and socialise the dogs, and although their stories were heartbreaking, they were the lucky ones \u2013 there were abandoned and dead dogs wherever we drove.\n\n\u201cWe drove the dogs back to the UK through day and night, and we kept going through Red Bull and coffee.\n\n\u201cWhen we arrived back, they went to new homes. We foster dogs ourselves for 1 Dog At A Time Rescue.Org, and our own two rescue dogs have also benefited from our win.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\u201cWe were able to spend \u00a36,000 on a new hip for Bailey, our rescue collie.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s nearly ten, and it\u2019s given him a new lease of life. He and our other rescue, Lily, are like children to us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve rescued 17 dogs in total, and 15 of them have been helped through our Lottery win.\n\n\u201cWe were able to extend the house and create a large bedroom \u2013 with plenty of room for us and the dogs to sleep.\n\n\u201cOnce a year, I fly my siblings to our home in Spain so we can all be together. Winning has been a force for good.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNeil Jones, 55, from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, won \u00a32.4 million on Lotto in 2010.\n\nNeil said: \u201cNothing beats the feeling when a game all comes together in one go.\n\n\u201cYou break the balls, you are knocking them all in and as all your practice pays off, your opponent isn\u2019t getting a chance.\n\n\u201cThe Lottery win enabled me to go back to my love of playing pool, and when I was chosen for the county team \u2013 and then had a trial for England in 2017, I was so happy.\n\n\u201cThe day of my trial, I was thinking of my dad, as I always do when I play.\n\n\u201cHe passed away a year before my trial, and I can hear him now, saying \u2018How\u2019s it going, son?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was always so proud, and it would have made him so happy to know that I was that close to playing for my country.\n\n\u201cI have a pool room with memorabilia and a table of trophies, and I play six days out of eight.\n\n\u201cThe Lottery has enabled me to have the time to practice and compete at this level, and to get better and better.\u201d\n\nMatthew Evans, 41, from Barry, south Wales Won a \u00a32.6million lotto in 2015\n\nMatthew said: \u201cI\u2019m a Cardiff City season ticket holder, and an avid supporter of the Welsh national team.\n\n\u201cSo it made perfect sense for me to create my own football pitch \u2013 literally in my back yard.\n\n\u201cI installed a full-size football goal and eight-man dug out in my garden and added a floral-inspired four-metre Welsh dragon mosaic in tribute to the national team.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not watching as a supporter, I\u2019m having a kickabout with my dad and my pals.\n\n\u201cWe all meet at my house before games. The win made my dreams come true.\n\n\u201cWelsh football and Cardiff City FC are my passions, so to be able to travel everywhere to watch them, and without having to take time off work, has been unreal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also a massive fan of American football and American sport in general, but instead of watching on telly like I used to, I regularly fly to the States for live games with my favourite teams, like the Washington Redskins playing American football, Baltimore Orioles play baseball and Washington Capitals in the ice hockey showdowns.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: National Lottery, with its Lotto, Euromillions and other games, has paid \u00a371 billion in prize money to winners since 1994", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Tommy Reynolds Photography", "Press Association", "Pa", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19413807.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/7_National-Lottery-stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
