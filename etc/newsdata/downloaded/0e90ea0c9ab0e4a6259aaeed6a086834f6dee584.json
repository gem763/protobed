REUTERS/Stevo Vasiljevic\n\nThe streets in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica through which Pompeo\u2019s motorcade passed were cordoned off by police.\n\nFlying in from Rome, Pompeo became the most senior U.S. official to visit Montenegro since independence in 2006. He was set to be the most senior U.S. official to visit North Macedonia since 2000 in a stopover later in the day before flying on to Athens.\n\nPompeo was met by Montenegrin Foreign Minister Srdjan Darmanovic at the airport, and was due to meet President Milo Djukanovic later.\n\nLater, he will fly to Ohrid, a town on a lake in North Macedonia, where he will meet top officials.\n\nPompeo\u2019s trip to Southern Europe has been overshadowed by an impeachment inquiry in the United States against President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. Democrats have pushed ahead with the inquiry following revelations by a whistleblower that Trump had asked Ukraine in July to investigate key political rival Senator Joe Biden and his son, and had withheld aid to Ukraine ahead of this request.\n\nPompeo has yet to comment on evidence presented in the probe on Thursday, in which it was revealed that the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold military aid from Kiev as it confronted a threat from Russia.\n\nAt the start of a meeting with Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic and Darmanovic, Pompeo did not respond to a journalist\u2019s question on whether he thought Volker had acted appropriately in the case.\n\nSECURITY ISSUES\n\nPompeo said the United States was about to finalise a deal for \u201c$36 million worth of light tactical vehicles\u201d to Montenegro.\n\nHe commended intelligence cooperation with Montenegro, through which \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to develop a patch against the latest Russian (computer) malware that now protects millions of devices worldwide.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials said Pompeo would discuss security issues, given that Montenegro joined the U.S.-led NATO alliance in 2017 and North Macedonia\u2019s membership is expected to be ratified by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt is of strategic importance for Montenegro to have U.S. and EU presence in the Balkans so there would be no space for (influence) of those countries who do not share same values,\u201d Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said.\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s attempts to integrate with Western institutions were hampered until it agreed with its neighbour Greece last year on its new name. Greece had long insisted that \u201cMacedonia,\u201d the name the country chose after the breakup of Yugoslavia, implied a territorial claim on the Greek region of that name.\n\nU.S. officials said Pompeo would discuss security issues, given that Montenegro joined the U.S.-led NATO alliance in 2017 and North Macedonia\u2019s membership is expected to be ratified by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe focus here is on NATO allies number 29 and 30,\u201d a senior State Department official said in previewing the trip for journalists last week.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cIt underscores the importance of the NATO enlargement, the open-door policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd of course, in both countries, I think, we will talk about Russian efforts to sow discord there,\u201d the official said, recalling allegations of Russian involvement in a coup attempt in Montenegro in 2016 and interference in North Macedonia\u2019s effort to resolve its long-running feud with Greece.\n\nTwo Russian intelligence officers and two opposition politicians were among 13 people sentenced on Thursday over a 2016 election day plot aimed at toppling Montenegro\u2019s government, killing the prime minister and bringing a pro-Russian alliance to power.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began a short trip to two small Balkan countries, Montenegro and North Macedonia, on Friday to discuss their roles in the Western NATO alliance.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436980848&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930QX", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
