It went across the computer board and blew it up.'\n\nMr Russo said geckos were the main problem especially as the weather heats up and people turn their air conditioners on for the first time after winter.\n\n'The biggest killer for air conditioners is geckos,' he said.\n\n'This time of year is the worst for it as well. They go in during the winter as it's warm.\n\n'They short themselves on the computer boards and blow themselves up.\n\n'Then when it comes to summer and everyone switches it on to cool, they realise the gecko has blown the computer board up and the air conditioning is not working.\n\nMr Russo (right) said geckos were the main problem especially as the weather heats up and people turn their air conditioners on for the first time after winter\n\nRobert, of Mackay Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning in West Mackay, said geckos had been a plague for the past 20 years but people were only just realising it.\n\n'We've had it that bad here in Mackay,' he told Daily Mail Australia via telephone on Saturday.\n\nRobert, who did not give his last name, said manufacturers were changing their boards and putting protective covers on to try to fix the problem.\n\n'Fujitsu is the worst for burning out from geckos,' he said.\n\nAir conditioning specialist Darrell Kellahan from the Gold Coast told ABC news that moisture in the bodies of the tiny lizards was what caused the problem.\n\nJames Cook University biodiversity lecturer Conrad Hoskins said air conditioners were an attractive hiding place for geckos.\n\n'They just like any crevice,' Dr Hoskins said.", "description": "A gecko has blown up a nursing home's air conditioning as tradesmen reveal sensitive energy-efficient cooling system motherboards are behind the uptick in repairs.", "authors": ["Alison Bevege For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19922152-0-image-a-14_1571487871425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
