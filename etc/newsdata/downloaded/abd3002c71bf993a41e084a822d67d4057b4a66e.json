Her ex-husband died in prison in 2017.\n\nSix years ago, she received a face transplant at Brigham and Woman\u2019s Hospital in Boston, where she\u2019s being evaluated for a possible second transplant.\n\nMAN'S EYES, NECK SWELL IN BIZARRE REACTION TO HAIR DYE\n\nTarleton, who has since lived in Manchester, New Hampshire, told The Boston Globe she had no regrets about the transplant because it dramatically improved her life. She has learned to play the piano and banjo, wrote a memoir and has spoken to many groups about her life. She lost 20 pounds and began walking five miles a week.\n\n\u201cI had such a low quality of life prior to my face transplant. Do I wish it had lasted 10 or 20 years? Of course,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 40 patients worldwide have received face transplants, including 15 in the United States. None of the American patients have lost their donor faces, but last year, a French man whose immune system rejected his donor face eight years after his first transplant underwent a second.\n\nTarleton\u2019s doctors noted that most transplanted organs had limited life spans, but her situation has been a reminder that despite successes in the field, face transplantation has been experimental and still a young science with many unanswered questions about benefits versus long-term risks.\n\nDr. Brian Gastman, a transplant surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, which performed the first U.S. face transplant 11 years ago, said more patients are starting to experience chronic rejection. \u201cWe all believe every patient will likely need a retransplant\u201d at some point, he said.\n\nSince her transplant in February 2013, Tarleton has had repeated rejection episodes when her new face became swollen and red. Those episodes were successfully treated, but last month, physicians discovered that some blood vessels to her face had narrowed and closed, causing facial tissue to die. If the damage progressed slowly, she could go on the waitlist for another donor face. Under the worst-case scenario, the tissue would die quickly, and doctors would have to remove it and reconstruct her original face.\n\n\u201cWe all know we are in unchartered waters,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather not have to go through a catastrophic failure.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt will take at least a month to evaluate Tarleton and reach a decision about a second transplant, doctors said. Aside from the setback with her face, a synthetic cornea transplanted into her left eye recently failed, leaving her almost blind.\n\n\u201cThese are not common things to go wrong, but when things go wrong, you have to deal with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI will get back to where I was. How, I don\u2019t know. I will get through this.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A woman who was severely burned in a domestic violence attack in Vermont is hoping for a second face transplant after doctors recently discovered tissue damage that likely will lead to the loss of her donor face.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
