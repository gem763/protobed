If I did it, then I should be banned for life,\u201d he said.\n\nA head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at the University of Free State, Baloyi is appealing the matter with the Colleges of Medicine of SA (CMSA) in a bid to clear his name.\n\nHe was accused of leaking questions for a gynaecology module examination by giving them to his students as \u201cmock questions\u201d earlier in the year.\n\nCity Press has seen the report, which noted among its findings that Baloyi\u2019s \u201cmock questions were in fact not the same as indicated\u201d, but they \u201chad the same themes and same topics as the original obstetrics and gynaecology papers of the first semester 2018\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn obstetrics, nine out of the 13 questions set by Professor Baloyi showed marked similarity with the original obstetrics paper of the first semester 2018 FCOG Part II written examinations. In gynaecology, nine out of the 10 questions set by Professor Baloyi showed marked similarity with the original gynaecology paper of the first semester 2018 FCOG Part II written examinations,\u201d the findings read.\n\nThe report said these \u201cconstituted a possible breach of the original obstetrics and gynaecology papers\u201d.\n\nWhile the conclusion cited instances of \u201cmarked similarity\u201d between Baloyi\u2019s \u201cmock exam\u201d and an external examination set in his presence, the report said there was \u201cnot enough evidence that indicated intentional and deliberate disclosure\u201d.\n\nBaloyi feels it is not enough. He is challenging the CMSA to be clear.\n\nHe intends to use as weapons points from the report, including where it says \u201cmock examinations are used to prepare candidates for the final exams at most training platforms in the country\u201d, and that \u201cno evidence that the actual (later retracted) FCOG Part II papers had been \u2018leaked\u2019, thus suggesting verbatim distribution of these papers.\n\nThe terminology of \u2018leaked\u2019 papers was thus used erroneously.\n\n\u201cI did nothing wrong. If, for instance, I teach gynaecology, am I not supposed to give my candidates mock questions on anything around organs, like ovary or vagina, just because there will be a question around that organ in their final examination?\u201d Baloyi said in an interview with City Press.\n\n\u201cIf what I did is wrong then it will mean all exams were compromised because we all do the same thing. We prepare candidates with previous questions. In my case, even after a new paper was set, my candidate still passed the exam.\u201d\n\nBaloyi has shown City Press letters from the college inviting him to examination committee meetings.\n\n\u201cI was accused and removed from the panel and do not understand why am I being invited when I am not sure if I am cleared of any wrongdoing,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso seen was a letter to CMSA president Professor Mike Sathekge, whom Baloyi said he met last month. He claimed Sathekge told him he was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThey are saying it but they won\u2019t put it in writing.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Baloyi asks the CMSA to \u201cofficially acknowledge that it erred in imposing the suspension, thereby debarring me from participating in the college activities\u201d and requests that \u201cany lifting of the suspension should be communicated in writing\u201d.\n\nWhen contacted about the matter, the college\u2019s chief executive, Lize Hayes, said: \u201cThe matter has not yet been finalised as Professor Baloyi has taken the findings on appeal. It would be premature to publicly address the matter at this stage.\u201d", "description": "A medical professor accused of leaking exam questions has challenged his accusers to be explicit in their findings and clear the \u201cconfusion contained in their ambiguous and inconclusive\u201d report into the matter.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7505/8f901ba1014a4e2f80c1bdcf65e8453c.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-03"}
