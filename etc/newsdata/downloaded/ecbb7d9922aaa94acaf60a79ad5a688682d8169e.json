REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe brief suspension of publication of the results from an electronic count of the Oct. 20 presidential election has triggered protests and strikes that have closed roads, schools and businesses around the nation for more than a week.\n\nIncumbent President Evo Morales, a leftist seeking a fourth term, was eventually declared the winner, prompting accusations of fraud from opposition candidate Carlos Mesa and his supporters.\n\nIn La Paz, opposition protesters mounted road barricades of rope, wooden boards and sheets of metal. Rows of helmet-clad riot police lined some streets, separating Morales\u2019 supporters from protesters opposed to the president.\n\nTear gas was used in at least two locations to disperse protesters.\n\nMorales, who has been in office nearly 14 years and is Latin America\u2019s longest-serving leader, has said the Organization of American States (OAS) will audit the election and that he will go to a second round if irregularities are found.\n\nThe Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) and Morales, 60, both deny any election fraud.\n\n\u201cWe, in the most transparent and secure way, confident in the sovereignty of the people, have invited an international audit,\u201d Vice President Alvaro Garcia told reporters early on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have called on the OAS and brother countries so they can clear up any doubt with respect to the malicious campaign of the losing candidate, who refuses to accept the decision of the Bolivian people,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n\u201cWe want to ask Carlos Mesa, the losing candidate, to join the audit,\u201d he added. \u201cWe await a speedy and affirmative response.\u201d\n\nWith 84% of the votes counted on Oct. 20, polling showed Morales was likely headed to a runoff with Mesa. However, when reporting resumed after nearly 24 hours, it showed Morales had pulled off a razor-thin victory.\n\nThe final, legally binding vote tally gave him 47.08% of votes to Mesa\u2019s 36.51%, less than a percentage point more than the 10-point margin needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nMesa, who has said he is confronting authoritarianism, did not immediately respond to Garcia\u2019s invitation but is expected to hold a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nProtesters in the streets accused the government of electoral fraud.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cThe audit doesn\u2019t help now,\u201d said Pamela Velez, 37, as police deployed gas at a barricade in the central part of the city. \u201c(The Morales government) has had a week to fix up (the vote).\u201d\n\nMesa, a former president, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that strikers would not accept negotiations to end protests.\n\nFive protesters were injured by gunshots on Monday in the industrial city of Santa Cruz. Police have said they are investigating the incident.", "description": "Protests over a disputed presidential election continued to convulse Bolivia on Tuesday as police fired tear gas in the capital and the government invited the opposition candidate to participate in an audit of the results.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446162904&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0UN", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
