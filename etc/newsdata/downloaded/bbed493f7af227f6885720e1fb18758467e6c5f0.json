We\u2019re instead shown moments of comedy and intimacy that feel completely regular yet also entirely important to the narrative, all of which are delightful and captivating.\n\nThis is of course mostly due to the stunning performances from Driver and Johansson.\n\nThe pair navigate separation (Picture: Netflix)\n\nEach digs into their characters\u2019 personalities and ticks in ways that balance and oppose each other brilliantly. It brings the script, that could have easily tipped from siding with one side or the other, to a place where you end up feeling awful for everyone involved.\n\nAlthough the latter half the film does seem to shift away from focusing on Johansson to the stories detriment.\n\nWhat may seem scattershot moments at first, flitting from quick montages to lengthy conversations, become rewarding as the film goes on.\n\nThrowaway jokes and lines become ammunition when returned in new contexts, as the couple continues to fracture apart. It feels much more structured and intricate than Baumbach\u2019s previous films without losing any of the spontaneous feeling.\n\nThe film is out next month (Picture: Netflix)\n\nUltimately it becomes a film about how easy it is to hurt someone else, and how equally easy it is to not even realise the pain you\u2019ve caused. About how the small moments stack upon one another until it\u2019s too much to take apart piece by piece. And about how we\u2019ve built up these systems and societal norms that push us to keep hurting each other to get what we want above all else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile many may take the film as sad, watching its central couple spiral further away from each other with increasing anger and pettiness, its story wraps with a moment that brings it all back around to a place of love; where these small moments can heal just as much as they hurt.\n\nMarriage Story is in cinemas 6 November and on Netflix 6 December.", "description": "Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver's Marriage Story will hit you right in the feels.", "authors": ["Jack Gracie"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d9b5850e-24ed-4e5b-89e5-eaa64391c4dd-unb_unit_09413_rgb-5195_1571756706.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
