All 12 of the songs from the \"Thank U, Next\" album landed on the Billboard Hot 100 list.\n\nGrande sells a variety of items on her website with \"Thank U, Next\" branding, including hats, socks, sweatshirts and more.\n\nRichard B. Levine/Newscom\n\nThe suit, which also named Riley Rose, the beauty company started by the daughters of Forever 21's founders, as a defendant, claimed that both brands \"fearing irrelevance in a rapidly evolving market with increasing competition,\" allegedly stole Grande's \"intellectual property to promote their brands for free.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, while the singer has used her success and star power to \"expand her career beyond the music industry through various commercial\" deals, she is \"selective of the brands\" she partners with \"and frequently turns down endorsement proposals.\"\n\nThe privately-owned clothing retailer that sells mostly to women ages 14 to 24 has approximately 815 stores in 57 countries around the world.\n\nForever 21 and Riley Rose did not immediately return ABC News' request for comment.", "description": "Superstar and Grammy-winning singer Ariana Grande filed a lawsuit against Forever 21 and Riley Rose.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ariana-grande-7-rings-video-ht-jc-190118_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
