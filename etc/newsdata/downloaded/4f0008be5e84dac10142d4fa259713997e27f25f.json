You can activate it whenever you want to go device-free \u2014 and you can customise the auto-responder so it tells people why you aren\u2019t available and when you\u2019ll respond to their texts or calls.\n\nThink of it like an out-of-office email, but for your phone.\n\nBehavioural design expert Nir Eyal explains the trick in his new book Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. He suggests the following customised message:\n\nHi! This is an automated reply to let you know I\u2019m indistractable at the moment. I will not see your message right away but I\u2019ll get back to you shortly. (I\u2019m not receiving notifications. If this is urgent, reply \u201curgent\u201d to send a notification through with your original message.)\n\nIf you are using an iPhone, there are still ways for people to reach you in an emergency \u2014 they can reply \u201curgent\u201d as noted above, or call your phone twice in a row.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking for this kind of hack, because my current method of remaining \u201cindistractable\u201d while working has been to keep my phone on silent and turn it face-down\u2014but then I worry that I might miss an emergency call from my parents, who live nearby.\n\nI could set my phone to Do Not Disturb full time, which would still let me receive twice-in-a-row calls from my family, but I like the idea of creating a customised message that can be tweaked to different kinds of situations. (\u201cI\u2019m at work,\u201d I\u2019m on annual leave,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m taking a phone-free day,\u201d etc.) I\u2019m of the generation who grew up with the AIM away message, so I\u2019m already thinking of how I could have a little fun with this.\n\nIt\u2019s also like setting up one of those, what did they used to be called?\u2014answering machines. A socially acceptable way to let people know that you can\u2019t get back to them right now, but will check your messages later.\n\nIf you want to know how to activate and update the DND While Driving auto-responder on your own phone, we\u2019ve got the step-by-step here.\n\nAdd An Auto-Responder To Do Not Disturb iOS: Apple's iOS recently joined Android in offering a \"Do Not Disturb While Driving\" mode. Unlike the normal iOS \"Do Not Disturb\", this mode also lets you auto-respond to anyone who texts. And you can activate it any time, not just when you're driving.
