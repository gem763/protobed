The drug was initially used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but was expanded to treat autism. Murray developed breast tissue after taking the drug, which was \u201chumiliating\u201d and \u201coften painful\u201d, his lawyers said.\n\nMurray\u2019s lawyers argued that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s subsidiary Janssen did not make him aware that the drug could lead to the development of female breast tissue. Tuesday\u2019s verdict was the first time a jury ruled on the case.\n\nThe jury ruled that Johnson & Johnson made a \u201cpervasive nationwide effort to illegally market Risperdal and downplay its very serious risks on a systemic level,\u201d according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Murray\u2019s lawyers are representing thousands of other people with similar claims against Johnson & Johnson.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said the $8bn award was \u201cgrossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case\u201d and \u201ca clear violation of due process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ruling is the latest in a string of multi-million dollar verdicts against Johnson & Johnson linked to historic drugs.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $575m by Oklahoma earlier this year over the company\u2019s historic involvement in the opioid crisis and earlier this month it reached a $20.4m settlement in Ohio over similar cases. Johnson & Johnson was also forced to pay $2.2bn in 2013 by the US Justice Department for unfairly marketing drugs, including Risperdal, as treatment for dementia.\n\nThey are also appealing a ruling made last year that required the drug company to $4.7bn to 22 US women who alleged that the company\u2019s talcum powder led them to develop ovarian cancer as a result of asbestos contamination.\n\nWatch the latest videos from Yahoo UK", "description": "Nicholas Murray was proscribed drug Risperdal as a child but claims he was not made aware of the possible side effects.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l0ibkTpUE_TcvFm_B2gUpw--~B/aD0yODczO3c9NDMwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/29b63bc0-ea76-11e9-aabf-252369204c2d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
