Biden has shown flimsy fealty to the facts in his own political career, but his campaign is now fighting to be the arbiter of truth, lobbying media outlets to squelch stories and refuse ads he says stretch the truth.\n\nHis campaign asked networks to stop booking Trump ally Rudolph W. Giuliani and then tried to organize a boycott of a Trump campaign ad by accusing the president of lying about Mr. Biden\u2019s actions to try to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired.\n\nAnd the Biden campaign on Thursday viciously attacked The New York Times for running an opinion column by an investigative reporter who questioned the international deal-making of Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, while his father was vice president.\n\n\u201cAre you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016?\u201d Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield demanded of the paper.\n\nThe attempt to berate the press has so far shown only modest payoff.\n\nCNN and NBC fell in line, barring the Trump ad from its airwaves. But other major outlets refused, including Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d said Katie Harbath, public policy director at Facebook. \u201cThus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers.\u201d\n\nThe line between truth and lies in politics has been getting murkier \u2014 so much so that a cottage industry of independent fact-checkers has popped up to sift through the scads of ads that are blasted into living rooms and splashed across computer and phone screens every election cycle.\n\nBut asking the press to cancel a candidate\u2019s ads could be the beginning of a slippery slope, said Steffan W. Schmidt, political science professor at Iowa State University.\n\n\u201cPolitical ads are almost always exaggerations \u2014 my polite term for lies and fabrications,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cSo almost every Democratic and Trump ad would need to be rejected.\u201d\n\nThat would also extend to social media, where candidates freely offer their opinions \u2014 sometimes unhinged from nuance or veracity.\n\n\u201cThe problem as always is that the truth is somewhat subjective and often the untruths are embedded in other stuff so it\u2019s hard to separate,\u201d the professor said.\n\nThe Trump ad that offended the Biden campaign claims the then-vice president \u201cpromised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,\u201d the narrator says in the spot, which has been viewed millions of times.\n\nMr. Biden did once brag that he used $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees as a cudgel to get Ukraine to force out the prosecutor.\n\nTim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, says the Biden campaign is scrambling to silence them because the \u201ctruth hurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best part is our ad includes Biden bragging about this very thing on videotape,\u201d Mr. Murtaugh said. \u201cOn what planet does he think he can deny it\u2019s true?\u201d\n\nBut fact-checkers say Mr. Biden\u2019s stance against the prosecutor was shared by other international partners who felt the prosecutor wasn\u2019t aggressive enough and needed to go. Those fact-checkers say Mr. Biden\u2019s threats were fair, and weren\u2019t tied to his son.\n\nFactcheck.org said: \u201cThe TV ad, in short, creates a false narrative about Joe Biden to discredit the impeachment inquiry, but it doesn\u2019t have the \u2018facts\u2019 to support its claim.\u201d\n\nTravis N. Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks ads in federal elections, said that it is \u201cfairly rare\u201d for TV stations to \u201creject something because it is untruthful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think in large part that\u2019s because federal regulations require them to not censor candidate ads,\u201d Mr. Ridout said. \u201cIn the vast majority of instances, you do hear candidates\u2019 complaints and they go nowhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might threaten to sue or whatever, but the lawsuit would be against the other candidate, not necessarily the TV station,\u201d he said.\n\nBeing the arbiter of truth is perhaps an odd fit for Mr. Biden, whose first presidential campaign flamed out in 1987 after he apologized for stealing passages from speeches by other politicians in his own addresses.\n\nIn this current campaign he\u2019s been chided for misrepresenting the Obama administration\u2019s immigration policies, his stance on the Iraq War and his voting record in the Senate.\n\n\u201cOne of Biden\u2019s problems is that he has a record of making stuff up,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t have to be a liability because according to most truth-checking projects, President Trump makes up a whole lotta stuff and it hasn\u2019t hurt him so far!\u201d\n\nIndeed, Politifact has scored 512 of the 724 statements \u2014 or 70% \u2014 they\u2019ve graded from Mr. Trump as \u201cMostly False,\u201d \u201cFalse,\u201d and \u201cPants on Fire.\u201d The group ranked 35 of the 96 claims \u2014 or 36% \u2014 they\u2019ve graded from Mr. Biden in a similar fashion.\n\nPatrick Griffin, a GOP strategist, said the Biden attempt to control the airwaves is patronizing to voters.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t convince him that his policies are bad, then they say we have to figure out a way to stop him,\u201d Mr. Griffin said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t be as sensitive and informed and as enlightened as they are.\u201d\n\nHank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist, said the Biden campaign is wasting its time, and said Mr. Trump has figured out that politics is less about fairness than about \u201ccombat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that you can stand there while the dragon is breathing fire on you and say it is unfair the dragon can do that is a throwback to another era,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no \u2018fair\u2019 in public discourse right now.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
