Buttigieg picked up his first endorsement from a Hispanic official: Mayor Michelle De La Isla of Topeka, Kan., the city's first Latina mayor. Former Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Mo., and Mayor Mark Barbee of Bridgeport, Pa., who are both black, also signed on to the endorsement.\n\nSeveral mayors also hail from early nominating states, including Ryan Arndorfer of Britt, Iowa, and Suzanne Prentiss of Lebanon, N.H.\n\nAnother notable nod came from Breea Clark of Norman, Okla., Sen. Elizabeth Warren's hometown.", "description": "Although the mayors are largely white, Buttigieg picked up some key endorsements from mayors of color.", "authors": ["Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e7/50/5039cbca448081428df2d078fdb0/190917-buttigieg2-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
