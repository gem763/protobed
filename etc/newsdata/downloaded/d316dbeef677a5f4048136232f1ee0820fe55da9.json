Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro has a tough road to the White House. But the Latino candidate dared to dream, and that's still inspirational.\n\nAt the end of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, I almost felt sorry for Juli\u00e1n Castro because he was drowned out by the 11 other contenders on stage.\n\nAnd he really needed a breakout moment to boost his candidacy in the most crowded field of presidential contestants in recent memory. Yet, my heart burst with pride just seeing him at the center of America\u2019s political stage.\n\nCastro is already an inspiration to a generation of Americans who wouldn\u2019t even dare dream try to land in the White House.\n\nForget the political differences for a moment \u2014 and there are many with Castro\u2019s agenda. It is just remarkably promising to see a Latino in the midst of one of the most existential election fights of a generation.\n\n2020 Ohio debate: Bernie Sanders is big winner in Democratic debate, but not because of anything he said\n\nThe 45-year-old Castro is running for president in 2020 to represent every American regardless of race.\n\n\u201cI wasn't born a frontrunner. I won't give up the fight to shine a light on the struggle of vulnerable folks and underrepresented communities,\u201d Castro said in a Twitter fundraising pitch after the debate.\n\nI wasn't born a frontrunner.

(Photo: John Minchillo, AP)\n\nCastro often mentions his humble upbringing in San Antonio, Texas, by a single mother \u2014 an activist who helped found the political party La Raza Unida. His grandmother was an immigrant from Mexico.\n\nThe family is deep-rooted in Texas politics. He served as a councilman and mayor of San Antonio. His identical twin brother, Joaquin, is a U.S. congressman.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, Stanford and Harvard-educated, is bright, articulate and no stranger to Washington, having served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under former President Barack Obama.\n\nA conservative's take: Winners and losers in the Democratic debate, from columnist Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nClearly, Castro has what it takes to win. But it\u2019ll be tough to pull it off. He has been hovering at about 1% support in the pollsand only raised $3.5 million in the third quarter \u2014 far below front-runners Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who during the same period brought in $25.3 million, $24.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively.\n\nDaring to dream can be a victory, too\n\nHis progressive agenda has raised eyebrows, especially his call for decriminalization of border crossers. Under his plan, entering the country illegally would still be a civil offense but people wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted in the criminal system.\n\nThat thrilled immigrant activists. But it also made everyone else question his electability, given that he must appeal to the broader population to have a fighting chance. Latinos are an important voting bloc, but too many don\u2019t go to the polls. In 2016, for instance, of the 27 million eligible to vote, only about 13 million cast a ballot, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nCastro\u2019s performance at Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio didn\u2019t fire up his campaign. But he\u2019s putting on a good fight and sometimes daring to dream is a victory in itself.\n\nElvia D\u00edaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral, where this column originally appeared.
