Though Google executives have long bragged about having a workplace culture designed to encourage open debate, current and former employees across the political spectrum have complained that they were retaliated against for raising concerns about equality and freedom of speech.\n\nThe settlement was approved by an agency director this week, according to a document. It is slated to go into effect after an appeals period.\n\nThe NLRB action is the second formal reminder to Google in a week to stay within the law. Last week, Google\u2019s YouTube unit settled an investigation into alleged violations of child-privacy law with a $170 million fine and an admonishment from regulators not to track the internet activity of children under age 13.\n\nGoogle, a unit of Alphabet Inc., GOOG 1.17% also is in the early days of separate investigations from the Justice Department and a group of attorneys general representing nearly every state into its dominant online advertising platform.\n\nPrivate employers have the ability to limit certain speech inside their workplaces, and late last month Google moved to prune office debates among its more than 100,000 full-time employees, adding new guardrails for discussions of nonwork topics and encouragement to avoid potentially disruptive conversations. Among the new rules: \u201cDiscussions that make other Googlers feel like they don\u2019t belong have no place here.\u201d\n\nFederal law protects activity like forming a union and conversations about improving pay, among other types of conduct.\n\nStill, current and former employees have said Google has overreached, or at times not done enough to protect their speech inside the workplace. The NLRB in its settlement orders Google to actively notify employees that the search giant killed rules to clamp down on employees sharing confidential information with one another, or with the media.\n\nRight-leaning employees say that expressing their beliefs can make them lepers among Google hiring managers, while left-leaning staff have been stymied in attempts to protest YouTube\u2019s evolving policies on hate speech, among other issues.\n\nSome of the more outspoken staffers were later offered pay packages to leave the company, these staffers say.\n\nThe NLRB\u2019s settlement comes in response to a pair of complaints about Google\u2019s reaction to workplace dissent.\n\nOne complainant, ex-Google engineer Kevin Cernekee, has said he was fired for expressing unpopular right-leaning political beliefs to fellow employees on the company\u2019s freewheeling internal message boards. Google says he was fired for misusing company equipment. President Trump tweeted support for Mr. Cernekee after The Wall Street Journal wrote about the former employee\u2019s allegations of bias last month.\n\nGoogle declined to comment this week on the NLRB action or Mr. Cernekee\u2019s case.\n\nThe other complainant is a current Google employee whose identity remains private. He alleges he was punished for posting unflattering opinions about a high-level Google executive on a Facebook page.\n\nThe NLRB\u2019s settlement is a victory for Google inasmuch as it doesn\u2019t make a formal determination about whether Google was in the wrong. Mr. Cernekee had asked to be reinstated, with back pay; he will receive neither under the settlement terms.\n\nInstead, the NLRB is ordering Google to inform current employees that they are free to speak to the media and others about working conditions, wages and the like, regardless of whether Google views such topics as inappropriate for the workplace.\n\nThe NLRB is also ordering Google to withdraw Mr. Cernekee\u2019s final warning letter, which said he had violated the \u201cRespect Each Other\u201d section of the company\u2019s code of conduct in five comments to message boards.\n\nAttorneys for Mr. Cernekee and the second complainant have objected in writing to the settlement, saying they deserve a hearing to air their views.\n\nWrite to Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "description": "Federal regulators have ordered Google to assure employees they are allowed to speak out on political and workplace issues, as part of a settlement of formal complaints that the search giant punishes those who do just that.", "authors": ["Rob Copeland", "Rob.Copeland Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106326/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
