Photo: Courtesy the author\n\nEver since I first saw Nicole Kidman in Practical Magic, I\u2019ve wanted red hair. My natural hair colour is dark brown, and although I dyed it \u2018red\u2019 at home as a teenager, it\u2019s impossible to get coppery, ginger hair from a box. Thanks to my genius colourist Chloe Backler at Hob Salons, my hair has been red since 2011, and since then, I\u2019ve been regularly asked about my colour \u2014 and, specifically, how I keep it from fading.\n\nThe truth is, coloured hair fades, and you will always need to get it retouched \u2014 most people get their roots and colour touched up every four to six weeks. However, I actually only get my colour done every 12 to 14 weeks, and I\u2019ve learned how to keep it looking as fresh and healthy as possible. After a few years of panicking about my colour\u2019s vibrancy and using expensive \u2018for red hair!\u2019 conditioners, my approach for saving my colour is pretty simple (and affordable): (1) I only wash my hair once a week, and (2) I no longer buy specific \u201ccolour save\u201d products \u2014 if it\u2019s of good quality and is gentle on your hair and scalp, it will (probably) also be gentle on your colour. My hair is pretty long, nearly halfway down my back, and while my scalp tends to get oily, the length of my hair can get quite dry if I don\u2019t condition and treat it properly. My hair and colour also benefits from \u2014 out of pure laziness \u2014 not regularly using hair straighteners or heat-based styling products. A couple times a month, I might be bothered to use my Revlon blow-drying brush, but that\u2019s it.\n\nAs a consumer, I\u2019ve very brand loyal, and so I\u2019ll try many different products from one place, like Lush, for example. I also tend to only take hair advice from people I know and trust in real life (who have amazing hair), so the below products have either been recommended to me by a friend or are made by a brand I really trust.\n\nThe best, gentle shampoo\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Worthington Everyday Gentle Micellar Shampoo Much like the skin on my face, my scalp can get quite oily, but if I strip all the moisture out of it, it gets even worse. This micellar shampoo (as recommended by Sali Hughes) says it\u2019s formulated to protect colour and is gentle enough to use everyday, but I still only use it once a week. It leaves my scalp feeling clean and my hair light, and I never feel like my colour has changed after I use it. Plus, it\u2019s pretty damn cheap! Because I have long hair, I use the equivalent of two 50p coins each time \u2014 it lathers nicely, and rinses without the awful, dry squeaky feeling. \u00a36 at Boots Buy\n\nThe best \u201cnatural\u201d shampoo to use\n\n\n\n\n\nLush Soak and Float Shampoo Bar I usually switch to using Lush\u2019s shampoo bars \u2014 specifically the Soak \u2019n Float \u2014 in the winter months as my scalp tends to get a bit dandruffy. These shampoo bars are gentle on your hair (if you\u2019re worried about sulfates, read this), and when I started using these instead of salon-grade shampoos, my hair stylist was like, \u2018What are you using?! Your hair feels so much healthier!\u2019 And I felt smug AF because it was just a shampoo bar from Lush. You can buy a little tin dish to store it in, but I find this doesn\u2019t allow the shampoo bar to dry properly, and it can get gooey and then get stuck inside the tin. I recommend storing it on a soap dish that will let it air out properly. \u00a38 at Lush Buy\n\nThe best, cheapest conditioner\n\nPalmers Coconut Oil Formula Repairing Conditioner Brands will use ridiculous-sounding technology and pop stars to try to convince you that their condition is the best way to protect your colour \u2014 and this is bollocks. The best, affordable conditioner I\u2019ve ever used is this one from Palmer\u2019s. It smells nice and leaves my hair feeling soft and my colour intact. A hair stylist once told me that if your hair is full of water, it can\u2019t absorb any of the conditioner, so I always squeeze out or towel dry the length of my hair a bit before I add conditioner \u2014 and 15 years on, it does seem to help. Ideally, you should leave this in for around five minutes, but I can\u2019t be bothered and want to save water in the shower, so it only stays on my hair for about one to two minutes at the very most. \u00a37 at Amazon UK Buy \u00a34 at Superdrug Buy\n\nThe best hair mask\n\n\n\n\n\nPalmer's Coconut Oil Formula Deep Conditioning Protein Pack I\u2019ve purchased and used many hair masks that have been sold to me at salons, but this is by far the best (and cheapest). Recommended to me by a former colleague after I commented on how swishy and shiny her hair was, I use this about every other week, sometimes even just as a conditioner if I\u2019m in a rush. If I\u2019m using it properly as a mask, I\u2019ll try to leave it in while I watch an hourlong show on Netflix. I honestly don\u2019t believe all the hype around expensive, exotic-sounding oils and ingredients, and even though coconut oil is still having a moment, at \u00a32 this leaves my hair feel nourished and easy to brush through. \u00a33 at Amazon UK Buy \u00a32 at Superdrug Buy\n\nThe best dry shampoo spray\n\n\n\n\n\nBatiste Dry Shampoo Cherry Dry shampoo is key to not washing your hair as often in order to preserve your colour. And although there are some amazing dry-shampoo sprays out there, Batiste can do the same thing as the fancy stuff for less money. I\u2019ve tried the ones with colour as a touch up for roots (they did make a red one back in like 2013 but discontinued it), but I find them a bit weird and wouldn\u2019t recommend, as it\u2019s hard to match your hair colour and, if not used properly, it leaves your scalp looking stained. To prevent having giant, ghosty white marks on your head, make sure to shake the bottle properly and hold it 30cm away from your head. The cherry scent is my favourite. \u00a33 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nThe best solid, dry shampoo\n\n\n\n\n\nR+Co BADLANDS Dry Shampoo Paste I got a sample of this when I subscribed to BirchBox, and I was really impressed with it. I like texture in my hair as well as a bit of volume, and this does exactly that. It takes some playing around with to figure out how much is the right amount for your hair (too much and it looks greasy), but once you do, it\u2019s fantastic. At the end of the week, when my hair is looking a bit flat and dull, I\u2019ll combine this with Batiste for some serious zhuzh. I add like half a pea-sized amount to my fingers and work it through particularly dull or greasy parts of my hair, near the roots, and I don\u2019t brush it through like I would Batiste. I used a tiny bit once or twice a week, and a tiny sample sized pot lasted me over six months! \u00a324 at Cult Beauty Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
