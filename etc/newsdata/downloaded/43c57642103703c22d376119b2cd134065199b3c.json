For every 1,000 citizens there are 514 cars, second only to Germany in car ownership among European nations.\n\nThe issue is particularly toxic for Progress, which presents itself as the motorists\u2019 party, and from which the current minister of transport is drawn.\n\nThe anti-toll protest is seen by some as a Nordic variant on the gilets jaunes movement in France, representing a backlash against the imposition of extra costs on drivers in the name of environmental protection.\n\nSuch is the anger that Sindre Finnes, the husband of Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, was briefly dragged into the issue due to his previous shareholdings in companies that make money at toll booths.\n\nThe FNB is expected to do particularly well in Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger, where the anti-toll party was founded in 2014.\n\nIn August, Solberg narrowly escaped presiding over a minority government when there was conflict between two of the four parties in her coalition, Progress and the centrist Liberals, over how to pay for roads and public transport. The rightwing Progress party has been calling for large cuts to road tolls, a policy opposed by the Liberals.\n\nThe coalition\u2019s compromise involved an agreement that the state will increase its financial contribution in public-private partnerships \u2013 so-called 50/50 projects \u2013 to 66% to fund a cut in the costs to motorists on toll roads. The increase in toll charges on motorways and in big cities has left motorists faced with paying hundreds of pounds more a year.", "description": "Gilets jaunes-style movement has threatened to bring down national government", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890af5346af04027fc577feb19e4f697bdb09cc9/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e50b1374ad8bbbf60801c3bebfa042b", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
