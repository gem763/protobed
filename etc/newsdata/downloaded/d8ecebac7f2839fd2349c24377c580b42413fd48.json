As always, the threat was taken very seriously and law enforcement became involved. The person making the threat is now in police custody being charged with a felony. As of July 1, the state of MS considers such threats against schools as a terroristic threat,\" the letter said according to Biloxi ABC affiliate WLOX.\n\n\"Although it saddens us that a poor decision could have such a serious impact on a young person\u2019s life, such statements written or uttered WILL NOT be tolerated,\" the statement continued. \"School safety above everything else is our NUMBER ONE priority.\"\n\nThe school year just started on Aug. 6.\n\nThere have been a number of shooting threats made online leading to arrests in recent weeks in the wake of shootings in El Paso, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and Odessa, Texas.\n\nTwo students, one a middle schooler, were arrested in late August for separate shooting threats in Davie, Florida, and Brandon, Florida.
