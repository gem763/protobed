It was released late on Sunday evening following a phone call between Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and the United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \"Caliphate\" will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d the White House statement said.\n\nThe SDF, a mostly Kurdish militia with some smaller Arab groups attached, has been Washington\u2019s main ally in the fight against Isis in Syria. The group received US arms, as well as massive air and ground support in the battle to defeat the Isis caliphate. It lost more than 10,000 fighters before the caliphate's fall earlier this year.\n\nAnkara, meanwhile, considers the SDF a terrorist organisation for its links to banned Kurdish separatist organisation inside Turkey.\n\nMr Trump has previously made abrupt announcements regarding the fate of US forces in Syria, only to later to walk them back. But the SDF said in a statement on Monday that US forces had already begun to withdraw from the area along Turkey\u2019s border. The move appeared to take them completely by surprise.\n\n\"The American forces did not fulfil their commitments and withdrew their forces from the border areas with Turkey, and Turkey is now preparing for an invasion operation of northern and eastern Syria,\" the SDF said in a statement.\n\n\"Erdogan's threats are aimed to change the security mechanism into a mechanism of death, displace our people and change the stable and secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war.\" it added.\n\nThe US currently has around 1,000 troops in northeast Syria, ostensibly to support Kurdish forces and ensure the lasting defeat of Isis. But their presence was also acting as a powerful deterrent for a Turkish attack. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to enter Syria to implement a \"safe zone\" along the border, free from SDF fighters. In September, following months of Turkish pressure, the SDF agreed to withdraw from some areas along the border to allow for joint US-Turkey patrols.\n\nRead more\n\nSyrian border town braces for new Turkish offensive\n\nBut Turkey has expressed frustration that the measures do not go far enough. Responding to the White House announcement on Monday, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu sai\u200bd Turkey would \"contribute to peace and stability in Syria.\"\n\n\"Since the beginning of the crisis in Syria, we supported the country's territorial integrity, and we will continue to do so from now on,\" he said in a tweet.\n\nYusuf Erim, a political and strategic analyst at Turkey\u2019s TRT public broadcaster, cautioned that it was too early to take the White House readout verbatim. Turkish officials are closely watching developments in Washington for signs of resistance within the US military and diplomatic corps to the US announcement.", "description": "The US will not stand in the way of a planned Turkish military operation against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria, the White House has announced, raising the prospect of a major conflict between two US allies.The abrupt announcement signals an abandonment by Washington of its longtime ally in the", "authors": ["Richard Hall", "Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DcDpaGMC9Q9r_MJPk3C.Rw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/28e1797172354ad375be5dda1fc465f2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
