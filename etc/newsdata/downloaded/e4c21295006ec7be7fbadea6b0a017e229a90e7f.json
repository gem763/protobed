All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\"\n\nA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\n(MORE: Maxine Waters, AOC slam Zuckerberg during Libra testimony for ads that give 'licence to lie')\n\n\"We considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too,\" Dorsey added.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign team responded to the news.\n\n\"We appreciate that Twitter recognizes that they should not permit disproven smears, like those from the Trump campaign, to appear in advertisements on their platform,\" said Bill Russo, the Biden campaign's deputy communications director in a statement. \"It would be unfortunate to suggest that the only option available to social media companies to do so is the full withdrawal of political advertising, but when faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out.\"\n\nAnother Democratic hopeful, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, reacted to Twitter's announcement by tweeting, \"Good. Your turn, Facebook.\"\n\nTrump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, slammed Twitter's decision, saying in a statement, \"Twitter just walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars of potential revenue, a very dumb decision for their stockholders. Will Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans? This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.\"\n\nBut the effect of Twitter's move might not be as impactful as if Facebook followed suit. For example, while the Trump campaign is spending $15.6 million on Facebook ads and $9.1 million on Google ads since January, they have only spent $6,300 on Twitter ads.\n\nTrump campaign communications director, Tim Murtaugh, told ABC News that the campaign planned to spend \"many\" millions over the next 12 months on the platform, after shutting down their Twitter ads back in August.\n\nTwitter CFO Ned Segal also acknowledged on on Twitter, \"political ad spend for the 2018 US midterms was <$3M.\"\n\nThe final policy will be shared on Nov. 15 and will go into effect on Nov. 22, Dorsey said, noting there will be a \"few exceptions\" including ads that support voter registration.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address,\" Dorsey concluded.\n\nPHOTO: In this Sept. 5, 2018, file photo Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
