Only 223 pairs of Nike Inc.\u2019s retro high-top were made for sale, according to online magazine Sneaker Files.\n\nThe model is among the most profitable sneakers traded on the exchange created by Beijing-based Nice App Mobile Technology Co. Such outsize returns are hard to come by, but they've nonetheless caught the attention of sneakerheads like Lei Xiaoming, 20, a mechanical engineering student in Huangshi.\n\nLei has collected limited-edition shoes for years but only started investing in them in April.\n\n\u201cPrices were surging so much I thought it would be a better choice to sell them rather than wear them,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt's more exciting than trading stocks.\u2019\u2019\n\nSince then, he's spent about 200,000 yuan buying more than 200 pairs \u2014 mostly Air Jordans and Adidas AG's Yeezy line, a collaboration with rapper Kanye West. He\u2019s earned profits of about 100,000 yuan by reselling some, he said.\n\nAcross China, more than 10 million monthly active users frequent online-resale apps, such as Poizon, Nice and DoNew, according to Chinese data-mining company QuestMobile. While many products suffer from the effects of the trade war, pairs of collectible sneakers are flying off the shelves, and that\u2019s attracting the attention of U.S. sneaker exchanges StockX and GOAT \u2014 as well as China\u2019s central bank and state media.\n\n\u201cChina will soon become the sneaker capital of the world\u201d\n\nMost of what\u2019s traded on these platforms are basketball sneakers \u2014 a testament to China\u2019s love of the sport, even as the NBA faces backlash for a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s tweet appearing to support Hong Kong\u2019s protests.\n\nThe buzz over shoe reselling made a unicorn out of Poizon, developed by Shanghai Shizhuang Information Technology Co. In April, funding from Digital Sky Technologies vaulted its valuation to $1 billion, according to CB Insights.\n\nChina's sneaker-resale market exceeds $1 billion in value, said Scott Cutler, chief executive officer of Detroit-based sneaker exchange SoleTrade LLC, known as StockX.\n\nChinese investors long have speculated in alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, fiery liquor from Kweichow Moutai Co., and garlic.\n\nNow, sneakers have their attention. Unlike Chinese stocks, which only can move 10% in either direction, there's no cap on shoe returns.\n\n\u201cAs with all frothy assets, there's no telling where the peak is,\u2019\u2019 said Yu Yingbo, investment director at Shenzhen Qianhai United Fortune Fund Management Co. \u201cAs long as there are high returns, there is going to be money chasing them.\u2019\u2019\n\nSneaker collecting went mainstream in the U.S. after Nike launched Air Jordans in the 1980s, and the trade went digital with eBay Inc. about a decade later.\n\nToday\u2019s technology makes the trade more sophisticated. Apps collect bid and ask prices, chart costs and volume in real time, and allow users to share investment advice. Some also let customers buy coupons that can be traded for shoes before coveted models arrive \u2014 in effect selling sneaker futures.\n\nNow more-established trading sites in the U.S. want a piece of the action in China.\n\nStockX plans to introduce local payment and language support this year, said Cutler, previously the head of global listings at the New York Stock Exchange. China already comprises about 10% of StockX\u2019s transaction volume.\n\nCulver City, California-based 1661 Inc.\u2019s GOAT launched a mini-app on WeChat in July after receiving $100 million in funding from Foot Locker Inc.\n\n\u201cChina will soon become the sneaker capital of the world,\u2019\u2019 said Henek Lo, general manager of GOAT China. The demand from Chinese millennials is \u201csomething we haven\u2019t seen anywhere else.\u201d\n\nSignificant rewards typically are accompanied by significant risks, and sneaker trading is no different. Of more than 2,600 collectible models sold on Nice, 56% lost value, according to company data. Only 0.4% of footwear saw returns of more than 1,000% on the app.\n\nBut Tian Hao, 27, is convinced he\u2019s cracked the code. These days, his 90-square-meter (969-square-foot) Beijing apartment mostly serves as storage space for his inventory, which he estimates to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- One of the hottest commodities in China right now is a pair of sneakers.The SoleFly x Air Jordan 1 in black patent leather rocketed in value by 6,600% to a high of 75,999 yuan ($10,730) on the online marketplace Nice after its release in December.
