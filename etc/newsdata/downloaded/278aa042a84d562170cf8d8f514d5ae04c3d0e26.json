It's the only agency that has not yet \"junked\" South Africa.\n\nThe rand started weakening on Tuesday in response to government's rescue plan for Eskom, which was presented by Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan. Gordhan said Finance Minister Tito Mboweni would expand on plans to deal with Eskom's R450bn debt burden.\n\nBut Mboweni again kicked the can down the road on Wednesday, failing to announce any strategy to restructure Eskom's debt.\n\nThe government will only make an announcement on how it will help the struggling power utility reduce its debt burden once it has seen evidence of a commitment by Eskom to become more competitive and cut costs, Mboweni said.\n\nMboweni emphasised that debt is accelerating at an unsustainable pace in a dismal economic landscape. He stressed that a weak global environment is adding to pressure on the local economy, and that drastic action is needed to ensure that SA creates a sustainable economic environment.\n\nBianca Botes, Treasury Partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, welcomed Mboweni's undertaking that government will in future only extend loans to state-owned entities - and expect to be paid back.\n\n\"Cashflow support to SOEs will be in the form of loans, no longer equity, which should offer some offset for the rating agencies. It also means that the SOEs need to learn to fend for themselves.\"\n\nJameel Ahmad, global head of FXTM, expects that the rand will continue to weaken - especially if the US Federal Reserve holds back from cutting interest rates in the United States later on Wednesday evening.", "description": "The rand lost more than 2.5% against the US dollar after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's mini budget speech on Wednesday afternoon.", "authors": ["- Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8979/ae94586b581a4359afbd164cf80877ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
