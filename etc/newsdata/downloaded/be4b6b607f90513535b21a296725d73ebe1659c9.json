Food delivery service Just Eat sits among them, alongside Ocado, Boohoo and Asos.\n\nAll of these firms combine the UK's tradition of shopkeeping with online nous. Ocado has shown how to take its model global. Boohoo, Asos and the like are giving more traditional fashion retail \u2013 even low-cost brands such as Primark and H&M \u2013 a run for their money.\n\nYet there is a widespread assumption that with two offers on the table Just Eat investors should take the shares or cash on offer and run.\n\nOn the menu: There is a widespread assumption that with two offers on the table Just Eat investors should take the shares or cash on offer and run.\n\nOne offer is an all-share bid from Dutch lookalike Takeaway, worth 594p per share after the subsidence of its share price.\n\nThe alternative is a cash offer from wealthy South African-backed Prosus, worth \u00a35.2 billion, or 710p per share. To put that in context, that is 3.7 times the value currently placed on Domino's Pizza. Whatever one may think of the social value of the Just Eat model it has found an important place in the UK food market and beyond.\n\nIndeed, when Sainsbury's was seeking to justify its aborted merger with Asda to the Competition & Markets Authority it identified Just Eat as competition in the prepared food space. The numbers on Just Eat's website are a guide to the company's reach.\n\nIn 2018 it added 4.8m new users and its platform includes no less than 4.9m reviews of restaurants for which it provides the delivery services.\n\nThe total orders processed in 2018 were \u00a34.2 billion. It has 26m active customers across several territories, including most of the Nordic area, Spain and France as well as Canada and Australia.\n\nIt has done this by using the kind of smart app we have become used to at Uber, which does the geography, the payments and offers feedback that digital customers use as guidance.\n\nIt is just the kind of services enterprise which a post-Brexit UK ought to treasure. But so far there has been not a hint of a shareholder or boardroom rebellion, just suggestions that management should sit back and grab the cash.\n\nWhat investors ought to consider is why Just Eat is in play. There are the obvious factors. Brexit uncertainty has left the valuations of UK-based companies way behind those of American and European counterparts. The depreciation of the pound means that the premiums being offered by overseas buyers are an illusion.\n\nJust Eat also is a plaything for key investor Cat Rock, which owns stakes in Take-away and Just Eat. No one is going to rush to its defence on national interest grounds.\n\nBut the way it is being sacrificed to short-term gain offers a glimpse of shortcomings in British capitalism at the start of an election campaign where the role of free markets will be central.\n\nGreen hand\n\nThe new chief executive of BP, Bernard Looney, faces a different order of problems to his predecessor. Bob Dudley's main task was to restore finances and reputation after the $62 billion (\u00a348 billion) Macondo explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n\nHe repaired relations with Moscow by making BP a minority holder in oil giant Rosneft. The difficulties faced by his successor are symbolised by third-quarter results which saw a sharp fall in profit as a result of lower oil prices and the adverse impact of Hurricane Barry.\n\nThe US is now self-sufficient in supplies so the oil price is far less vulnerable to attacks on Saudi facilities of the kind seen recently. Margins for big oil could be diminished.\n\nHurricanes are a reminder of the climate change threat which has luvvies, such as Shakespearean actor Sir Mark Rylance, up in arms. BP and big oil will need to make huge adjustments to the green agenda if they are not to end up as tobacco-like social pariahs.\n\nDesert storm\n\nWhile on the subject of oil it is interesting to note who among the good and the great has been tempted back to 'reformist' Saudi leader Prince Mohammed bin Salman's 'Davos in the Desert' after the murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAmong high-profile attendees was Blackrock chief executive Larry Fink.\n\nHe began the year by dispatching a letter to the chief executives in companies in which Blackrock is invested noting 'trust in multilateralism and official institutions is crumbling', and demanding better governance standards.
