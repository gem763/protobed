Governor Pressures Gun Industry to Tighten Controls", "language": "en", "text": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the state may end business relationships with retailers and makers of guns if they don\u2019t adopt measures to curb illegal firearm sales.\n\nThe Democratic governor signed an executive order Tuesday directing state officials to ask all gun makers or retailers that currently sell weapons to New Jersey to disclose how they screen for straw purchasers or firearms traffickers and prevent sales to people barred from owning guns. Under the order, the state will also ask the retailers and gun manufacturers how they promote gun safety and assist law-enforcement investigations into criminal possession of firearms.\n\nNew Jersey currently spends about $70 million annually on guns, parts and ammunition, largely for law enforcement.\n\n\u201cIf we find folks not living up to our standards, we reserve the right to stop doing business with them moving forward,\u201d Mr. Murphy said at a press conference. \u201cAnd where we find a retailer who is doing the right things but doesn\u2019t yet have the ability to compete for state contracts, we will gladly open the door for doing business with good actors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said New Jersey hasn\u2019t codified requirements for gun manufacturers and retailers to do business with the state, and added that the executive order is an effort to find common ground with the gun industry.\n\n\u201cThis is not intended at day one to be an adversarial act,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is to express a broad statement of principles and values that matter to us deeply.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey already has a background-check law for gun purchases within the state. Mr. Murphy\u2019s executive order aims to persuade the gun industry to adopt such measures and other best practices in states with less stringent firearm laws than New Jersey\u2019s.\n\nLawrence Keane, general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun makers and retailers, said the executive order would exceed the governor\u2019s authority by trying to regulate interstate commerce outside of the state if Mr. Murphy\u2019s aim is to influence the actions of licensed gun dealers outside of New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe governor views licensed and law-abiding small businesses that are just trying to earn a living, and are engaged in the lawful commerce of a constitutionally protected product, [as] somehow the problem,\u201d Mr. Keane said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s executive order also directs the state Treasurer\u2019s office to ask financial institutions doing business with the state to disclose whether they have adopted standards for their dealings with the gun industry. Mr. Murphy said the state, which pays about $1 billion annually in fees to these institutions, could also cut financial ties with any that give unsatisfactory responses.\n\nThe executive order \u201censures that taxpayer dollars are being used wisely to procure goods and services from companies that act responsibly when it comes to firearms and ammunition,\u201d said state Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio.\n\nMr. Murphy also directed New Jersey\u2019s Department of Banking and Insurance to prohibit or limit the sale of insurance products that encourage the improper use of firearms. The department will scrutinize liability insurance for personal firearm use that protects against civil claims, which are currently legal in the state, and determine whether such programs should be allowed to continue, the governor\u2019s office said.\n\nMr. Murphy signed a package of gun-control bills into law in 2018, including banning magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds, and mandatory background checks for private firearm sales. Former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, had previously vetoed tighter gun measures passed by the Democratic-controlled state Legislature during his two-term tenure.\n\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "description": "New Jersey Gov.
