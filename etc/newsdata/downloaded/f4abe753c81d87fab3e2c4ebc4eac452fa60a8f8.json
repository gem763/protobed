But the students find new ways to use their supplies as a shooter terrorizes their school.\n\n\u201cThese new sneakers are just what I need for the new year,\u201d a young boy says as he runs away from the shooter in the school hallway.\n\n\u201cThis jacket is a real must-have,\u201d a young girl says as she uses it to fasten a set of doors shut in the gymnasium so the shooter can\u2019t enter.\n\nAnother student describes his new skateboard as \u201cpretty cool\u201d as he uses it to break through a window in his classroom to escape as students scream in the background.\n\nTwo more students can be seen hiding in their art class, gripping new scissors and colored pencils in case they need to defend themselves. Another girl uses her new socks as a makeshift tourniquet on her classmate\u2019s wounded leg.\n\nIn the final scene, a crying girl crouched in the darkness sends a text on her phone: \u201cI love you mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI finally got my own phone to stay in touch with my mom,\u201d she says through tears before the sound of a door opening is heard in the background. The girl closes her eyes as footsteps grow louder.\n\nWhite words on a black background in the ad conclude, \u201cIt\u2019s back to school time and you know what that means. School shootings are preventable when you know the warning signs.\u201d\n\nNicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son was one of the 20 children killed during the 2012 massacre, co-founded Sandy Hook Promise to curb gun violence and lobby for legislation to help make schools safer. She said her group\u2019s new ad may be hard to watch, but it\u2019s necessary to effect change.\n\n\u201cPeople might wonder why do a PSA that is hard to watch,\u201d she said during an interview with \u201cToday\u201d that aired Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to run away from it. So pretending it doesn\u2019t exist is not helping to solve [the issue of school shootings.]\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly seven years since the devastating shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\n\n\nSandy Hook Promise, which was founded by families impacted by that tragedy, is releasing a shocking PSA they say all families need to see. pic.twitter.com/BDhvcwYlSx \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 18, 2019\n\nSince the Sandy Hook shooting, more than 400 people have been shot on campuses nationwide, according to a New York Times report. To address the epidemic of gun violence sweeping the nation, Sandy Hook Promise has called on Congress to pass classroom safety and gun safety legislation.\n\nThe group is also urging everyone to recognize the signs of a potential shooter, including a fascination or obsession with firearms, social isolation and over-reactions to seemingly minor issues.\n\nSandy Hook Promise has released several \u201cKnow The Signs\u201d PSAs over the last few years, though this year\u2019s \u201cBack-To-School Essentials\u201d ad is the most graphic and is the group\u2019s first one to show blood.\n\nSeveral presidential candidates have signed on to share the video on their social media, and a few networks, including CNN and AMC, have donated media placements, according to the Times.\n\nWhen asked how she\u2019s holding up seven years after her son\u2019s death, Hockley told \u201cToday\u201d that she\u2019s \u201cstill standing\u201d and hopeful that the ad will ignite change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still filled with hope because I know that we can save lives along the way while we get to where we need to be as a country,\u201d she said.", "description": "Sandy Hook Promise released the heartbreaking PSA to raise awareness about the signs of a potential school shooter.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82144c2300001005571645.png?cache=mype9flfaj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
