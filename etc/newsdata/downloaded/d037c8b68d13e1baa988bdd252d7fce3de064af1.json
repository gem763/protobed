Chris Christie signed a lucrative consulting contract with a pharmaceutical company less than a year after President Donald Trump\u2019s bipartisan commission on opioids and addiction, which Christie chaired, recommended policy changes the drugmaker sought.\n\nPacira BioSciences paid Christie $800,000, plus stock options, in 2018 and 2019 as it lobbied for new Medicare rates to boost the financial prospects of its flagship product, a non-opioid painkiller used in surgeries, according to a POLITICO review of the New Jersey company\u2019s regulatory filings.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Christie-led commission\u2019s final report, published in November 2017, encouraged the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to review and modify Medicare reimbursement rates for non-opioid painkillers used to treat patients post-surgery.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, non-addictive pain medications are bundled in federal reimbursement policies so that hospitals and doctors are essentially not covered to prescribe non-opioid pain management alternatives,\u201d Christie wrote in a Nov. 1, 2017, letter that accompanied the report, echoing testimony Pacira BioSciences CEO David Stack had provided to the commission five weeks earlier.\n\n\u201cThese types of policies, which the federal government can fix, are a significant deterrent to turning the tide on the health crisis we are facing. We urge you to order HHS to fix it,\u201d Christie wrote.\n\nThe clout of the commission\u2019s recommendation played an important role in influencing the agency\u2019s decision to set a remunerative reimbursement rate for Exparel, Pacira\u2019s non-opioid painkiller, in late 2018 \"in response to the recommendation from the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis,\" according to the agency.\n\nBy mid-2018, shortly after Christie left office, Pacira arranged a $481,000 contract with the former governor in exchange for \u201chigh-level guidance about organizational strategy,\u201d according to a company spokesperson. Christie LLC \u2014 described in Pacira's SEC filings as \u201can entity affiliated with Mr. Christie\u201d \u2014 received another $380,000 the next year, along with stock options for 35,000 Pacira shares that, if exercised, are now worth around $1.3 million.\n\nDetails of the contract have not been previously reported.\n\n\u201cGov. Christie was not a consultant to Pacira at any point during his tenure as Chair of President Trump\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis,\u201d Amber Sears, Pacira\u2019s vice president of communications, said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cOur consulting relationship began in mid-2018. During the course of this relationship, Gov. Christie ... was not involved in executing our governmental relations engagements.\u201d\n\nThe contracts were terminated last week after the Nasdaq-traded company, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., named Christie to its board of directors. In a press release, Pacira cited Christie\u2019s work on the commission \u2014 whose report it has since utilized in its lobbying efforts \u2014 as an example of the expertise the one-time presidential candidate will bring to its board.\n\nTelephone and email efforts by POLITICO to contact Christie over the past week through his office and former associates were unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, Christie told NJ Advance Media on Thursday that \u201cPacira is providing non-opioid pain relief to patients in an era where we see the dangers of opioid addiction in every corner of America. I am proud to be associated with a company with such an effective tool in the war on preventing opioid addiction in the first place.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential campaign, and with his rocky second term as governor drawing to a close, Christie turned his attention to the public health crisis posed by rising rates of opioid addiction in his home state. As overdose deaths in New Jersey climbed into the thousands, Christie\u2019s administration responded with a $42.6 million advertising and public outreach campaign along with $200 million in anti-opioid and addiction treatment measures .\n\nPacira, a local company whose flagship product functioned as an alternative to opioids for post-surgical patients, made for a natural ally in those efforts.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth had been slowed by Medicare reimbursement policies, according to a POLITICO review of Pacira\u2019s earnings call transcripts.\n\nProviders who prescribed Exparel to patients on Medicare weren\u2019t receiving any additional payments from Medicare because of the way the drug is administered.\n\nClinicians inject Exparel into surgical sites to numb the area for several days after surgery, forestalling the patient\u2019s need for opioid painkillers. Because the treatment is used in surgery, CMS viewed Exparel as an element of the procedure and wouldn\u2019t offer providers a separate payment for it use.\n\n\u201cDrugs like Exparel are not reimbursed separately, but payment is considered to be bundled into this fixed payment simply because the drugs are administered during the surgery, despite the fact that this administration is intended to manage post-surgical pain,\u201d Stack told Christie and other members of Trump\u2019s opioid commission , after being invited to testify at a September 2017 meeting. \u201cThis payment policy created a perverse incentive for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers by essentially rewarding those that prescribed opioids instead of administering a non-opioid pain medication.\u201d\n\nStack\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t land on deaf ears. The commission\u2018s report that Christie submitted to Trump on Nov. 1, 2017, recommended a review and modification of \u201crate-setting policies that discourage the use of non-opioid treatments for pain, such as certain bundled payments.\u201d\n\nThe report was good news for Pacira. A week after it was finalized, Stack told financial analysts that the company's effort to receive new rates were \"benefiting from ... the almost unbelievably strong commitment of Governor Christie and [former] Congressman [and opioid commission member Patrick] Kennedy in this area.\"\n\nOver the next year \u2014 including after Christie had signed on as a consultant \u2014 Pacira repeatedly referenced the commission\u2019s recommendations in its push for a dedicated Medicare reimbursement rate for Exparel.\n\nIn a Sept. 24, 2018, letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma, Stack argued that the agency should heed the commission\u2019s advice in modifying rate-setting policies that discourage the use of non-opioid treatments for pain.\n\nThose recommendations resonated with CMS.\n\nIn November 2018, citing the Christie-led commission\u2019s report, Medicare announced it would reimburse providers for the average sales price plus 6 percent for non-opioid pain medicines used in procedures at ambulatory surgery centers, starting in 2019. Opioid pain relievers remained in the bundled payment for surgeries, lowering the comparative incentive to prescribe them, POLITICO reported at the time .\n\nExparel was the only drug that qualified for the more lucrative reimbursement rate when CMS finalized its rates.\n\nThe new rates didn\u2019t represent a complete victory for Pacira. CMS declined to set up a separate reimbursement schedule for Experal treatments administered in hospitals.\n\nEven so, \u201cthis reimbursement code provides us with a crucial element to expanding the use of Exparel in the ambulatory setting,\u201d which made up 10 percent of the drugmaker\u2019s business the previous year, Stack told analysts in a February earnings call \u2014 three months after CMS finalized its rates. \u201cConsequently, we see significant growth opportunity here and our team is working with commercial payers to follow Medicare's lead and reimburse for this effective non-opioid option.\u201d\n\nChristie had no role in Pacira\u2019s engagement with CMS, Sears said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGov. Christie provided Pacira with valuable insight and guidance as we executed on our corporate mission to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as appropriate by increasing patient access to non-opioid pain management solutions,\u201d she wrote. \"Governor Christie\u2019s appointment to the Pacira board was based on his long-time, unwavering commitment to the opioid crisis and his track record as a seasoned government leader who gets things done. This is the exactly the type of individual we want on our board, and we are honored to have him join.\"", "description": "Details of the contract have not been previously reported.", "authors": ["Sam Sutton"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-Chris%20Christie_01_0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
