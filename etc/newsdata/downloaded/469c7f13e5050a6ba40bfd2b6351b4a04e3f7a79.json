Now, clearly not.\n\n\u201cFrom the energy, the outlook...(Ferrari are) trying to ramp Charles up,\u201d added the Briton, who leads team mate Valtteri Bottas by 73 points with five races to go and is also heading for a sixth title.\n\nFerrari have long had an obvious number one and two, with Eddie Irvine and Rubens Barrichello playing the supporting role to Michael Schumacher, who retired with seven championships.\n\nVettel, who joined the Italian team in 2015 hoping to emulate boyhood hero Schumacher, enjoyed the lead role until this season.\n\nLeclerc, an ambitious youngster still in his first year at Ferrari and only his second in Formula One, has turned the tide his way.\n\nThe Monegasque handed Ferrari their first win of a difficult year in Belgium at the end of August and followed it a week later with the team\u2019s first home victory since 2010 at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\nHe has racked up four consecutive pole positions, the first Ferrari driver to do so since Schumacher, and outqualified Vettel for nine straight races.\n\nVettel won in Singapore and, as the Ferrari grew more to his liking, has begun showing the old fire and flashes that carried him to four successive titles from 2010-2013 with Red Bull.\n\nHamilton, who unsettled reigning double world champion Fernando Alonso when they were team mates at McLaren in the Briton\u2019s rookie year in 2007, said he knew what it was like to come in and rattle an established star.\n\n\u201cI do understand,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cWhen you arrive you want to have equal opportunity.\n\n\u201cBut there are drivers that always wanted that number one status, it\u2019s easier for them. I like to earn that, start on an equal platform.\n\n\u201cIf you already know you\u2019re number two, it\u2019s kind of defeatist.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton believes Charles Leclerc has usurped four times world champion team mate Sebastian Vettel as Ferrari's favourite.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439365827&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991WC", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
