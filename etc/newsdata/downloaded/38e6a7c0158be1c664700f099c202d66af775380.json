September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nRing doctors ended the fight with Abdullaev at the bell to start the fifth round, citing a suspected broken cheekbone for the Russian. He never challenged Haney and was blooded in the fourth.\n\nHaney is 23-0 and it\u2019s the 15th time he has stopped an opponent. He has made no secret that Lomachenko, considered by some the world\u2019s best fighter, is on his radar.\n\nHaney, 20, looked solid in his first bout at the Garden\u2019s theater. His jab was quick and he landed several strong combinations in controlling the action.\n\nEarlier, Brooklyn was in the ring, and in the house.\n\nAmanda Serrano outclassed Heather Hardy with a relentless attack to take away the WBO women\u2019s featherweight title and grab the WBC interim crown before a raucous crowd. They are two of America\u2019s best women boxers, though Serrano was born in Puerto Rico. Both represent the borough just across the East River from Madison Square Garden, and their fans filled the Garden\u2019s theater, creating a raucous atmosphere that would have fit for a Rangers game in the big arena.\n\n\u201cIt was a great night,\u201d Serrano said, thanking her fans for their support after winning a unanimous decision.\n\n\u201cShe is as tough as they come,\u201d Serrano added about Hardy, who looked done in the opening round. \u201cShe stayed for 10 rounds.\u201d\n\nTen pretty lopsided rounds. From the outset, when Serrano\u2019s hand speed, agility, power and relentlessness were on display, Hardy was off balance. She got her footing in the middle of the bout, but never was a threat.\n\nSerrano (37-1-1) won by scores of 98-91, 98-92 and 98-92 on the judges\u2019 cards. Hardy, her face reddened and bleeding by the second round, took her first loss in 23 fights.\n\nSerrano\u2019s followers easily had the most to cheer about as she rocked Hardy in the opening round and never backed off for nine more rounds.\n\n\u201cMy corner told me to box and be smart,\u201d Serrano said. Mission accomplished.\n\nMichael Hunter enhanced his status as a rising contender in the heavyweight division with a unanimous 12-round decision over Sergiy Kuzmin. Hunter decked Kuzmin with a sharp left hook in the fifth round and generally controlled matters even though his Russian opponent outweighed him by 37 pounds.\n\nHunter (18-1, 12 knockouts) could get a shot at one of the better-known heavyweights next time out, though a title shot isn\u2019t too close for the 31-year-old American. Kuzmin is 15-1.", "description": "Devin Haney has only one opponent on his mind.
