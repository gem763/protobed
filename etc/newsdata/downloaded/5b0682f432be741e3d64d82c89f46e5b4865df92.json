REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s market regulator has fined retailer Steinhoff a record 53 million rand ($3.6 million) for making \u201cfalse, misleading or deceptive statements\u201d to the market, the company said on Thursday.\n\nSteinhoff disclosed the hole in its accounts in December 2017 which shocked investors and wiped more than 200 billion rand off its stock market value.\n\nThe company said the penalty would have been 1.5 billion rand, but was reduced in recognition of the fact that the fraud was perpetrated by former employees and that the company had cooperated with regulators.\n\n\u201cEven after this reduction it remains the largest single fine ever imposed by the FSCA,\u201d Steinhoff said in a statement, quoting the regulator.\n\nThe Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) ruled that multiple, significant restatements of the company\u2019s accounts after December 2017 supported the conclusion that Steinhoff failed to meet its obligations under the Financial Markets Act.\n\nSteinhoff CEO Louis du Preez said there were no more further FSCA enforcement actions outstanding against the Steinhoff.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the matter has now been brought to a conclusion and that the FSCA has recognised our full co-operation with the investigation,\u201d said Preez.\n\nAn independent report by PwC released in March found Steinhoff had overstated profits over several years in a $7.4 billion accounting fraud involving a small group of top executives and outsiders.\n\n($1 = 14.6256 rand)", "description": "South Africa's market regulator has fined retailer Steinhoff a record 53 million rand ($3.6 million) for making \"false, misleading or deceptive statements\" to the market, the company said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429020703&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0OB-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
