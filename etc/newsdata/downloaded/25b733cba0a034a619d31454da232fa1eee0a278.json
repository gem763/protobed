A black woman was fatally shot by a white Fort Worth, Texas, officer inside the home early Saturday after police were called to the residence for a welfare check, authorities said. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified her as 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson. (Fort Worth Police Department via AP)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 A white police officer who killed a black woman inside her own home in Texas didn't have time to perceive a threat before shooting her, an attorney for the woman's family said.\n\n\"You didn't hear the officer shout, 'Gun, gun, gun,'\" attorney Lee Merritt said after viewing video taken from a Fort Worth officer's bodycam during Saturday's shooting death of Atatiana Jefferson, 28. \"He didn't have time to perceive a threat. That's murder.\"\n\nHer family told KXAS television that Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed early Saturday while police checked on the home after a neighbor called a police non-emergency line to report that the front door was open.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said in a statement that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \"perceiving a threat.\" The video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\" One shot is then fired through a window. The officer does not identify himself as police in the video.\n\n\"It's another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us,\" said Jefferson's sister, Amber Carr.\n\n\"You know, you want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back,\" she said.\n\nAn aunt, Venitta Body, said the family does not understand why Jefferson was killed.\n\n\"It's like from the moment we got the call, it's been more and more inconceivable and more confusing. And there has nothing been done in order to take away that confusion,\" Body said.\n\nPolice said the officer, who's been on the force since April 2018, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. His name was not released.\n\nNeighbor James Smith, who called police about the open door, told reporters he was just trying to be a good neighbor.\n\n\"I'm shaken. I'm mad. I'm upset. And I feel it's partly my fault,\" Smith said. \"If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive.\"\n\nSmith said Jefferson and her nephew typically lived with an older woman, who's been in the hospital.\n\n\"It makes you not want to call the police department,\" he said.\n\nMerritt said Jefferson's family expects \"a thorough and expedient investigation.\"\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said it released bodycam footage soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but that any \"camera footage inside the residence\" could not be distributed due to state law. However, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home. It's unclear if the firearm was found near the woman. Police did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Sunday, and the statement released Saturday made no mention of the weapon.\n\nThe shooting comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her black neighbor inside his own apartment. Amber Guyger, 31, said during her trial that mistook Botham Jean's apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean's. Merritt also represents Jean's family.", "description": "A white police officer who killed a black woman inside her own home in Texas didn't have time to perceive a threat before shooting her, an attorney for the woman's family said.  \"You didn't hear the officer shout, 'Gun, gun, gun,'\" attorney Lee Merritt said after viewing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
