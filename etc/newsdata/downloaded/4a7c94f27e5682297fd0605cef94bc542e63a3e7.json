It occurred at a time when Russia and the United States, which spent part of the Cold War locked in a space race, were pursuing a policy of detente.\n\nLeonov trained as a military pilot before becoming a cosmonaut. He received a \u2018Hero of the Soviet Union\u2019 medal - one of the Russian state\u2019s most prestigious awards - twice and has a small crater on the Moon named after him.\n\nLeonov helped train other cosmonauts before retiring in 1992, a year after the Soviet Union collapsed.
