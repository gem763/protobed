Reyes said, adding that authorities \u201chave no interest in interfering with adoptions that have already taken place.\u201d\n\nPeterson, an adoption lawyer who is licensed in Arizona and Utah, was also hit with charges in Arizona, including conspiracy and theft, according to a Tuesday indictment filed by the state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office. He was arrested in California, officials said.\n\nProsecutors allege Petersen \u201crecruited\u201d and transported more than 40 pregnant women from the Republic of the Marshall Islands\u2014a country of islands between Hawaii and the Philippines\u2014to Utah over the last three years. Reyes said Peterson first established a connection with the Marshall Islands through The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nAfter the children were born, Peterson allegedly offered the women money to give their babies up to U.S. parents and allegedly charged $40,00 per adoption, according to the indictment. The elected GOP official allegedly failed to disclose the scheme to his adoptive parent clients.\n\nArizona and Utah investigators said Wednesday they believe at least 29 babies, some of whom were brought to other states to be adopted, are victims of the scheme.\n\nReyes added Utah authorities were first alerted to the scheme after concerned hospital workers and adoption lawyers called a human trafficking tip line. On Tuesday evening, Arizona authorities executed search warrants in multiple locations and found eight pregnant women from the Marshall Islands inside a Mesa home. It is not immediately clear what connection Petersen has to the property.\n\n\u201cWe are thinking of the birth mothers, adoptive families and children in this case as victims,\u201d Reyes said, adding that Peterson\u2019s alleged scheme \u201cexploited highly vulnerable groups in two countries\u2014the birth mothers and families in the Marshall Islands and the adoptive parents here in Utah.\u201d\n\nThe 32-count indictment filed in the Superior Court of Arizona alleges Petersen and his colleague, Lynwood Jennet, also organized travel for \u201cpregnant women from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to come to Arizona for the purpose of giving a child up for adoption.\u201d\n\nProsecutors say Peterson claimed these women as Arizona residents in order to receive medical services from the state\u2019s Medicaid system.\n\n\u201cAfter the birth of the child, Paul D. Petersen and Lynwood Jennett facilitated travel for these women to leave Arizona,\u201d the indictment alleges. \u201cIn several instances the women returned directly to the [Republic of the Marshall Islands.\u201d\n\nThe scheme also allegedly violated the 1983 compact with the Republic of the Marshall Islands that prevents the island\u2019s citizens from coming to the U.S. \u201cfor the purpose of adoption\u201d unless they have a special visa.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich emphasized in a press conference Wednesday that the families who fell victim to the alleged scheme are not being investigated.\n\n\u201cThese adoptions are not in jeopardy. Our focus is on the individuals who facilitated these adoptions,\u201d Brnovich said.\n\nPeterson was first appointed as Maricopa County assessor in 2013 after serving as the office\u2019s liaison to the legislature. The Republican candidate was re-elected in 2016 in an unopposed election.\n\nAccording to his website , the father of four has been working with adoptive parents for almost 15 years and is also an active member of the Maricopa County Republican Party and the Arizona Republican Party.", "description": "Authorities said Wednesday that at least 29 babies are victims of the international adoption fraud scheme.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570650797/191009-melendez-arizona-border-tease_nl8hgl", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
