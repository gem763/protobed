But he recoils at the thought of Benn, who turns 56 in January, returning to the ring whatsoever.\n\n\u201cI just think that people around him, that care about him and love him whether that\u2019s his son, brother or wife, should say \u2018this is not for you, boxing has moved on\u2019,\u201d Saunders explained. \u201cIn 20 years boxing has escalated.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cBut someone like Nigel Benn who is always in shape, always keeps himself in shape is always going to have that thought to come back. But at 55 he\u2019s over halfway to 100. Let\u2019s just leave it now.\u201d\n\nBenn became a legend of British boxing as a result of his 48-fight professional career which ran from 1987 to 1996 and included domestic grudge matches against the likes of Michael Watson and Chris Eubank.\n\n\u201cI used to love watching Nigel Benn,\u201d Saunders added. \u201cI was a big, big fan. In the Chris Eubank rematch, I thought he should have definitely won when they called it a draw. But now it\u2019s one of them where I just don\u2019t want to see him get in the ring again.\u201d\n\nBoxing history is littered with fighters who are unable to truly walk away from the sport. Like Benn, many return after years in retirement while others try to replace the buzz with substance abuse. British boxing icon Ricky Hatton fell into a deep depression upon his first retirement in 2012 and openly admits he tried to kill himself on a number of occasions.\n\nSaunders, 30, has been boxing since he was a child and the sport has genuinely enveloped his life for more than two decades. He does not, however, anticipate any such problems with turning his back on it completely when the time is right.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the reason you have to hold back and not give everything to boxing,\u201d said Saunders, who returns to the ring on November 11 as part of the undercard for the professional fight between Youtubers KSI and Logan Paul.\n\n\u201cBoxing is a sport and when boxing is gone from my life, I\u2019m still going to be around doing something. I\u2019ve always made sure I\u2019ve got something half-sensible to fall back on and do once boxing is over.\n\n\u201cBut you have to get what you want out of boxing in order to do that, in order to walk away. I\u2019m in boxing to do what I can, get good fights and leave my trademark name as a Saunders. I want to leave a trail where people think \u2018wow, that\u2019s a tough trail to follow\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my goal in boxing and so if I achieve that I\u2019m happy and won\u2019t be coming back at the age of 55.\u201d\n\nBenn\u2019s 22-year-old son Conor, who himself is a 15-0 professional boxer, has suggested that it was his own career that enticed his old man back into boxing. He also revealed that the 55-year-old will face a former WBC champion who only fought two years ago. Those clues pointed towards 40-year-old Sakio Bika, who, like Benn, lives in Australia.\n\nAnd promoter Hearn, who counts Benn Jr and Saunders among his clients, said: \u201cI have too much respect for Nigel Benn to criticise him. He must have his reasons for doing it, I don\u2019t believe it is just money. So what are they? Competitiveness? Curiosity? Boredom?\n\n\u201cIf it is Sakio Bika, I don\u2019t like that fight. He is still a right handful, he is strong, he can punch. He is horrible with his head, he is dirty. I don\u2019t know too much about it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Benn, who is currently 42-5-1, had approached him about promoting his comeback, Hearn added: \u201cMaybe two years ago. He was always going to fight Eubank, that was always going to be the big comeback fight. I don\u2019t understand the Sakio Bika fight. If it was Benn and Eubank, you would think that was big, but Benn against Sakio Bika in Birmingham?\u201d", "description": "Billy Joe Saunders has called on Nigel Benn\u2019s loved ones to try and convince the 55-year-old to scrap his plans for a bizarre and potentially dangerous comeback.
