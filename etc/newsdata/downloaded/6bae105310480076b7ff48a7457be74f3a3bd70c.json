PHOTO: SIYABONGA KALIPA\n\nSouth African Police Service (SAPS) officers from different police stations in the Western Cape gathered, at the Mandela Park Stadium, Khayelitsha, on Saturday to voice their concerns over the lack of promotions in the service.\n\nThe meeting formed part of the nationwide gathering by SAPS members.\n\nNokuthula Ndzongana, the deputy chairperson of the South African Police Allied Workers Union (SAPAWU), said they decided to call a meeting because they were overlooked for promotions.\n\nShe said the feels left out because promotions are given to special units within the police service. \u201cThere were about 2000 posts that were just given to special units and those coming from the college while most of us have long service in the police,\u201d she said.\n\nNdzongana said they are in the forefront because as police officers they are always first on the scene and that they are the most that get killed on the job.\n\nShe said there are even police officers with degrees and diplomas who were not considered for promotions.\n\n\u201cThe posts should have been opened for everyone to apply but they were just filled and we do not know which criteria was used,\u201d she said.\n\nNdzongana accused the minister of police Bheki Cele of causing divisions between the officers.\n\nA police constable who did not want to be named said described the situation as \u201cvery unfair\u201d to a lot of them. He said he has been a constable for a long time.\n\nHe said they were not told anything about the new promotions and were given to special units who some of them do not even have long service.\n\nPolice spokesperson Vish Naidoo said the concerns of the members were about promotions and salary grading. He said the problem was only in the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal.\n\nHe said Cele and the management met with station commanders and provincial commanders to address the issue.\n\n\u201cThe resolution was that a committee will be formed in the next three months to review these two policies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this was communicated to the officers.", "description": "South African Police Service (SAPS) officers from different police stations in the Western Cape gathered, at the Mandela Park Stadium, Khayelitsha, on Saturday to voice their concerns over the lack of promotions in the service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8653/6a49dc43074c4362aead69fe42c7d35e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-21"}
