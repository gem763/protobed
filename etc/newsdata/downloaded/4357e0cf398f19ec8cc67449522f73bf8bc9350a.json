The result was a kaiju-inspired battle reminiscent of Pacific Rim and with clear nods to Voltron and other mecha cartoons and anime. It was exhilarating to watch live, even though I watched it on my iPhone screen, rather than the PlayStation 4 I typically play on.\n\nThe event has been weeks in the making, with developer Epic Games performing its now-standard trickle of hints and subtle reveals that helped curious players piece together the puzzle. There was the monster eye hidden in the frozen ice of the game\u2019s Polar Peak location, the owner of which broke free and began swimming around the island. By the time the robot was being constructed within the map\u2019s once-active but now-dormant volcano, it became quite clear to players what Epic was planning: a world-shaking showdown between the two titanic beings.\n\nThe battle started at a distance, with the robot firing missiles at its foe before closing the gap with a tackle that sent both flying across the map. Players who had been watching the build up to the event were able to buy one of two emotes, a pro-monster and a pro-robot one, while Epic also designed an in-game skin of the pink, cat-themed robot. This time around, Epic gave everyone an unlimited-use jetpack to catch the action from whatever angle they liked. Weapons were disabled, so trolls couldn\u2019t spoil the fun for other players.\n\nok that was cool pic.twitter.com/u3PFeQ5OjD \u2014 andrew webster (@A_Webster) July 20, 2019\n\nOnce the battle became a close-quarters bout, the monster ripped off the robot\u2019s arm and seemed on the verge of winning. But drawing source from some element of the island\u2019s power \u2014 we\u2019ve seen it before with the rocket that created a massive rift in the sky and past events that have transported players to another realm \u2014 the robot drew out a sword buried beneath the ground. (It was coyly hidden beneath the statue in Neo Tilted, with the statue itself forming the hilt of the blade.)\n\nThe robot put it through the monster\u2019s skull, and then blasted off into the sky, leaving behind the skeleton of the creature with the sword stuck through it. It\u2019s now a fixture of the map in all game modes.\n\nEpic now has a storied history of holding increasingly sophisticated live events, starting with the rocket launch that took place in June of last year and continuing with subtle map changes and creative experiments in collective action that let players affect have direct effects on the world. Since the rocket launch, there\u2019s been a live concert featuring the electronic artist Marshmellow, and a massive in-game Fortnite poll that effectively let players decide which popular item would get revived from retirement in the vault, which was followed up by a volcanic eruption.\n\nWhat used to be a season-ending affair that would kick off a new three-month season has turned into a constant flow of big and small changes that take place almost every week, which typically culminate in a massive gathering like the one we watched today. Epic has also moved on from having events singularly focused on one object or action, like a rocket launch, and is now pulling off substantial changes to the map in the midst of active play, so players experiencing a live event can find themselves parachuting back down onto a completely changed environment, no update required. We saw that today as the monster\u2019s skeleton and the robot\u2019s sword became a part of the map that you can now fly over and fight on.\n\nFortnite\u2019s live events are at the cutting edge of online multiplayer gaming experiences\n\nIt\u2019s a mind-blowing technical achievement that continues to keep Epic and Fortnite at the cutting edge of online multiplayer gaming experiences. And it\u2019s still relatively unclear what Epic\u2019s ultimate goal is here. These live events are great world-building affairs that make its battle royale game much more than a kill-or-be-killed contest; it has a rich world and deepening lore that\u2019s built just as much by Epic as it by Fortnite\u2019s fanbase.\n\nBut the sheer technical sophistication on display in these events leads me to believe there is a lot more Epic has planned, not just for Fortnite but also future games that build technology using the company\u2019s Unreal developer tools. It\u2019s not hard to imagine the amazing experiences a massively multiplayer online game could offer with this type of backend infrastructure, and the types of gameplay enabled when simulated, immersive worlds at the scale of Fortnite\u2019s island can be changed and manipulated in real time without requiring you stop the software and install an update.\n\nWith the advent of cloud gaming on the horizon, it\u2019s an exciting time to see where this time of fusion of in-game storytelling with live see-it-once events could yield in just a few years time. And, of course, Fortnite helping build that future, one mecha-monster battle at a time.", "description": "Players battle royale hit Fortnite who happened to boot up the game this afternoon were treated to a cataclysmic showdown between a giant robot and a terrifyingly large monster.
