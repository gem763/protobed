Just an amazing veterinarian. It\u2019s a devastating loss, a huge loss for humanity,\u201d said Jaime McKnight, who runs a St. Petersburg pet rescue and used to work at Partridge\u2019s animal hospital.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Umstead State Park around 10 a.m. Monday, more than 12 hours after authorities began combing the densely forested park adjacent to the airport.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said air traffic controllers lost radar contact with the Piper PA32 at about 7:25 p.m. Sunday as it approached Runway 32, the smallest of three landing strips and perpendicular to what the airport considers its primary runway. The FAA website said the model of single-engine plane typically has around six seats.\n\nRescuers from at least a dozen state and local agencies spent the night searching in and around the park, a 5,600-acre (2,260-hectare) wooded expanse bounded by an interstate, the airport and a state highway. The park remained closed Monday, and people were asked to avoid the area while authorities secured the crash site.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into the crash. An NTSB spokesman said he didn\u2019t expect to release further information Monday.\n\nHarvey Partridge ran a veterinary clinic in St. Petersburg, Florida, and a statement from his office called him \u201ca truly wonderful doctor and advocate for animals.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said Partridge owned the aircraft. FAA records show that Harvey Partridge was certified to fly single- and multi-engine planes as a private pilot.\n\nMcKnight, who runs the Pawlicious Poochie Pet Rescue from the animal hospital, said that Partridge provided medical care for her rescues. Last year, a French bulldog named Jaxson had a hole in his heart \u2014 and Dr. Partridge flew McKnight and the dog up to Gainesville for life-saving surgery.\n\n\u201cHe was the most generous person. And his wife was just as amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s reeling from the shock.\u201d\n\nAirport spokesman Crystal Feldman said Sunday night that the dense woods and darkness hindered initial phases of the search, which included helicopters scanning for signs of heat coming from the wreck.\n\nAir operations were halted at the busy airport for about 20 minutes Sunday night as firefighting and rescue units rushed to the wooded area. That caused a number of commercial flights into the airport to be delayed or diverted until regular operations resumed.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A Florida veterinarian and his wife were identified Monday as victims of a deadly plane crash near a North Carolina airport.", "authors": ["Jonathan Drew", "Tamara Lush"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/plane-crash-north-carolina-.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
