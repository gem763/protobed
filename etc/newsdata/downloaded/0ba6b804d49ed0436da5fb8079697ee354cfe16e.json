It also contains hollow ceramic microspheres which are designed to reflect infrared radiation\n\nDoha (pictured) is so hot partly because it's on a peninsula in the Persian Gulf, in which surface water temperatures average around 90.3\u00b0F (32.4\u00b0C) \u2013 temperatures in the city can reach a sweltering 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C)\n\nEngineer Saad Al-Dosari said: 'The temperatures of dark asphalt is 20 degrees Celsius higher than the actual temperature because black attracts and radiates heat\u2019\n\nThe air conditioning in Qatar works by pumping cold air onto the pavement through cooling nozzles after chilled water is brought to the street via a pipeline.\n\nQatar is especially vulnerable to extreme heat because the country is a peninsula \u2013 a piece of land which sticks out into water \u2013 on the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn the Gulf the average surface temperatures of the water are around 90.3\u00b0F (32.4\u00b0C).\n\nWith virtually no clouds or rain in summer, the rising sea temperatures lead to more atmospheric humidity.\n\nJos Lelieveld, an atmospheric chemist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, said: \u2018These areas are warming faster than the rest of the globe, and in certain cities on top of that you have an urban heat island effect and urban pollution.'\n\nIn a bid to help everyone to stay cool, city planners have built walkways and streets pointing north to take advantage of breezes that come from that direction.\n\nTalking about the blue road Hossam Almeer, a 30-year-old data scientist working for Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), said: \u2018I think it\u2019s great that the government is open-minded about using technological innovation to deal with the challenges of living in the desert.\n\n\u2018The degree of cooling could have a real impact on our electricity consumption since air conditioning makes up almost 70 per cent of household electricity usage.\u2019", "description": "Authorities in Doha, Qatar's capital city, are also trialling painting their roads blue in a bid to try and keep temperatures down on the tarmac because the blue absorbs less heat than black.", "authors": ["Anthony Harwood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/16/19892162-0-image-a-20_1571414192021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
