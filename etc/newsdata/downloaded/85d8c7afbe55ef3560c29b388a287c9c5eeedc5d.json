Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chief sponsor of the Senate \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill (S. 1804), often reminds us that the United States spends roughly twice as much per capita on health care as most other economically advanced countries, but American life expectancy is lower than that of almost all these high-income nations.\n\nReps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., lead sponsors of the House\u2019s Medicare for All bill (H.R. 1384) say, \u201cThe quality of our health care is much worse than [that of] other industrialized countries. The life expectancy in the U.S. is lower than other nations, while our infant mortality is much higher.\u201d\n\nThese are misleading generalizations. In fact, American medical outcomes for the most serious conditions\u2014for example, lower mortality from heart attacks and strokes, as well as survival rates from a variety of cancers\u2014are generally superior to those of other advanced countries.\n\nAmerica\u2019s high level of investment in advanced medical technologies, including innovative drug therapies, has improved medical outcomes and has directly contributed to longer life expectancy among our senior citizens.\n\nAccording to \u201cThe Economic Report of the President,\u201d issued in March:\n\nThe United States\u2019 all-cause mortality rates relative to those of other developed countries improve dramatically after the age of 75 years.\n\nIn 1960\u2014before Medicare\u2014the U.S. ranked below most EU countries for longevity among those [ages 50 to 74], yet above them among those age 75 and higher. This pattern persists today.\n\nTrue, America needs to improve overall life expectancy at birth. According to a major 2018 study of 11 high-income nations in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Japan has the highest life expectancy at 83.9 years, and the U.S. comes in last at 78.8 years.\n\nThese disparate findings reflect the vast size and diversity of the United States, including a bewildering array of behavioral, racial, social, economic, environmental, demographic, and metabolic risk factors.\n\nThe medical journal\u2019s researchers thus caution \u201c\u2026 the United States average, in comparison to averages of much smaller, more homogenous countries, may lead to erroneous conclusions.\u201d\n\nFor example, the life expectancy of Minnesota, a state comparable in size and demographics to Sweden or Denmark, has more similar population health outcomes to these countries than Minnesota has in comparison to Mississippi.\n\nIn a 2017 study for the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that 74 percent of American variation in life expectancy\u2014indeed, the largest source of variation\u2014was attributable to behavioral and metabolic risk factors.\n\nThe recent annual declines in American life expectancy, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were largely attributable to increased drug overdoses (opioids) and suicides.\n\nThen, there is the special category of infant mortality. \u201cOur infant mortality rate, kids and babies who are dying, is the highest,\u201d says Jayapal, the Washington lawmaker.\n\nThe truth is more complicated. In their 2018 study, the JAMA researchers report that American infant mortality is indeed higher than in 10 other high-income countries. Notably, however, the researchers also found that when adjusting for low birth weights, the U.S. statistical ranking improves significantly.\n\nThey write: \u201cWhen adjusting neonatal mortality to exclude deaths of infants born weighing less than 1,000g [about 2.2 lbs.], the United States ranked fifth relative to the other countries, with 1.61 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with a mean of 1.70 for all 11 countries.\u201d\n\nComparisons of infant mortality between the United States and other countries are often flawed because definitions of terms and measurements are different.\n\nAs Sally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, notes, \u201cThe United States \u2026 counts every live birth in its infant-mortality statistics. But France only includes babies born after 22 weeks of gestation. In Poland, a baby has to weigh more than 1 pound, 2 ounces to count as a live birth.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization notes that it is common practice in several countries, including Belgium, France, and Spain to \u2018register as live births only those infants who survived for a specified period beyond birth.\u201d\n\nNote also that the United States also has high rates of pre-term births. American medical professionals, including those participating in Medicaid, will thus intervene in complex and difficult cases and literally spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to save the life of a premature infant.\n\nMedical professionals in other countries do not necessarily make the same moral and financial commitments.\n\nFactors influencing longevity are far more complex than how a nation organizes the financing and delivery of medical care. Total government control over the financing and delivery of health care, championed by self-styled \u201cprogressives,\u201d will not guarantee Americans\u2019 longer life spans.\n\nWaiting in line for medical care is no prescription for a longer life.\n\nPersonal behavioral changes, including diet and exercise, can make a difference in longevity, but so also can the American-style investment in innovative medical technologies and America\u2019s superior responsiveness in treating deadly disease.", "description": "Ponder this: If self-styled \u201cprogressives\u201d in Congress impose total government control over health care, will ordinary Americans enjoy a longer life span?", "authors": ["Robert E.
