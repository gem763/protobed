The combatant commanders want carriers,\" Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer said at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nHalf, if not more than half, of the Navy's 11 carrier fleet is currently in a non-deployable state, Business Insider recently learned during a congressional hearing. Spencer revealed Wednesday that he believes it may take up to five years to get carrier maintenance back on track.\n\n\"My job,\" the Navy secretary added, \"is to see how I can fulfill that requirement the best I can.\"\n\nOne option, he said, is the \"Lightning Carrier\" concept, an idea the secretary has mentioned twice in the last week to augment the carrier fleet.\n\nThe idea, which is reminiscent of the Harrier Carriers (Wasp-class amphibious assault ships carrying AV-8B Harrier jump-jets), involves stripping out the assault force component and loading up the new America-class amphibs with up to 22 F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, short-takeoff/vertical-landing variants developed for the Marine Corps.\n\nPossible Lightning Carrier configuration US Marine Corps\n\nThe first Lightning Carrier test was conducted aboard the USS America in 2014 with 12 F-35Bs. Earlier this month, the Navy and the Marine Corps flew sorties off the America with 13 of these new fighters.\n\nThe Lightning Carrier concept has never been tested at full capacity.\n\n\"Does it have the same strike as a carrier? No, it doesn't,\" Spencer said Wednesday.\n\nBut, \"part of the mission of the carrier is presence and forward deployability,\" the secretary added, explaining that around two dozen fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighters aboard a large amphib is \"a great option\" to augment the Navy's fleet of available flattops and meet the requirements of the combatant commanders.\n\nThe Lightning Carrier is not an institutionalized program of record. It is an experiment, Spencer told reporters. \"We will experiment with it. What we are trying to do is get the commanders out there ... to think, explore.\"\n\n\"I think it's a great way to start thinking with new muscle movements,\" he added.\n\nIt's unclear when or even if the Navy will actually field this kind of capability. The secretary said that it might be possible to \"see one set sail in the near future,\" adding that he would \"love to see it sooner rather than later.\"", "description": "Twice in the past week, the Navy secretary has pointed to loading the large amphibs up with F-35s as a way to augment the carrier fleet.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9d554dee0192b6a376a16?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
