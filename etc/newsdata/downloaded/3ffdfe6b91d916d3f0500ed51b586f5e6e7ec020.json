Today two-year Treasuries yield 1.42%; 10-year yields 1.54%. That narrow spread was briefly inverted in August, and in shorter maturities, the curve has been flat to inverted throughout the year.\n\nAny normalization and steepening of the curve with yields on longer-dated bonds going up would likely reverse this performance trend. But for now, technical analysis and the broader outlook is for low rates to persist, market pundits say.\n\nAssets Rush Into TLT\n\nWho knew a bond allocation could deliver such as performance punch? Traditionally, a fixed income allocation is for diversification, low correlation to other assets, and safety in the form of steady income.\n\nBut in the past year, taking on duration risk has been a source of massive outperformance. And investors have taken notice.\n\nIn the past year, more than $8 billion of fresh net assets have flown into TLT, just about all of it coming in year to date. The fund is now a $19 billion ETF.\n\nThis type of demand isn\u2019t business as usual for this Treasury fund. Look at the creations/redemptions TLT has seen in recent years\u2014nothing comes even close:\n\nYear Net Asset Flows 2019 $8 Billion 2018 $1.6 Billion 2017 $1.4 Billion 2016 -$1 Billion 2015 -$20 Million 2014 $3.3 Billion 2013 -$420 Million\n\nSources: ETF.com, FactSet data\n\nThis uptick in demand for longer duration is centered on a troubling macro picture that includes a global economic slowdown, fears of recession, geopolitical risk and increased market volatility. If buying long-dated Treasuries is a safety play, the $8 billion into TLT suggests investors are feeling quite defensive.\n\nThere are other factors, too, fixed income analyst J.R. Rieger points out. For starters, $13 trillion in negative-yielding bonds globally has been pushing demand for yield into the U.S. Treasury market. A 30-year U.S. Treasury today yields about 2.04%.\n\nLack of meaningful inflation and a strong U.S. dollar have also contributed to appetite for investment-grade bonds in general, Rieger, who runs The Rieger Report, said.\n\n\u201cDuration paid off for investors as rates have come down and central banks continue to lever the only tool they have\u2014rate cuts\u2014to stave off recession,\u201d Rieger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique and likely unexpected situation that drove long bonds up nicely.\u201d\n\nRole Of ETF Structure\n\nThe surge in demand for TLT could also be attributed to the ETF wrapper itself.\n\n\u201cETFs have gained traction as tools for institutions that can now easily and at low cost shift assets tactically as they see fit,\" Rieger said, noting that bond ETFs such as TLT are benefiting from institutional demand as \u201cpension funds are changing their return targets downward and accepting lower yields on the long end to match liabilities with assets.\"\n\n\u201cBeing fluid enough to exit when rates do rise is another benefit of using ETFs as exposure,\u201d he added. \"We can't ignore that the tools have changed.\u201d\n\nContact Cinthia Murphy at cmurphy@etf.com\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2019 ETF.com.
