Six weeks after he took office with a promise to leave the European Union by Oct. 31, \u201cdo or die\u201d, the British prime minister is running out of escape routes.\n\nThe former London mayor insists his preference is for Britain to leave the EU by renegotiating the deal struck by his predecessor Theresa May. That always looked a long shot. UK ministers claim European leaders are willing to rethink the agreement. But with just 58 days to go until the Brexit deadline, the government has yet to come up with any concrete proposals to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, a key EU requirement.\n\nIf the deal cannot be revised, Johnson has pledged to leave the EU on Oct. 31 without one. That door is also closing, though. The prime minister\u2019s opponents in parliament were on Tuesday preparing to take control of the legislature, enabling them to pass a bill that would force the government to extend the Brexit deadline by three months if it does not secure a deal. Rebel lawmakers from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party \u2013 including Philip Hammond, the former finance minister \u2013 are supporting the plan, threatening the government\u2019s miniscule majority.\n\nThe prime minister on Monday indicated that if parliament blocked a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, he would turn to his third escape route: calling an early election, probably on Oct. 14. However, he needs the backing of two-thirds of parliament to bring forward the poll, which is not due until 2022. It would be folly for the opposition Labour Party to support that plan if a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit at the end of October remains a risk.\n\nBeyond this, Johnson could take more extreme measures to frustrate parliamentary opposition, such as trying to kill off a Brexit extension in the House of Lords, Britain\u2019s unelected second chamber. He might even ask the queen to refuse her assent for the legislation, plunging the country into an even deeper constitutional crisis. The pound on Tuesday morning dipped below $1.20.\n\nBut such actions would further anger opponents already outraged by Johnson\u2019s decision last week to suspend parliament for more than four weeks, strengthening their determination to bring down his administration. For Johnson\u2019s government, the choice of \u201cdo or die\u201d looks increasingly like the latter.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy is already unravelling.
