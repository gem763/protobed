(AP) - Vermont\u2019s capital city is facing a 25% increase in its health care costs, which is expected to add 4.5% to the municipal budget.\n\nOutgoing Montpelier Finance Director Todd Provencher says the high cost of the health care plan increase came because the city last year paid $1.2 million in premiums to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and had $2.4 million in claims.\n\nThe Times Argus reports Provencher is still waiting on quotes from the state\u2019s other health care providers, but he says those rates are expected to be even higher.\n\nMontpelier, with 119 employees, has too many to be eligible to join the more affordable Vermont Health Connect, which has a 100-employee limit.\n\nMayor Anne Watson says she would like to see if the 100-employee cap can be increased.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times Argus, http://www.timesargus.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vermont's capital city is facing a 25% increase in its health care costs, which is expected to add 4.5% to the municipal budget.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
