One of the most important pieces of data on the calendar was Monday\u2019s Eurozone PMI reports and while the currency recovered quickly from initial losses, the economy won\u2019t be turning as abruptly. in the Eurozone contracted at its fastest pace in nearly 7 years with the index falling to 45.6 from 47. The slowdown was led by Germany, where the index fell to 41.4, the lowest level in more than a decade. Manufacturing in moderated as well while slowed across the board. There is no doubt that Germany is experiencing a recession and when the numbers are released, it will confirm that the economy contracted for the second quarter in a row. Today\u2019s reports tell us that there\u2019s also a very good chance the Eurozone will follow. According to ECB President today the temporary slowdown is deeper, more prolonged than expected. He sees the need for highly accommodative ECB stance and said the ECB is ready to use all instruments \u2013 implying that more easing could be necessary.\n\nYet the recovery in post PMIs is a reflection of the market\u2019s hope that the Germans will will follow through with fiscal stimulus in the coming few weeks. However as noted by our colleague Boris Schlossberg, \u201cGerman officials remain reluctant to increase the budget, but the longer they wait the worse the situation may become. It\u2019s clear that monetary policy has run out of gas and fiscal tools are needed to jump-start the economy.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s German should be softer as data continue to pressure policymakers into action. Until fiscal policy actions are announced, the path of least resistance for EUR/USD is lower with the pair aiming for a break of 1.09.\n\nWhile there are only a handful of secondary US economic reports scheduled for release this week, there\u2019s a lot of central-bank speak. From the US we have Fed Presidents , , , , , , and speaking at various events. Not all of them will be touching on monetary policy but investors will be listening in closely to see how many FOMC members support further easing this year. We know how Bullard feels because he voted for 50bp in September and George won\u2019t support more easing because she voted against the rate cut this month. Evans, Kashkari and Williams are doves but Daly, Barkin and Kaplan side more with Fed leadership. Bank of England Governor , Bank of Japan Governor and Reserve Bank of Australia Governor will speak as well and all 3 of their currencies are vulnerable to weakness as these central bankers recently talked about the need for easing. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand also has a but no changes are expected after the surprisingly large 50bp rate cut in August.\n\nThe was up against all of the major currencies today except for the and . Ongoing pressure on US rates and trade uncertainty makes it very difficult for the greenback to rally. The US dollar should be trading higher after last week\u2019s Fed meeting because the majority of US policymakers do not see another this year. Fed Chairman was also tight lipped on future policy changes. However fell hard after China cut its US farm visits short. Trade winds are shifting week to week and they moved back in a southwardly direction after President Trump said he doesn\u2019t need a trade deal before the 2020 election. Vice President Pence also said the era of economic surrender is over \u2013 none of this language makes us feel good about US-China relations.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, Williams Companies Inc.
