The school confirmed reports that the teacher\u2019s name is Renee Greeley.\n\nNear the start of the video, which was posted on Thursday by Facebook user Rasheed Noel, Greeley can be heard saying, \"You're probably on welfare, too,\"\n\n\"Not even a little bit,\" the man in the video responds, \"Six figures a year, ma'am.\"\n\nGreeley responds by swearing at the man in the video. He tells her that she's only angry \"because I'm young and I'm black.\"\n\nRelated Video: \u2018SNL\u2019 Fires Comedian Over Racist Comments Days After Hiring Him\n\nShe responds, \"That's right, because you're black.\" She continues, \"Always looking to milk the system. And you see me, a white woman, so you think I've got money.\"\n\nShot 9 times, police say: Photographer asked three teens to stop using a racial slur\n\nGreeley eventually says, \"Go back to your welfare\u2026 your Section 8 house.\" Section 8 is the government's program for providing housing assistance vouchers to low-income families.\n\nThat draws a laugh from the man. While Greeley is comparing her truck to his car, which she refers to as a \"piece of (expletive),\" he tells her, \"I've got a 3,200 square-foot home.\"\n\nAfter another exchange, Greeley says, \"Go (expletive) off, you (N-word).\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" he replies.\n\n\"You heard me,\" she says.\n\nA statement from Upper Darby School District posted to social media said the teacher was placed on administrative leave pending further investigation. District Superintendent Daniel P. McGarry told USA TODAY Greeley is on leave without pay.\n\nMcGarry also said the poster of the video had a third grader in his car while Greeley was ranting. He added other children were watching the confrontation from the school, too.\n\nRacist graffiti in Mississippi: 'I never thought something like this would happen to me'\n\nMcGarry, who was named superintendent in March, said it isn't within his power as superintendent to fire Greeley. He said the district's investigation is complete and has been turned over to its legal team. He will make a recommendation, but Greeley's employment will be up to the district's school board.\n\nThe board's next official meeting is in November, though McGarry said the board could call for a special meeting ahead of that.\n\nMcGarry called Greeley's tirade \"awful.\" He added, \"I do not believe anyone who conducts themselves this way should be allowed to teach.\"\n\n\"Such commentary, such actions will not be tolerated in our community,\" McGarry said in a phone interview with USA TODAY. \"Now, as a leader of this school district, I'm coming out against it, as hard as I can. We're not going to run from this.\"\n\nRaising his voice, McGarry said, \"You can not conduct yourself this way, especially when you're working with our children and our community.\"\n\nMcGarry added Greeley, who has been a teacher since 2008, could elect to go through arbitration, she could resign or she could call for a formal hearing. He didn't speculate on what Greeley would do.\n\n'I would say it again': Says N.C. woman who used racial slur in viral video confrontation with black women\n\n\"Upper Darby School District does not condone or tolerate inappropriate conduct or speech associated with hate, racism, discrimination or intolerance of any kind,\" the district said in a statement.\n\nAfter the racial slur, the man in the video said, \"This situation can change real quick.\"\n\nGreeley replies, \"Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it?\"\n\nThe man warns Greeley to stay where she is multiple times while she tells him, \"Bring it on.\" The video ends after Greeley calls the man a homophobic slur.\n\nA Facebook message to the poster of the video from USA TODAY was not immediately returned Sunday night. McGarry said he met with both the poster of the video and Greeley the day he saw the video.\n\n\"It's got to stop,\" McGarry said. \"This rhetoric and this language and the way the people feel and the way they communicate has to stop. It's destroying the country. It's destroying (the) country and we're going to be the place that's going to prove to people that it can be done the right way.\"", "description": "A teacher at Drexel Hill Middle School in Pennsylvania has been placed on administrative leave after she used racial slurs in a viral Facebook video.", "authors": ["Jordan Culver", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p5oQFsDpJ6ofwpqkdqEE_w--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ed5a9a30-ee90-11e9-8ba7-9ad475cd989d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
