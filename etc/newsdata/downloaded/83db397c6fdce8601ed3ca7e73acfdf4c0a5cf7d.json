So they did what Catholic officials have done for decades: They turned to William Lori.\n\nFrom Rome and Washington to Connecticut and then Baltimore, where he is now archbishop, Lori is often on the front lines when the nation\u2019s largest religious group is facing major scandals or perceived threats to its values and traditions. He is the Vatican\u2019s fixer in the United States.\n\nWhen the clergy sexual abuse scandal exploded in the news in the early 2000s, Lori helped craft policies to hold abusive priests \u2014 but not bishops \u2014 accountable. When the Obama administration pressed for greater acceptance of same-sex marriage, contraception and abortion, Lori led a national campaign arguing that America\u2019s religious freedom was at stake. And when the Vatican decided last fall to investigate the accused cleric in West Virginia, that job, too, fell to Lori.\n\n\n\nBaltimore Archbishop William Lori leaves after celebrating Sunday Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in July in the suburb of Randallstown. (Mary F. Calvert for The Washington Post)\n\nThe probe of the allegations against Michael Bransfield, conducted by five lay investigators and overseen by Lori, was intended to signal a new era of church accountability. But Lori\u2019s handling of it, along with revelations of his own links to Bransfield, have made the Baltimore archbishop a focus of anger by some parishioners and threaten to complicate his legacy.\n\nFirst, The Washington Post reported in June that Lori was among dozens of clerics who had received cash gifts from Bransfield over the years, and that Lori ordered that the recipients\u2019 names \u2014 including his own \u2014 be omitted from a confidential report on the investigation\u2019s findings. Some church insiders were further rankled by another aspect of Lori\u2019s years-long relationship with the man he investigated: In March of last year, Lori asked Bransfield\u2019s diocese for $300,000 for a school in the Baltimore archdiocese that also served students from West Virginia, according to church financial records.\n\nAn online petition organized by parishioners and signed over the summer by more than 900 people demands that Lori release the report detailing the investigators\u2019 findings. It decries misconduct by church leaders, saying \u201cwe are forced to acknowledge that the coverups have been facilitated by our acquiescence to a culture of clericalism that has pervaded our Church.\u201d\n\nLast month, Vincent DeGeorge, a former seminarian who says he was mistreated by Bransfield, complained to the Vatican\u2019s U.S. ambassador that Lori\u2019s report may have misled church leaders. In an Aug. 14 letter, DeGeorge faulted Lori for omitting from the report the names of clerics who received cash gifts from Bransfield. He also noted Lori\u2019s \u201cpersonal role in exempting abusive bishops\u201d from the policy document crafted in Dallas in 2002 in response to the abuse crisis.\n\n\u201cCertain parties may have been woefully misled by the report that the entrusted investigator delivered to your office,\u201d DeGeorge wrote to Christophe Pierre, whose title as ambassador is nuncio.\n\nDeGeorge, who served as Bransfield\u2019s traveling assistant on multiple occasions until last year, told The Post that Bransfield drank excessively and then inappropriately hugged, kissed and touched him and showed him lewd films.\n\nAfter The Post\u2019s June report, Lori told parishioners that he regretted omitting the recipients\u2019 names, and he pledged to reimburse the diocese $7,500. He also said including recipients\u2019 names might have suggested \u2014 wrongly, in his view \u2014 that \u201cthere were expectations for reciprocity.\u201d\n\nHe also said the decision on whether to make the report public was the Vatican\u2019s, not his.\n\nHis spokesman said Lori\u2019s request for $300,000 was appropriate because the Maryland school served some West Virginia students. The spokesman said the omission of bishops from the policies crafted in Dallas was not Lori\u2019s \u201cdecision to make.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichael Bransfield, shown in 2015 when he was bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston in West Virginia. (Scott McCloskey/AP)\n\nIn an interview, Bransfield called DeGeorge\u2019s account \u201ca lie\u201d but declined to elaborate. Bransfield was removed from ministry in March after Lori\u2019s investigators concluded that the cash gifts were part of a broader pattern of abuse of power by the bishop, including harassing young priests and spending church money on personal indulgences. Bransfield has denied wrongdoing.\n\nIn his role overseeing the probe, Lori\u2019s motives and actions have come in for vigorous scrutiny. At 68, Lori is the ambitious, dedicated, loyal servant he\u2019s always been, a hard-charger in French cuffs and spectacles. But the world around him has changed. Catholics are demanding more transparency.\n\nIn an hour-long interview in his office in July, the archbishop sounded chastened about what his spokesman called the hardest period of Lori\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a work in progress. And the older I get, the more I recognize that,\u201d Lori said. \u201cI go to confession every couple weeks, not because I want to, but because I need to. I expect people to respect the office, but I know I need to earn their trust.\u201d\n\nA fast rise handling scandals\n\n\n\nLori greets parishioners after Sunday Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in July. (Mary F. Calvert for The Washington Post)\n\nBorn in Louisville, Lori studied at the Seminary of St. Pius X in his hometown and then headed north. He attended Mount St. Mary\u2019s Seminary in Emmitsburg, Md., and Catholic University, from which he earned a doctorate in sacred theology in 1982. He spent a good part of his early career in the Washington archdiocese, where he made his name alongside a young priest from Philadelphia named Michael Bransfield.\n\n[W.Va. bishop gave powerful cardinals and other priests $350,000 in cash gifts before his ouster, church records show]\n\nLori rose quickly, starting as a young priest in the early 1980s and becoming a top aide to James Hickey, then the D.C. archbishop. By the standards of the time, Hickey was a leader on addressing clergy abuse \u2014 for instance, meeting with and apologizing to victims.\n\nAs his aide, Lori was dispatched to remove abusive priests from ministry before doing so was common. In 1995, he represented the archdiocese on television when four priests were forced out after admitting they molested an altar boy years earlier. Lori announced that the priests had been sent to undisclosed locations for counseling.\n\nLori\u2019s spokesman, Sean Caine, said the then-monsignor announced in parishes why the priests were being ousted and connected The Post with one of the victims. Lori believes victim-survivors \u201cshould always be the first priority,\u201d said Caine, who responded to questions before and after the interview with Lori.\n\nLori\u2019s star was ascendant. A few months after the altar boy case, he was made an auxiliary \u2014 or assistant \u2014 bishop in the District, becoming one of the country\u2019s youngest bishops at age 43.\n\nIn 1997, Lori led an inquiry into Hickey\u2019s concerns that a Georgetown parish had been allowing criticism of the church\u2019s refusal to ordain women and using gender-neutral words during readings for Mass. Over three days, Lori and two subordinate priests individually summoned dozens of parishioners into a room, told them the session would be recorded and asked them to swear an oath to be truthful.\n\nLori said in news accounts at the time that the process was a reasonable way to gather information about the parish, but some liberals saw it as insulting.\n\n\u201cHe acted as inquisitor \u2014 it was really ugly,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit who was then a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Woodstock Theological Center. \u201cLay people there felt very hurt.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Lori was made bishop of the Bridgeport, Conn., diocese, and soon he took on a major role in the most urgent crisis then facing the church. Lori was a key figure in the creation of what is known as the Dallas Charter, the set of rules drafted in 2002 in response to the clergy sexual abuse scandal that had shaken the church. He was one of four U.S. bishops who traveled to Rome to finalize the document, which established procedures for handling sexual abuse complaints, including that they be reported to police or prosecutors.\n\nThe rules applied to accused priests but not bishops, who under church law can be disciplined only by the pope, the bishops concluded. They agreed to be more outspoken in criticizing one another, a solution the document calls \u201cfraternal correction.\u201d\n\nTo oversee compliance with the charter, the bishops set up a board composed of prominent lay Catholics.\n\nBut Illinois Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, who chaired the board in the mid-2000s, said in an interview that Lori and the other bishops paid only lip service to the concept. She recalled once contacting him for information.\n\n\u201cWhen he got back to me, it wasn\u2019t pleasant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Who do you think you are, asking me questions?\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe said he \u201cdismissed me\u201d and \u201cgave a sour note in the way he talked with me.\u201d\n\nCaine said Lori did not recall the conversation with Burke and remembered that he later had a friendly conversation with her and her husband at a New York function and that afterward, they sent him a book. Caine said Lori is \u201ca kind, considerate and polite man who demonstrates respect for everyone.\u201d\n\nSeizing on religious freedom\n\nEven before the Dallas agreement, Lori established new practices and policies in Bridgeport, including removing suspected sex offenders from ministry, offering abuse awareness training, doing criminal background checks on diocesan employees, and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 reporting allegations of clergy sexual abuse to state investigators, according to reports at the time.\n\n\n\nLori administers Communion at Holy Family Catholic Church. (Mary F. Calvert for The Washington Post)\n\nLori stood out as being accessible \u2014 both to reporters and survivors \u2014 on a topic most bishops avoided. He talked with outside sexual-abuse experts on his radio show in Bridgeport. He built a reputation for being pragmatic and an activist, someone who wanted to be a visible leader on the biggest issues.\n\n\u201cHe comes across as being a pastoral, caring person, and that goes a long way when you\u2019ve dealt with just: \u2018Attack, attack, attack,\u2019 \u201d said attorney Cindy Robinson, who represented church abuse victims in Connecticut, referring to the ways Lori\u2019s predecessors treated people who alleged abuse.\n\n[Perspective: Too many questions remain unanswered in the case of West Virginia Bishop Michael Bransfield]\n\nEven so, he squared off against members of the national Catholic group Voice of The Faithful, which began as a response to the 2002 abuse crisis and had started advocating for more liberal church policies.\n\nThe group at one point contacted the Bridgeport diocese to talk about the crisis. In response, Lori dispatched priests who criticized the group for not being orthodox enough, said Joe O\u2019Callaghan, a Fordham University history professor who was a member of the organization. Voice of The Faithful and another advocacy group, Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, were soon told they could not meet in the diocese\u2019s parishes, O\u2019Callaghan said.\n\nCaine said the victims\u2019 groups did not accurately reflect the church\u2019s efforts to help those who had been abused by priests. Also, he said, bishops generally allow only groups whose theology is aligned with that of the church to hold events in parishes.\n\nAlso during that period, Lori fought a seven-year legal battle to keep secret thousands of pages of court documents from lawsuits that accused Bridgeport priests of abuse. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to intervene in the case brought by four news organizations, leading to the release of documents that showed Lori\u2019s predecessors hid the reasons they were moving accused priests from parish to parish.\n\nLori told the Associated Press at the time that the public was not interested in \u201ca repeat of reports about what happened in the past, tragic and reprehensible as that was.\u201d Caine said Lori was focused on protecting names of innocent priests and medical records in the files.\n\nWhile he was in Bridgeport, Lori became the U.S. church\u2019s unofficial spokesman for a cause gaining national steam: religious freedom, specifically that of religious conservatives concerned by the lightning-fast advance of gay equality. Connecticut legalized same-sex marriage in fall 2008, and Barack Obama was soon swept into office promising to expand health-care coverage for contraception and abortion.\n\nIn 2009, Lori drew national attention by fighting a proposed state measure that would have given lay people significant control over Catholic parishes. The idea had been raised by a Catholic churchgoer fed up with embezzlement scandals involving two local priests. It was advanced by two Catholic lawmakers.\n\nLori rallied thousands of Catholics to the state capitol, branding the proposal an attack on religious freedom.\n\nThe proposal, which had gathered little support, was quickly withdrawn.\n\n[In his first public statement, Washington\u2019s new Catholic archbishop slams Trump for \u2018diminishing our national life\u2019]\n\nSupporters say Lori was prescient in tapping into passions that would grow in subsequent years as same-sex marriage became law \u2014 tensions between the gains of liberals in the United States and the religious rights of conservatives.\n\nCritics say he exaggerated the threat. \u201cWhat he said in public wasn\u2019t in tune with reality,\u201d said Mike Lawlor, a Democrat and former state representative who helped advance the measure and who was then chair of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cBut he took advantage of an opportunity. You can\u2019t fault him for that; he relished that role, the victim role.\u201d\n\nThe buses of protesters who came to the capitol in Hartford, Lawlor said, \u201clooked like a Trump rally.\u201d Conservative Connecticut blogs at the time celebrated Lori\u2019s campaign, framing his opponents as those who hated Christianity generally.\n\nLawlor said that in the decade he and Lori overlapped in Connecticut, the bishop came to talk with him only once, to argue against legislation that gave sexual abuse victims more time to sue offenders.\n\n\u201cHe went on and on about financial burden of all,\u201d Lawlor recalled. \u201cI was like: You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. . . . To put it mildly, asking for that was totally tone deaf at that time.\u201d\n\nCaine did not dispute Lawlor\u2019s account of Lori\u2019s position on the issue, which is aligned with arguments the church has long advanced. He said diocesan lobbyists, not the bishop, would be the ones primarily at the capitol to advocate.\n\nIn 2012, Lori was chosen to lead the new Committee for Religious Liberty for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. In that role, he became the public face of the church\u2019s effort to strip out federal funding for abortions and mandatory contraception coverage from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAn elite leader in the church\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI, right, greets Lori after giving the Baltimore archbishop the pallium, a woolen shawl symbolizing their bond, at the Vatican in 2012. (Andrew Medichini/AP)\n\nPope Benedict elevated Lori that year to be archbishop of Baltimore.\n\nThe Baltimore archdiocese has a special status in the U.S. church. It was the country\u2019s first Catholic diocese, established in 1789. A disproportionate number of its leaders have become cardinals.\n\nThe position carries enormous prestige. Lori lives in a sprawling historic residence that was built by the architect of the U.S. Capitol and in which hang portraits by famed artist Gilbert Stuart. There is also a portrait of Lori himself painted by John Howard Sanden, who did the official portraits of George W. Bush and Laura Bush. The $75,000 portrait was donated by the Knights of Columbus, the world\u2019s largest Catholic fraternal organization. Lori has been the organization\u2019s top chaplain since 2005, a role for which he is paid $135,000 a year.\n\n[Opinions: The forces against religious freedom are ascendant. The Trump administration mounts a defense.]\n\nThe Knights of Columbus also supports various programs in the archdiocese \u2014 as it does across the country \u2014 and paid for a private chapel in the archbishop\u2019s residence, a Knights spokesman said.\n\nSupporters of Lori praise him for stabilizing Catholic school enrollment \u2014 he announced plans last year to open the first new Catholic school in Baltimore in decades \u2014 and for putting the schools on firmer financial footing. Voice of the Faithful last year ranked Baltimore fourth among 177 dioceses for financial transparency. He is a good listener and includes lay people and women in high positions, some supporters say.\n\nMary Pat Seurkamp, vice chair of the archdiocesan school board and a former president of Notre Dame of Maryland University, said Lori\u2019s entire career should be taken into account when evaluating how he handled the Bransfield allegations. \u201cYou have evidence of other things showing he\u2019s willing to take a stand when others would not,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of us is perfect.\u201d\n\nAs leader of the region\u2019s biggest diocese, Lori regularly received financial reports from nearby smaller ones, including Bransfield\u2019s in Wheeling-Charleston. Lori knew Bransfield\u2019s diocese had a massive endowment built on revenue from oil-rich land in Texas donated to the diocese more than a century ago.\n\nIn March 2018, Lori asked Bransfield for $300,000 to support Bishop Walsh, a struggling Catholic school in Maryland near the West Virginia border, attended by a few dozen West Virginia children.\n\nNotes from the special diocesan financial council meeting to discuss the request say a gift of $150,000 was given only after Bransfield noted that West Virginia, like Baltimore, \u201cwas struggling.\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, Lori returned to West Virginia \u2014 a diocese he was at that point overseeing with Bransfield\u2019s removal last fall. He asked for another $150,000.\n\nCaine told The Post that when the $150,000 was granted in 2018, the diocese \u201cplanned to revisit the remainder this school year.\u201d Diocesan Finance Council notes say the 2018 money was a \u201cone-time gift.\u201d\n\nDavid Turner, a member of the Finance Council, said that the 2019 request was \u201cextensively debated\u201d and that he could recall no similar request in his 12 years on the council. However, he found no fault with the request and praised Lori\u2019s leadership in West Virginia, saying the archbishop was attentive and well-liked.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing nefarious,\u2019 \u201d Turner said.\n\n[Opinions: Why am I still a Catholic?]\n\nIn the interview with The Post, Lori called Bransfield \u201can acquaintance\u201d with whom he had a friendly relationship during the nearly 20 years the men were around Catholic University and both rose to high positions in the Archdiocese of Washington.\n\nLori\u2019s investigation of Bransfield was launched at a time when Pope Francis was demanding that dioceses worldwide begin finding ways to hold bishops accountable. In overseeing it, Lori had the opportunity to set a precedent for how such matters would be handled and how much information the church would share with parishioners.\n\nThe Vatican announced Bransfield\u2019s retirement in September without offering details. The U.S. bishops said in a separate news release that day that Bransfield had been accused of financial and sexual misconduct and that Lori would lead an investigation into those claims.\n\nLori said he wrote the news release and was attempting to be as transparent as possible. He said there was \u201csome back and forth\u201d with the Vatican about what would be in the release and that he \u201cput in as much as I thought I could get away with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew it would be trimmed, and it was trimmed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe day The Post planned to publish its June report about the investigation\u2019s findings, Lori\u2019s office asked for additional time to prepare responses. Fifteen minutes before the agreed-upon deadline, Lori published a letter to his parishioners, saying that \u201cin the interest of transparency,\u201d he was going public with information about the checks he had received.\n\nHe also told parishioners he would return $7,500 of the money he had received \u201cin light of what I have come to learn\u201d about the diocese\u2019s finances. He did not mention the impending Post article. The investigation had concluded in February. (He kept $3,000 from Bransfield, money Lori said was compensation related to two special Masses he celebrated in West Virginia.)\n\n\n\nLori talks to the Rev. Raymond Harris of Holy Family Catholic Church after delivering Mass. (Mary F. Calvert for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI wanted them to hear from me, not you, and that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Lori told The Post, describing his decision to publish the letter to parishioners. \u201cWhen your family gets bad news, you want them to hear it from you.\u201d\n\n[Catholic bishops adopt long-promised abuse plan \u2014 for bishops to police bishops]\n\nDays after the story published, the U.S. bishops met in Baltimore for their annual spring meeting. The core issue on the agenda was to vote for a first-ever system for bishops to investigate one another. Lori\u2019s investigation of Bransfield was discussed as a model.\n\nSome lay Catholics complained that the approach Lori had taken \u2014 having a bishop oversee an investigation of another bishop \u2014 was insufficient. To them, the handling of the Bransfield matter made that clear.\n\n\u201cThe bishops as a body do not recognize the weariness and exasperation of the laity as they are shut out and discounted \u2014 again,\u201d read a statement from 5 Theses, a D.C.-based group formed recently to advocate for greater church transparency. \u201cThere is deep discouragement.\u201d\n\nThe bishops took a different view. Lori\u2019s investigation had worked, they told reporters.\n\nIt \u201csuccessfully exposed a problem,\u201d Portland, Maine, Bishop Robert Deeley said. Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Tex., said: \u201cYou can always say we could do this or that a little better, but it resulted in accountability.\u201d", "description": "Archbishop William Lori rose quickly by helping the church emerge from crises and fight for conservative causes, but his handling of the probe into financial and sexual misconduct in West Virginia \u2014 and his ties to Bishop Michael Bransfield \u2014 angered some parishioners.", "authors": ["Michelle Boorstein", "Religion Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GZNf2gdvSSev47NlaO4AREz1_M8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33JKTNVHZYI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg"}
