But Scheer has fewer options in a minority than his Liberal counterparts, having firmly rejected the notion of negotiating with the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u2014 something he re-iterated in his interview with CTV News.\n\n\"We're not going to ask other parties for support,\" Scheer told LaFlamme.\n\nSingh spurns Conservatives\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is currently experiencing a surge in the polls, has said he is open to working with every party except Scheer's Conservatives.\n\nUnder Canada's parliamentary system, the incumbent prime minister remains prime minister until he or she formally resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General.\n\nIf no party wins a majority of seats on Monday and the Liberals come in second to the Conservatives, Justin Trudeau could continue to govern by trying to gain the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nIf he decided to do so, Trudeau would have until mid-January to recall the House. He could also enter a coalition or informal power-sharing agreement with other parties. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has already opened the door to such a deal.\n\nIn recent years, the second-place leader \u2014 even the incumbent \u2014 has usually conceded defeat on election night and allowed the leader with the most seats to try to form government, as then prime minister Paul Martin did when Stephen Harper won the most seats in 2006.\n\nDuring his tenure, Harper espoused the view that \"Losers don't get to form coalitions. Winners are the ones who form governments.\"", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday night that he expects that all parties \"will respect the fact\" that whoever wins the most seats on Oct. 21 will be the one to form\u00a0government.", "authors": ["Michelle Ghoussoub Is A Journalist With Cbc News In Vancouver.
