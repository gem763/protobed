His eyes were tired, his shoulders slumped. For the third time in three games, his Washington Redskins had been trampled by another team, this time 31-15 by the Chicago Bears, and he was searching for an answer as to why it won\u2019t keep happening.\n\n\u201cWe got to stick together. That\u2019s all we can do,\u201d the coach said when asked what he had told his team moments before. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\nBut how much longer they can stay together is a question. In a must-win year, Gruden\u2019s Redskins are 0-3 after three dismal games by a defense that was supposed to be one of the team\u2019s strengths. On Monday, they allowed Chicago\u2019s Mitchell Trubisky, who hadn\u2019t thrown a touchdown pass all year, to throw three.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said that while Gruden\u2019s job is in danger, he would not be fired before Sunday\u2019s game at the New York Giants. Still, his Redskins fell behind 28-0 on national television, and while they rallied some in the second half, the deficit served as another \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d humiliation, the franchise\u2019s eighth straight defeat in the prime-time game.\n\nAt blame was the defense that allowed the Bears to convert 62 percent of their third downs. At blame, too, was quarterback Case Keenum, who was intercepted three times and lost two fumbles, clouding the 332 yards for which he threw.\n\nThings were so bad for Washington that even a halftime ceremony to induct former star linebacker London Fletcher into the team\u2019s ring of honor was ruined when his name was misspelled on the scoreboard.\n\nLater, Gruden said he would not heed the chants of some fans who called for Keenum to be replaced by first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins.\n\n\u201cWe have to have some continuity,\u201d he said, explaining that the team is trying to mix in several new players on offense. \u201cIf I thought we didn\u2019t have a chance to get better, I would make the change.\u201d\n\n[Biggest moments from the Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears]\n\nDesperate for a win, the Redskins came into the game with confidence, even stopping the Bears on their first drive, but things fell apart quickly. Keenum\u2019s first pass, a certain first down, was dropped by tight end Jeremy Sprinkle. A play later, Keenum threw a ball into the arms of former Redskins safety Ha Ha \u00adClinton-Dix, who ran 37 yards to the end zone for a touchdown.\n\nFor a time, Washington stayed in the game, even pushing a drive to the Chicago 11-yard line, catching a break when a lost Keenum fumble was negated by a Bears penalty. But then came a sack and a missed field goal early in the second quarter, and things got bad for the Redskins from there.\n\nThe Bears drove 11 plays downfield, scoring on a play in which wide receiver Taylor Gabriel was so wide open in the end zone that Trubisky seemed almost unsure whether he should throw the ball or flick it underhanded. He chose to throw, and Chicago was up 14-0, leaving some Redskins defensive players shaking their heads as they walked to the bench.\n\nThey would soon be back on the field: One play into Washington\u2019s next drive, Bears star pass rusher Khalil Mack knocked the ball from Keenum\u2019s hand, giving Chicago the ball at the Washington 11. Two plays later, Trubisky hit Gabriel again for a touchdown to build the lead to 21-0.\n\nThat advantage bloomed to 28-0 when Trubisky again threw a pass to Gabriel, who had beaten Josh Norman down the right sideline to the corner of the end zone. At first the officials said Gabriel had fallen out of bounds, but a review showed both his feet touched the ground as he caught the ball. Referee Walt Anderson\u2019s arms went up, signaling a 36-yard touchdown. And some of the fans began chanting Haskins\u2019s name.\n\nThe Redskins did get a field goal just before halftime, but there were still boos as the Redskins headed to the locker room for the midgame break.\n\nThey looked done early in the third quarter when Clinton-Dix intercepted Keenum again and ran the ball 59 yards to the \u00adWashington 24.\n\n[Svrluga: At 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?]\n\nBut then good things started to happen for the Redskins. Chicago kicker Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro missed a field goal attempt and the Redskins moved 66 yards in 3:37 to score a touchdown when Terry McLaurin leaped high in the end zone to catch a Keenum throw, cutting the Bears\u2019 lead to 28-9. Not long after, Norman intercepted a pass on the goal line and Washington again moved downfield, going 97 yards over 12 plays in 4:56 to score on a two-yard fourth-down pass from Keenum to Paul Richardson Jr. that made the score 28-15.\n\nMoments later, Washington got the ball back and was moving again, all the way to the Chicago 16. The Redskins fans who had been quiet for much of the night were jumping in their rows. It looked as if the Redskins were about to score again when, on fourth and one, Keenum tried to leap over the line, stretching the ball ahead of him and past the first-down marker. The ball was slapped away and recovered by the Bears, ending Washington\u2019s comeback bid.\n\nSeven minutes remained in the game, and the last great hope the Redskins had to salvage this \u00adseason had wobbled away.\n\nMost of the fans at FedEx Field climbed from their chairs and headed to the parking lot, leaving the final minutes of another Redskins defeat to be played in front of a sea of empty orange seats and many happy Bears fans.\n\n\u201cWe should have executed,\u201d guard Ereck Flowers said quietly as he sat at his locker. \u201cIf we had executed, we\u2019d have won.\u201d\n\nIt seemed a mantra for a season that is quickly falling apart.", "description": "Washington is in last place in the NFC East after a turnover-filled performance.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/npdRGX2Vlf5NRSIuEOVlXlVTJm0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LCDSGCG6OEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
