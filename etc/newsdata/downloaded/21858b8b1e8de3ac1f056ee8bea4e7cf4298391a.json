Add Gun Control as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Gun Control news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn a letter sent to the Senate on Thursday, CEOs from businesses including Airbnb, Twitter and Uber asked Congress to pass a bill to require background checks on all gun sales and a strong red flag law that would allow courts to issue life-saving extreme risk protection orders.\n\nThe country's law on background checks needs to be updated, the CEOs argued, saying the current law doesn't reflect how people buy guns today.\n\nThe New York Times was first to report on the letter .\n\nThe CEOs' letter comes after shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, as well as those in West Texas and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nWalmart earlier this month decided to discontinue sales of certain gun ammunition and also will discontinue handgun sales in Alaska.\n\nThe retailer is further requesting that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores unless they are law enforcement officers. However, it said that it won't be changing its policy for customers who have permits for concealed carry. Walmart says it will be adding signage in stores to inform customers of those changes.\n\nOther retailers including Walgreens and Kroger have followed suit, with Publix \u2014 Florida's largest supermarket chain \u2014 announcing Thursday it is also asking customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores.\n\nSenators, who returned from recess this week, are pushing to require background checks for private gun sales and made a fresh pitch to President Donald Trump on Wednesday as part of an effort to break the gridlock over legislation to curb gun violence following a summer of more mass shootings.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
