He was criticized throughout his career for not caring enough about the team, specifically his defensive responsibilities. When Barry Trotz became the Capitals' coach in 2014, he asked Ovechkin to round out his game. In the Capitals' march to the Cup, Ovechkin's all-round play was noticeably improved.\n\nPREDATORS EXTEND STAR: Roman Josi signs eight-year deal\n\nOH NO: Blues lose top-line scorer for at least five months\n\nOvi says the Leafs need to 'figure out if they're playing for themselves or for a Stanley Cup' and if they want to win they need to play differently \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/oWTV5qUfmn \u2014 Yahoo Sports Canada (@YahooCASports) October 29, 2019\n\nMost of the fans in hockey-crazed Toronto would agree with Ovechkin's assessment. The team's shaky defensive game has undermined the team's efforts to become a top contender. Their 6-5-2 start has been underwhelming to average.\n\nIn the early going, the Maple Leafs rank sixth in scoring 3.54 goals per game. But despite changing up their defense in the offseason, the Maple Leafs rank 24th at 3.38 goals given up per game. They are not hard enough to play against.\n\nThe Maple Leafs would indeed be better off if they heeded Ovechkin's advice.", "description": "Alex Ovechkin told reporters in Toronto that the Maple Leafs need to change their ways if they want to win a Stanley Cup.
