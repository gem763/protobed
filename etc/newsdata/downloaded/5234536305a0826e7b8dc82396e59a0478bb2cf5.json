I think it\u2019s at a good time of year,\u201d said Thomas.\n\n\u201cBut I worked really, really hard the last couple weeks to make sure I was ready for this tournament and I was glad that it showed.\u201d\n\nOne of the longest hitters in the game, if Thomas had beefed up his red meat consumption this week, it seemed to give him even extra length.\n\nOn Sunday as he made light work of the fearsome uphill 589-yard ninth hole, which was also playing into the wind.\n\nThe man from Louisville crushed a perfect drive over 300 yards and then muscled a fairway wood past the pin, 282 yards away, to the green\u2019s back fringe.\n\nBy contrast, playing partners Lee and Cameron Smith had to lay up, unable to get near in two.\n\nThomas now takes the short hop to Japan for the US PGA Tour\u2019s inaugural Zozo Championship, which starts Thursday, with a chance to take his Asia strike rate to an amazing 50 percent if he can make it five wins in 10 starts.\n\nAt the Narashino Country Club, near Tokyo, he will come up against the formidable opposition of world number two Rory McIlroy and 15-time major winner Tiger Woods in another 78-player elite $9.75 million event, with no cut.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy this win a little bit tonight and then I need to get ready for next week, because I have another tournament I\u2019m trying to win,\u201d he said after pocketing a cheque for $1.755 million.\n\nWith his record in Asia, there will be few doubting Thomas is capable of doing it all again in Japan.", "description": "Jeju (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Justin Thomas loves playing in Asia \u2014 on Sunday he took his record on the continent to a remarkable four victories", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/53ef2f_justin-thomas-trophy-winning-cj-cup-it-all-beef-thomas-adds-incredible-asia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
