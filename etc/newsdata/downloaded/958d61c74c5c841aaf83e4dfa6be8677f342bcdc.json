He starred at Shadow Mountain in the 1990s and helped lead the Arizona Wildcats to the NCAA championship as a freshman in 1997.\n\n\"We are excited to welcome Mike Bibby as part of the Hillcrest Prep family,\" said Nick Weaver, co-founder of Hillcrest and recruiting coordinator. \"He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the program.\"\n\nBibby, who did not immediately return a message from The Republic, did not return to Shadow Mountain after an investigation was conducted over allegations of sexual abuse and harassment two years ago by a Shadow Mountain teacher. Phoenix police did not recommend criminal charges against Bibby because it did not find probable cause.\n\n\u201cMike Bibby was cleared of the charges so nothing held us back from hiring him,\u201d Weaver said in a text. \u201cMike truly has a passion for kids and helping them succeed so for us it was an easy decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about the opportunity,\u201d Bibby said in a text. \u201cGot some good young talented kids I get to work with.\u201d\n\nShadow Mountain head coach Mike Bibby watches his team on offense against Moon Valley during the second half of their game in Phoenix, Tuesday, Feb .12, 2019.

He was the No. 1 pick of the NBA draft in 2018.\n\nBibby, who played 14 years in the NBA, played this summer in the BIG 3 for the Ghost Ballers.\n\nBibby told The Republic in April that he was hoping to land a college or NBA coaching job. Bibby said then that he was hoping his coaching future wasn't damaged by the police investigation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there that should keep me out of it,\u201d he said then.", "description": "Phoenix Hillcrest Prep is hiring Mike Bibby, who was ousted as Shadow Mountain's head coach in late February following sexual misconduct allegations.", "authors": ["Richard Obert", "Published A.M.
