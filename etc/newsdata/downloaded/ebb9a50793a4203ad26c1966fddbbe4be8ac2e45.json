Yet it started in failure.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn his book, \u201cZero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future,\u201d founder Peter Thiel explains that PayPal was originally intended to allow owners of PalmPilots to beam money to each other. That idea did not work, but it evolved into using similar technology on eBay auctions.\n\nThe point is that PayPal was a private company competing in the market economy. That meant it was subject to market discipline. It had to develop an effective product or it would go out of business. The same thing cannot be said of the federal government.\n\nIn its latest bad idea, movement is building for the Federal Reserve to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange to compete with others in the marketplace and even replace physical cash.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker reportedly said at a recent conference. \u201cI think it is better for us to start getting our hands around it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an apt metaphor, since what the Fed always wants to choke off is any competition to its monetary monopoly. This comes hot on the heels of another bad idea, called FedNow, which is supposed to speed up the processing of financial transactions.\n\nINSIGHT INVESTMENT\u2019S GAUTAM KHANNA: LOW INTEREST RATES CAN HURT YOU \u2014 HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nSpeed is great, of course. It can take a full business day for transactions to clear. That\u2019s too slow in our 21st century world of instant communication.\n\nBut the Fed is late to the party. The Clearing House launched a real-time payment system two years ago that now reaches half the banks in the country. It\u2019s expected to be everywhere by next year.\n\nJudging by the non-answers that the central bank has given to members of Congress on its interoperability with private sector systems, FedNow would seemingly not compete on a level playing field; it would simply use the power of the federal government to crush a private-sector competitor.\n\nProponents of a Fed-run crypto exchange argue that such an exchange could stop the current delays in the U.S. bank transfers entirely on its own. This thought proves just how bad the Fed is at making good investments, anticipating changes in technology, and keeping up with the speed of innovation.\n\nIf board members of the central bank believe that blockchain may soon supplant the need for real-time payment services like FedNow, why the Fed would spend the next 3-5 years building FedNow from scratch when The Clearing House already offers the same type of service is beyond me.\n\nIf board members of the central bank believe that blockchain may soon supplant the need for real-time payment services like FedNow, why the Fed would spend the next 3-5 years building FedNow from scratch when The Clearing House already offers the same type of service is beyond me.\n\nThe Fed should stay out of the way and let the private sector blockchain and real-time payments marketplaces settle this debate. Instead, the central bank seems poised to set itself up as both the regulator of all monetary exchanges and a participant in that business.\n\nWithout assurances on interoperability from the central bank, businesses will always choose the Fed\u2019s offerings instead of a private company\u2019s, since doing so would make the business look better to its regulator.\n\nLIZ WESTON: HOW MUCH THE WRONG HEALTH CARE PLAN CAN COST YOU\n\nThe Fed cannot handle real competition, and so it is trying to shut it down. It worries about Bitcoin, it worries about The Clearing House, and it will be worried about the next bright idea for money sharing that comes along. It\u2019s got a monopoly to protect.\n\nWe need to open up the field for new forms of money. While I served in Congress, I introduced the Free Competition in Currency Act, which would have defined money as whatever people are willing to trade with each other, whether that\u2019s paper, tokens of some sort, or direct barter. It would have ended the Fed\u2019s power to declare that only certain pieces of paper are currency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nLet\u2019s allow companies to compete, and let the market set the value.
