Democrats in the House and Senate are pushing the Do Not Harm Act that would strip away the rights of millions of Americans who, because of their faith, are pro-life or support traditional marriage, making this an election issue for 2018.\n\nMore than 100 House Democrats have signed onto H.R. 3222, the misleadingly named \"Do No Harm Act\".

The Free Speech Clause protects the right to express beliefs and opinions, including religious ones. The Free Exercise Clause protects living your life according to the teachings of your faith.\n\nFor two centuries, government burdens on exercising faith were subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d meaning they were presumed by courts to be unconstitutional and were sustained only if absolutely necessary and carefully tailored to achieve a truly compelling public interest. But in 1990, the Supreme Court in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith wrongly narrowed the scope of the Free Exercise Clause to protect only against government actions that directly or indirectly target religion, lowering the bar for government interference with religious liberty.\n\nCongress responded by enacting RFRA in 1993, restoring \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d protection to exercising faith. The House passed RFRA unanimously \u2014 not a single vote against it among 435 members of Congress \u2014 and the Senate passed it by an overwhelming vote of 97-3. The ACLU supported RFRA.

When the Obama administration imposed its \u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d through ObamaCare regulations, Hobby Lobby Stores \u2014 owned by an Evangelical Christian family \u2014 faced $475 million per year in penalties for not providing abortion-causing drugs to employees.\n\nKyle Duncan \u2014 now a judge on the federal Fifth Circuit appeals court \u2014 and former Solicitor General Paul Clement, argued the Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), which struck down ObamaCare\u2019s contraceptive mandate because it violated RFRA. But Hobby Lobby was a 5-4 decision. A single vote separated this faith-driven company from a financial catastrophe.\n\nGovernment has been increasingly willing to infringe upon religious freedom as American society has become more secular. Often, these violations pit conscientious beliefs about abortion, human sexuality and marriage against secular progressivism.\n\nPoliticians and bureaucrats often mask infringements on applying ones beliefs about controversial issues in the public square by redefining religious liberty to mean only \u201cfreedom of worship.\u201d In other words, people are free to believe whatever they want when within the four corners of their house of worship but cannot carry those beliefs into the workplace to inform how they can run their business or conduct their lives.\n\nThe reality is that most of the current threats to religious liberty concern rights of conscience on the matters that would be specifically exempted by the Do Not Harm Act. This bill targets countless faithful Christians and adherents of other faiths who turned out for President Trump Donald John TrumpWHCA calls on Trump to denounce video depicting him shooting media outlets Video of fake Trump shooting members of media shown at his Miami resort: report Trump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage MORE because they believed his promise to protect religious liberty \u2014 a promise he continues to faithfully keep.\n\nIt does not matter if people of faith are sincere in their love for people who disagree with them on those issues or go the extra mile to avoid causing offense. The political elites have decided that everyone must adhere to the government-approved orthodoxy on these social issues, and therefore legal protections that shield people of faith must be stripped away.\n\nThat is not American. This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do Not Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom and should be an issue in the upcoming election. It gives voters a clear choice regarding the nation\u2019s future.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior counsel for First Liberty Institute, the largest organization exclusively dedicated to protecting religious liberty for all Americans.", "description": "\"Government has been increasingly willing to infringe upon religious freedom as American society has become more secular.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pray_032318gn_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-08"}
