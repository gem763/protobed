Their love for each other is so evident. It's a treat to see them on the big screen.\"\n\n\"Meghan & Harry are the most humble royal couple. You can see how genuine they are.

Seeing Meghan and Harry just be natural and enjoy time with their son is refreshing and humanising,\" agreed another.\n\nA fifth said: \"I like them even more after watching... didn\u2019t think that was possible. Substance & style. An amazing couple. They\u2019re authentically themselves. They\u2019re comfortable in their own skin.

Life is [tiring] but I think any parent can relate to that. He\u2019s been doing really well. He\u2019s been sleeping really well.\n\n\"It's not lost on us what a huge and significant moment this is. I think Archie will look back on that in so many years and realise at the beginning of his life he was fortunate enough to have that moment with one of the most inspirational leaders of our time.\"", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex smiled as she made the romantic admission during tonight's ITV documentary", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662553.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Megan-and-Harry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
