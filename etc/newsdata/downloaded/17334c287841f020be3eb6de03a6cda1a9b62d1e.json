The North Carolina Supreme Court, which would hear any appeal, has six Democratic justices and one Republican.\n\n\u201cIt contradicts the Constitution and binding legal precedent, but we intend to respect the court\u2019s decision and finally put this divisive battle behind us,\u201d Mr. Berger said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on.\u201d", "description": "A three-judge panel in Raleigh threw out North Carolina\u2019s state legislative maps as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and ordered new maps drawn and approved by Sept. 18.", "authors": ["Michael Wines", "Richard Fausset"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/us/03carolina/03carolina-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
