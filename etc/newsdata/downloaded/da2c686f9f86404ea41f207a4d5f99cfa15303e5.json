Richard Nixon\u2019s White House was a petri dish breeding deceit and distrust. It teemed with espionage and enemies\u2019 lists, wiretapping and burglaries, leaked national secrets and even murder conspiracy. All those sins represent just one pre-Watergate feud: Nixon\u2019s crusade against the investigative reporter Jack Anderson. Still, this old-style gumshoe journalist who saw his job as digging for dirt not writing think pieces, helped proved the system\u2019s resilience.\n\nA transition figure, Jack Anderson had shoes soiled by muckraking, hands ink-stained from typing, and face powdered for his nine-year TV gig on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. He was Upton Sinclair and Ida Tarbell, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Lesley Stahl and Dan Rather, all wrapped in one. And, when America needed it, he helped take down a president.", "description": "For those who think the future of press freedom is facing unprecedented challenges, a reminder of the time Nixon aides hatched a plot to kill a troublesome journalist.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1491846633/articles/2017/01/21/when-nixon-s-henchmen-plotted-to-assassinate-a-journalist/170120-troy-jack-anderson-assassination-tease_ro0f69", "published_at": "2017-01-21"}
