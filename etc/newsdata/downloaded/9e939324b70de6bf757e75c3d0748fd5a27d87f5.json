The NDP's Jagmeet Singh used a slight variation. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has been using the line at least since 2013.\n\nBut whatever effect the claim once had, it's since worn off. The Bloc is poised to make substantial gains on Monday night. After eight years in the political wilderness, it could once again be a significant player on the federal scene.\n\nAccusing the Bloc of obsessing over old arguments was meant, of course, to make the party look like a leftover from a bygone era, when talk of referendums and sovereignty consumed the country's political oxygen.\n\nBut the problem is that under leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, the Bloc has reinvented itself.\n\nBlanchet has spent most of his time talking about Quebec nationalism, not sovereignty.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau makes a campaign stop at the Hamilton Fire Department's administration and training academy in Hamilton, Ont. on Saturday. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nIn Quebec, this brand of nationalism is often called d\u00e9complex\u00e9, that is, unselfconscious or, literally, without complexes; its champion is Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault and it's seen as something new, refreshingly so.\n\nRecycling the vieilles chicanes line makes it seem like it's the other federal leaders who are the ones stuck in the past.\n\nWhy nationalism, why now\n\nBooks will be written on why this unselfconscious nationalism has supplanted sovereignty, and why at this moment. In the meantime, though, here are a few sociological trends to consider.\n\nFor the first time in recent history, according to Scotiabank , Quebec's economy will lead the country in GDP growth this year.\n\nThere are construction cranes not just in Montreal, but across the province. Mid-sized cities \u2014 like Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Sherbrooke and Drummondville \u2014 are growing and adapting to the opportunities of a high-tech economy.\n\nAlong their main streets, help-wanted signs can be spotted in just about every other storefront window.\n\nThis is a relatively new experience in a province where for years a sluggish economy was understood to be the byproduct of continuous referendum uncertainty.\n\nBut the long-term prospects of this growth face significant hurdles thanks to an aging population that is leaving the workforce in droves.\n\nEconomists, business lobbies and mayors are pleading for more workers, for immigrants. But these pleas confront more deeply embedded concerns: Will they speak French? Will they adopt our values?\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau, left to right, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet applaud as they take part in the the Federal leaders French-language debate in Gatineau, Que. on Thursday, October 10, 2019. (Chris Wattie/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe perception among many Quebecers \u2014 especially those older and living outside of Montreal \u2014 is that the Trudeau government was deaf to these concerns.\n\nMulticulturalism, a word closely associated with the Trudeau name, is understood as putting the needs of newcomers and minority groups before those of the host society.\n\nTo get a taste of how that was received, here are a few samples from the opinion pages in Saturday's Journal de Montr\u00e9al, the most widely read newspaper in the province:\n\n\"[Trudeau] trucks in a radical multiculturalism.\"\n\nHe's among the \"defenders of the multicultural orthodoxy.\"\n\nCanada is a country divided by its \"state multiculturalism.\"\n\nQuebec, in a way, is re-modernizing itself, a process that comes with anxieties about the ability of a collective identity to survive the transformation.\n\nAs have similar anxieties elsewhere in the world, in Quebec they have been channeled into nationalism. That is what the Bloc is offering voters.\n\nUsing the vieilles chicanes line not only makes it seem that the federal leaders are out of touch with these concerns, it reminds Quebecers that the outcome of the old argument was never really resolved.\n\nThe province still hasn't signed the Constitution; its distinct society is still unrecognized by the federation.\n\nReturn of the repressed\n\nJack Layton and the NDP's Orange Wave of 2011 often gets the credit for decimating the Bloc, putting it on life support until Blanchet's arrival.\n\nBut it's worth remembering that was preceded by Stephen Harper's experiment with \"open federalism,\" which included the parliamentary motion recognizing Quebec as a nation and giving the province a seat at UNESCO.\n\nBlanchet points to these measures now as proof of what the Bloc can get done in a minority government. At the time, though, they were seen as stealing the party's thunder.\n\nAs prime minister, Stephen Harper experimented with 'open federalism,' which included the parliamentary motion recognizing Quebec as a nation and giving the province a seat at UNESCO. (Jose Luis Magana/The Canadian Press/AP)\n\nTrudeau had his own opportunity to demonstrate that Liberals too could practise a federalism sensitive to Quebec's continuing anxieties about its constitutional status.\n\nIn 2017, then premier Philippe Couillard \u2014 a Liberal and diehard federalist \u2014 unveiled an ambitious 177-page manifesto that outlined a very gradual way to get Quebec to sign the Constitution.\n\nTrudeau, walking into a cabinet meeting in Ottawa just hours after the manifesto was released, dismissed the effort with little more than a shrug.\n\nWhen it came time for Couillard to seek re-election, his opponents accused him of cravenly bowing to Ottawa, of being too co-operative with the federal government only to come home empty-handed.\n\nHe was trounced by Legault's brand of nationalism.\n\nIf Trudeau loses his majority, or worse, it will in no small part be due to the nationalist energy the Bloc drew from Legault.\n\nThere is a theory in Freudian psychology known as the return of the repressed, which in its less sexual variant holds that those things you don't confront will eventually come back to haunt you.\n\nSo long as Quebec's distinct character remains unaddressed in the Constitution, it is likely the Bloc will continue to haunt the other federal parties for some time to come.", "description": "So long as Quebec\u2019s distinct character remains unaddressed in the Constitution, it is likely the Bloc will continue to haunt the other federal parties for some time to come.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327945.1571530197!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/yves-francois-blanchet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
