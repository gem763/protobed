She casually mentioned that yes, President Trump might just drop in on the U.N. 2019 Climate Action Summit since, you know, he\u2019d be in the building anyway.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he popped in and stopped by. We\u2019ll see what happens. His schedule is ever-changing but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he pops by.\u201d With that Grisham left open the possibility of Trump \u201cpopping in\u201d during the part of the programming of the United Nations meetings today that the administration maintained he would not \u2013 climate change. As she said, his schedule shifted a bit and he popped in for about 14 minutes to listen to one speaker in particular.\n\nGuess which speaker he chose to pop in for? His new bestie, Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. You may have seen reports of their visit Sunday in Houston during the city\u2019s \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d rally. It was quite something to see \u2013 the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest democracies holding hands and walking onto the same stage. Their words were of mutual admiration for each other. Most importantly, Trump was taking the opportunity to reach out to over 50,000 Indian-Americans who most likely voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Modi\u2019s unapologetic praise of Trump may sway some of them to vote for Trump in 2020, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. So, it is a particularly pointed jab in the eye of the global climate change scolds that he spent a few minutes listening to Modi\u2019s speech delivered to the world leaders.\n\nTrump took a seat in the auditorium next to Vice-President Pence to listen to Modi\u2019s speech. He was present to hear Modi say, \u201cThe world needs to act now.\u201d That \u2018s a little ironic, right, since India is a huge producer of carbon emissions while the United States has met and exceeded its goals of carbon emission reduction. The world has gone mad with organized protests and this movement is happy to exploit children as the face of it.\n\nThe summit culminates a week of international protests and marches aimed at drawing attention to the climate crisis. In New York City 1.1 million children were excused from classes to attend the Global Climate Strike rally. Organizers say around 250,000 people turned out in New York. Thousands filled the streets of San Francisco (40,000), Denver, (7,500), Boston (7,000), Chicago (3,000), Portland (2,000) and Washington, D.C., among other cities. Protests continued on Monday in Washington, D.C., where activists shut down major intersections and disrupted the morning commute. Similar scenes took place worldwide in cities including Berlin (270,000), London (100,000) and across Australia (about 100,000 in Melbourne).\n\nWhat President Trump so aptly does is show that withdrawal from a feel-good international agreement on climate change, which had no teeth as far as enforcement of it went, isn\u2019t necessary for reducing carbon emissions. Conservatives are supportive of measures to manage the harmful effects of climate change but not in the way that liberals call for. We do not wish to go back to pre-industrial revolution days. Taxing everyone into poverty, which would destroy American businesses and innovations, is not the way to go. And, most conservatives don\u2019t intend to let world leaders determine how we live here in America, thank you very much. Liberals love to hate Big Oil, for example, but the energy industry has been pro-active for years in developing environmentally-friendly alternatives to oil and gas drilling and exploration. The common-sense solution isn\u2019t to \u201cleave it in the ground\u201d but to drill, baby, drill.\n\nPresident Trump angers the leftists who would dictate how we live when he doesn\u2019t fall for the emotional groupthink. As a businessman, he knows the downfall of over-taxation and restricting free markets. The party of science falls back on emotions instead of reason and that is why they exploit children to deliver their message.\n\nSo, President Trump popped by and gave the global climate change part of the U.N.\u2019s agenda today a whole 14 minutes. He did it as he supported an ally, he hopes, in trade deals and friendship. It can\u2019t be said he ignored the agenda. That\u2019s pretty perfect if you ask me.\n\nI was a bit surprised to see Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg standing in the background when President Trump and his entourage arrived at the United Nations at the start of this week\u2019s session. He stopped for questions from the press and there she was, standing off to the side with her adult handlers. She was looking angrily at the president. She was in the building to deliver her own speech to the adults.", "description": "Drive-by attendance", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/f30ceab4-a589-4651-80cb-9be8db2ca3ae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
