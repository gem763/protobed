Before you start.\n\nBut as long as Pep Guardiola and his team produce moments and goals such as the one that effectively ended this match as a contest, they should be cherished by all of those without a dog in the fight.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nDeepish in his own half, an interception falls to David Silva, who cushions a pass into the stride of a gliding Kevin de Bruyne.\n\nOn to Gabriel Jesus and across to Benjamin Mendy, a defender strictly in name only. Nothing else.\n\nAnd then to Raheem Sterling, who can feel the breeze from David Silva\u2019s dart between defenders, sense his senior colleague\u2019s intentions.\n\nA pass lifted exhibition-style and as it drops from the Selhurst air, an over-the-shoulder volley from a player who defines sublime.\n\nIt was a thing of beauty. In a tequila sunrise of a strip, it was a cocktail of ingenuity, the type of goal Guardiola must dream about.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd it did not just get a ten for artistic impression, unlike the scruffy head and shoulder combination that Gabriel Jesus used for the breakthrough a couple of minutes earlier.\n\nIt got a ten for its importance, pretty much guaranteeing a positive result after the Wolves wobble by taking City into the break two to the good.\n\nAnd no-one was more instrumental in securing that result than Sterling.\n\nIf the impudent flick for David Silva\u2019s goal was the party piece of his performance, one breathless dash back to dispossess Wilfried Zaha was the food and drink.\n\nWith what passes for City defenders nowadays nowhere to be seen, Sterling\u2019s diligence was as equally as importance as his brilliance.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe only blemishes on Sterling\u2019s performance were a couple of snatched finishing attempts, including one particular Raheem-of-old miss from in front.\n\nOn that score, he was not alone, and that was the fundamental reason City did not convert their possession superiority into a more emphatic win.\n\nNot that Guardiola will be overly concerned with the spurned chances. He will be relieved with the win, relieved they ended what would, in a Manchester City context, be classed as a goal drought.\n\nWhen Jesus converted Bernardo Silva\u2019s cross, it ended a period of well over two hours without a Premier League goal for the champions.\n\nThat just felt odd.\n\nAnd while this triumph was something of a canter - although Ederson did have to produce a couple of very decent second half saves - there was still not the total fluidity you come to expect.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nNot that Guardiola\u2019s team had to be that fluid against a Crystal Palace team of very limited ambition.\n\nYes, it is City. Yes, they keep the ball like no other outfit. But there were times when Roy Hodgson\u2019s side looked scared to attack.\n\nPresumably, it was because they feared the sort of counter-attack that produced the Sterling assist and David Silva finish.\n\nWhen a similar goal was scored in a City training session once, Sterling had to explain to his manager what he meant when he had encouraged a colleague to \u2018dink\u2019 it.\n\nPep certainly knows what it means now, after this matchless assist.\n\nCity were not quite back to their dinking best but when they give the game stunning moments like the one they produced here, it does not matter.\n\nIn the hurly-burly of the Premier League, a work of art is always welcome.", "description": "Man City showed some of their brilliance despite wasting chances in a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657108.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Crystal-Palace-v-Manchester-City-Premier-League-Selhurst-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
