We have not seen any texts. This is going to take more time,\" said one senior EU diplomat. \"I cannot imagine leaders tomorrow being able to say more than: 'This doesn't look too bad and let's work with the UK to set out more details'.\"\n\nA second senior EU diplomat said of the talks in Brussels and a planned Saturday session of the House of Commons: \"If things go well, the sword of Damocles remains, with the decision of the British Parliament.\"\n\nA third diplomat added that, should there be an eleventh-hour agreement in technical talks between British and EU going on in Brussels, the summit could offer London a short delay to its departure date currently due on Oct.31 to polish the detail.\n\nWithout any agreement, the bloc would entertain a longer lag, the diplomat said.
