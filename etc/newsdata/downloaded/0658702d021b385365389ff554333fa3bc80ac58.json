They were a medium-sized company with about hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year. It was the CEO, the COO, the CFO, the CHRO, and a few other leaders on the line. They were explaining to me the problems they were facing in their company.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cOur business units do not mind their P&Ls \u2014 half of them are barely profitable and several of them are actually losing money,\u201d said the CFO.\n\n\u201cWe have processes that are being used on the front lines that make no sense,\u201d added the COO.\n\n\u201cSome of our people are in positions that they shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the CHRO chimed in.\n\nThen the CEO said, \u201cOn top of all that, we have middle management here that don\u2019t understand the vision of the company. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond, in case there were any additional complaints that someone wanted to voice. The phone was quiet for a few moments until the CEO finally said, \u201cWell what do you think, Jocko? We have so many problems. Where do you think we should start?\u201d\n\nI took a breath. \u201cWell,\u201d I told them all, \u201cYou don\u2019t have multiple problems. In fact you only have one problem\u2014and that is leadership. All your problems are leadership problems.\n\n\"Business units not paying attention to their P&Ls? That means you have leaders at your business units not prioritizing expenses versus income. Processes that don\u2019t make sense? That means you have leaders that aren\u2019t developing and implementing good processes.\n\n\"People in positions that they shouldn\u2019t be in? That means leaders aren\u2019t having tough conversations and making hard decisions when it comes to personnel. And midlevel managers that don\u2019t understand the vision of the company? That means that all of you, the leaders on this conference call, are not leading; you all are not conveying the vision of the company in a way that the midlevel managers\u2014and everyone else in this company\u2014can understand.\n\nAnd if you want to fix these problems, you won\u2019t fix them by just looking at spreadsheets or doing time-studies on processes. A manpower analysis won\u2019t put people in the right positions. And the company vision will not be understood and embraced by the troops through a mass-email. What you need to do \u2014 what all of you need to do \u2014 is lead.\n\n\u201cAnd if you want to fix these problems, you won\u2019t fix them by just looking at spreadsheets or doing time-studies on processes. A manpower analysis won\u2019t put people in the right positions. And the company vision will not be understood and embraced by the troops through a mass-email. What you need to do \u2014 what all of you need to do \u2014 is lead,\u201d I said.\n\nThere was silence on the other end of the conference call. I was wondering if I had been a bit too straightforward. The truth can sting when it hits close to home.\n\nFinally, the COO spoke up, \u201cJocko, I\u2019m not sure you really unders\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure you understand,\u201d the CEO cut off the COO, \u201cJocko is right. Every one of these problems need to be fixed through leadership. And yes \u2026 that means us.\u201d\n\nThe CEO continued on, offering some ideas of where to start and changes they could implement quickly. With that, the conversation was open \u2014 and their minds were open as well.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nI spent the next few months working with the executive leadership team to help them develop strategies and tactics to align their leadership and thereby, the entire company.\n\nAnd they made rapid progress in correcting their problems, once they recognized the simple truth that all problems in any organization are leadership problems.\n\nJocko Willink is a Retired Navy SEAL Officer, author of Extreme Ownership, Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual, The Dichotomy of Leadership, Mikey and the Dragons, and the Way of the Warrior Kid series, and hosts the top-rated podcast: Jocko Podcast.
