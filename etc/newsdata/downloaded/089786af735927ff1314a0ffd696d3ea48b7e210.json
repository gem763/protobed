Ryan Day has struck up a good relationship with the veteran (3213253 aboard him) and he will be at pains to gain some cover early on and creep into the race unnoticed.\n\nHistorically, October has been a kind month to Duke Of Navan who has won two of his four starts at this time of the year and he looks a spot of value to arrive late on the scene with a winning chance today.\n\nDoncaster seems a fairly big price to pass their 7.30am inspection on Saturday morning with conditions on Town Moor deteriorating rapidly on Friday with the prospect of more rain to materialise.\n\nIf the meeting does get the go ahead then it is highly likely Aidan O\u2019Brien will enhance his terrific record in the Vertem Futurity Trophy with five of the six runners scheduled to go to post and the classy MOGUL (Doncaster, 3.25) is the one to beat.\n\nSportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out the best tips for Saturday's meetings at Cheltenham, Newbury and Doncaster...\n\nCHELTENHAM\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 2.00 Cogry 2.35 Quel Destin 3.10 Duke Of Navan (nb) 3.45 Theclockisticking 4.20 Macgiloney 4.55 Garo De Juilley 5.30 Mustang Alpha GIMCRACK 2.00 The Young Master 2.35 Quel Destin 3.10 Marracudja 3.45 Tobefair 4.20 The Butcher Said 4.55 Pym 5.30 Barbados Buck\u2019s\n\nDONCASTER\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 1.45 Troubador 2.15 Lost In Time 2.55 Indianapolis 3.25 Mogul 4.00 Saaheq 4.35 Oh This Is Us 5.10 Zip GIMCRACK 1.45 Art Power 2.15 Lost In Time 2.55 Indianapolis 3.25 Mogul (nap) 4.00 Tarboosh 4.35 Flying Pursuit 5.10 Reloaded\n\nNEWBURY", "description": "Sportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out the best tips for Saturday's meetings at Cheltenham, Newbury and Doncaster...", "authors": ["Sam Turner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/22/20199292-0-image-a-32_1572038992221.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
