U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff hike, but officials said much work still needed to be done.\n\nAnalysts in the latest Reuters poll expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) would ease policy further by cutting banks' reserve retirement ratios (RRR) and the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), its new benchmark lending rate.\n\nThe PBOC has already cut RRR seven times since early 2018, in addition to two modest reductions in the one-year LPR since August.\n\nAnalysts expect the PBOC to deliver another 50 basis-point RRR cut in the fourth quarter, and two more RRR reductions in the first half of 2020, according to the poll.\n\nThe central bank is also forecast to slash the one-year LPR to 4.00% by the end of 2019, down by 20 basis point from its current level.\n\nHowever, they do not expect it to cut its previous benchmark lending rate, which remains in place but will be replaced by the new benchmark lending rate over time.\n\nEconomists expect the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.35 percent through at least the end of 2020.\n\nThe poll also predicted annual consumer inflation will pick up to 2.5% in 2019, quickening from 2.3% estimate in the July survey, but below the government target of around 3%.\n\nData earlier in the day showed China's factory gate prices declined at their fastest pace in more than three years in September, reinforcing the case for Beijing to unveil further stimulus as manufacturing cools on weak demand and U.S. trade pressures.\n\nConsumer inflation accelerated to 3% in September - the highest since October 2013, but analysts attributed this to the supply-side impact of rising food costs, driven by surging pork prices as African swine fever diminishes hog supplies.\n\n(Polling by Khushboo Mittal and Jing Wang; Reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "description": "Trade pressure seen denting China's 2019 growth to 29-year low at 6.2%, 5.9% in 2020: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E0DO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
