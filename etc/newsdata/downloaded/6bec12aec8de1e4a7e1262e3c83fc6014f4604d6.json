Many have sought refuge in bonds but savvy long-term investors will stay with stocks.\n\nAdding to nervousness, FAANG stocks \u2014 Facebook FB, -0.29% , Amazon AMZN, +0.29% , Apple AAPL, +0.71% , Netflix NFLX, +1.03% and Google GOOGL, -0.29% (a.k.a. Alphabet) \u2014 face tough antitrust scrutiny, new challenges over user privacy and more competition. After leading the market for years, like Microsoft MSFT, -1.47% , Intel INTC, +1.45% and Cisco CSCO, -0.30% in the 1990s, they have somewhat receded into the pack.\n\nConsumer spending and the broader service sectors are still growing and the FAANG\u2019s challenges more likely herald opportunities for other leaders to come forward.\n\nDisrupting the FAANGs\n\nFor example, Walmart WMT, +1.14% has fashioned a formidable web presence to rival Amazon in groceries and doesn\u2019t suffer the same product quality problems in other areas. Netflix\u2019s woes are driven by Disney DIS, -0.35% and others expanding in the video streaming space \u2014 likely expanding overall industry revenue and profits.\n\nMicrosoft has resurrected itself from a \u201clegacy tech\u201d to a leader in cloud services, and revolutions in artificial intelligence and robotics are driven by a host of smaller firms that are cutting waste out of the economy.\n\nSearching for the brightest prospects requires information that ordinary investors cannot muster. They should stick to broad diversification \u2014 in particular, indexing \u2014 and ask how stock valuations stack up against history and prospects for continued growth.\n\nOver the last 25 years, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.10% price-earnings ratio has averaged 25 for the trailing 12-months of profits. Currently, those are at 22 and indicate stocks are hardly overvalued.\n\nModerate growth\n\nThe U.S. and global economies should continue to grow at about 2% and 3% in real terms and 4% to 6% nominally, respectively, with U.S. household income improving moderately. That should translate into gains in corporate sales and profits the first half of next year.\n\nThe American economy is adjusting to less emphasis on autos and residential construction\u2014and temporarily Boeing BA, -0.85% \u2014 to greater reliance on digital technologies that are revolutionizing the services sector. For example, consumer accessible artificial intelligence through health apps and UberEats UBER, -0.05% and DoorDash.\n\nOverall, profit growth may hit a nadir in the third quarter, possibly pushing stock prices to clutch down further, but that metric should accelerate to 8% or 9% by the first half of next year.\n\nStick with equities\n\nOver the horizon, the stuff of strong gains beckons and is a good reason to stick with equities.\n\nFor ordinary investors, stocks, bonds and CDs are the only reasonable places for retirement money. IRS depreciation rules make investing in rental property difficult, and small investors can expect increasing competition from large firms \u2014 with significant backing from Wall Street \u2014 expanding into the businesses of flipping and renting homes.\n\nOver the last 50 years, the S&P 500 has outperformed 10-year Treasuries TMUBMUSD10Y, +3.77% by more than 50%, and no compelling argument has been offered that the coming decades will be any different. With the Federal Reserve and other central banks in an interest-rate-cutting mode, stocks will continue to enjoy the edge over fixed-income assets\u2014even with only moderate profit growth.\n\nThe world is awash with too much savings \u2014 businesses have more cash than new opportunities and international investors looking for safe havens for their wealth. A good chunk of that money will find its way into Treasuries \u2014 suppressing yields \u2014 and U.S. stocks \u2014 driving up P/E ratios.\n\nPicking the next Apple or Amazon or timing when profits and stock prices will dip and then rise is a virtually impossible task \u2014 winning at that game has even eluded Warren Buffett over the last decade.\n\nWhat to do\n\nSmall investors should invest for the long term by purchasing a broad-based index fund like the Vanguard, Fidelity or USAA S&P 500 portfolios. And perhaps an international index fund to smooth results \u2014 sometimes U.S. equities do better while other times foreign stocks lead.\n\nOnce within 10 years of retiring, gradually move about half of that money into fixed-income vehicles with maturities of less than five years. Avoid bond funds \u2014 it\u2019s less risky to purchase fixed income through Treasury Direct or in CDs.\n\nIf you consistently add a reasonable amount to those investments throughout your working years, you should be in good shape to give your child a great wedding, pay tuition, and enjoy a secure retirement.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MarketWatch.", "description": "Trade wars and political and economic turmoil in China and .09/09/2019 19:18:32PM EST.", "authors": ["Peter Morici", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/302/05fcdb00-2dfe-41ba-8059-1cce0d0b74f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
