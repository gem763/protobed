We've got over a reported 40 deaths from the community in the last three weeks and probably another 50 or so are sick,\" said Katie Powell of the Winnipeg-based Save A Dog Network Canada.\n\nThe dead include family pets as well as strays running loose in the community, about 75 kilometres southeast of The Pas, she said.\n\nPowell's organization along with another rescue group, Feed The Furbabies Canada, have arranged for an emergency vet team to visit Moose Lake on the weekend of Oct. 19-20.\n\nThe goal is to vaccinate dogs that can still be saved and euthanize those that cannot, she said.\n\n\"And body recovery is a big part of this \u2014 getting the virus out of the community. Any dogs that we do find that have passed away we will be gathering.\"\n\nCanine distemper is an extremely contagious airborne virus that affects the respiratory, digestive and nervous systems of animals.\n\n\"The dog can appear sick, looking a little bit lazy with vomiting, diarrhea. In the more severe stages, as the virus takes over the body, there's lots of mucous coming from the nose, eyes,\" Powell said.\n\n\"And near death, they start to seize, they do lip smacking, convulsions and are unable to walk. The animal suffers and it's very visually traumatizing for families witnessing this.\"\n\nWhile there have been many documented cases of distemper in Manitoba, neither she nor any other rescue group she works with has ever seen an outbreak this severe in a single community.\n\nPowell blames it on a lack of affordable veterinary care and vaccinations available to people in remote areas. The vaccination rate is less than five per cent in those communities, compared to 70 per cent in places like Winnipeg.\n\n\"Manitoba is really, really struggling with an overpopulation of dogs and a lack of veterinary care to these First Nations communities and this is exactly what happens,\" she said.\n\nEvery dog in Moose Lake and nearby areas are affected by the distemper outbreak if they have not been vaccinated, Powell said.\n\n\"It absolutely has the potential to wipe out thousands of dogs\" if it continues to spread, she said.\n\nIt can also be picked up by wildlife \u2014 coyotes, foxes, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons \u2014 so it is not limited to dogs.\n\n'Make this happen'\n\nThe emergency vet trip has been planned with help from Manitoba's Chief Veterinary Office, the conservation department of the provincial government, Moose Lake Chief and Council, Moose Lake RCMP, and many volunteers.\n\nTwo veterinarians are also involved, one from Winnipeg and one from Virden.\n\nKatie Powell is the founder of Save a Dog Network Canada. (Submitted by Brittany Semeniuk)\n\n\"It is a large collaborative group because the provincial vet does not deal with strays,\" Powell said. \"So the dogs that are not owned, they will be left behind if our group doesn't step up.\"\n\nShe doesn't blame the provincial vet, noting they are limited in resources and by their policies.\n\n\"But as a collaborative with all of us, we can make this happen,\" she said.\n\nThe rescue groups are working out logistics and raising funds to cover costs for the medications and vaccinations as well as the hotels, gas and accommodations for volunteers.\n\nPowell's organization routinely flies in to First Nations communities with supplies to perform a free spaying and neutering.\n\nOne thing that goes a long way in helping control the dog populations on reserves is building long-term, positive relationships with chiefs and band councils so they are open to groups like Powell's coming in an holding vet clinics.\n\nPart of the emergency visit on Oct. 19-20 will be to provide education to officials and residents on animal care.", "description": "An outbreak of canine distemper is killing dogs on a northern Manitoba First Nation and has the potential to spread to other communities.", "authors": ["Reporter Editor", "Darren Bernhardt Spent The First Dozen Years Of His Journalism Career In Newspapers", "First At The Regina Leader-Post Then The Saskatoon Starphoenix.
