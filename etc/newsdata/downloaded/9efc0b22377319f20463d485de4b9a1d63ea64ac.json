He said that Trump was potentially \"violating the Constitution\" and \"doing things that are unacceptable\" with respect to the presidency.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption A.J.

In all, 52% of Americans say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released this week.\n\nBut by a 58-37% margin, Americans think the president's future should be decided at the ballot box rather than through impeachment, according to the poll.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption A.J.

On the call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to \"look into\" the family of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House.\n\nIn the interview with NPR's Ari Shapiro, Booker was asked why Congress should get involved in impeachment proceedings, rather than leave it up to voters who go to the polls in a little more than a year.\n\nBooker said he has no idea what the state of things will be 13 months from now, but \"in this moment in history\" the move should not be to sit back and wait for November 2020.\n\n\"So politics be damned,\" Booker said. \"I have a job to do which is to hold the executive accountable and we should be doing that.\"", "description": "The New Jersey senator and presidential hopeful says Congress must take action. \"Politics be damned.
