The discovery as it was found (right) and next to 20 pence for scale (left)\n\n'This time I got a strong signal so I dug down five inches and saw it. My first reaction was it was a piece of climbing equipment, or perhaps coupling from a tractor.\n\n'I never thought it could be gold.\n\nWHAT IS TREASURE? Under the Treasure Act 1996, finders of potential treasure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are legally obliged to notify their local coroner An inquest then determines whether the finds constitute treasure. If the find is declared treasure, the finder must offer it for sale to a museum at a price set by the British Museum's Treasure Valuation Committee. A reward is then offered to the finders and other relevant parties.\n\n'I carried on detecting for an hour and a half before I called my friend and sent him a picture of it.\n\n'He said I must come around with it right away so I hopped in my car and drove to his house with it.\n\n'He was very excited about the find and told me to take it to a jeweller's, who confirmed it was 11oz of 22 carat gold.\n\n'He said it had a value in gold of \u00a311,000, but it was worth a lot more because of its age and what it was.\n\n'I was stunned and gobsmacked. I still can't believe it.'\n\nMr Vaughan, a care worker, has alerted his local museum and the coroner who will rule if the find is 'treasure' under the Treasure Act (1996).\n\nIn that instance, he would be legally obliged to offer it for sale to a museum at a price set by the Treasure Valuation Committee.\n\nThe startling discovery was made in a remote field near his home town of Whitehaven, Cumbria\n\nMr Vaughan said: 'I try not to get ahead of myself and think about the money until you get it, but it will make a difference.\n\n'To think I was the first person to hold that torc in who knows how many years is quite something.'\n\nGold torcs were worn as jewellery around the neck or wrist to display wealth and status, often being gifted to loved ones.\n\nAnother example which was unearthed in Norfolk two years ago was purchased for \u00a323,000 by a local museum.", "description": "Billy Vaughan, 54, was stunned when he unearthed the gleaming 22 carat Bronze Age gold band in a remote field near his home town of Whitehaven, Cumbria.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19398216-0-image-a-28_1570456392043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
