Or are we all living in alternative realities, where we all have our own set of facts?\n\nIt sounds silly, but it\u2019s all too real.\n\nJust days after President Trump moved into the White House in 2017, top aide Kellyanne Conway kicked off the whole game. During a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d appearance, she was asked about the size of the crowd at the inauguration \u2014 yes, that was an actual news story \u2014 and she said then-press secretary Sean Spicer \u201cgave alternative facts\u201d to dispute claims that there was a paltry crowd.\n\nIn a fantastic twist you couldn\u2019t have made up, \u201cjournalist\u201d Dan Rather blasted Mrs. Conway (yes, the guy who used \u201calternative facts\u201d when he claimed former President George W. Bush never served in the Texas Air National Guard and got booted from his CBS News anchor chair). It\u2019s all gone downhill since then.\n\nNow, \u201cfacts\u201d have become fungible. Every day, both side cite \u201cfacts\u201d \u2014 often diametrically opposed \u201cfacts\u201d \u2014 to support their arguments. Fact-checkers swing into action, with liberal sites backing Democrats\u2019 \u201cfacts\u201d and conservative sites validating Republicans\u2019 \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nAnd both sides are embracing the fact that maybe there aren\u2019t any \u201cfacts\u201d anymore.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a testy hearing in January with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the U.S.-Mexico border, interrupted to declare: \u201cI reject your facts.\u201d\n\nWell, that pretty much ends that debate.\n\nMs. Nielsen, a no-nonsense sort, was having none of it. \u201cThese aren\u2019t my facts,\u201d she fired back. \u201cThese are the facts.\u201d But were they her own \u201cfacts\u201d?\n\nNow, it\u2019s all too late \u2014 everyone is armed with their own \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nEspecially Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She takes to social media daily to decry this or denounce that, often citing \u201cfacts.\u201d Last week, she said that \u201cthere is a potential that a lot of diseases could, um, escape these melted glaciers, things that were frozen for thousands of years, and that they\u2019re going to get into our water.\u201d She must\u2019ve read an article, so now, clearly, she\u2019s an expert.\n\nThe 29-year-old former bartender also said mosquitoes are \u201cstarting to fly further north that carry diseases like malaria, and, um, a whole slew of other things,\u201d so, boom, another \u201cfact.\u201d\n\nAOC embodies the new flexible definition of \u201cfact,\u201d lamenting to The Washington Post that \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.\u201d\n\nThen, as always, there\u2019s former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, for whom \u201cfacts\u201d are whatever he says they are.\n\nAt the Iowa State Fair last month, the 2020 Democratic front-runner declared to a crowd of supporters: \u201cWe choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden actually bailed out of his first run for the White House in 1988 after it was revealed that he had plagiarized parts of his own life story from a British politician. \u201cMy intent was not to deceive anyone,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote at the time. \u201cFor if it were, I would not have been so blatant.\u201d\n\nThe 76-year-old is at it again, this time after telling a story last month about how a four-star general asked him to travel to Afghanistan to award a Silver Star to a Navy captain who saved a fellow soldier. It was a great tale, \u201cexcept almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect,\u201d The Post wrote.\n\nMr. Biden has been defending himself for a week for conflating the stories of three different soldiers into one anecdote, and on Monday said he wasn\u2019t trying to \u201cmislead anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetails matter in terms of whether you\u2019re trying to mislead people. And I wasn\u2019t trying to mislead anybody,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters in Iowa at a Labor Day picnic. \u201cMy point is, I was there.\u201d\n\nThen he went further on Tuesday, saying \u201cthe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making.\u201d\n\nSnopes, a liberal fact-checking site, backed Mr. Biden, saying his \u201cstory is not \u2018false,\u2019 as was widely reported, because his underlying recollection of pinning a medal on a grieving soldier who did not want the medal is based on a real occurrence.\u201d Huh?\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s Mr. Trump. \u201cAs of Aug. 5, his 928th day in office, he had made 12,019 false or misleading claims,\u201d according to The Post. Even if the liberal paper is only half right, that\u2019s a lot of falsities.\n\nSo, forget facts. Politicians from both sides are telling you they don\u2019t exist any more.\n\nBut luckily, you know better. \u201cFacts\u201d are real and they still exist. They\u2019re hard to find and harder to validate, but that\u2019ll be every American\u2019s job this election season as they sift through the claims from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd always remember, you\u2019re entitled to your own opinion, but not your own \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
