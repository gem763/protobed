Renewals, however will be on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cWe believe insurers have an important role to play in mitigating climate risk and transitioning to a low-carbon economy,\u201d said Axis President and CEO Albert Benchimol in a release. For oil sands production, oil is forced from sand at intense temperatures, using water and natural gas to separate out the extremely thick bitumen. Impure and too viscous to flow, it goes through an \u201cupgrading\u201d process before traveling via pipeline to an oil refinery.\n\n\u201cThis policy is in line with our broader strategies such as reducing investments in lines that do not align with our long-term approach; investing in growth areas, such as renewable energy insurance, where we are a top five global player; and growing our corporate citizenship program, a core focus of which is creating a positive environmental impact,\u201d Benchimol said.\n\nThe Unfriend Coal campaign said in a report last year that global losses tied to coal hit $337 billion in 2017, including insured losses of $144 billion.\n\n\u201cWhile Axis\u2019s policy is a good step, it must eliminate the geographic loophole in its policy and stop insuring new coal projects everywhere today, especially in Southeast Asia where there are hundreds of proposed power plants. We call on insurers around the globe to step up and improve upon Axis\u2019s policy,\u201d said Brett Fleishman, head of global finance campaigns at advocacy group 350.org, in a tweet from Insure Our Future campaign, a consortium of activist groups.\n\nThe Bermuda-based insurer\u2019s policy shift aligns with that of competitor Chubb Ltd CB, -0.36% , which in July became the first U.S. insurer to pledge to phase out its coal investments and insurance policies, saying then it will no longer sell new insurance policies to or invest in companies that make more than 30% of their revenue from coal mining. The company said for existing coal plants, insurance coverage for risks that exceed the 30% threshold will be phased out by 2022, and for utilities beginning in 2022.\n\nAxis shares are down 2.6% over the past month, though up more than 22% in the year to date. Chubb shares are down 2.9% over the past month and up nearly 20% so far in 2019.\n\nGermany\u2019s Allianz and Italy\u2019s Generali also pulled back some underwriting for coal companies in 2018, while the French firm Axa tightened its policy further, the Guardian reported. Lloyd's of London agreed to exclude coal from its investment strategy beginning in April 2018. Reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re said last year they were limiting their underwriting for coal.\n\nClimate activists at nonprofit RAN have called out other insurers including privately held Liberty Mutual for dropping coverage of corporate clients facing increased climate-linked risk while keeping up their own investment in fossil fuels and insuring coal and oil sands projects.\n\nThe Insure Our Future campaign highlighted the move\u2019s potential significance beyond broad climate goals. It\u2019s seen as at least a small victory for the First Nations Native American groups that have been fighting the oil sands industry for indigenous land rights.", "description": "Axis Capital joins Chubb in giving up profit potential from coal and oil sands, a step it says supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK354_Coal_M_ZG_20180605142417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
