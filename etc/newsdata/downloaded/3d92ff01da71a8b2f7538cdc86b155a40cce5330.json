In the process, the world's largest brewer expects to raise about $5 billion, making it the second largest public offering this year after Uber's $8.1 billion IPO in May, according to Dealogic.\n\nThe amount was at the low end of its original proposed price range of between 27 and 30 Hong Kong dollars ($3.44 to $3.83) a share, but the company tapped into an option that allowed it to increase the offering, issuing about 189 million additional shares for a total of just over 1.45 billion shares.\n\nAB InBev had originally planned to make its Hong Kong listing the biggest of the year, with the goal of raising $9.8 billion . But it scrapped that plan in July, citing market conditions, before resurrecting the IPO earlier this month.\n\nBudweiser APAC's IPO is a big win for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The bourse has been battered by a months-long political crisis, the ongoing US-China trade war and slowing consumption in China. The Hang Seng Index has fallen nearly 8% over the last three months.\n\nRead More", "description": "Anheuser-Busch InBev is set to pull off the world's second largest IPO of 2019.", "authors": ["Sherisse Pham", "Laura He", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924015505-ab-inbev-asia-ipo-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
