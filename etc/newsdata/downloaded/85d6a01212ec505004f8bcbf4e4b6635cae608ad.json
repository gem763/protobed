But his performance that day showed the Springboks towering back row trio of Pieter Steph du Toit, Duane Vermuelen and Siya Kolisi can be undermined.\n\nWith Justin Tipuric and Aaron Wainwright already among the players of the tournament, Wales will be seeking to achieve maximum breakdown disruption once again.\n\nDefend like demons\n\nSouth Africa bashed the brilliance out of Japan in the quarter final with a thunderous defensive effort which saw their rush defence teetering on the edge, and often across, the off-side line. Their line speed denied Japan\u2019s talented three-quarters breathing space and suffocated the life out of the host nation.\n\nIf there is one team in the tournament who can match the Springboks power game in defence on it is Wales. Shaun Edwards has forged his reputation on building defensive structures and, although porous at times on their way to the semi-final, including leaking two early tries against France in the quarter final, Wales have the wherewithal to use their defence as a means of attack on Sunday.\n\nFit again Jonathan Davies, who missed the quarter final with a knee injury, will be key to Wales\u2019 chances both in attack and defence.\n\nSilence Springbok wonder wings (and bombard Le Roux)\n\nWhen South Africa\u2019s wonderfully fleet-footed winger Cheslin Kolbe was ruled out of contention on Thursday, Wales fans with short memories may have thought their rivals had lost their attacking threat.\n\nBut Kolbe\u2019s replacement S\u2019bu Nkosi is a more than adequate replacement with the potential to be one of the most potent finishers on the planet. With eight tries in 10 Tests the 23-year-old Nkosi has already proved he can cut it on the international stage and his partnership with Makozole Mapimpi may be raw, but what it lacks in experience, it makes up for in pace, power and finishing potency.\n\nFollowing his superb quarter-final brace, Mapimpi now has 13 tries in 12 Tests and Wales more experienced wing duo George North and Josh Adams will have their work cut out on Sunday.\n\nWith Springbok full back Willie Le Roux failing to impress so far in the tournament, Wales may be best served targeting the most experienced of South Africa\u2019s back three.\n\nKeep a lid on it (discipline)\n\nBoth sides can consider themselves fortunate not to have seen a man sent off in the quarter final. Springbok prop Tendai Mtawarira escaped with a yellow card for a tip tackle against Japan while Wales replacement Ross Moriarty admitted he feared the worst when his forearm clattered Gael Fickou across the chin just minutes after coming on against France.\n\nWith a record number of red cards having been shown so far in the tournament, and a World Rugby clampdown on high tackles in full effect, both sides will need to keep a lid on their emotions and ensure perfect tackling technique to avoid a repeat of Sam Warburton\u2019s match defining red card at the same stage in 2011.\n\nRoll back the years, Leigh\n\nWith four wins from four against the Springboks in recent times there is no reason Wales can\u2019t continue their winning run to reach what would be the nation\u2019s first ever World Cup final.\n\nThe loss of full back Williams is undeniably a significant blow but his replacement Leigh Halfpenny has been a magnificent servant for Wales down the years and is more than capable of stepping up when duty calls.\n\nHalfpenny appears to have overcome the concussion problems which dogged him last season and the 30-year-old will be hoping his 85th Wales cap proves to be among his most fruitful.", "description": "As\u00a0injuries have mounted for Warren Gatland\u2019s men in an unwanted repeat of their 2015 World Cup campaign, the mood of optimism for Welsh\u00a0supporters has begun to ebb away somewhat.", "authors": ["Sam Peters"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/15/wales-vs-south-africa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
