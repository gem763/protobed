He hit it opposite-field off possible AL Cy Young winner Gerrit Cole and it landed on the train tracks at Minute Maid Park.\n\nAnd there was the record-book stuff. Three hits and three RBIs in his first World Series game. Only nine players had ever done that \u2014 and only one, Andruw Jones, was younger than Soto when he did.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat was great, but it wasn\u2019t *the* most impressive to Nationals hitting coach Kevin Long.\n\nFor that, let\u2019s rewind to the fifth inning. There were two runners on. Soto\u2019s homer in the previous inning had tied the game after the Astros jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first.\n\nSoto was in the box again against Cole \u2014 a guy who hadn\u2019t lost a game since May 22; and who had only allowed one postseason run before Game 1 \u2014 and he waited. Soto wanted a fastball. He feasts on them. That\u2019s what he hit to the train tracks. And that\u2019s what Cole was trying to avoid throwing him again.\n\nInstead, he fed Soto breaking balls. A slider taken for a ball. Two knuckle curves taken for balls. Soto still waited. He took a called strike on a slider. He took a rip \u2014 and swung and missed on a changeup.\n\nAnd then, his sixth pitch into the at-bat, he saw yet another slider and hit it the other way, clanking off the scoreboard in left field, bringing home two runs and giving the Nats a 5-2 lead that would eventually become a 5-4 win.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t see one fastball that at-bat,\u201d Long says of Soto. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare that a 20-year-old kid in a situation like that won\u2019t see one fastball from a guy who throws 97. He was able to stay back, find a good pitch and drive it off the left-field wall.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Long said with a pause, \u201cis impressive.\u201d\n\nYoung Nats star Juan Soto had three hits, a homer and stole a base in World Series Game 1. (Rob Tringali/Getty Images)\n\nThis is what baseball is about, after all. Adjustments and tweaks. Making something out of a moment where a methodical pitcher like Cole doesn\u2019t want to give you anything to hit. How do you react if you\u2019re a 20-year-old on the biggest stage of your life? With that kind of patience? With that amount of poise?\n\nA lot of young players come into the league and get by on raw talent. It\u2019s when they have to make an adjustment \u2014 when a pitcher or an opposing team learns their tendencies \u2014 the real challenge comes. That Soto hasn\u2019t been figured out yet is a testament to just how good of a hitter he is. That he did this in his first World Series game and in his franchise\u2019s first World Series game is nothing short of remarkable.\n\n\u201cClearly this is not too big a stage for him,\u201d said Houston Astros manager A.J. Hinch.\n\n\u201cIt felt like he was there before,\u201d said Asdrubal Cabrera, the 33-year-old infielder.\n\nHistory would tell you that not many people have been where Soto was on Tuesday night.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s now the fourth-youngest player to homer in the World Series. Only Miguel Cabrera, Mickey Mantle and Andruw Jones were younger. That\u2019s quite a list.\n\n\u2022 He became the youngest player in MLB history to have three RBIs and a stolen base in postseason history. Before Soto, the youngest player to hit a homer and steal a base in a World Series game was Jose Canseco \u2014 who was 24 when he did it.\n\n\u2022 He was the first player since Moises Alou in 1997 to have three hits, hit a homer and steal a base in a World Series game.\n\nSpeaking of 1997 \u2014 are you ready to feel old? \u2014 Soto wasn\u2019t even born yet. He was born in October 1998. (His 21st birthday is Friday, the date of the first home World Series game in Nats history). For context, the San Diego Padres and the New York Yankees had just finished up the 1998 World Series a few days before Soto was born.\n\n\u201cYou can always tell the young guys that come up that can slow the game down,\u201d said Nats first baseman Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cWhat does that mean? It means at any moment, at any time you can take a deep breath and you don't try to do too much and you just stay within yourself. It sounds easy to do, but it's hard to do even in the regular season for a 20-, 21-year-old. To be able to do it on this stage, to be able to execute the plan that he had, he's got a chance to be OK.\u201d\n\nAfter hitting just .188 in the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, without a homer and only collecting three hits, Soto used his time off to re-focus his game. He\u2019d been in the cage, trying to stay back on balls, hit them the other way.\n\nPounce on the fastball when it comes, sure, but don\u2019t get fooled by the other stuff.\n\n\u201cSometimes I just put gum in my mouth,\u201d Soto said about how he stays calm in big moments. \u201cBut most of the time just take a deep breath and focus. It's just the pitcher and me. I forget about everybody around. It's just you and me.\u201d\n\nIt was him and Cole in Game 1. The pitcher nobody had been able to solve this season was bested by the player that might just be baseball\u2019s best young star.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned when he was a 19-year-old at Yankee Stadium,\u201d said Nats GM Mike Rizzo, \u201cthe bright lights don\u2019t seem to affect him. They even make him sharper and more focused.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, that there\u2019s a good chance we still haven\u2019t seen Juan Soto\u2019s most impressive moment in this series. And that should frighten the Astros.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at mikeozstew@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
