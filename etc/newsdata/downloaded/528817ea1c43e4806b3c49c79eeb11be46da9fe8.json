Equifax Plans to Sell More Utility, Phone Records.", "language": "en", "text": "Equifax Inc. EFX 1.15% will soon give consumers the option to let lenders review their electric, phone and cable payment information, the latest move aimed at providing lenders more data to determine whether to approve loan applicants.\n\nEquifax, one of the largest U.S. credit-reporting firms, is partnering with Urjanet Inc., a data aggregator that receives payment information from roughly 6,500 utility, phone and other companies. By around early next year, banks and other lenders will be able to ask consumers if they want to supplement their Equifax credit report with this data.\n\nBanks have spent much of the past decade making loans to ultra-creditworthy borrowers, but that pool is limited. Lenders have been asking Equifax and other credit-reporting and -scoring firms to help them find new borrowers, often by factoring in new data.\n\nSome big banks are already considering consumers\u2019 electric and phone bills when deciding whether to approve them for loans. Other firms are experimenting with more unusual metrics, like whether loan applicants shop at discount stores.\n\nThe Equifax move and other credit-industry changes in large part are aimed at assessing people who have no credit reports or scores\u2014or low scores.\n\nCritics say the changes could make risky consumers appear safer than they actually are. But Equifax says some consumers\u2014such as loan applicants who are new to the U.S. or pay for most expenses with cash\u2014simply don\u2019t have traditional borrowing backgrounds.\n\nEquifax said the purpose of this new data \u201cis not to extend credit universally,\u201d but \u201cto shed light on creditworthy applicants who are currently credit invisible and those with limited credit histories.\u201d The data won\u2019t be added into a consumer\u2019s credit report but will be provided to the lender alongside it.\n\nFor decades, credit-reporting firms like Equifax and Experian PLC have sold to lenders credit reports that mostly comprised consumers\u2019 history of repaying their debts.\n\nBut Experian, for example, said last year it would begin adding utility and cellphone data to its credit reports for certain consumers.\n\nFair Isaac Corp. last year announced a new score that factors in how consumers manage their bank accounts and is intended to reward those who maintain at least a few hundred dollars and don\u2019t overdraw. The company\u2019s widely used FICO scores are calculated based on information in consumers\u2019 credit reports.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you opt to let banks review your utility and phone payments when you\u2019re applying for a loan? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nEach of these developments has given consumers more of a say in what lenders consider when reviewing loan applications.\n\nWith the Equifax move, lenders will be able to ask loan seekers for access to their utility and other payment information. Gas, water and internet bills can also be factored in.\n\nLenders might ask to look at this data in cases where a person\u2019s credit report or score doesn\u2019t exist or isn\u2019t good enough to get approved for a loan.\n\nIf the consumer agrees, lenders will be able to see information such as whether the applicant pays bills on time and in full. The data can include both positive and negative information covering at least 12 months of a consumer\u2019s payment history.\n\nWrite to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com", "description": "Equifax will soon give consumers the option to let lenders review their electric, phone and cable payment information, a move aimed at providing lenders more data to determine whether to approve loan applicants.", "authors": ["Annamaria Andriotis", "Annamaria.Andriotis Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107941/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
