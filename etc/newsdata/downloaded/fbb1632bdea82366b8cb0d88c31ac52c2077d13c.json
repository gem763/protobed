I hate to lose. But I also know what I can do when I play...\n\n\"Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Even though I lost, I can take it as an experience.\"\n\nChardy, roared on by the home crowd in the French capital, saved nine break points in a dramatic deciding set.\n\n\"Jeremy played very well, but it's a shame because I had my chances,\" added Medvedev, who is the only current player other than the 'big four' of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to have made six consecutive ATP finals.\n\n\"The difference was that he was able to take the opportunities that came his way and I wasn't.\"\n\nMedvedev's run of finals dated back to July, during which he had claimed the Cincinnati and Shanghai Masters titles and lost an epic US Open championship match to Rafael Nadal.\n\nIn New York, he was the first Russian man to reach a Grand Slam final since Marat Safin at the 2005 Australian Open and he has won four ATP tournaments in 2019 in total.\n\nMedvedev will next head to London for his maiden appearance at the ATP Tour Finals next month, where he is hoping to emulate last year's champion and fellow youngster Alexander Zverev.\n\n\"Now I have more time to prepare for the Tour Finals. It really is a dream for me to be going there.\n\n\"It's a tournament where anything can happen, Zverev showed that there last year. It's going to be a good experience.\"\n\nIt is the first time that Chardy has reached the third round at Bercy, having already come through two matches of qualifying and a first-round tie with Sam Querrey.\n\n\"To win against a guy like him (Medvedev) is a great feeling,\" said the 32-year-old. \"At the end there everything was shaking, but I had nothing to lose.\"\n\nChardy will next play a last-16 clash against either 15th seed John Isner or Chile's Cristian Garin.\n\nResults from the second day of the ATP Paris Masters on Tuesday (x denotes seeding):\n\nSecond round\n\n\n\nJeremy Chardy (FRA) bt Daniil Medvedev (RUS x4) 4-6, 6-2, 6-4\n\nAlexander Zverev (GER x6) bt Fernando Verdasco (ESP) 6-1, 6-3\n\nRadu Albot (MDA) bt Andreas Seppi (ITA) 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (8/6)\n\nJan-Lennard Struff (GER) bt Karen Khachanov (RUS x8) 7-6 (7/5), 3-6, 7-5\n\nFirst round\n\n\n\nCorentin Moutet (FRA) bt Dusan Lajovic (SRB) 6-4, 1-6, 6-3\n\nKyle Edmund (GBR) bt Ricardas Berankis (LTU) 6-4, 6-3\n\nAlex de Minaur (AUS) bt Laslo Djere (SRB) 6-1, 6-4\n\nTaylor Fritz (USA) bt Frances Tiafoe (USA) 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 6-4\n\nGrigor Dimitrov (BUL) bt Ugo Humbert (FRA) 4-6, 6-1, 6-2\n\nDenis Shapovalov (CAN) bt Gilles Simon (FRA) 2-2 - retired", "description": "Russian world No 4 Daniil Medvedev has suffered a shock second round defeat by French world No 65 Jeremy Chardy at the Paris Masters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7913/01f5ab631173402f8e7cbf0cd98253d7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
