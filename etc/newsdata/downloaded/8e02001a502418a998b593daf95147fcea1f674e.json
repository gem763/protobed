My friends and my family wanted me to perform, I was able to bring home a medal for my country. I just wanted to go there and make our country proud.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian slammed into the Bahamas on Sept. 1 as a Category 5 storm, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record to hit land, causing widespread devastation and killing at least 50 people.\n\nGardiner is from Abaco, one of the worst affected islands.\n\n\u201cEverybody was evacuated, my house was damaged but not destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roof is still standing.\u201d\n\nHe said that people had thrown a watch party in Nassau, where parts of the city are still without power, to follow the race on television.\n\nBahamas\u2019 preparations for the championships have also been hit by wrangling between the athletics federation (BAAA) and the country\u2019s Ministry for Youth, Sports and Culture over funding. At one point, the BAAA feared it might not be able to send a full team to Doha, although eventually it did.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about that as I train in the U.S.,\u201d said Gardiner. \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying too much attention.\u201d\n\nAlthough Doha\u2019s Khalifa stadium was full for the evening\u2019s athletics events, few people appeared to pay attention to the 400m as it took place minutes after local favourite Mutaz Barshim won the high jump for host nation Qatar.\n\nThe public address system broke during the race and the stadium was strangely quiet as Gardiner celebrated his win.\n\nKerley was fastest out of the blocks but Gardiner closed the gap, found another gear around the second bend and accelerated away to finish 0.67 seconds ahead of Zambrano.\n\n\u201cComing around the bend, I thought I\u2019ve got to make a move now or it\u2019s going to be too late,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\n\u201cI hit it at the right time and I managed to just keep my technique and hold on for dear life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling ever right now,\u201d added Gardiner. \u201cI wanted to be a world champion and here I am now.\u201d", "description": "Bahamian Steven Gardiner powered to victory in the 400 metres at the world championships on Friday, one month after he was personally affected by the hurricane which devastated his country.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437147207&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931JA", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
