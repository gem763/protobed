But the good thing about football is you can bounce back in any game.\n\n\u2018They might think this is the best occasion to bounce back from it but we know that. We want to go out and fight for every metre on the pitch and try and take the three points back to Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s massive, but it\u2019s more massive for the fans. I think all of the Champions League games are as big as this.\n\n\u2018The whole atmosphere and leading to the actual game is bigger than some other games but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the biggest of the season.\n\n\u2018The big ones are the Champions League and the ones that are hopefully going to win us the Premier League title.\u2019\n\nLiverpool have won eight successive games this season and will equal the Premier League record for the most consecutive wins if they beat Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nMORE: Martin Keown names his Man Utd and Liverpool combined XI after Jurgen Klopp rant", "description": "Paul Pogba has posted a fresh injury update on Instagram after being ruled out of Manchester United's Premier League clash against Liverpool.
