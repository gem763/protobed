It\u2019s an odd combination that perhaps not surprisingly doesn\u2019t quite come together.\n\nAs \u201cThe Swallows\u201d opens, we are introduced to Alex Witt, a slacker instructor at Stonebridge, a Vermont boarding school whose headmaster happens to be friends with Alex\u2019s father. Alex is coming to Stonebridge in \u201cdisgrace\u201d: We learn that a lovelorn student at her last school filmed her drunkenly hooking up with a consenting adult and then distributed the video as a form of revenge. (The school later claimed Alex had encouraged the affections of the boy, which seems like a reach. Wouldn\u2019t a prep school be more concerned with burying the issue than manufacturing blame?) Why we learn this 159 pages in is just as mystifying as why it\u2019s treated as a high-profile secret and a source of deep shame \u2014 for a long time, we suspect Alex has a damning, checkered past that she simply doesn\u2019t have.\n\nThere are other problems percolating at Stonebridge: A particularly odious group of boys at the school use an encrypted and highly misogynistic website called the Darkroom, where they post revealing photos of Stonebridge girls and rate sexual encounters. When Alex assigns an anonymous questionnaire in her creative writing class, asking, among other questions \u2014 What do you love? and What do you hate? \u2014 the girls respond that they hate the Darkroom, and the boys say they love it. After one of her classmates is humiliated by the circulation of a nude photo, Gemma Russo, who is frequently described by adults as a rebel and whose dyed hair and punk outfits should make that obvious to even the most clueless of readers, becomes the ringleader of a group of girls determined to take down the Darkroom.\n\nThe polyphonic narrative that ensues has the pacing and urgency of a spy thriller but the middling stakes of a book about a group of privileged kids sending each other cryptic texts. By the time the stakes do achieve life-or-death heights, the novel has forced itself into an awkward stance of violence and suspense that doesn\u2019t entirely fit with its crumpled class notes and teenage self-importance.\n\n[Poking fun at the male ego \u2014 and academia \u2014 in one cheeky little novel]\n\nIn the #MeToo era, the intent of \u201cThe Swallows\u201d is admirable: Trace toxic masculinity back to its roots, the peacocking years of early adolescence, and empower a group of young women to shatter it. And Lutz is mordant in her descriptions of \u201cboys will be boys\u201d sliminess \u2014 there\u2019s a preppy villain, a pedophilic oaf, a smooth-talking manipulator, an unfunny class clown, and a teacher-cum-writer who enables them all (and whom Lutz expertly uses to skewer male novelists who can only write about their imagined sexual prowess).\n\n\n\nAuthor Lisa Lutz (Morgan Dox)\n\nIt\u2019s in the machinations of the campus cold war itself \u2014 and in her clumsy homage to le Carr\u00e9 \u2014 that Lutz stumbles. More than once in \u201cThe Swallows,\u201d prep school kids sit next to each other and talk facing forward, \u201clike spies\u201d; whether Lutz intended to play this for laughs is up for debate. The book is full of anonymous notes and secret meetings \u2014 some to exchange privileged information, some to preserve social standing, some a combination of both \u2014 that come across as comically self-serious. This is not to say that misogyny in high school and the sexual harassment of adolescent girls aren\u2019t serious issues \u2014 rather, they are intersectional ones, and there is much to be said about power, privilege and cycles of abuse that is skimmed over in favor of spy-versus-spy skulduggery in \u201cThe Swallows.\u201d\n\n[\u2018The Passenger\u2019 review: First a dead husband, then a wife on the run]\n\nWhere the novel truly succeeds is in its implication of adults in the nasty schemes of kids. Lutz ingeniously employs a clueless guidance counselor named Martha Primm as a figurehead of deranged internalized misogyny and the systemic victim-blaming that has plagued institutions of higher learning across the country. Sexual trauma is personified in school librarian Claudine Shepherd, who was educated and abused at Stonebridge and carries on the school\u2019s dark legacy with severe consequences. Even Alex becomes too entangled in her students\u2019 dealings and ends up suffering at the hands of one of the more calculating boys. No one is perfectly innocent in \u201cThe Swallows,\u201d and no one should be.\n\nRebekah Frumkin, author of the novel \u201cThe Comedown,\u201d is a professor of English and creative writing at Southern Illinois University.", "description": "Set at a New England prep school, Lutz\u2019s novel mixes mystery and #MeToo.", "authors": ["Rebekah Frumkin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RL02tWnEWPkG-RVMuGyNPNKeq0E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQ34GKGIDMI6TJHTYCA2CJW6OA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
