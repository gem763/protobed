When forced to spar with critical news anchors, their lies become transparent and diluted. In his recent appearances, Giuliani has been a shvitzing, manic mess, plotting out imaginary treacheries and schemes by the president\u2019s political opponents. Graham comes off like the president\u2019s useful idiot. McCarthy looks like he\u2019s in over his head, and Jordan sounds like he should be sized for a straitjacket.\n\nNot even the most strident Trump partisan could come away from Sunday thinking that Stephen Miller was doing anything but bicycling away from Chris Wallace. The Trump gang\u2019s panicky, nonsensical answers were enough to convince a viewer with any horse sense that the president has yet to mount a genuine defense to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. It may be painful for the Biden campaign to watch, but this is valuable news that average news consumer can use to reach independent judgments on who is telling the truth about the Ukraine scandal.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jack Shafer"], "top_image": ""}
