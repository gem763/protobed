I deny the claims. They are false. I believe in the court system where I will clear my name. I will not be making any further comment at this time. \u2014 Trent Brown (@Trent) October 16, 2019\n\nBrown's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, and a Raiders spokesperson did not immediately reply to emails from USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\n\"We attempted to get this matter resolved amicably, and we were unsuccessful,\" Marzette-Sanders' lawyer, Waukeen McCoy, told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nUSA TODAY does not typically identify victims of domestic violence, but McCoy said his client was OK with his client being named because her complaint is a public document.\n\nBrown, who previously played for the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots, signed a four-year, $66-million contract with the Raiders in March. The deal made him the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history.\n\nThe lawsuit could lead to punishment from the NFL if Brown is found to have violated the league's personal conduct policy. NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy told USA TODAY Sports the league would \"review the matter.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, which requests a jury trial and seeks unspecified compensation, Brown and Marzette-Sanders met via Instagram in 2016 and started exclusively dating in March 2017. Throughout their relationship, the lawsuit alleges, Brown exhibited \"a pattern and practice of committing domestic violence\" against Marzette-Sanders.\n\nThe lawsuit references several incidents to this effect, including one in March in which Brown allegedly choked Marzette-Sanders and another in April in which he allegedly slapped her and punched her in the ribs.\n\nMarzette-Sanders also claims that Brown violated what the lawsuit describes as a \"non-marital partnership\" in which Brown allegedly agreed to financially support Marzette-Sanders \"for the rest of their lives\" and she agreed to maintain their home.\n\nMarzette-Sanders claims in the lawsuit that Brown violated this implied agreement in June, when he \"kicked her out of their house\" and refused to financially support her. The lawsuit also makes multiple references to an alleged promise from Brown that he would marry her.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "A woman identifying herself as the mother of Trent Brown's child filed a civil lawsuit Tuesday accusing the Raiders OT of domestic violence.", "authors": ["Tom Schad", "Published A.M.
