The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign student and San Diego native had been coming to Comic-Con for years, but others in her party were usually the ones to camp out. This year, it was her turn.\n\nShe woke up at 5:30 a.m. and knew she\u2019d have a 12-hour day of waiting in line and sitting in Hall H. But it\u2019d all be worth it. She\u2019d be there for the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d panel on the series\u2019 final season.\n\nThe waiting paid off. She was fourth in line for the panel\u2019s Q&A portion. Typically, the first five to seven people get to pose a question. She was right in the mix to ask the cast of the HBO show who\u2019d they pick for the Iron Throne if it weren\u2019t Bran \u2014 her way of asking about the show\u2019s writing without actually asking about the writing.\n\nComic-Con personnel were screening questions, as always, but soon enough Floeter noticed something was off.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018We want this to be positive,\u2019 which I\u2019ve never heard them say,\u201d Floeter told HuffPost.\n\nShe had been to plenty of panels before, and questions weren\u2019t necessarily all warm and fuzzy. Now, Floeter said some people in line had to change what they wanted to ask. Anything about the writing seemed to be out. And even stranger, costumes were getting censored, too. A Daenerys Targaryen cosplayer had to set aside a Starbucks cup. A Night King cosplayer had to remove a prop dagger sticking out of his gut that had \u201cStar Wars\u201d written on it.\n\nFloeter had never seen this before. This was Comic-Con. Attendees were supposed to be able to dress how they wanted.\n\n\u201cThere were no bad words written, nothing offensive \u2014 well, offensive in my mind. But apparently, it would\u2019ve been offensive to the actors or HBO,\u201d Floeter said. Comic-Con did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nHuffPost A Night King cosplayer with a dagger saying \u201cStar Wars\u201d on the side at Comic-Con. Fans had accused the showrunners of rushing the final season to start writing new \u201cStar Wars\u201d films for Disney.\n\nThe panel was off to a weird start, to say the least \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected.\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is perhaps the most culturally defining television phenomenon of the last decade. In an age where streaming continually fractures audiences, the series seemingly rode the rising tide of social media to become the last vestige of communal watching and appointment TV as we know it. It changed the landscape, as seen in everything from continually ballooning TV budgets to the glut of fantasy stories now being tirelessly mined in search of the next \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nBut Season 8, which ended the show\u2019s near-decade on air in May, wasn\u2019t like the others.\n\nYes, the season received a historic amount of accolades: 32 Emmy nominations in 2019, which led to 12 wins including the coveted Best Drama. It also brought in a record-breaking amount of viewers and featured the most-tweeted-about episode of scripted television ever. However, the main storyline that emerges when looking back was the backlash. The hate wasn\u2019t universal, but it was palpable.\n\nThroughout Season 8, the citizens of Twitter cycled through a laundry list of complaints: the episodes were too dark, the White Walkers were gone too quickly, Arya killed the Night King just to \u201cavoid the expected,\u201d Daenerys \u201ckind of forgot\u201d about Euron\u2019s fleet. Cersei didn\u2019t get to do anything. The coffee cup left in the background was proof the series was rushed; the water bottles were too. From Jaime going back to Cersei to Daenerys scorching King\u2019s Landing on a whim, character arcs were thrown out the window faster than Bran in the pilot episode.\n\nUp until the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Comic-Con panel, that pushback had basically lived online through tweets, viral petitions, uncharacteristically low ratings on review sites, think pieces and articles about everything the season got wrong. But on a July day at Comic-Con, there were around 6,500 fans in one room all eagerly awaiting answers. And everyone seemed a bit on edge.\n\nAhead of the panel, Eddie Ibrahim, director of Comic-Con programming, made an impassioned speech to the audience. Quick translation: \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mean.\u201d There were groans. There was applause. When the actors arrived, they were met with roars from the crowd; Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister), Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth), Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm), John Bradley (Samwell Tarly), Conleth Hill (Varys), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran Stark) were all there. They lifted coffee cups from the table, poking fun at the viral moment from the final season. But some of the smiles and laughs from the cast seemed trepidatious, like they were half-expecting the crowd to all of a sudden turn and start calling for Ned Stark\u2019s head.\n\nIn the end, Ibrahim\u2019s lecture, the costume policing, any nerves \u2014 it was all much ado about nothing.\n\nJeff Kravitz via Getty Images Maisie Williams, Jacob Anderson, and Liam Cunningham at \u201cGame Of Thrones\u201d Comic Con 2019. (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for HBO)\n\nAny backlash was mostly pushed aside. The moderator\u2019s line of questioning went on so long that the fan Q&A was cut altogether. Hill chalked up Season 8 criticism to a \u201cmedia-led hate campaign,\u201d and no one said otherwise.\n\nWhat was everyone really expecting though? The subjects of all the fan ire weren\u2019t even there.\n\nWhen it was originally announced in June that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss were set to appear at the panel, fans had debated a question online: should they boo or simply laugh? The showrunners\u2019 inclusion seemed to prompt an organized effort to disrupt the event. Perhaps in the least-shocking twist of Season 8, the pair dropped out days before the event, along with some of the actors who were originally announced to attend. Their reason: \u201cproduction and scheduling conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe fans didn\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t want to acknowledge the backlash,\u201d said Asya Cook, a resident director at UCLA, who waited in line for hours to experience the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d panel. \u201cI would have appreciated if they would have come and just talked about that and have a conversation with the fans. How it\u2019s received now is that they\u2019re scared or they\u2019re running away. I\u2019m not a fan of that.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, fans kept pointing their fingers at the showrunners, but perhaps there were other factors to blame.\n\nIn George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d book series, which started this \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d phenomenon, there\u2019s a prophecy that says \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d When analyzing the response of the fandom to Season 8, it seems the backlash had three driving forces as well: the growing hype that set impossible goals; the strategy of subverting expectations that would never satisfy fans; and the reality that after the show\u2019s storyline passed the books\u2019, it just wasn\u2019t Martin\u2019s story anymore.\n\nThe Growing Hype\n\nBut nothing happened overnight. TV was much simpler when the show premiered in 2011.\n\nFilmMagic via Getty Images Actors John Bradley, Gwendoline Christie, Liam Cunningham and Isaac Hempstead Wright at the \"Game of Thrones\" autograph signing with HBO at San Diego Comic-Con International 2017.\n\nCord-cutters had yet to inherit the Earth, as Netflix wouldn\u2019t unleash binge-watching on the world with the help of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d until two years later. Prestige dramas were about advertising agencies and Claire Danes hunting terrorists. Popular network shows often had variations of \u201cCSI\u201d in the title and reality TV was still ruling the airwaves, with multiple \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d spinoffs premiering in the same year.\n\nHigh fantasy shows were basically nonexistent in primetime TV, but the recipe for success was there. \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter\u201d were examples of book series finding huge followings and big box office numbers.\n\nFor \u201cGoT,\u201d its built-in book fanbase made it one of the most anticipated shows of 2011. It\u2019d take years of buildup and steady growth to become what it did, but with the help of the exploding social media landscape, speculation and a loyal following, there was no ceiling in sight.\n\nNielsen numbers show the series continued to grow by millions of viewers season over season, from 3.3 million average viewership in Season 1 to more than 13.7 million in Season 7. Piracy data monitoring company MUSO reported that by Sept. 3, 2017, Season 7, which had just ended in August of that year, had reached 1 billion illegal downloads and streams.\n\nAnd circumstances were about to raise \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to even higher levels. The eighth season wouldn\u2019t air in 2018. Instead, fans had to wait until 2019 for the final six episodes. It was the first year since 2011 that \u201cGoT\u201d would not air new episodes. The layover felt longer than the Long Night in Old Nan\u2019s stories, a time when the sun hides for years and children are born, live and die all in darkness. There were 595 days between seasons.\n\nThe growing hype, coupled with the \u201cgestapo\u201d-like levels of security surrounding Season 8, led fans to only hear what HBO wanted them to: The season would have the \u201cbiggest battle ever,\u201d there were \u201c55 night shoots,\u201d actors cried, there were fake scenes and multiple endings. Peter Dinklage, who played Tyrion Lannister, said the final season battle would make \u201cthe Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park.\u201d Emilia Clarke, or Daenerys, now infamously said in one interview, it\u2019d be the \u201cbest season ever.\u201d\n\nEven now, it all sounds pretty awesome. (Fans would later claim seemingly glowing interviews were sarcastic and clearly proof the cast was trying to warn everyone something was wrong, like hostages desperately trying to get a secret message out.)\n\nGame of Thrones cast tried to warn us about Season 8 pic.twitter.com/fa52CedDGM \u2014 Dataracer (@Dataracer117) May 9, 2019\n\nPerhaps there were early signs that expectations should\u2019ve been course corrected. Season 7 was widely criticized for characters time-jumping from one place to the next, and the Season 8 episodes, which were rumored to be six feature-length films, were revealed to be around an hour and 20 minutes max.\n\nBut the hype was unbowed, unbent, unbroken.\n\nThe Season 8 trailer set an HBO record; it was viewed 81 million times across platforms in the first 24 hours after its release. Promo teasers, such as \u201cAftermath\u201d and \u201cCrypts of Winterfell,\u201d seemingly focused on the battle with the White Walkers, both teasing that main characters would not make it through. Anticipation was reaching critical mass.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was dreading it,\u201d said Vanity Fair reporter and \u201cStorm of Spoilers\u201d podcast host Joanna Robinson, reflecting on the final season. \u201cI was like, no way this is going to end well. Honestly, that\u2019s how I felt. No way, only because the pressure was so intense. And everyone\u2019s expectations were so high. And it was too big. I was just like, I don\u2019t know how they land this plane in a way that satisfies people.\u201d\n\nWhatever number of people \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was reaching before, it\u2019s safe to say the final season\u2019s viewership walked behind it ringing the shame bell.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, the final season averaged 15.4 million viewers per episode. MUSO reports the premiere alone was pirated more than 54 million times in just the first 24 hours. While Season 7 averaged more than 621,000 Twitter interactions per episode, according to Nielsen, Season 8 averaged more than 1.5 million. As of a day after the finale, there were 100 million tweets about the show in 2019 alone, according to a Twitter spokesperson.\n\nBy Season 8, the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d speculation train was leaving the station, and media outlets couldn\u2019t jump aboard fast enough, covering anything and everything the fandom could create. Even The New York Times was writing about memes from the show.\n\nThis hype and the write-up-anything-and-everything mentality of media sites also appears to have helped the petition to redo the final season go viral.\n\nDylan D., the author of the infamous petition, didn\u2019t make it with the intention that it would blow up. But after a relatively modest amount of signatures and a Change.org press release, news outlets picked it up, causing it to gain more and more traction. Soon, it had 200,000 signatures, then 800,000. Today, the petition sits at 1.7 million. It has been lauded by Season 8 detractors, criticized by the cast and even officially dismissed by HBO.\n\nSuperfans Elio Garc\u00eda and Linda Antonsson run fansite Westeros.org, and their vast knowledge of the \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d world led to them writing Westeros history book \u201dThe World of Ice and Fire\u201d with Martin himself. They explained the rise in theories, rumors and interest during this downtime somewhat mirrored the rise in Martin\u2019s fandom during the early waits for his books to be published.\n\nWhile \u201dA Game of Thrones\u201d (1996), \u201cA Clash of Kings\u201d (1998) and \u201dA Storm of Swords\u201d (2000) all came out within a few years of each other, \u201dA Feast for Crows\u201d wasn\u2019t released until 2005. \u201cA Dance with Dragons\u201d followed that six years later in 2011. The last two books in the series, \u201dThe Winds of Winter\u201d and \u201dA Dream of Spring,\u201d still don\u2019t have release dates.\n\n\u201cA year between each book, I\u2019m not sure they would have been as popular. It would have been too fast. The momentum wouldn\u2019t have built enough,\u201d Antonsson said. \u201cBut certainly there is a point where the wait means that people go off the reservation, coming up with stranger and stranger theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were trying to figure out how they could wrap it up so quickly. And they were sure that it would be something really amazing,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cThen they wrapped up quickly by wrapping it up quickly.\u201d\n\nSubverting Expectations\n\nEarly on while writing his \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d series, Martin decided he wouldn\u2019t change the ending based on fan guesses, because he had already laid out the clues. He told Sky News in 2014 that changing the story to surprise fans would result in \u201cdisaster.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Season 8 discourse \u2026\n\nWhen the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d showrunners explained in \u201cInside the Episode\u201d videos that Daenerys \u201ckind of forgot\u201d about the Iron Fleet and Arya killed the Night King to \u201cavoid the expected,\u201d it didn\u2019t sit right with people. Fans defending the season continually brought up how the show always \u201csubverts expectations,\u201d and the phrase basically became the mocking House Words of Season 8, inscribed on its tombstone, or at least on its memes.\n\n\u201cArya and the Night King bothers people not because it\u2019s Arya, I think that that\u2019s awesome ... but it felt off because Benioff and Weiss had been specifically leading everyone to believe that Jon was going to be involved somehow,\u201d Kim Renfro, a reporter at Insider and author of the upcoming \u201cThe Unofficial Guide to Game of Thrones,\u201d told HuffPost. \u201cThey thought that it would be a good surprise for it to be Arya. Surprising people in that kind of a manipulated way isn\u2019t going to work all the time.\u201d\n\nIn order to have Arya fit into the storyline, the showrunners took an old line that Melisandre (Carice van Houten) said to the young assassin that she\u2019d shut \u201cbrown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes\u201d and retconned it by having the Red Woman say it again with blue eyes last, making it sound like she had been hinting at Arya killing the blue-eyed Night King the whole time.\n\n\u201cPeople want to feel like they have a handle on the story because of the depth, the details or the subplot that you\u2019re putting in there,\u201d Renfro said. \u201cAnd to not put them in there for the sake of subverting expectations, I think is what kind of cracked the seal of everyone feeling like they were sort of in the weeds now.\u201d\n\nAs an example of the power of the fandom, Benioff and Weiss have recalled multiple times that during their first meeting with Martin, he asked them who Jon Snow\u2019s mother was. The pair said their \u201cshocking\u201d and correct answer \u2014 seemingly that Snow\u2019s mom was Ned Stark\u2019s sister Lyanna \u2014 was the reason Martin let them adapt the series.\n\nIf you had only read Martin\u2019s novels, Lyanna being Jon\u2019s mother was truly a surprising answer. But by the time the pair met with Martin in 2005, fans had been discussing the idea for around a decade. Antonsson recalls seeing the initial discussions of the theory that Lyanna was Jon\u2019s mother, dubbed R+L=J (Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon), in 1997 on the Dragonstone board, the first major \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d community.\n\n\u201cThe books came out at the time when the internet was finally really showing up and communities are forming,\u201d Garc\u00eda told us. \u201cSuddenly, you have this hive mind. It\u2019s not just isolated readers, it\u2019s hundreds and then thousands and now hundreds of thousands all pouring over these books. No writer can really hide everything from these fans there. You\u2019re not smarter than the hive mind of hundreds of thousands.\u201d\n\nPassing the Books\n\nMoving beyond Martin\u2019s books was never the plan for the showrunners; however, as time went on and the novels remained without release dates, it became evident it was inevitable. Now, Benioff and Weiss were forced to create the series essentially based on Martin\u2019s CliffsNotes. He had filled them in on the \u201cbroad strokes\u201d of where the series was going in 2013.\n\nIt was a turning point in the fandom.\n\nAt Comic-Con, Nami, a cosplayer from New Jersey who\u2019s in a master\u2019s program for biology, summed the season up to \u201cbad fanfic.\u201d She was glad there weren\u2019t more seasons, as HBO had said they wanted.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t write like the author and they were not suited to write an entire series. And I think they were offered like two extra seasons for this. And they didn\u2019t take it. And honestly, I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t. Because as much as I think they could have told a better story, I also don\u2019t know that they were capable of it,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring Season 8, members of Free Folk, a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d subreddit, manipulated the Google Search results for \u201cbad writers\u201d to show pictures of Benioff and Weiss; the aforementioned petition was all about getting a new season with \u201ccompetent writers.\u201d\n\nNo one was expecting this severe of a reaction to the final season, but some backlash was always going to happen.\n\nHere is a visual representation of the pacing in Game of Thrones. pic.twitter.com/HObMQHagvr \u2014 Thomas \u2018TomSka\u2019 Ridgewell (@thetomska) August 17, 2017\n\n\u201cI feel like in a way, Benioff and Weiss didn\u2019t stand a chance, especially the second that they overtook Martin\u2019s books,\u201d said Renfro. \u201cI feel that was kind of like the ultimate doom for them just in terms of how fans were going to respond, because it felt like nothing that they would do would wholly satisfy folks, just because everyone felt like it wasn\u2019t Martin\u2019s story.\u201d\n\nUp until Season 5, ostensibly, spoilers weren\u2019t actual spoilers. If you wanted to know what was happening in the story, all you had to do was crack open one of Martin\u2019s books. With the show passing the books in Seasons 5 and 6, book readers and show watchers were all in the same boat, just rowing along like a Season 3 Gendry (Joe Dempsie).\n\nEvents that hadn\u2019t happened in the book \u2014 Sansa\u2019s (Sophie Turner) rape at the hands of Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), the deluge of tragedies that befell Stannis\u2019 (Stephen Dillane) quest for the throne, the time jumps and ill-advised plan to go beyond the Wall to catch a wight \u2014 brought on more and more criticism. In Season 5, Garc\u00eda stopped watching the show altogether.\n\nWithout Martin\u2019s source material as a guide and only six episodes to finish up, the final season felt more like a highlight reel of what happened in Westeros rather than actually seeing the story unfold logically.\n\nFor as much blowback as it got, Season 8 really did try to please fans. It relied heavily \u2014 perhaps too heavily \u2014 on callbacks to early seasons, chasing its old magic without truly catching it. Early years of the show excelled at portraying small, quiet moments, some of which weren\u2019t in the books, such as the Season 2 conversations between Arya and Tywin (Charles Dance). But the final season was about being as big and brash as possible. There\u2019s little room for things like Arya and Sansa reacting to Jon\u2019s (Kit Harington) parentage and Mr. Snow petting his dog in what could\u2019ve been their last meeting ever when you have extended sequences for Jon and Dany\u2019s comical dragon riding date and Cleganebowl.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fandom thing,\u201d Robinson said of Cleganebowl. \u201cYou know, [the showrunners] said in the past, that you don\u2019t listen to fans, but that\u2019s you paying attention to what the fandom wants. And what\u2019s also true is fans shouldn\u2019t write TV.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI do think the pressure, it was too big. Everyone\u2019s expectations are really high. And then I think that ended up sort of seeping into the groundwater and affecting how the final season was constructed too.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s West of Westeros?\n\nAround two months after the series finale \u2014 and a week before fans would be ignored at Comic-Con \u2014 HuffPost walked among the smoldering ashes of Season 8 and found life at \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fan convention Con of Thrones in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nWhile Comic-Con handles hundreds of thousands of fans each year with almost mechanical efficiency, Con of Thrones is more in the 4,000 per day range. It\u2019s a more intimate setting, and many of the panels are fan-created. Here, the question-and-answer segments at each panel were never cut. In fact, they were the main event.\n\nDanielle Del Valle via Getty Images Actors Miltos Yerolemou, Hannah Murray, Jerome Flynn and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau answer questions during an interview for the 2019 Con Of Thrones.\n\n\u201cI think there was a real shock of the anger,\u201d Coster-Waldau said during a fan Q&A panel, explaining the actors had been expecting people to love it. \u201cThat was not what was given, so they were more like, \u2018Huh? What? They don\u2019t like us anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe crowd let out surprised, reassuring objections: \u201cNooooo!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there was a genuine surprise that people didn\u2019t think it was the greatest hour of television ever made,\u201d he said somewhat jokingly about Episode 3 of Season 8. \u201cAnd I think it was a good slice of humble pie if you ask me.\u201d\n\nThe warm reception he was greeted with was enough to make you wonder if the pushback to Season 8 ever actually happened at all. In one panel, a fan said the show saved his life. In another, a fan expressed how the show has taught people so much about themselves.\n\n\u201cI just wish Dan and David could be here to hear this, to understand that people really love the show, that suddenly they\u2019re not the most hated people in the world. I mean, because that\u2019s how they might \u2015 I know how they feel,\u201d Coster-Waldau said in response.\ufeff\n\nJust months out from the Season 8 finale, there are indications that the tide is turning more positively in the show\u2019s favor. Almost unanimously, when HuffPost asked people at Comic-Con and Con of Thrones if they had plans to remain in the fandom, they gave an emphatic answer: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nHuffPost Andy, a stan for Bran at Comic-Con.\n\nMelissa Anelli, founder of Mischief Management, who puts on Con of Thrones each year along with fansite Watchers on the Wall, recalled the early days of creating LeakyCon, the ongoing \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan convention. After the movies were all released, she had thought the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fandom would simmer down. She was wrong.\n\n\u201cLeakyCon is as big or bigger than ever. So [Con of Thrones] is definitely not dying ... they\u2019ve got those prequels coming up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Westeros and \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 world is definitely still living past this barrier.\u201d (The 2020 Con of Thrones was recently announced.)\n\nFollowing the Emmy wins on Sunday, the showrunners were asked about the show\u2019s legacy backstage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really up for us to decide what people feel about it. We hope that they watch it and like it in the future,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe hope it holds up, and there\u2019s really no way to tell how things are going to be perceived in 10 years or in 20 years or even in five years. Because things change so fast and the landscape of television changes so quickly. It\u2019s changing right now as we\u2019re standing here, so it\u2019s so gratifying to have reached this many people.\u201d\n\nSusan Miller AKA Sue the Fury, editor-in-chief of Watchers on the Wall, told HuffPost she believes people will ultimately remember the live tweeting, watching with friends and the relationships they built.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re in this sort of hotbed of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty spicy out there. Still a lot of hot topics going on. But 10 years from now, I think we\u2019re going to look back and be like, \u2018Man, we were really worked up over a TV show.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Despite the fan pushback, the HBO series won Best Drama at the Emmys.
