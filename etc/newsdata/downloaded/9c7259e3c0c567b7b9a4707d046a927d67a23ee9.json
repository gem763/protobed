Where the hell is he? . . . I have an idea for a new T-shirt . . . Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nTrump attacked the press for fact checking the allegations he has leveled against the Bidens noting they are often described as unsubstantiated. \u201cIt\u2019s not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns,\u201d he said after repeating his exaggerated and misleading claims about the former vice president and his family.\n\nTrump, who has fixated on the former vice president as a potential 2020 foe since Biden entered the race in April, is embroiled in an escalating battle with House Democrats as they pursue an impeachment inquiry over Trump pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over what Trump claims were the younger Biden\u2019s corrupt business dealings in the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nDuring the raucous rally \u2014 interrupted frequently by pro-Trump chants, cheers and boos as protesters were hauled out of the arena \u2014 the president ramped up his attacks on Biden and paid scant attention to other potential 2020 Democratic challengers, even as the former vice president has faltered as of late in polling.\n\nBiden \u201cwas never considered smart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he figured out how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s own vice president, Mike Pence, has been criticized for being too obsequious to the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to run against him, to be honest,\u201d Trump said of Biden.\n\nTrump also fixated on the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and predicting that the Democrats\u2019 \u201cbrazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box, the likes of which they have never, ever seen before in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nThat claim comes even though recent polling has indicated that public opinion is turning against Trump. A Fox News poll released Thursday showed that 51 percent of voters want to see Trump impeached and removed from office.\n\nAD\n\nAt the rally, Trump insisted: \u201cPolls are no different than crooked writers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s fire in Minnesota was expected to be trained on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents the Minneapolis district where the rally was held. But he also elicited boos after mentioning Somali refugees more broadly.\n\n\u201cLeaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia,\u201d Trump said, at which point a sizable portion of the crowd booed, \u201cwithout considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.\u201d\n\nMinnesota is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants of any state \u2014 accounting for about 1 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nAD\n\nTrump also mocked Omar, the first Somali-American in Congress. \u201cHow hell did that ever happen?\u201d he said of her election, adding: \u201cCongresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump talked about Omar, images of her in a headscarf flashed on the arena\u2019s screens.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has attacked Omar many times before, including a racist taunt earlier this year that she and three other minority Democratic congresswoman should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d at a July rally, a crowd in North Carolina responded to his attacks by chanting, \u201cSend her back!\u201d\n\nTrump has also raised concerns about refugees on many occasions, dating back to his 2016 campaign, and his administration has sought to limit the number that can enter the United States.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump is embroiled in an escalating battle with House Democrats as they pursue an impeachment inquiry over Trump pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_2xs1Wyfjxz7AsFdcdbMQpLG4ZA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZKS6DNXLZ4I6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
