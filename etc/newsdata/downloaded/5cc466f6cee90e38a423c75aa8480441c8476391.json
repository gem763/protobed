And it\u2019s also to support the Turkish army for our fight in Syria.\u201d\n\nHis town has been hit by mortars since the Turkish offensive began, causing damage but no deaths, although there have been 20 civilian deaths elsewhere inside Turkey from mortar attacks. Turkish-backed Syrian fighters occasionally drive across the border from the battlefield, flashing victory signs and chanting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d - God is Great - from the back of their pick-up trucks.\n\nJust across the border lies the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, which fell to Turkish-backed forces on Sunday, although sporadic fighting has continued and Turkish forces were still firing artillery from Akcakale Tuesday.\n\nNews that Tal Abyad had fallen, announced on state-run media even as shelling continued, led to a flurry of random jubilatory events on the Turkish side of the border. Small convoys of flag-draped cars drove through the dusty streets, horns blaring; gaggles of flag-waving men posed and cheered for television cameras.\n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the joy of this achievement. But this achievement should be known by the whole world,\u201d 60-year-old Abbas Gulenc, a council member for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, said at one such event. He spoke beside a giant poster of Erdogan, who he said \u201cis the real leader of the whole Muslim world and we all love him.\u201d\n\nTurkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria on Oct. 9, two days after President Donald Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the area. Erdogan has said he wants to create a 30-kilometer (20-mile) -deep \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria.\n\nAnkara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate a terrorist organization.\n\nBut the offensive has led to an international outcry, causing tens of thousands to flee their homes and upending alliances in Syria\u2019s eight-year war. Having suddenly lost U.S. support, the Syrian Kurdish fighters have turned to Syrian President Bashar Assad to help them fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion, setting the stage for a potential military confrontation between Turkey and Syria.\n\nFaced with a backlash, Erdogan launched a public relations offensive and blasted his critics, telling the EU he would \u201copen the doors and send you 3.6 million refugees\u201d if his Syria operation was described as an invasion.\n\nThat appears to have had little effect abroad. But at home many have rallied behind their president, and some appear genuinely taken aback by the international opprobrium raining down on Erdogan.\n\n\u201cAlthough Turkey is right to fight against terrorist organizations, European countries and America, all of them are against this operation and against Turkey. Why?\u201d asked Gulenc, in a query often echoed in Akcakale. \u201cDon\u2019t they know that this land is not owned by terrorist organizations? It\u2019s the land of Syria. So don\u2019t these countries know that America is bringing these terrorist organizations to this region for a purpose?\u201d\n\nAll opposition parties, bar the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, have voiced support for the offensive.\n\nCriticism is not tolerated.\n\nLast week, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 121 people had been detained for social media posts critical of the incursion while some 500 people were under investigation for posts characterizing Turkey as an \u201cinvading\u201d force and \u201cinsulting\u201d the operation under Turkey\u2019s broad anti-terrorism laws.\n\nThere were dissenting voices within the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, which many believe was forced to voice support to avoid being accused of having terrorist sympathies by Erdogan\u2019s ruling party. On Monday, authorities opened an investigation against CHP legislator Sezgin Tanrikulu over a series of critical tweets.\n\n\u201cWhile Turkey could have solved the Kurdish (issue) through dialogue, the government dragged Turkey to the swamp,\u201d Tanrikulu said. \u201cWar is death, war is pain, war is bloodshed.\u201d\n\nThere was also a backlash against Mustafa Akinci, president of the self-declared Turkish state in the ethnically divided island of Cyprus, who said although Turkey\u2019s offensive is named Operation Peace Spring, \u201cwhat is being spilled is not water, it is blood.\u201d Erdogan was furious, saying Akinci \u201cshould know his place\u201d and reminding the Cypriot politician he is in office \u201cthanks to Turkey.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said there was widespread support for the operation.\n\n\u201cOur people\u2019s support is a source of motivation for us,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nSuzan Fraser in Ankara contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "National soccer team players give military salutes during international matches, Turkish flags flutter from balconies and storefronts, songs extolling the glory days of the Ottoman Empire blare from a border town's loudspeakers, punctuated by the occasional boom of outgoing artillery.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Elena Becatoros"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/turkey_syria_patriotism_98019_c0-288-4547-2940_s1200x700.jpg?6cf3c61e386ac1092aa73d40977defd0945b69e3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
