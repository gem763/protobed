In an act that is drowning in a lack of self-awareness, it has been revealed that Mr. Romney has been operating a Twitter account under a pseudonym since 2011.\n\nWe would have learned about this sooner had legacy media been at all curious or capable of doing a basic investigation into the man, but no. Mr. Romney is their anti-Trump; he\u2019s the sort of Republican that Democrats like \u2014 a willing passenger on the swamp express, so no need to look closer lest you actually find something.\n\nWhen Mr. Romney admitted to having the anonymous Twitter account in a recent interview with The Atlantic after managing to keep it secret for eight years, one thinks he wanted to be exposed believing, incorrectly, it would be seen as somehow cool or hip.\n\nThe famously disconnected Romney was wrong. It\u2019s neither.\n\nInstead, the account is the Twitter equivalent of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s pathetic \u201cplease clap\u201d moment to an uninterested audience during one of his presidential campaign stops in 2016. His plea for praise to the bored and unimpressed audience became symbolic of a man who was unable to generate enthusiasm from his own base.\n\nMr. Romney named his secret account \u201cPierre Delecto.\u201d I would have had a great deal more respect for him if he was just a tiny bit more self-aware and chose \u201cPepe Lepew\u201d instead. After all, the name is a play on Mr. Romney\u2019s knowledge of French having spent over two years in France on a Mormon mission in the 1960s. \u201cDelecto\u201d is Latin for \u201cdelight.\u201d If only Willard had as much regard for the American electorate as he does for himself.\n\nMr. Romney explained to both The Atlantic and a group of journalists in the hallway in the Senate that he used the account to keep an eye on the political conversation.\n\n\u201cI like what I like. \u2026 I follow a lot of people as a way to keep up with the news and I, you know, followed 600 or some odd people, 700. Just a way to have a private account to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d said the former presidential candidate.\n\nLooking at how he used the account belies that. He promoted and defended himself, and even more pathetically, he \u201cliked\u201d tweets that praised him.\n\nJohn Nolte at Breitbart noted, \u201cHe\u2019s so insecure and hungry for approval, but so cowardly and craven in not wanting to correct or criticize his abusers in the media directly, that he cowers in their mentions under the cloak of just another anonymous nobody. Why doesn\u2019t Romney use his verified Twitter account to makes these points, to set the record straight? Why doesn\u2019t he reach out directly to those in the media when he wants something corrected?\u201d\n\nWhy not indeed. Yes, this is what 12-year-old children do. The moment the account was exposed, Mr. Romney locked it down, making its content unavailable to the public.\n\nIn other words, he scooted into a kitchen cabinet to hide. Not having a spine makes it much easier to squeeze yourself into secret places.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints people have about President Trump is his style. The president tweets and speaks in a transparent and honest manner, all under his own name. He confronts situations transparently and head-on. He does so because he\u2019s not afraid of other people; he\u2019s not unsure about what he believes; he does not say things to placate or to curry favor. And he is sure that this country and its people deserve strong leadership and the truth.\n\nThis is another crime that Mr. Trump has committed for which the Pierres of the world hate him \u2014 being able to be himself and to own it; to have enough regard for the American people that he\u2019s honest with them; to be exactly the same person in a general election as he is during a primary season. This is very bad news for people like Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Joe Biden and so many others in the rotted establishment.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Romney is losing Utah, where a new UtahPolicy.com poll shows his approval rating is now underwater, \u201cRomney\u2019s approval rate among \u2018strong Republicans\u2019 is actually underwater: Only 40 percent approve of him, while 59 percent disapprove of him. That is rather amazing. \u2026 Romney\u2019s problem with the reddest of his party is no doubt because he has been critical of Trump \u2026\u201d\n\nAbout this rather striking development, Hotair.com says, \u201cThis is a fantastic poll for Trump if only because it shows other Republicans in the Senate that not even Mitt Romney is immune from a backlash in Utah for criticizing him. If the first Mormon presidential nominee can be underwater in a state where Mormons are 60+ percent of the population simply because he\u2019s anti-Trump, God help any GOP senator whose political position isn\u2019t as secure in their own home state.\u201d\n\nThe Romney First strategy isn\u2019t going over very well in Utah, or elsewhere among Republicans and conservatives. Maybe Pierre is a Democrat, which would explain so much.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women\u2019s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk-show host.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
