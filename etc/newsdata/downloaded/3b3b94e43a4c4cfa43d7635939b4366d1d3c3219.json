But one isotope, tritium, cannot be removed so the water has been stored in a huge tanks which will fill up by 2022.\n\nThere has long been a plan to dump the water in to the Pacific ocean and the Environment Minister Yoshiaki Harada has now said that he supports the plan.\n\nMany scientists say the water would quickly be diluted in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, and that tritium poses a low risk to human and animal health.\n\nBut the BBC's Tokyo Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports that this does not mean the controversial plan will happen.\n\nFishermen's groups are strongly opposed to it and the South Korea government has made it clear if Japan goes ahead it will further damage an already fraught relationship.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency says Japan has to make a decision about what is going to happen to the contaminated water urgently.", "description": "The environment minister says storage space for contaminated water from Fukushima will run out in 2022.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1A57/production/_108734760_waterstorage2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
