REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo\n\nAbout 2,000 km (1,200 miles) to the south in Hong Kong, festivities have been scaled back and the date looms with an air of foreboding in a city wracked by nearly four months of often-violent anti-government protests.\n\nChinese-controlled Hong Kong is on high alert to stamp out any activities that could embarrass Beijing and draw unwanted attention at a time when Xi will seek to project an image of national strength and unity under Communist Party rule.\n\nSome protesters have said they plan to seize the holiday to propel their calls for greater democracy on to the international stage and embarrass Hong Kong\u2019s political masters. Activists plan a mass rally from Victoria Park in the bustling Causeway Bay district to Chater Garden near government headquarters.\n\nIn a recent audio recording obtained by Reuters, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam was heard saying at a closed-door meeting with business people that the government had made \u201cspecial arrangements\u201d for Oct. 1.\n\nHong Kong has already canceled the annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city\u2019s iconic Victoria Harbour, citing public safety concerns.\n\nIn an arrangement similar to that on July 1 for the anniversary of the city\u2019s handover from Britain to China \u2013 when protesters ransacked the legislature - guests attending the traditional flag-raising ceremony have been told they will be moved indoors.\n\nThe change is \u201cto ensure that the flag-raising ceremony can be carried out in a solemn and orderly manner,\u201d the city\u2019s Home Affairs Department told Reuters.\n\nNOTHING TO CHANCE\n\nThere is far less uncertainty around the holiday in Beijing, where security that is tight in ordinary times has been intensified ahead of Oct 1.\n\nOn recent weekends in the Chinese capital, spruced up with red flags and bright landscaping, shops in the city center have been closed, curtains ordered shut and streets closed for rehearsals featuring military vehicles rumbling towards Tiananmen Square and fighter jets screaming across the sky.\n\n\u201cCan you just not have the rehearsals? The roads are closed and the noise has woken me up,\u201d one resident complained on the Chinese social media network Weibo.\n\nBeijing\u2019s anniversary celebrations are expected to involve 100,000 people, fireworks, artistic and athletic performances and displays of cutting edge military hardware.\n\nThe actual parade will be off-limits to much of the public, who will only able to watch on TV.\n\nImages circulating on social media from the rehearsals showed what appeared to be a new spy drone. Defense analysts also speculate that the parade will feature the intercontinental Dongfeng-41 (DF-41) missile.\n\nSome Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which allow internet users to bypass China\u2019s Great Firewall, have seen increasing disruption, some users say on social media, which is often the case ahead of sensitive dates. The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany nightclubs in Beijing have issued notices that they will be shut down until early October, without giving explicit reasons. One club, One Third, said on its social media account that it will be closed temporarily due to an \u201cupgrade.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cWe have minimized disruptions to people, and minimized the burden on local government. We have tried to use the night-time, especially midnight to dawn for our activity,\u201d Tan Min, a senior military official in charge of the preparations, told a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nFor many migrant workers, construction jobs have dried up as building projects come to a temporary halt, some of them said.\n\nOne worker said he has lost up to 16,000 yuan ($2,258), or two months\u2019 income. \u201cIt\u2019s the common people who suffer when the government wants to celebrate,\u201d he said.", "description": "As China prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic on Oct 1, Beijing is on security lockdown ahead of celebrations headlined by President Xi Jinping that will be capped by a massive military parade down its main ceremonial thoroughfare.", "authors": ["Huizhong Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433974100&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P03G", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
