But should the rest of us emulate them?\n\nIn entirely random, but nevertheless heartwarming news, two of Tottenham\u2019s most famous faces, Adele and Skepta, are reportedly dating. The pair were recently spotted enjoying an evening out at the Crystal Maze Live Experience in London, where they locked eyes as Skepta alluringly filled small bowls with sand to release a crystal, and Adele roared, \u201cStart the fans, please!\u201d so loudly that the dome shattered into a thousand pieces \u2026 well, something like that, anyway.\n\nBut is an immersive experience inspired by a 90s TV show really the ideal place for romance? Naturally, I went along \u2013 without a date \u2013 to find out.\n\nMy first impression is that this may have been the hopeless place Rihanna was singing about: the experience is located in perhaps the least amorous part of London, Piccadilly Circus. There may be a statue of Eros in the street, but, on a Tuesday lunchtime at least, it\u2019s 10% buskers, 90% Italian schoolchildren. Inside, though, it seems this could have date potential; no one in my eight-strong group (two of whom, curiously, have never seen the TV show) looks too bad in the trademark red bomber jacket. And, lo and behold, among the team there is a couple on a date: Chris and Eleni, who are celebrating Chris\u2019s birthday.\n\nGetting into the challenges, however, the potential for romance quickly falters. No one looks dignified straddling a massive mechanical rocket while the mazemaster hurls innuendoes at them, not even Chris, who is wearing a black tracksuit and shiny new trainers for the occasion. The puzzle activities offer more time for bonding, although having your date fling abuse at you because you couldn\u2019t decode Blood Diamond from emojis of a syringe and a gemstone would surely be a humiliating experience for anyone.\n\nIn fact, a thread of low-level humiliation runs through the whole Crystal Maze Live Experience, not least when you (me) realise you can\u2019t use a crossbow, do not actually know how a crossbow works and end up lobbing the darts across the room by hand, while your team sigh loudly.\n\nThis is categorically not a first-date experience, so it makes sense that Adele and Skeppy go way back (in a 2016 interview, he said that Adele texted him \u201call the time and keeps me in check\u201d) . In fact, anyone suggesting Crystal Maze Live Experience on a dating app \u2013 instead of \u00a330 worth of \u201csmall plates\u201d at a pub \u2013 is probably far too comfortable with life. But, as an activity for people who know each other well and want to know each other even better, why the hell not? Or, as Eleni succinctly puts it: \u201cIt was either this or couple\u2019s bungee jumping.\u201d", "description": "The two musicians were recently spotted sharing an evening out at the London attraction.
