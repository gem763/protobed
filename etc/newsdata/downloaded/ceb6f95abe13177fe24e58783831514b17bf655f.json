Conermann, a 15-year old high school sophomore among several thousand who marched to the Capitol building in Washington.\n\n\"I want to grow up. I want to have a future,\" Conermann added.\n\nIn New York, where public schools excused students with parental permission, tens of thousands of mostly young people marched through lower Manhattan.\n\n\"Sorry I can't clean my room, I'm busy saving the world,\" one protester's sign declared.\n\nAnd in Paris, teenagers and kids as young as 10 traded classrooms for the streets. Marie-Lou Sahai, 15, skipped school because \"the only way to make people listen is to protest.\"\n\nClimate protesters demonstrate in London, Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. Protesters around the world joined rallies on Friday as a day of worldwide demonstrations calling for action against climate change began ahead of a U.N. summit in New York.

Youth Climate Summit on Saturday and speak at the U.N. Climate Action Summit with global leaders on Monday.\n\n\"They have this opportunity to do something, and they should take that,\" she said. \"And otherwise, they should feel ashamed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story by the Associated Press on Yahoo News >>>\n\nSwedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, center, takes part during the Climate Strike, Friday, Sept. 20, 2019 in New York.
