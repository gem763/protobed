She owed $9.\n\n\u201cI got my cheesy breadsticks and put in my number,\u201d Jefferson said of the incident. \u201cAnd when I was going to check out, the lunch lady didn\u2019t say anything, took away my cheesy breadsticks and sauce, put them over there, and took out bread on cheese from the fridge and put it on my tray.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

She called on the school district to change its policies, which she says places the blame on children for their guardians\u2019 actions.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, he didn\u2019t owe anything. I owed the money, the parents, the school district,\u201d Ms Bailey said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After he was sent home with a note of August 30 citing the $9 dollar debt, she called the school to straighten things out, and thought that the situation was resolved - until her grandson's lunch was taken away on his birthday.\n\n\u201cMy other question is, if they take the food off of your tray, they have to throw it away,\" she said. \"You would take the food off a tray and you can\u2019t reserve it? You\u2019re going to throw it away and not feed the child? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\n\nThe school district issued a statement saying it was \u201clooking into this specific situation\u201d, which Jefferson said made for his worst birthday ever.\n\n\u201cThe lunch programme is complex due to federal requirements,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAs it relates specifically to our policy, students receive multiple means of communication when their accounts become negative. Currently students who are $15 or more in debt are provided a lunch that includes fruit, vegetables, and either a cheese quesadilla or cheese sandwich.\u201d\n\nThis policy, like several others that have come under fire in recent years, including a school\u2019s rule in Rhode Island that meant students in debt would only be served sunflower seed butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch, visibly divides children in lunchrooms between those whose guardians pay and those who do not.\n\nCriticism of the policies call these rules harmful and shaming, and inexcusable to enact on children. Public outrage has pushed many schools, including Green Primary School, to reassess how students are treated.\n\n\u201cIt is important to us that students have positive experiences in the lunchroom and all areas of the school,\u201d the school\u2019s statement concluded. \u201cFor that reason, we will continue to look into our practices and come up with solutions that work for our students and families.\u201d", "description": "A student in Ohio had his school lunch taken away from him on his ninth birthday after his grandmother fell behind in lunch money payments, the latest incidence of a public school\u00a0punishing children for not being able to pay for food.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/17/gettyimages-152470992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
