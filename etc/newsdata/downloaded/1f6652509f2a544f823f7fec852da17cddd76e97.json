Here's what you need to know.\n\nEmail:\n\nThe quickest method for getting in touch with an editor or reporter at Business Insider is by emailing us.\n\nOur newsroom uses Gmail with 2-factor authentication. You can look up a specific reporter or editor email address by going to their author page \u2014 most email addresses are the first letter of the reporter's first name followed by their last name @businessinsider.com. If a reporter uses PGP encryption, which encrypts the contents of your email but leaves record of the sender and recipient, you can find their public PGP key on their author page.\n\nFor the full BI Masthead with links to specific author pages, click here.\n\nNote: It's important to keep in mind that your employer may have access to the contents of your work email. Do not use your work email to send a tip. Depending on the nature of the information, you may also want to consider a more secure option for getting in touch.\n\nSecureDrop:\n\nBusiness Insider is currently in the process of updating our SecureDrop system. This page will be updated when SecureDrop is back online.\n\nMail:\n\nYou can always send tips to Business Insider through the mail.
