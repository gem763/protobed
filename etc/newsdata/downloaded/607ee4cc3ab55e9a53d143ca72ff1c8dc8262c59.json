AMP's chief risk office Pally Bagri resigned shortly thereafter in May 2018.\n\nFormer wealth management boss Paul Sainsbury and head of advice Jack Regan, both of whom underwent intense cross-examination during the royal commission's public hearings, were squeezed out of the business in April 2019 and December 2018 respectively. Neither have re-emerged in roles elsewhere in the financial services industry.\n\nA former National Australia Bank and Macquarie director, Ms Bruce joined AMP Bank as managing director in August 2015, when the company's share price was around six times higher than where it currently stands.\n\nMr De Ferrari said she has been an \"oustanding leader\" who delivered \"double digit earnings growth\" and a \"strong and inclusive culture\".\n\n\"I am confident I am leaving AMP Bank in the hands of a strong team who will continue to drive the success of the business under AMP's new strategy,\" Ms Bruce said.", "description": "AMP has announced it is merging its banking and wealth management units, as the embattled company's post-Hayne transformation strategy takes shape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0597d90ce27e0a366ba0584dd9e2d0c33b36ed42", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
