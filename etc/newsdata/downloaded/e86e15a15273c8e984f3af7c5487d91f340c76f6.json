A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick.

AP\n\nThat change has since followed the centre. After joining Rugby United New York, being left out of the World Cup squad and retiring, he has returned to the Top 14 with Lyon on a short-term contract. But with all these environmental changes, the most notable has come in the bulldozer\u2019s positon on the pitch.\n\nAt first glance, many would think he was part of the pack. Well now, he actually is. Since joining Lyon this summer, he has been played as a No 8.\n\nAlthough Bastareaud could reverse his decision to retire internationally, the streamlined back line could well have been the key reason for the position switch. Minutes haven\u2019t been easy to come by since his move to Lyon but he was able to score on his league debut for the club which came from the No 8 position.\n\nHad he made the switch sooner, former France fly-half, Thomas Castaignede feels it could have saved the Frenchman\u2019s international career. \u201cTo play the modern game you need quick backs and as a No 8, Bastareaud could be even better than Louis Picamoles,\u201d he told RugbyPass earlier this year.\n\nBut the switch wasn\u2019t made early enough, and both France and one of their most destructive weapons have moved on.\n\nInstead, Bastareaud moved to the United States, a nation with a growing appetite for rugby.\n\nDespite a heavy 45-7 loss to England last Thursday, the Eagles are making strides and as a result, so is their national game. Currently 13th in World Rugby\u2019s rankings, above Italy who play in the Six Nations, the States built up good momentum with six wins and two losses this year before the start of the tournament. Beating a then-ranked sixth placed Scotland in June 2018 also showed that the US could mix it with competitive nations, but can they do so consistently?\n\nOf their six wins in 2019, not one has come against a country ranked higher than themselves. Hosts of the World Cup, Japan, who were ranked 11th at the time also beat the Eagles 34-20 in August.\n\nSo, what are they doing to make even bigger strides than they already have done?\n\nIt helps that Major League Rugby is young and still expanding. At its inception, the league was formed of seven teams. As for the upcoming season, there will be twelve teams split into two Western and Eastern Conferences similar to other American sports leagues like the NBA and Major League Soccer.\n\nMLR may also be taking inspiration from a similarly young MLS and the way they have tried to build the popularity of a new league on the continent: by attracting popular imports.\n\nFoden and Bastareaud have been the first stand out players to embrace the challenge and continuing to attract high profile players to the league as rugby itself isn\u2019t that much of a problem.\n\nIn the sevens format, for instance, the States are becoming a force. The end-to-end nature of the game breeds exciting play based on speed which is great for spectators and the many American athletes that turn to that version of the sport.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s been so good that their sevens team have been crowned the USA Sevens Tournament champions two years running and finished 2nd in the World Rugby Series last season.\n\nTranslating this ambition to the 15-a-side game may still take a while, as MLS have shown in football, new leagues won\u2019t explode overnight in America. However, with World Rugby CEO Brett Gosper admitting there is an \u201cexpression of interest\u201d from the United States to host the Rugby World Cup in either 2027 or 2031, this, as well as decent performances in their upcoming World Cup, could accelerate the process.\n\nAt the moment, however, a meeting with a confident France may see them struggle to exit the pool stage, as they have failed to do in each of their seven World Cup appearances to date. But that in no way dims their very bright future.", "description": "France take on the USA in the Rugby World Cup on Wednesday but they\u2019ll be without a famous rampaging centre in their ranks.
