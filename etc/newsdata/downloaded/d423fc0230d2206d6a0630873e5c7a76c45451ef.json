Unai Emery\u2019s side missed the chance to go third in the Premier League table on Monday when they were beaten 1-0 by Sheffield United.\n\nThe loss at Bramall Lane was a fifth in the last 10 away games in the league on a night when Arsenal\u2019s common failings were again on view. The Gunners looked vulnerable from set-pieces and uncomfortable playing out from the back, while at the other end of the pitch top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was largely anonymous and Blades goalkeeper Dean Henderson was only forced to make one real save \u2013 from Xhaka\u2019s 30-yard strike just before half-time.\n\nLys Mousset capitalises on Arsenal failings to boost Sheffield United Read more\n\nThe performance prompted familiar criticism of Arsenal\u2019s mentality, with former Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra \u2013 a studio guest during Sky Sports\u2019 live coverage of the match \u2013 describing the Gunners as \u201cbabies\u201d in a blistering assessment of a team he claimed he used to relish playing against.\n\nXhaka said: \u201cWe have to stop about mental bullshit like this. For me, it is the same whether you play home or away \u2013 you have to win and show big character and a good game and not to always find the same excuse.\u201d\n\nAddressing Evra\u2019s comments, he added: \u201cA lot of people they speak too much. It is not the first time he has spoken something about us. I have a lot of respect for him as he was a great player but you have to be careful what you say. But it is not only him - a lot of people speak a lot of bullshit about us. It\u2019s always the same.\n\n\u201cFor me it is strange as they were in the same situation as us, they were players as well. Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not always good but every week they speak bullshit like this every week.\n\n\u201cI tell you the honest truth, I\u2019m not interested in what people say and speak. We have to speak in our group to improve things and work hard and not listen to these people.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSheffield United\u2019s winning goal came after half an hour when Lys Mousset turned the ball home from close range after Jack O\u2019Connell had headed Oliver Norwood\u2019s corner back across goal.\n\nXhaka said: \u201cI think we did a lot of good things and they had one chance, and it was a goal. But it\u2019s too easy, you shouldn\u2019t lose a game because of a corner or a free-kick. We have to improve but there were some good things as well. In the end if you want to be top four then you have to beat Sheffield.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal\u2019s midfielder Granit Xhaka was irate after the former Manchester United player Patrice Evra described his side as \u2018babies\u2019 in an assessment of their performances on the road", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8521fb171d29c47c8abbb4589f9715d2c224e045/0_231_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6310d0f215ddc49a4c0e52d89b8e39a1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
