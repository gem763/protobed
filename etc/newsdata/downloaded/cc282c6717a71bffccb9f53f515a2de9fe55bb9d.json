The FDA found \u201cno proof of causality, but at a minimum, an association with Juul,\u201d Mitch Zeller, the director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, wrote to Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner at the time. In an interview, Zeller said that the FDA had not been able to confirm that Juul use was associated with the seizures in two of the three initially reported cases, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of their initial report that found 32 cases tied to vapor products over 10 years, some of which referenced JUUL products by the submitter,\u201d a Juul spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Verge. \u201cWhile FDA has not reached out to us about this issue, we will vigilantly monitor for any evidence of potential safety issues and work cooperatively as we continue to combat youth usage and eliminate cigarettes, the number one cause of preventable death in the world.\u201d\n\nOver the next several months, the agency uncovered an additional 32 reports of e-cigarette use that had been linked to seizures between 2010 and 2019. In April, it publicly announced its investigation. Since then, the total number of reports to the FDA associating e-cigarette use with seizures has increased to 127. The FDA continues to investigate reports of seizures through its Safety Reporting Portal.\n\nSeparately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an unknown lung disease that also seems to be associated with e-cigarette use. More than 190 people have the unknown illness. Last week, one person died after being hospitalized with the disease.\n\nYesterday, USA Today published an article pointing the finger at marijuana vapes for the lung disease. Juul is quoted in it. \u201cMany patients were vaping both nicotine and THC,\u201d Juul told USA Today in a statement. \u201cWe also must ensure illegal products, such as counterfeit, copycat, and those that deliver controlled substances, stay out of the market.\u201d", "description": "An ongoing Food and Drug Administration investigation into a possible link between seizures and e-cigarette use was kicked off by three cases allegedly involving Juul use, Bloomberg reported.", "authors": ["Mary Beth Griggs", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vEpxAfJeiemSvZJ8XnI73_ZGs9k=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11634219/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
