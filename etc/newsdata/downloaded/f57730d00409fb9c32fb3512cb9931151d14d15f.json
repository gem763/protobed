Laxalt, former Nevada Attorney General\n\n\u201cAs the former Attorney General of Nevada, I can assure you there is no more qualified person for our Ninth Circuit seat than Lawrence VanDyke. I say this after daily personal interaction with him for many years. He has the experience, the integrity, and the judicial temperament to make him the most outstanding candidate put forward in a generation.\u201d\n\nU.S. Congressman Mark Amodei (NV, 02)\n\n\u201cI have served the people of Nevada for many years, both as a former state legislator and currently as a Member of Congress, representing the 2nd congressional district of Nevada. Lawrence VanDyke is a man of impeccable character with a brilliant legal mind. As our solicitor general, he successfully fought for the rule of law, especially in the protection of our cherished land, water and property rights. Lawrence\u2019s deep commitment and understanding of the needs and the closely held values of the Western states will serve him well as a judge on 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nTim Fox, Montana Attorney General\n\n\u201cI have had the privilege of knowing Lawrence Van Dyke since 2008. I chose him to be Solicitor General of Montana upon my taking office as Montana\u2019s Attorney General in January of 2013. Lawrence demonstrated sound judgment, great skill, and earnestness in the Montana AG\u2019s office, working hard for the people of the state, and I know he has the intelligence, experience, fairness and diligence to be a great addition to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nMark Hutchison, former Nevada Lieutenant Governor\n\n\u201cAs the former Lieutenant Governor of Nevada and a founding partner of a law firm in the Silver State, I enthusiastically support our state\u2019s former solicitor general in his nomination to serve on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Lawrence knows and appreciates our western heritage and values and, more importantly, he knows the law and how to fairly and appropriately apply it. It is my hope that the U.S. Senate will expeditiously confirm Lawrence to the federal bench.\u201d\n\nBob Beauprez, former U.S. Congressman and Head of The Western Way\n\n\u201cWe applaud President Trump for putting forward such an extremely qualified and thoughtful nominee in Lawrence VanDyke to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As an organization that strives to achieve balance between two critically important causes throughout the American West \u2013 environmental conservation and economic prosperity \u2013 The Western Way is charting a new path in defining real solutions that will provide long-term success for both of these causes. And as a former Member of Congress, I know firsthand that true leadership isn\u2019t defined by simply identifying problems, but by advancing and achieving solutions that are thoughtful, sound, and within the scope of the laws of our land. We strongly believe that Mr. VanDyke will adhere to the Constitution, the rule of law, and with his western roots, he\u2019ll serve our nation with a fair mind and a steady hand.\n\nRobert List, former Governor and Attorney General of Nevada\n\n\u201cAs a former Governor and Attorney General of the great State of Nevada, I am proud to lend my full and enthusiastic support for Lawrence VanDyke\u2019s nomination to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Lawrence has an unparalleled appreciation, knowledge, and respect for our Constitution and the rule of law. He is a very humble man; a great family man and he possesses the character and humility one would expect from a true westerner. I applaud President Trump in this selection, and I look forward to Lawrence\u2019s approval by the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nJames Settelmeyer, Nevada State Senate Minority Leader\n\n\u201cLawrence VanDyke was an outstanding Solicitor General in Nevada and he will certainly be a welcomed addition to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. As an elected leader and a lifelong Nevada rancher, I know how critical it is to have judges who will strictly adhere to our Constitution and prevent federal overreach. In Nevada, we have seen multiple attempts by the federal government to improperly seize further control over our water rights, property rights, and our basic fundamental liberties. These actions severely impact our critically-important mining, ranching and agriculture industries. Lawrence has deep respect for our Constitution, and I\u2019m thankful for President Trump nominating him and I look forward to his confirmation and continued service to our nation and to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nJim Wheeler, State of Nevada Assemblyman\n\n\u201cI would like to applaud President Trump for this outstanding selection of Lawrence VanDyke to the 9th Circuit. In his service to Nevada as solicitor general, Lawrence helped defend our state on issues such as protecting our land and water rights, revising the harmful sage grouse land-use plan, his success in fighting the EPA\u2019s Waters of the US rule, and numerous other issues where the federal government was intruding on our Constitutional rights. Nevadans have been craving more balance 9th Circuit with judges who will properly apply the rule of law and adhere to our Constitution, and Lawrence will provide that fair-minded balance.\u201d\n\nPatricia D. Cafferata, Esq., former Special Assistant Attorney General for Law Enforcement, Counties and Municipalities\n\n\u201cLawrence Van Dyke and I worked together in Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt\u2019s office from January 2015 to December 2018. I found him to be among the brightest and hardest working lawyers I\u2019ve worked with during my legal career. He extensively researched the law and followed it. His conclusions were well thought-out and brilliant. His analysis was always thoughtful and in-depth. Lawrence understands the courts, legal processes and procedures. His writing is clear and precise.\n\n\u201cOn my background, I shared with Lawrence membership in the Federalist Society. I was president of the society, when I attended Southwestern School of Law. The rest of my experience includes being elected to the Nevada Assembly (1980), and as Nevada State Treasurer (the first woman elected to constitutional office in Nevada history (1982), and served as district attorney of Lincoln, Lander and Esmeralda counties at different times between 1992 to 2003. I also served as the Executive Director of the Nevada Commission on Ethics and as Chair of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission. Currently, I am a law clerk in the Second Judicial District Court and also served as a law clerk there in 2004-2005, and in the Ninth Judicial District Court 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cI highly recommend Lawrence Van Dyke for appointment to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nMichael Roberson, former Nevada Senate Majority Leader\n\n\u201cLawrence VanDyke served Nevada well as our solicitor general and I am thrilled that President Trump has nominated him to serve on our 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Lawrence has exactly the right temperament, experience and qualifications for this distinguished position on our federal courts. He is a true westerner, a constitutionalist and someone who clearly appreciates our heritage in Nevada and throughout the American West. I wholeheartedly support his nomination and I know Lawrence will be an outstanding and needed addition to the 9th Circuit.\u201d\n\nChuck Allen, former Washoe County Sheriff\n\n\u201cAs the former elected sheriff of Washoe County, I had the great pleasure serving the residents of northern Nevada at the same time Lawrence VanDyke was serving as our state\u2019s solicitor general. Lawrence is a thoughtful, fair-minded individual who cares deeply about our state, our law enforcement community, and the rule of law. He is a true westerner, a man of honest integrity, and he will make an outstanding addition to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. I applaud President Donald Trump for nominating Lawrence, and I am proud to lend him my full support.\u201d\n\nDoug Busselman, Executive Vice President, Nevada Farm Bureau\n\n\u201cThe Nevada Farm Bureau works to enhance and strengthen the lives of rural Nevadans by building strong agriculture communities in our state. We put Nevada first and support others who do as well, regardless of party affiliation. Lawrence VanDyke is a man of integrity and character with deep roots in the West. He will serve Nevada and the country well. We hope the Senate quickly confirms him to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Goicoechea, Nevada Cattlemen\u2019s Association Executive Committee\n\n\u201cThe Nevada Cattlemen\u2019s Association supports former Nevada Solicitor General, Lawrence VanDyke, and his nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Lawrence is a born and bred westerner and embodies the level of independence, integrity, good character and outstanding legal background to serve on the ninth circuit. We thank him for his willingness to serve and urge the U.S. Senate to confirm him.\u201d\n\nPaul J. Enos, CEO, Nevada Trucking Association\n\n\u201cI am writing this letter to express my support for the appointment of Lawrence Van Dyke to the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\u201cI got to know Lawrence in 2015 when he moved to Nevada and became our Solicitor General, dealing with issues from labor and overtime laws to the environment. As a 3rd generation Nevadan, born and raised in Elko, I am excited at the prospect of having a fellow Westerner on the court who appreciates the relationship between citizens and our public lands\u2014not just as a place to be protected for wildlife and recreation, but as a place that provides opportunities for ranchers and miners to sustain their families and drive the economy of their communities.\n\n\u201cAs the CEO of the Nevada Trucking Association since 2006, a bi-partisan, trade association founded in 1932 with over 500 member companies, I appreciate Lawrence\u2019s grounded worldview. The trucks of these companies travel through multiple jurisdictions on a daily basis\u2014so I have witnessed the tension between disparate rules and the uniform application of the law. Educated as a civil engineer, with a background in construction management and being involved in a small, family business, Lawrence understands this tension. He has the experience and makes the effort to connect laws, regulations and legal theories to their real world application and impact.\n\nLawrence Van Dyke has the wisdom, experience and credentials to make a fine judge and I am hopeful for a fair consideration of his nomination.\u201d\n\nAndy MacKay, President, Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association\n\n\u201cSince 1962 the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association (NFADA) has been a leader in Nevada for over a hundred new franchised automobile and truck dealers. Our mission is to support and promote our members within our state, protecting sound business practices and standards. We take pride in what we do representing Nevadans in the motor vehicle industry. Over the years, we have supported both Democrats and Republicans based solely on their track record of looking out for the people of the West. Lawrence VanDyke ranks high on that list. We look forward to his swift confirmation.\u201d\n\nJason Woodbury, Carson City District Attorney\n\n\u201cI applaud the President for nominating this great westerner, Lawrence VanDyke, to serve on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Lawrence cares deeply about Nevada, having served as our solicitor general with honor, class and integrity. He is a brilliant lawyer, a family man, and somebody who will always defend our Constitution and the rule of law. As an elected prosecutor and member of Nevada\u2019s law enforcement community who has personally witnessed his extraordinary abilities, I\u2019m proud to give Lawrence my full support.\u201d\n\nDick Gammick, Former Washoe County District Attorney\n\n\u201cAs a criminal prosecutor for thirty years, twenty of those as the elected Washoe County District Attorney, I know how important it is to have the highest caliber of individuals serving in positions of accountability and responsibility to others. As our former solicitor general in Nevada, Lawrence VanDyke is exactly that caliber of individual. Further, I have followed the record of the 9th Circuit Court Appeals when their cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court and have been astonished in the number of reversals. It is time to improve that record. Lawrence is a man of extraordinary intellect and unwavering integrity. He is a wonderful family man and he has a strong sense of compassion and humility, which will continue to serve him well. I believe Lawrence will serve as a fair and honest judge on our 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and I look forward to the Senate confirming this outstanding selection by our President.\u201d\n\nErin Phillips, President, Power2Parent\n\n\u201cPower2Parent, a Nevada-based non-profit that serves as the state\u2019s most influential parental rights organization, congratulates Lawrence VanDyke on his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit. Mr. VanDyke, a Harvard Law graduate, brings unparalleled experience and credentials to this position. In his distinguished career as an attorney, including serving as Nevada\u2019s Solicitor General, he has provided balance and fairness in upholding the law. Additionally, Mr. VanDyke is constitutionally minded when it comes to the protection of parental rights, parental notification for abortion and consent laws. He argued successfully before the Nevada Supreme Court in defense of the constitutionality of Nevada\u2019s groundbreaking and historic Education Savings Accounts law. Mr. VanDyke is a native westerner and understands the complex problems facing western states and the citizens who call it home. Power2Parent is honored to support the nomination of Lawrence VanDyke, a highly qualified candidate to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nDon Turner, President, Nevada Firearms Coalition\n\n\u201cLawrence VanDyke has a long and principled record of fiercely defending our Constitutional rights, including our critical Second Amendment. He did this as our solicitor general in Nevada and I know he will continue to protect our individual liberties and freedoms on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We applaud his nomination by President Trump and we look forward to his confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nDr. Robin Titus, Nevada State Assembly Republican Leader\n\n\u201cAs a longtime practicing physician, a fellow westerner, and the Republican leader of the Nevada State Assembly, I am extremely proud to support our former solicitor general, Lawrence VanDyke, in his nomination by President Trump to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Lawrence is a man of humility with a deep respect and understanding of our Constitution and the rule of law. Nevadans have fought for generations against federal overreach and Lawrence has served on our front lines, ensuring our rights and liberties were properly restored and defended. It is my hope the U.S. Senate will confirm him expeditiously.\u201d\n\nNational Shooting Sports Foundation\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the National Shooting Sports Foundation\u2019s approximately 9,000 member companies, I am writing to express our strong support of President Trump\u2019s nominee Lawrence VanDyke, of Nevada, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Lawrence VanDyke is well-educated, experienced, and is certainly no stranger to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nVanDyke has served as the top lawyer for appellate and constitutional issues in both Nevada and Montana and presently serves as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Born and having spent most of his life in the West, VanDyke appreciates his strong western roots and values. He has keen knowledge of issues of impacting the area and has successfully argued numerous cases and fought against federal government overreach. VanDyke is deeply committed to the rule of law and strong defender of our Constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment.\n\nOn a more personal level, VanDyke is widely known a man of integrity and humility, a dedicated family man, and an avid competitive shooter. It is not surprising why a man of such strong character has earned the accolades of several individuals of various levels of government and industries who have had the pleasure of knowing, interacting, and serving with him. Without question, VanDyke\u2019s qualifications are unparalleled.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation urges the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to advance Lawrence VanDyke\u2019s nomination, so that the full Senate can confirm him as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMary Lau, President & CEO Retail Association of Nevada\n\n\u201cLawrence Van Dyke, nominated by President Trump to the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, would provide invaluable insight and a unique perspective to the court\u2019s impressive reserve of experience. Mr. Van Dyke\u2019s impeccable legal education and his broad experience throughout the West will be an invaluable asset on the 9th Circuit. It\u2019s important that our courts represent the people they may reside over, and Mr. Van Dyke understands the West\u2019s history of placing an importance on the private rights of individuals.\n\nIn Nevada there are nearly 8,600 retail businesses spread among 27 store categories. The five store categories that employ the most workers are grocery stores, general merchandise stores, clothing stores, automobile dealers and department stores. As the industry\u2019s voice, the Retail Association of Nevada understands the significance of having a judiciary with officers who understand how their actions affect our members\u2019 ability to continue to provide for their families and the families of their 272,800 employees.\n\nMr. Chairman, it is because of the need for a more balanced western judiciary that I am honored to lend our encouragement to President Trump\u2019s nomination of Mr. Van Dyke and respectfully ask that you support his confirmation through the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and subsequently, on the floor of the United States\u2019 Senate.\u201d\n\nMelissa Clement, Executive Director, Nevada Right to Life\n\n\u201cNevada Right to Life thanks President Donald J. Trump for the recent nomination of Lawrence VanDyke to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe people of Nevada have long suffered under the outrageous judicial opinions handed down by the 9th Circuit Court, the most overturned court in the land. Basic human rights and liberties, such as the right to life, freedom of religion, the right to peaceably assemble and to associate, and the freedom of speech have suffered assault after assault for decades.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s dedication to changing this Court is furthered by the nomination of Lawrence VanDyke. I am confident that Mr. VanDyke will provide a much-needed counterbalance to the extreme leftward, anti-life, anti-liberty stance of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nNevada Right to Life and its thousands of members across Nevada look forward to a swift confirmation of this highly qualified man.\u201d\n\nRepublican National Lawyers Association\n\nCurrent and Former States Solicitors General", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
