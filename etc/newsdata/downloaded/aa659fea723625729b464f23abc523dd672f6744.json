The Wholechain platform is based on Mastercard\u2019s blockchain-based Provenance Solution.\n\nTopco will use the platform to trace the provenance of produce, meat and seafood.\n\nBlockchain provides transparency for food supply chains\n\nBlockchain technology has found widespread application in the food industry with multiple high-profile companies.\n\nMajor American retailer Walmart began using blockchain tech to track Indian shrimp supply chains earlier this month. This is reportedly the first time that the technology has been used to track shrimp from the country. Walmart China started tracking food through its supply chain with VeChain\u2019s Thor blockchain in June.\n\nThe retailer previously stated that blockchain technology allows the firm to more quickly recall products in the event of a possible health issue.\n\nIn August, Switzerland\u2019s largest supermarket chain and retailer Migros announced that it would use TE-Food\u2019s blockchain-based food traceability system for its products.\n\nBlockchain can help food supply chains, but standards are needed\n\nCointelegraph recently reported that Alex Manders, the head of blockchain solutions at Information Services Group (ISG), has urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to offer clear guidance on blockchain apps to improve food safety.\n\nAt an FDA public meeting called \"A New Era of Smarter Food Safety,\" Manders said that the regulatory body should introduce clear guidelines on how to use blockchain safely in food supply chains.\n\nISG states that the main challenges facing blockchain adoption in food supply chains are non-technical i.e. a complete unawareness of existing blockchain infrastructure including collaboration models and vendors.", "description": "Topco Associates will use a blockchain platform for food supply chains that is based on Mastercard\u2019s Provenance Solution", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8zOTdkZTA5MjZmMTM0MDNjZDkxMGU1Yjk2YWI4ZGM5OS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
