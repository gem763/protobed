I never understood this but it is something that has prevailed in our culture.\n\nIt is an odd insult often thrown by the less successful at the more successful. If these successful people were really so stupid, why did they accomplish so much?\n\nWe have a tradition of calling our President \u2018stupid.\u2019\n\nIt goes back a long way. Many of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s enemies (including many in his own party) called him stupid and a lightweight. Of course, we do not think of FDR today as a lightweight \u2026 but that was a criticism of him for many years.\n\nIn my lifetime, almost every Republican President has been caricatured as being stupid. Gerald Ford was the clumsy bumbler portrayed. Anyone of that era remembers Chevy Chase\u2019s hilarious skits on Saturday Night Live.\n\nBut Ford wasn\u2019t a clumsy bumbler. He was actually the opposite \u2014 Ford was a world-class athlete. He was voted the most valuable player on the University of Michigan Football team.\n\nThen came Reagan. How could an actor be smart? The zeitgeist was that Reagan was stupid and he was being taken advantage of by other members of his party. It was so assumed that he was a dummy that there is a classic SNL Phil Hartman skit that is a parody of the parody. The skit was so hilarious because no one could actually believe Reagan could take control of anything.\n\nReagan may have been folksy, but he certainly wasn\u2019t stupid. He played his \u201csimple\u201d status to his advantage.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was also depicted as stupid. Will Ferrell on SNL portrayed Bush 43 as a complete idiot. And just like Reagan, Bush was seen as stupid and being taken advantage of by evil powers (like Cheney, Rove, and Rumsfeld).\n\nBut was George W. Bush stupid or was it more of an act? You would not think that if you saw his debate performance against Ann Richards for Texas Governor in 1994.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at our current President, Donald Trump. The Alec Baldwin caricature of Trump is that he is stupid and being taken advantage of (first by Bannon and then by Putin)\n\nBut whatever you think about Trump, the caricature that he is a dummy who gets taken advantage of by others just doesn\u2019t ring true. No one really thinks people take advantage of Trump \u2014 the biggest real criticism is that he takes advantage of others.\n\nEven with George H. W. Bush, the one recent Republican President no one could attack as being stupid, the \u2018Ivory Tower\u2019 still found a way to attack his ticket by calling Dan Quayle stupid.\n\nEveryone I know that worked for Vice President Quayle, like Keith Rabois, consistently remark how smart he was. So was he really stupid or did he just happen to misspell \u2018potato.\u2019\n\nWhat most people don\u2019t know (or don\u2019t remember) is that Quayle was looking at a flash card provided by the school that had the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer on it, spelled incorrectly. So, yes, Quayle did mess up\u2014but so did the school. Whether Quayle should have known better (yes) or the school should have known better (yes), that one little letter was the vowel heard \u2018round the world, damaging Quayle\u2019s credibility and adding to the public\u2019s perception that the vice president wasn\u2019t the brightest crayon in the box. Quayle was embarrassed, of course. He later wrote in his memoir Standing Firm that \u201cIt was more than a gaffe. It was a \u2018defining moment\u2019 of the worst imaginable kind. I can\u2019t overstate how discouraging and exasperating the whole event was.\u201d http://mentalfloss.com/article/64689/never-forget-time-dan-quayle-misspelled-potato\n\nCalling someone \u2018stupid\u2019 is not a successful strategy in politics.\n\nThe funny thing is that calling someone stupid is not an effective line of attack. It turns out the main attack on George H.W. Bush (that he was out-of-touch) was much more effective than the attack on George W. Bush (that he was stupid).\n\nBill Clinton won on \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d Eight years later, Al Gore lost on the campaign \u201cthe other guy is stupid.\u201d\n\nIn the end, these types of attacks don\u2019t work very well. In the end, no one really believes that a major party nominee is dumb. No doubt that Al Gore is a very smart man \u2026 but if he was really smart he would have found a way to run a better campaign.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t know a lot about politics, I will venture that the best thing politically that has happened to President Trump is the portrayal of him as stupid and unintelligent by Alec Baldwin. There are dozens of better attack vectors. If Trump wins re-election, Balwin\u2019s portrayal might be deciding factor.\n\nWhy do we think these successful people are so dumb?\n\nA lot of smart people think the people who are not smart in the same way as them, are just not smart.\n\nPeople that are really quick on their feet think people who need time to think things through are just not that smart.\n\nPeople that are really good standardized test-takers think they are smarter than those that are not.\n\nPeople that know a lot about history can think they are smarter than people that know a lot about hip-hop music.\n\nWe discount the bits of intelligence that we don\u2019t have.\n\nVerbal intelligence is very difficult and we should not overly criticize people who learn orally (verses via the written word).\n\ncalling successful people \"stupid\" is a very weird insult.\n\n\n\nJust because someone doesn't have high SATs does not mean they are not smart.\n\n\n\nfor instance, verbal intelligence is actually very difficult and we should not overly criticize people who learn orally. \u2014 Auren Hoffman (@auren) October 6, 2019\n\nBad grammar is another thing people love to criticize.\n\nSome people mispronounce words because they learned them by reading. There was a whole mockery of George W. Bush on how he pronounced the word \u201cnuclear\u201d and \u201cIran.\u201d\n\nSignaling one\u2019s intelligence is just so darn important.\n\nPeople who think of themselves as smart like to remind others that they are smart. They can intentionally communicate in a way that makes it hard for people (who are not steeped in their world) to follow. It is a bit of intellectual bigotry.\n\nIntellectual bigotry can come from the right or the left. Just because it was levied on Republican presidents, does not mean that one side has a monopoly on this insult.\n\nAnother way of calling someone stupid is saying someone is a lightweight. That can be a common way the right insults the left. On example here is overweighting experience.\n\nWhy are academic papers so difficult to read?\n\nAcademic papers are incredibly hard to read. I have a lot of trouble getting meaning from a paper (behind the summary). And these papers seem to be getting harder to read and understand over time. An academic paper in 1919 is a lot easier to read than a similar paper in 2019. Is that just signaling?\n\nThe antithesis of an academic paper is anything written by Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell is brilliant because he can clearly tell a story and write important concepts in ways the average person can understand. Gladwell gets much-maligned that he is TOO simplistic \u2026 but that is the point of his brilliance.\n\nWhy is it more intellectual to read a fiction book than watching a movie?\n\nWhy is it more intellectual to read a non-fiction book than to listen to the same audiobook?\n\nSummation: the ivory tower insult of calling successful people is not only false, it is also ineffective.\n\nspecial thank you to Samo Burja, Erik Torenberg, Ben Casnocha, Peter Thiel.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://summation.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
