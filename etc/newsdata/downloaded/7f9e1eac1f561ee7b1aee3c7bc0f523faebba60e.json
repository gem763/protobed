But, hypothetically speaking, she said that if nuclear weapons did have to be removed from that base, it would be a complicated operation. It would require negotiations with the nation that would become the weapons\u2019 new host, James said. And it would require a great deal of logistical and security work.\n\nIf the Air Force found a new nation willing to host the nukes, James said, it would have to take \u201cthe greatest of care\u201d in their removal and transport. If the receiving base did not have the facilities or security necessary, James said, it would require a significant construction effort. And NATO would likely be involved.", "description": "Asked about the U.S.'s reported stockpile in Turkey, Trump said, \"We're confident\" they're safe.
