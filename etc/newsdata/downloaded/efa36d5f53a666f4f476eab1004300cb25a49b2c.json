I was convinced they\u2019d made a mistake and swapped my petri dish accidentally.\n\nI\u2019ve never said the words \u2018I have cancer\u2019 because I don\u2019t identify as a person with a disease. Words are really important, and mantras can be hugely impactful.\n\nIf you work on loving yourself and say to yourself \u2018I\u2019m amazing\u2019 everyday then that becomes who you are.\n\nCancer is never something that I wanted or identified with, it\u2019s an external thing which grew inside me, so I only ever said I\u2019ve been \u2018diagnosed\u2019 with cancer to cement that distance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve had to work hard to make my experience as positive as possible \u2013 even dressing up in glitter and my shiniest clothes to go in for chemo.\n\nI\u2019ve worked so hard to love myself throughout this process (Photo: Holly Wellington)\n\nI have been calling my healing process my \u2018dragon transformation,\u2019 as although I have always had strength, the courage that I have developed in the face of my diagnosis is making me even fiercer.\n\nI find all the imagery associated with dragons really powerful, and I love the idea of a fire growing inside me, sprouting wings and being fierce.\n\nI want to change people\u2019s perception of cancer and disease. Yes, it can be scary and challenging, but it\u2019s also been the making of me.\n\nBefore I found out I took fitness and health really seriously but found it difficult to appreciate my body. Then when I began chemo my body started to change, my hair fell out and I couldn\u2019t work out anymore.\n\nIt made me appreciate who I am on the inside so much more, and realise how amazing and beautiful my body is. Being able to cope with this treatment and shrink a tumour, I know my body has had to go through something so huge and I feel really proud of it.\n\nA year ago, I was someone who may have seemed confident on the outside, but on the inside my self-doubt was eating away at me.\n\nMy diagnosis has totally, wholeheartedly, changed how I feel about myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an artist and musician, I used to base all of my worth on what I created, which was a really unhealthy outlook as I put myself under so much pressure. I went through periods of not being able to create anything as I was scared it wouldn\u2019t be good enough. I was sabotaging myself.\n\nHolly Wellington is taking part in Teenage Cancer Trust\u2019s #StillMe campaign (Photo: Jack Liley)\n\nHaving to face cancer made me realise that I\u2019m more than my art; I\u2019m a fun loving, free spirited, human being. But that being said, I\u2019m so lucky to have had art and music in my life during treatment.\n\nBeing able to perform and express myself is so cathartic, it means so much to stand there on stage singing out with my bald head proud of my healing process.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I got the all-clear, which was incredible.\n\nAs my tumour was on the larger side I\u2019m going to have radiotherapy every day for four weeks starting soon, and I\u2019m also in discussion about having a double mastectomy and reconstruction \u2013 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about that yet but I will listen to my body and make the right decision.\n\nTwo days after getting the all-clear I was back in the studio recording an exciting record with my band.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve worked so hard to love myself throughout this process, whatever state I\u2019m in or whatever I\u2019m able to do.\n\nNow, with a lot of emotional work behind me I am much more in touch with myself and ready to continue the process of working on my solo album. I\u2019m feeling so elated about life because I really believe anything is possible.\n\nHolly stars in Teenage Cancer Trust\u2019s new #StillMe campaign, which is shining a light on the impact that cancer and treatment can have on young people\u2019s body image, confidence, and self-esteem.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "I used to dress up in glitter and my shiniest clothes to go in for chemo.", "authors": ["Holly Wellington"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/70460572_1448431335296966_8763497368642387968_n-1-a93a-e1570202395893_1570268351.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
