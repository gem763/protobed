We'll share coverage, commentary, and probably bad jokes all throughout the keynotes. We've also invited Tim Cook \u2014 we'll see if he joins in! He may be busy.\n\n\n\nAlso, we want to play a game. It's very easy. All you have to do is guess how many times the word 'apple' will be uttered during the grand keynote ceremony. Submit your best guess before Tim Cook says \"One more thing.\" The prize is amazing. IT'S APPLES. As many Apples as Apple says Apple during the Apple Event on new Apple products. Like, more than 100 apples?\n\n\n\nFeel free to leave predictions, opinions, and puns now and during the event.\n\n\n\nGet those Apples.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://answers-cdn.tnwcdn.com/sessions/lux1ce9Y5lZloI50k5h8XSB7COY5sMs1N9RBfHLF.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
