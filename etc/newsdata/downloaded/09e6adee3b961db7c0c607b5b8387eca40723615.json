Investigation.\n\nSince the launch of DeLonge\u2019s organization, it has released footage of possible UFOs, with the New York Times reporting on one video in December 2017. The footage, which was recorded by Navy pilots in 2004, shows a mysterious object flying and rotating in the sky. As Vice\u2019s Motherboard reports, this video, along with two others, has officially been acknowledged by the U.S. Navy as \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d which is basically the sexy, updated term for UFO.\n\nJoseph Gradisher, the official spokesperson for the deputy chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare, told Motherboard that \u201cthe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those 3 videos as unidentified.\u201d However, they did not comment further on what these videos exactly mean, or whether or not dem aliens are flying around in these objects. \u201cThe Navy has not publicly released characterizations or descriptions, nor released any hypothesis or conclusions, in regard to the objects contained in the referenced videos,\u201d Gradisher told the website the Black Vault, which originally reported the news.\n\nStill, it is interesting, especially since the Navy did not acknowledge the footage previously. And also because of the specific terminology the Navy is using for its commentary. \u201cI very much expected that when the U.S. military addressed the videos, they would coincide with language we see on official documents that have now been released, and they would label them as \u2018drones\u2019 or \u2018balloons,\u2019\u201d John Greenwald, who runs the Black Vault, told Motherboard. \u201cHowever, they did not. They went on the record stating the \u2018phenomena\u2019 depicted in those videos, is \u2018unidentified.\u2019 That really made me surprised, intrigued, excited and motivated to push harder for the truth.\u201d\n\nIs the Navy\u2019s use of the terms \u201cunidentified\u201d and \u201cphenomena\u201d a little wink letting us know that dem aliens are real? The truth is out there \u2026 somewhere.\n\nStay in touch.
