In order to test the security of the devices, the group developed a number of fake apps designed to steal users\u2019 passwords.\n\nThe team developed eight hacking apps that were designed to look like an app that would check a user\u2019s horoscope, one was also designed to look like a random number generator. Instead, the apps were used by researchers to eavesdrop on users and phish for their passwords.\n\nFabian Br\u00e4unlein, a senior security consultant at SRLabs, told Ars Technica: \u201cIt was always clear that those voice assistants have privacy implications\u2014with Google and Amazon receiving your speech, and this possibly being triggered on accident sometimes. We now show that not only the manufacturers but\u2026 also hackers can abuse those voice assistants to intrude on someone\u2019s privacy.\u201d\n\nThe apps all had different names and different ways of operating but generally followed the same routine. A user would say a phrase such as: \u201cHey Alexa, ask My Lucky Horoscope to give me the horoscope for Taurus\u201d or \u201cOK Google, ask My Lucky Horoscope to give me the horoscope for Taurus.\u201d The eavesdropping apps then responded with the requested information while the phishing apps gave a fake error message, then the app made it seem as if they were no longer running and waited for the next part of the phishing attack.\n\nThe apps appeared to stop but quietly logged all conversations within listening distance of the device and sent a copy to the security researchers\u2019 servers. A video showing the operation can be seen below:\n\nAmazon commented on the experiment stating:\n\nCustomer trust is important to us, and we conduct security reviews as part of the skill certification process. We quickly blocked the skill in question and put mitigations in place to prevent and detect this type of skill behavior and reject or take them down when identified. On the record Q&A: 1) Why is it possible for the skill created by the researchers to get a rough transcript of what a customer says after they said \u201cstop\u201d to the skill? This is no longer possible for skills being submitted for certification. We have put mitigations in place to prevent and detect this type of skill behavior and reject or take them down when identified. 2) Why is it possible for SR Labs to prompt skill users to install a fake security update and then ask them to enter a password? We have put mitigations in place to prevent and detect this type of skill behavior and reject or take them down when identified. This includes preventing skills from asking customers for their Amazon passwords. It\u2019s also important that customers know we provide automatic security updates for our devices, and will never ask them to share their password\n\nWhile a Google spokesperson stated:\n\nAll Actions on Google are required to follow our developer policies, and we prohibit and remove any Action that violates these policies. We have review processes to detect the type of behavior described in this report, and we removed the Actions that we found from these researchers. We are putting additional mechanisms in place to prevent these issues from occurring in the future.\n\nAs Breitbart News has written in the past, the easiest way for users to protect themselves from being listened to by these devices is quite simple \u2014 don\u2019t purchase one.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
