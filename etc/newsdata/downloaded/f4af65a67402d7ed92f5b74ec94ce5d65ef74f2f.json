Some buildings on the islands date to the Iron Age, Viking rule and medieval times.\n\nBut around 1,000 sites are situated on the coastline and are under threat.\n\nOne such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay. Dating from between 600-400AD, the sea has taken much of the site\u2019s western area. Now the broch wall itself is falling into the sea.\n\nJulie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, says it will eventually disappear.\n\n\u201cWhat you can see just over here is the front door of the broch, exposed by the sea, taking away parts of the ruins and leaving a built wall still intact. And each year a little more falls as the sea batters it,\u201d she said as she stood on the cliff\u2019s edge.\n\n\u201cWhat we have discovered in recent years, through the use of geophysics and other things, is that... on this stretch of the coastline, all the settlement archaeology is within 100 metres of the coast edge. And so as the sea takes this heritage of ours away it\u2019s taking all that we have,\u201d she said.\n\nPiece of South Howe Broch wall fallen onto beach on the island of Rousay, Orkney, Scotland, Britain September 25, 2019.

This Iron Age building is well-preserved, courtesy of a sea wall built in the 1930s and well-maintained since. A spring-fed water tank, fireplace and room partitions are clearly visible. But even Midhowe Broch is at risk from climate change.\n\nA climate risk assessment of Orkney\u2019s Neolithic sites, published by conservation public body Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July this year, described the potential impact of climate change on the sites as \u201cextreme\u201d and their vulnerability as \u201chigh\u201d.\n\nAccording to HES, average precipitation (rain, sleet and snow) has increased by 27% in Scotland since the early 1960s. In the same period, winter precipitation has gone up by more than 70% in parts of northern Scotland.\n\nWetter weather means buildings are wetter for longer, meaning water is more likely to penetrate masonry and decay it. It also leads to metal parts of buildings corroding and the ground becoming unstable. This can lead to structural collapse.\n\nSea levels are also rising and beach erosion is a growing problem.\n\nSince 1970 some Orkney beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches (40 centimetres) per year since 1970. That is compared to an annual average loss of eight inches between 1890 and 1970, according to data from cross-governmental coastal change assessment partnership Dynamic Coast.\n\nIncreased storminess also threatens damaging Orkney\u2019s historical sites, HES says.\n\nArguably the most famous site of Orkney is Skara Brae. This Neolithic settlement, occupied from roughly 3100-2500BC, features a network of stone buildings. When inhabited it was approximately one kilometre (0.6 miles) from the sea with a freshwater loch and sand dunes in between. Now it sits only a few metres from the North Atlantic.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nVisitors can see the settlement\u2019s 5,000-year-old hearths, bed recesses, cupboards and dressers. Some 112,000 people visited it in 2018.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a really real present risk. The climate has already changed because of the influence of humans. And it\u2019s going to continue to change and that pace of change is going to speed up,\u201d said HES climate change scientist, David Harkin.\n\n\u201cSo the risk to sites like Skara Brae and other sites around Orkney, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s here, it\u2019s happening. But it shouldn\u2019t all be doom and gloom and despair. There is an opportunity to still do something about it and to avoid the worst possible consequences of climate change,\u201d he added.", "description": "Ancient British structures older than the pyramids are being threatened by climate change, experts have warned, as rising sea levels, heavier rainfall and severe weather events endanger Scotland's archaeological treasures.", "authors": ["George Sargent", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439200826&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990NS", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
