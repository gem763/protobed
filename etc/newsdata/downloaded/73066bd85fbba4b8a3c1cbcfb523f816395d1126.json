'Rebecca Adlington has said she's going to take me to the Olympic pool in Stratford. I need to make sure I have structure in my life, and keep myself busy doing positive things.'", "description": "And while the TOWIE star, 31, has been thwarted with troubles of late, his new digs are undoubtedly a welcome distraction as images of his stunning Woodford Green house", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20323750-0-image-a-276_1572351244874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
