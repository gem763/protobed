Best application of 'Deepfake'-style AI facial replacement I've ever seen.\n\n\n\nHere's an example of me as DiCaprio (generated in under 8 secs from that one photo in the thumbnail) \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/1RpnJJ3wgT\n\nThe company was forced to issue a statement on Sunday pledging changes after critics attacked the app\u2019s privacy policy, which it had \u201cfree, irrevocable, permanent, transferable, and relicenseable\u201d rights to all user-generated content.\n\nThere has been growing concern over deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to appear genuine. Critics say the technology can be used to create bogus videos to manipulate elections, defame someone, or potentially cause unrest by spreading misinformation on a massive scale.\n\n\u201cWe understand the concerns about privacy. We\u2019ve received the feedback, and will fix the issues that we didn\u2019t take into consideration, which will take some time,\u201d a statement released by Zao said.\n\nZao is owned by Momo Inc, a Tinder-like dating service that is listed on the US Nasdaq.\n\nIt has since changed its terms to say it will not use headshots or videos uploaded by users, other than to improve the app. It also pledged to remove from its servers any content that was uploaded but subsequently deleted by users.\n\nThe backlash has not dented the app\u2019s popularity. As of Monday afternoon it remained the top free download in China, according to the app market data provider App Annie.\n\nConcerns over deepfakes have grown since the 2016 US election campaign, which saw wide use of online misinformation, according to US investigations.\n\nIn June, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said the social network was struggling to find ways to deal with deepfake videos, saying they may constitute \u201ca completely different category\u201d of misinformation than anything faced before.", "description": "Critics say face-swap app could spread misinformation on a massive scale", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Shanghai"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7bf26a18469e062e778281737e35fbfb3ff228/0_149_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c21f323c07b7a1021d26aeac28ed8da"}
