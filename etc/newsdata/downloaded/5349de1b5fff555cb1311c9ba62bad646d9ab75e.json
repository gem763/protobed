This was the law passed by parliament last month requiring Johnson to seek a Brexit delay if he has not agreed a withdrawal agreement in the next two weeks.\n\nIf he does not, they want the court to use its powers, not available to English judges, to write to EU leaders itself requesting an extension on his behalf.\n\nWhile saying he will comply with the law, Johnson has said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask for any delay and that Britain will leave the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d on Oct. 31.\n\nWith time running out, European Council President Donald Tusk and EU parliament head, David Sassoli, are due in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday.\n\nSassoli will also see French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday and Johnson in London later on Tuesday.\n\nPENALTIES\n\nThe legal challenge, fronted by tax lawyer Jo Maugham and Joanna Cherry, a lawmaker from the Scottish National Party, also says that if Johnson fails to comply with the Benn Act the courts could impose penalties \u201cincluding fine and imprisonment\u201d.\n\nIn submissions to the Scottish court read out by the campaigners\u2019 lawyer, Aidan O\u2019Neill, the government said Johnson accepted he was obliged to send a letter to the EU on Oct. 19 asking for a delay if no deal had been struck and that if an extension was granted, Britain would also agree to it.\n\nO\u2019Neill said the submissions were \u201cdirectly contrary to what the prime minister was saying to parliament yesterday\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for Johnson said he could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nIn Brussels, an official dealing with Brexit said: \u201cIt is not for us to comment on the UK\u2019s internal constitutional arrangements or on legal proceedings. But time is already tight and the only way to avoid no deal is to ratify a deal or to agree an extension, so having clarity is going to be pretty key.\u201d\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter that a senior source in Johnson\u2019s office had said they could still avoid any delay.\n\n\u201cThe government will comply with the Benn Act, which only imposes a very specific narrow duty concerning parliament\u2019s letter requesting a delay,\u201d she quoted the source as saying.\n\n\u201cThe govt is not prevented by Act from doing other things that cause no delay including other communications, private and public. People will have to wait to see how this is reconciled.\n\n\u201cThe government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s Outer House of the Court of Session will give its ruling on Monday on whether it will order Johnson to comply with the Benn Act, Maugham said.\n\nIRISH BORDER ISSUE\n\nJohnson\u2019s new proposal is intended to offer arrangements for the post-Brexit border between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe EU wants it reworked by the end of next week to yield a deal at the Oct.17-18 summit of 28 national leaders in Brussels.\n\n\u201cIf, at the end of next week, there is no sign of serious movement, then it\u2019s probably too late for a deal at the summit,\u201d said an EU diplomat dealing with Brexit. \u201cWe need substantial movement on the UK side, especially on customs.\u201d\n\nDespite the Benn Act, Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU remained concerned about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which many businesses fear would have damaging economic repercussions for Britain and the EU.\n\n\u201cI think British politics is so unpredictable right now, that we can\u2019t rely even on the law in Britain in this context,\u201d he told RTE on Friday.\n\nThe legal challenge is the latest case that has seen judges called in to arbitrate over Brexit, with all the high-profile cases so far going against the government.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves his Downing Street office in London, Britain, October 3, 2019.
