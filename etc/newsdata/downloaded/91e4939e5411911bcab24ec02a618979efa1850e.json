(Getty)\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest smartphone packs in loads of futuristic features to compete with Apple\u2019s iPhone and tempt people to upgrade.\n\nBut one of the features may create some unintended consequences.\n\nThe Google Pixel 4 can be unlocked instantly when it recognises your face, saving you valuable time when you need to make a quick call or check messages.\n\nThe technology works through an infrared camera that projects dots onto your face to make sure it\u2019s really you. If it is, the phone unlocks itself.\n\nBut the sensor is so good, it can be activated even while you\u2019re asleep, making it extremely easy for jealous types to unlock their partner\u2019s phones while they\u2019re sleeping.\n\nMORE: Google reveals Pixel 4 and several other gadgets at New York hardware event\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome suggest that it won\u2019t be long for this feature to be put to sneaky use.\n\n\u2018Google is opening up a whole can of worms with such easy access to the phone with facial recognition, what person who suspects their partner is cheating is not going to have a go at unlocking it when their other half is asleep?\u2019 said Jessica Leoni, a sex and relationship expert with extra-marital affairs site IllicitEncounters.com.\n\nResearch carries out by the site found that three-quarters of people (74%) have accessed or attempted to access their partner\u2019s phone.\n\n\u2018Lots of people try to guess their partner\u2019s passcode if they are not already aware of it,\u2019 Jessica told Metro.co.uk.\n\nThe Pixel 4 comes in a choice of 3 colours (Getty)\n\n\u2018I suspect that Google will close this loophole following concerns about the ease of access to the phone using this log-in method. In future you will probably have to blink or have some kind of other facial motion for it to work. But that could be a few years off.\n\n\u2018Would I recommend that suspicious partners access their partner\u2019s phone in this way? Absolutely! If they are not cheating, it will soon become obvious and you can be assured you are dating someone you can trust and your fears were unfounded. Hopefully it will put your relationship on a better footing.\u2019\n\n\u2018If they are cheating, you can confront them and work out if the relationship has a future. You can also check whether your partner\u2019s sexual behaviour is putting you at risk. Are they practicing safe sex with their bit on the side?\u2019\n\nA man uses the new Google Pixel 4 smartphone during a Google launch event in New York (Getty Images)\n\nMORE: I went through my ex-partner\u2019s phone and I have no regrets\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As for the wider issue of whether snooping is a good/bad thing, ask yourself this: if your partner is cheating, wouldn\u2019t you rather know? I suspect there is very little chance of them volunteering this information without a little detective work on your part.\u2019\n\nRelationship goals aside, the Pixel 4 is sure to be a big seller as it looks to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S10 and iPhone 11 \u2013 both of which can also be unlocked with your face.\n\nThe Pixel 4 pricing starts at \u00a3669 for the Pixel 4 and \u00a3829 for the Pixel 4 XL, both will be available from October 24.", "description": "There's a crafty way to unlock someone's Pixel 4", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90314578_1571323866.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
