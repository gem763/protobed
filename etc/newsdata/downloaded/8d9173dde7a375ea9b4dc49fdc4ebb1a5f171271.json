Gruden backs defensive coordinator", "language": "en", "text": "ASHBURN \u2014 The Washington Redskins have the worst third-down defense in the league, rank 26th in yards allowed and have given up the second-most points per game. All three statistics encapsulate the team\u2019s 0-4 start \u2014 a shock to many within the Redskins, given the defense was supposed to be the team\u2019s strength.\n\nDespite all that, coach Jay Gruden backed defensive coordinator Greg Manusky when asked Monday why the linebacker-turned-coach is still the right man for the job.\n\nFans have called for Manusky\u2019s firing and the coordinator even faced criticism from his own players last season when former Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger publicly questioned his defensive calls after a loss in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cGreg\u2019s not covering and Greg\u2019s not rushing,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe have to hold each other accountable and he\u2019s got to make better calls, too. It\u2019s a team game really and I\u2019m not going to put it all on Greg Manusky, I\u2019m not going to blame it all on the players. It\u2019s everybody in this building and we have to get better, we have to fight through it together.\n\n\u201cMaking a change at coordinator, still somebody has to go out there and cover. \u2026 Whatever you call, somebody\u2019s got to stand up and make a play.\u201d\n\nIn the offseason, the Redskins spoke to notable defensive coordinators like Gregg Williams and Todd Bowles \u2014 moves some took as a sign Manusky was on his way out. Washington pushed back against that notion, saying the team wanted to add experience to help Manusky.\n\nThe Redskins hired defensive backs coach Ray Horton and inside linebackers coach Rob Ryan instead \u2014 both have experience as defensive coordinators.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s 24-3 loss to the New York Giants, the Redskins started slow for the second straight week. The Giants scored on their first two possessions, the latter of which was a 13-play, 94-yard drive. Washington started slow against New York and the Chicago Bears in back-to-back weeks.\n\nWashington, though, has been encouraged by its second-half defense. The team went without giving up points after halftime, and Chicago scored on only a field goal in the final two quarters.\n\nThat was an improvement from the first two weeks \u2014 when the Eagles scored 25 second-half points and the Cowboys hung 17 of their 31 after halftime.\n\n\u201cWe just have to make plays,\u201d said cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who had two interceptions against the Giants. \u201cThe coaches can only call the plays. They can only do so much. So the plays they do call, we just have to take advantage and make those plays.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Giants, Gruden said the Redskins surrendered too many big plays.\n\n\u201cThey had three or four big plays in that game that really should have been six-yard gains as opposed to 35-yard gains,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf we can eliminate those and make a team go 75, 80 yards on us and make them work for every inch of grass that they get, we have a chance to be really good.\u201d\n\nGruden listed two ways the Redskins can improve: Eliminate big plays and get better on third down.\n\nOpponents have converted 63% of their chances on third-down, worst in the league by a wide margin.\n\nGruden said the Redskins have made strides \u2014 Washington forced four turnovers Sunday \u2014 but added his team can play better.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s somebody different on every time and it is hurting us,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta all play together as one and I think we\u2019re starting to do that. I think people are starting to have confidence in what we\u2019re calling and how to execute it.\n\n\u201cI feel good about the thought of our defense being great. We\u2019re just not there yet, but we\u2019re getting better. We\u2019ve played four games already, we\u2019ve gotta turn it up quick.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
