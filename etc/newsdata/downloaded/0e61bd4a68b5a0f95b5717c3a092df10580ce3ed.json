It\u2019s a guide for how Justice and the F.E.C. should interact in administering federal election law. The document recognizes that some election law violations, for whatever reason, \u201cmay not be proper subjects for prosecution as crimes\u201d under key criminal provisions of the federal election law statutes. The document then explains how the two agencies should interact when one or the other learns of potential violations.\n\nHere\u2019s the key part for our purpose: When information comes to the attention of the Justice Department indicating a \u201cprobable violation\u201d of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the document says, \u201cthe department will apprise the commission of such information at the earliest opportunity.\u201d\n\nNote the standard for when the Justice Department must notify the F.E.C.: when there\u2019s a \u201cprobable violation,\u201d a low bar compared with the standard for actually bringing a criminal prosecution that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSo again, as far as anyone knows, the Justice Department never provided that notification. And there\u2019s more. The memo further explains that when the Justice Department determines that a probable violation \u201cdoes not amount to a significant and substantial knowing and willful violation\u201d \u2014 presumably what happened when the department decided not to continue investigating the matter described in the whistle-blower complaint \u2014 then \u201cthe department will refer the matter to the commission as promptly as possible.\u201d\n\nThis, too, the Justice Department appears not to have done.\n\nWhy does it matter? Because the F.E.C. has a host of tools available to it to enforce federal election law that are distinct from the prosecutorial tool that the Justice Department declined to exercise here. The memo makes this, too, very clear.\n\nIt says that the Justice Department\u2019s referral of such matters to the F.E.C. will facilitate the latter\u2019s \u201cconsideration of the wide range of appropriate remedies available to the commission.\u201d Those include, for example, the imposition of civil penalties for certain election-law violations \u2014 which would have been made public.\n\nAnd establishing a civil violation doesn\u2019t require that violation to have required a standard of knowing and willful. It also doesn\u2019t require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, only the much lower standard of a preponderance of the evidence. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no monetary threshold for a civil violation, meaning that the Justice Department\u2019s apparent inability to quantify the \u201cthing of value\u201d the president was soliciting is irrelevant to the Justice Department\u2019s duty to notify the commission and not a bar to that agency\u2019s potential imposition of a civil penalty.", "description": "The Justice Department should have shared a campaign-finance investigation with the Federal Election Commission.", "authors": ["Neal K.
