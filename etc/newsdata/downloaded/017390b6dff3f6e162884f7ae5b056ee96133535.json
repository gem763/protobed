It also helps when your No 9, in this case Eddie Nketiah, bags a poacher's hat-trick.\n\nThis was evidence that altering formations \u2013 they played three separate styles \u2013 should work moving forward. After all, Austria are supposed to be England's main threat in a European Championship qualifying group the Young Lions are now in complete control of.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi celebrates scoring England's first against Austria U21's on Tuesday night\n\nEddie Nketiah celebrates scoring the second during the Under-21 Championship Qualifier\n\nHudson-Odoi points to the sky having added a fourth for Aidy Boothroyd's side at MK Dons\n\nMATCH FACTS England U21: Ramsdale, Justin, Guehi, Kelly, Aarons, Willock, Davies, Foden, McNeil, Nketiah, Hudson-Odoi. Subs: Balcombe, Panzo, Sessegnon, Richards, Wilmot, Skipp, Brewster, Gallagher, Surridge. Austria U21: Ehmann, Malicsek, Danso, Maresic, Friedl, Demaku, Lovric, Arase, Baumgartner, Meister, Raguz. Subs: Helac, Borkovic, Halper, Lema, Muller, Grull, Meisl, Golles, Schmidt. Referee: Michael Fabbri (Ravenna)\n\nAidy Boothroyd will view this as a significant step in the right direction. It was four by half-time, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Nketiah both scoring twice.\n\nHudson-Odoi's second was a peach, bending into the far corner after the Chelsea winger had picked up possession 30 yards from his own goal. The four England runners who kept up with him drew Austria all over the place.\n\nLeeds loanee Nketiah's were predatory and the sort of finishes we have come to expect from someone who leans on Ian Wright for wisdom.\n\nThe first, however, will give Boothroyd the most pleasure. Their expansive 3-5-2 allowed Max Aarons to gallop on the right, collect Lloyd Kelly's searching diagonal, and cross for Hudson-Odoi to rattle in on the volley. His stay with the Under 21s may be short-lived.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi, stop that.\n\n\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\n\n\n\nHe's wasting absolutely no time on his return from injury! pic.twitter.com/ra9qVwuY4H \u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 15, 2019\n\nTheir only blot came after the hour, Christoph Baumgartner nestling between central defenders to find Aaron Ramsdale's corner.\n\nEngland really ought to have plundered more before and after that consolation, Phil Foden's influence growing greater as the game became stretched.\n\nCaptain Tom Davies was denied on the line when attempting to turn in Foden's free-kick. The Manchester City midfielder \u2013 shortlisted for the Golden Boy award \u2013 then picked a tiny lock, only for Fabian Ehmann to thwart Joe Willock.\n\nEhmann expertly tipped Foden's wicked 30-yard free-kick over the bar, unfortunate not to cap another peerless display with a goal. Nketiah notched his third late on, finishing off Rhian Brewster's teasing cross. There remained time for the Arsenal striker to miss a penalty, but he won't mind too much.\n\nThe Arsenal youngster on loan at Leeds adds a third for his side and his second of the game", "description": "JACK GAUGHAN AT STADIUM MK: A triumph for England's trialling, Austria were demolished by the tinkerers on a night that will prompt real optimism.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758894-0-image-a-3_1571172350946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
