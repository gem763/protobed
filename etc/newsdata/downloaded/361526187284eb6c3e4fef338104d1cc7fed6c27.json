Annual grants averaged $15 million through 2017, but the EPA\u2019s contribution dropped to $1.6 million in the current fiscal year, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAlex Formuzis, spokesman for the Environmental Working Group, blasted the report. He said he would expect \u201cnothing less from the flat Earth swarm at CEI\u201d and called the grants \u201can extraordinarily wise use of taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe program has produced invaluable research into the connections between toxic chemicals and asthma, ADHD, obesity, autism and cancer in children,\u201d Mr. Formuzis said in an email. \u201cThe work of these children\u2019s health centers has led to restrictions on the proximity of schools to major roadways in California, federal limits on arsenic levels in rice used to make baby food and New York City\u2019s decision to phase out diesel buses.\u201d\n\nThe CEI report argues that the centers have engaged in \u201cstatistical shenanigans\u201d to draw shaky links between children\u2019s health issues such as premature births, asthma and obesity, and trace chemicals in products and pesticides, with no mention of their public health benefits.\n\nA brochure promoted by the 2017 NIEHS/EPA \u201cImpact Report\u201d advised against using flea and tick collars, without pointing out that fleas and ticks can transmit microbes that cause serious illnesses such as Lyme disease.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, much of what the government is funding in the name of \u2018children\u2019s environmental health\u2019 involves a seemingly endless web of weak studies cross-citing one another and then being cited as justification for government action,\u201d said the report.\n\nThe \u201cImpact Report\u201d also credited the work of the Community Outreach Translation Core (COTC) at each center in conveying \u201cbasic research findings into intervention and prevention methods to enhance awareness among communities, health care professionals, and policymakers.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the CEI study said, the \u201ctranslation cores\u201d often act as \u201ca facade for engaging in environmental activism rather than advancing science or its application.\u201d\n\n\u201cCOTCs often start with ideologically derived, predetermined conclusions \u2014 sometimes related to the area of study and sometimes not \u2014 and then design outreach programs around those conclusions,\u201d said the study. \u201cThe research component is secondary and tainted with bias; it has become little more than a smokescreen to legitimize activism.\u201d\n\nThe effort to defund the centers has drawn some attention in Congress. In a March 2018 letter, 15 senators praised the centers\u2019 work and said they have produced 2,500 publications on research identifying \u201cthe critical role environmental toxicants play\u201d in childhood conditions and diseases.\n\nThe 2017 NIEHS/EPA report included a comment from Frank Gilliland, director of the University of Southern California Children\u2019s Center: \u201cWe don\u2019t do advocacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe conduct the science and provide it in a way that can empower both the communities and the policymakers to do something about it,\u201d Mr. Gilliland said.\n\nThe Washington Times has reached out to the EPA for comment.\n\nThe CEI report argued that the Trump administration should go further by cutting the 50% share of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences funding, which would eliminate all federal dollars for the centers, and raised concerns about recently announced plans for more \u201ctranslation centers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf these new centers turn out to be anything like the COTCs in the following case studies, which NIEHS already funds, we can expect them to simply spread scientific misinformation while engaging in political advocacy,\u201d said the report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
