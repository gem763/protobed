In a sense, it plays one off the other, Mark Katz, a professor at George Mason University who studies Russia and the Middle East, said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like the Iranians in Syria?\u201d he paraphrases the Russian message to the Saudis. \u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re there to keep an eye on them.\u201d\n\nThe Turks loathe Syria\u2019s leader, Bashar al-Assad. Russia is Assad\u2019s staunchest ally, yet Russia just sold an antiaircraft missile system to Turkey.\n\nAD\n\nNow Putin wants to sell one to Saudi Arabia, too. Plus a nuclear power plant.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia appreciates Russia\u2019s active role in this region and in the world,\u201d King Salman bin Abdulaziz said Monday as he opened talks with Putin.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn Soviet times, relations between Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union were at a rather low level. In recent years, the quality of our relations has changed dramatically. We consider Saudi Arabia a friendly nation,\u201d Putin responded.\n\nAnalysts say that American confusion, bungling and missteps \u2014 especially in the past few days \u2014 have opened the door to the Middle East for Russia. Moscow, by not talking about human rights and transparency, is a welcome change of pace from the West, they say. Putin finds common ground with leaders as diverse as Assad of Syria, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Hassan Rouhani of Iran and even Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Russians do not scold the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist.\n\nBut experts question whether Russia, having established diplomatic beachheads, has the means to bend the Middle East to its will. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough oomph to turn it,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, a former U.S. diplomat who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe American withdrawal from Syria gives Russia an even freer hand in that country. Turkey\u2019s invasion of Kurdish areas does not directly threaten Russia\u2019s interests. In fact, it offered Russians the opportunity to persuade the Kurds to start talks with Assad\u2019s government. The mutual recriminations between Turkey and the United States \u2014 two NATO allies \u2014 give Russia even more to build on as it attempts to weaken the Western alliance.\n\nDmitri Trenin, head of the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, said in a tweet that Russia\u2019s influence in Syria \u201chas been again tested and proven strong\u201d by the Kurds\u2019 decision to talk to Damascus. \u201cKeeping contacts with all, including Turkey, and having a clear view of one\u2019s own interests and thus a coherent policy is paying off.\u201d\n\nYet the dramatic turn of events of the past few days has led to signs of an underlying uneasiness among some in Moscow.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Turkish military invasion in the north of Syria has only complicated the situation in the region,\u201d Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Federation Council, Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament, wrote on his blog. \u201cTrying to solve its problem by military means, Turkey creates a new one and exacerbates the old ones.\u201d\n\nInvading a neighboring country, he wrote, is not an effective counterterrorism tactic.\n\nRussia, he concluded, must call for more substantial dialogue.\n\nThere is not a great deal else it can do while it waits to see how the invasion plays out.\n\nVladimir Dzhabarov, the deputy head of the Federation Council foreign affairs committee, suggested that Russia and the United States could jointly broker further talks between the Kurds and Assad\u2019s government.\n\nAD\n\nSyria is just one item on the agenda during Putin\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The price of oil is another \u2014 both Riyadh and Moscow believe its price should not be allowed to go too high. Russia wants to pursue a number of energy and military deals \u2014 that nuclear power plant being one of them. They will also talk about the attacks on a Saudi oil refinery last month and on an Iranian tanker on Friday. Another topic sure to come up is war-torn Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and Iran back opposing sides \u2014 both of which, as it happens, have had cordial talks with the Russians.\n\nAD\n\nIt is a balancing act for Moscow: Sow some friendship with one side, then the other; sow some uncertainty at the same time, get some deals done, some boots on the ground. Katz argues that Russia does not have an actual strategic goal for the Middle East. It wants to continue as a player and prevent any one side from becoming dominant.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dependent on keeping the pot simmering but not boiling over,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nIt is not clear, he said, that is possible in the long run.\n\nAD", "description": "Putin travels to Saudi Arabia for discussions on all sorts of topics, from Syria to Iran to oil.", "authors": ["Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=128", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
