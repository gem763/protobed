The Glocks were only four of the 45 illegal firearms the pair admitted to trafficking from Virginia to the District and Maryland over the past two years.\n\nEven from jail, Giles asked Pearce about \u201cthe list\u201d \u2014 meaning Armslist, an online firearm marketplace \u2014 and prices for various guns.\n\nOf the guns sold by Giles and Pearce, 17 have been recovered in criminal investigations; five were in the hands of felons, prosecutors said. One gun was used in an armed robbery, they said. And one buyer is now accused of murder in Prince George\u2019s County, Md.\n\nThe two 22-year-olds were sentenced Friday in Alexandria federal court: Giles to 33 months in prison and Pearce to 12. Both pleaded guilty earlier this year.\n\n\u201cYou had to know people were willing to pay more for these guns because they couldn\u2019t buy them themselves,\u201d Judge Liam O\u2019Grady told Giles. \u201cThey wound up in the hands of some very dangerous people.\u201d\n\n\n\nDarius Antonio Giles (U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia)\n\nAuthorities in the District and Virginia have been trying to crack down on the flow of illegal guns across state lines by going after sellers like Giles and Pearce. More than one-third of illegal firearms in the District come from Virginia, according to statistics from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nTo buy guns, Giles stole the identity of a Virginia man, Malik Yarborough, who was himself a felon and thus barred from having firearms.\n\nBut private gun sellers in Virginia are barred from doing business only with people they have \u201creason to believe\u201d are prohibited. To would-be sellers, Giles said he was a D.C. firefighter who had only a copy of his ID because he lost the original. It was up to the sellers how diligent to be. One searched online and saw that Yarborough was a felon. Another cut off contact after Giles was unable to provide proof he was a firefighter, saying he left his badge at work and didn\u2019t want to share his pay stubs. But one buyer was \u201ccomfortable\u201d just being told that Yarborough was a firefighter.\n\nAfter the car chase, Giles became a felon. Ultimately, one buyer realized that he was dealing with someone who couldn\u2019t sell guns and alerted ATF, sparking a sting operation. When he was arrested in February, Giles gave his brother\u2019s name.\n\nIn court Friday, public defender Kevin Wilson said Giles was just one of several people using the same false name to sell guns and was not a ringleader. Giles got involved in selling guns at 19, he said, after seeing a gun ad online and the huge potential profits.\n\n\n\nTwo brothers illegally trafficked from Virginia to D.C. or Maryland in the past two years; one texted this photo of a Sig Sauer handgun to an associate in 2017. (U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia)\n\n\u201cHe saw that as a way he could make money,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nIn a letter to the court, Pearce said he \u201cinvolved myself in some nonsense\u201d because of his older brother \u2014 \u201che was my downfall.\u201d\n\nWhen he is released, he said, he plans to move his family to rural Maryland, \u201cwhere I don\u2019t have to worry about my girls going outside to play.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAlleged leaker says Espionage Act charges violate First Amendment\n\nHe put 224 guns on the streets.
