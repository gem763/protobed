Aramco is shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities, Aramco officials told reporters. [nL5N26B59G]\n\nAramco already brought back part of the lost production and will return to pre-attacks level end of September, Nasser said.\n\n\u201cNot a single shipment to our international customers has been missed or canceled as a result of the attacks, and we will continue to fulfill our mission of providing the energy the world needs,\u201d he said in the message, seen by Reuters.\n\nEnergy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had used its reserves to maintain oil supply flows to customers abroad and inside the kingdom.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks.\n\nSaudi Arabia says 18 drones and three missiles were fired at Abqaiq, the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility, while the Khurais facility was hit by four missiles.\n\nNo casualties were reported at either site even though thousands of workers and contractors work and live in the area.", "description": "Saudi Aramco has emerged from attacks on its oil facilities \"stronger than ever\", Chief Executive Amin Nasser told employees in a message, adding that full oil production would resume by the end of this month.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432274599&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K063", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
