Or how there were no standards for police questioning.'\n\nAnother added: 'Blimey, unbelievable that this could happen. 70s Britain was grim and 80s was not much better. Police left to their own devices.'\n\nThey added: 'I like to think this wouldn't happen now?'\n\nIn 1972, police received a phonecall to a house fire in Catford, Lewisham. In the early hours of the next day, the body of Maxwell Confait had been found.\n\nHowever, the room that he had been found in had been untouched by the fire and marks on his neck showed that he had been strangled.\n\nViewers were shocked by the documentary, with many calling the treatment of the boys 'unbelievable' and 'scary'\n\nA murder investigation was launched and soon after Maxwell's death, the police picked up three teenage boys for lighting a series of small fires nearby.\n\nThey were Colin Lattimore, 18, Ronnie Leighton, 15 and Ahmet Salih, 14, who lived close to where Maxwell had been murdered.\n\nThe boys were taken in for questioning but in the 1970s, the teenagers were treated like other suspects and had few rights.\n\nThey could be interviewed without a lawyer or a parent or guardian present and the police could interrogate them for as long as they wanted.\n\nColin Lattimore, 18, Ronnie Leighton, 15, and Ahmet Salih, 14, made false confessions to murder under police interrogation\n\nInterviews took place in cell blocks and with no independent witnesses, the only version of what was said during the interrogation came from the police themselves.\n\nBarrister Jonathan Caplan QC said: 'The culture was that the police decided how the suspects were treated.\n\n'They decided how the interrogations were conducted. They decided what rules to apply. Everything was at the discretion of the officer in charge of the case.'\n\nFollowing hours of interrogation, each boy admitted to the small fires that had been started in the Catford area and confessed to the fire at Doggett Road and the murder of Maxwell.\n\nThe teenagers were arrested on suspicion of arson and the murder of Maxwell Confait in 1972, after he was found dead in his flat\n\nMaxwell as found dead in his flat in Deptford, where he was found to have strangulation marks on his neck\n\nThe families of the boys were called to the police station to sign the statements to validate the police's account of what happened.\n\nColin's brother Gary recalled how his parents knew Colin - who had learning difficulties - hadn't committed the crime he had been accused of and falsely admitted to.\n\n'No way was Colin capable of murdering anyone. He was scared of his own shadow.\n\n'Colin couldn\u2019t read or write. He didn\u2019t act like an 18-year-old man, he was more like an eight-year-old. He was a boy in a man\u2019s body.'\n\nHowever, Colin, Ahmet and Ronnie were all charged with murder and went on trial for the crimes.\n\nGary Lattimore said his brother Colin was 'incapable' of murdering anyone, saying: 'He was scared of his own shadow'\n\nDespite them all protesting their innocence and Colin having an alibi for the time Maxwell was killed, the jury took just three and a half hours to deliver guilty verdicts for all three teenagers.\n\nAhmet was sentenced to four years at a reformatory centre, Ronnie was convicted of murder and Colin was convicted of manslaughter with diminished responsibility.\n\nBoth Ronnie and Colin received life sentences.\n\nShocked by the result, Colin's dad George wrote letters to The Queen and members of the parliament to try raise awareness of the case and the miscarriage of justice he believed took place.\n\nJonathan Caplan QC was assigned to Colin's case to overturn the miscarriage of justice and helped determine the truth behind Maxwell's time of death\n\nThe three teenagers went on to be declared innocent of all charges after appeal judges quashed their convictions in October 1975\n\nFortunately, one of George's letters reached the National Council of Civil Liberties and Jonathan Caplan QC was assigned to his case.\n\nWanting an independent forensic review to determine the truth behind Maxwell's time of death, Jonathan enlisted the help of Professor Donald Tear, a pathologist whose findings went against the initial findings that had been made by another pathologist Dr Cameron.\n\nAt the same time, the case gained media attention when Labour MP Christopher Price took the story to Thames Television.\n\nAn episode of This Week - which was watched by eight million people at the time - was dedicated to the case which resulted in speculation about how and why the three teens made false confessions.\n\nViewers were shocked by Catching Britain's Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us last night, and called the treatment of Colin Lattimore, 18, Ronnie Leighton, 15, and Ahmet Salih, 14, 'unbelievable'\n\nLabour MP Christopher Price took the story to Thames Television and helped campaign for the boys innocence\n\nIn it, Professor Tear confirmed that Maxwell's time of death would have been around 8 or 9 o'clock not between 6.30 and 10.30pm as stated by the previous pathologist.\n\nWith press attention mounting, the case was sent to the Court of Appeal and was successfully heard in the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\nOn 17 October 1975, after listening to the new evidence which saw Colin's alibi stand up, the appeal judges quashed the convictions and declared the boys innocent of all charges.\n\nGary said he and his parents were always sure of his brother's innocence, saying: 'My parents absolutely knew Colin hadn't done it'\n\nAs the story made headlines in newspapers across the country, the false confessions from the three teens raised fundamental questions about the police conduct and the wider justice system.\n\nOne month after the appeal, an inquiry was launched into the case and was led by top judge Henry Fisher.\n\nThe inquiry set to find out how the boys confessed to something they didn't do.\n\nThe wrongful conviction of Colin, Ronnie, and Ahmet led to the introduction of the Police Criminal Evidence Act 1984\n\nAs the findings were revealed, Fisher publicly criticised how the boys were treated by the police but in an unexpected turn of events, he also claimed that the boys were involved in the fire and the murder of Maxwell.\n\nWhat is PACE? The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (otherwise known as PACE) was introduced. The aim of PACE is to establish a balance between the powers of the police in and the rights and freedoms of the public. It safeguards suspects by giving them the right to have a lawyer present during questioning, taping the interview and having a parent or guardian present during an interview with a suspect under the age of 16. As well as the Maxwell Confait case, the 1981 Brixton Riots also acted as key factors in the passage of the act.\n\nThe Royal Commission went on to investigate police powers and when the Royal Commission published its recommendations about police reform, the government was quick to draft a new bill turning its findings into law.\n\nAs a result, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (otherwise known as PACE) was introduced.\n\nThe act safeguards suspects by giving them the right to have a lawyer present during questioning, taping the interview and having a parent or guardian present during an interview with a suspect under the age of 16.\n\nSpeaking of the act which has transformed the way suspects are treated, former Magistrate Baroness Hayter said: 'This was all extraordinarily quite new but one has to remember that partly it came from a tragedy, it came from a miscarriage of justice in the Confait case.\n\n'Maybe the lesson is that it takes a crisis to make a change happen.'\n\nViewers were shocked by the case and the behaviour of the police, with many taking to Twitter to reveal their horror.\n\nOne commented: 'Thank God things have moved on. Scary stuff back then.'\n\nAnother added: 'Watching Catching Britain's killers already astonishing what the police could do in 72.'", "description": "Viewers were shocked by the behaviour of police in BBC Two's 'Catching Britain's Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us' which revealed the miscarriage of justice in the Maxwell Confait case.", "authors": ["Deepika Rajani For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/09/20121916-0-image-a-22_1571906150139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
