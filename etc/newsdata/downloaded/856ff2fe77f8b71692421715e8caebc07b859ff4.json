He was later pronounced dead by medical personnel at 2:20 p.m. Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Wednesday.\n\nHernandez-Diaz\u2019s death is still under investigation, though ICE reported that he appeared to have strangled himself.\n\nHernandez-Diaz had been in ICE custody for nearly five months. He initially applied for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas, in May, The Associated Press reported.\n\nBorder agents deemed the immigrant \u201cinadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\u201d ICE said in its news release. He was transferred to ICE custody on May 20.\n\nHernandez-Diaz\u2019s wife, Yarelis Gutierrez, told BuzzFeed News that her husband was seeking asylum in the U.S. after speaking out against leaders of the Cuban government and being persecuted for it.\n\nGutierrez also said that immigration officials had asked her husband to provide more evidence to support his asylum claims, which proved difficult because he was in a detention center, according to BuzzFeed.\n\n\u201cHe told me he was going to participate in a hunger strike because of the abuse he endured in detention,\u201d Gutierrez told the news site. \u201cHe never said he was going to hurt or kill himself. This is all news to me, and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nThe Richwood Correctional Center, a private detention facility operated by LaSalle Corrections, began housing undocumented immigrants earlier this year after signing a deal with ICE to take in detainees.\n\nRichwood has a history of guards being accused of using excessive force and intentionally causing emotional distress, according to local reports.\n\nIn June, a former prison guard captain was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to pepper-spraying two handcuffed inmates who were on their knees in 2016, AP reported at the time. Four other guards pleaded guilty for their part in the same incident.\n\nHernandez-Diaz is the second undocumented adult in ICE custody who has died this month and the eighth to die this year, according to a tally kept by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nNebane Abienwi, a 37-year-old man from Cameroon, died earlier this month after suffering a brain hemorrhage, according to ICE. Abienwi was in ICE custody for less than a month.", "description": "The asylum-seeker was found unresponsive in his cell at Louisiana's Richwood Correctional Center, which has a history of violence.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da7a8432100007d1034a2c6.jpeg?cache=cbgorwow64&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
