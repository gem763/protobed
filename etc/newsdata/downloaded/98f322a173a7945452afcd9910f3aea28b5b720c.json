One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.\n\nAt least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.\n\nPolice, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.\n\nThe water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.\n\nPOLICE PROJECTILES: Tear gas and other weapons fired from a Hong Kong pedestrian footbridge #HongKongProtests #\u9999\u6e2f pic.twitter.com/ZrC3Flmim4 \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) September 29, 2019\n\nTensions already rising this Sunday.

They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted \u201cI love China\u201d.\n\nAngela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were \u201cthugs\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the government takes violent action I don\u2019t object,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tolerated enough.

But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia\u2019s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.\n\nMany wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled \u201cstand with Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cfight for freedom,\u201d while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.", "description": "As China's National Day approaches, police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9080a42400005e00d4427c.jpeg?cache=mudofte09e&ops=1778_1000"}
