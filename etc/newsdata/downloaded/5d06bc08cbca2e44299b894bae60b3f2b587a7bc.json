The main differences between the play, by James Leo Herlihy, in which Lynley had appeared triumphantly the year before on Broadway, and the film were that, on screen, the word abortion is never uttered and the girl has the baby.\n\nLater on, in the adult phase of her career, Lynley was a member of the stellar cast trying to survive when a luxury liner capsizes in The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Before the ship is hit by disaster, her character, Nonnie Parry, the onboard singer, delivers the Oscar-winning song The Morning After (though Lynley was actually dubbed by Ren\u00e9e Armand).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carol Lynley on the set of The Poseidon Adventure, 1972. \u2018It was the most physically demanding role you can possibly imagine,\u2019 she recalled.

They hosed us down at least 20 times a day. And there were no safety precautions for the first two weeks of shooting. I\u2019d be up there on the catwalk and if I slipped, it was six stories straight down through flames to a concrete floor. I went through 10 or 15 pairs of shorts because they kept shrinking.\u201d\n\nBorn Carole Ann Jones in New York, she was the daughter of Frances (nee Felch) and Cyril Jones. After her parents divorced, when she was a toddler, her mother worked as a waitress until Carol was in demand as a child model, becoming the family\u2019s primary breadwinner. This led her into acting, and she appeared on Broadway in Graham Greene\u2019s family drama The Potting Shed (1957) and Blue Denim (1958).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carol Lynley with Brandon deWilde in Blue Denim, 1959.

It was then that 20th Century Fox offered her a contract, casting her in ingenue parts in three pictures in 1959, opposite three of their promising young male stars: Brandon deWilde in Blue Denim, Gary Crosby in Holiday for Lovers and Fabian in Hound-Dog Man.\n\nLynley made the cover of magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Life and Seventeen as well as doing TV commercials for hair dye and toothpaste. She had also begun making guest star appearances in television series, starting with Alfred Hitchcock Presents, in an episode directed by Robert Altman, The Young One (1957), in which she played a rebellious girl who will do anything to escape being raised by her domineering aunt.\n\nThe studio began to give her more mature roles, such as the female lead in Return to Peyton Place (1961), as the author of the scandalous novel who is in love with her married publisher (Jeff Chandler). The rather lame sequel to Peyton Place did not do much to boost her career.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carol Lynley in Bunny Lake Is Missing, 1965. She held her own against actors such as Laurence Olivier and Anna Massey. Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nLynley managed to show acting range despite rather limited parts, such as a rival to Joanne Woodward in the title role of The Stripper; the reluctant target of a lecherous landlord (Jack Lemmon) in Under the Yum Yum Tree; and a psychiatric patient in Shock Treatment, all in 1963. She was well cast as the \u201cblonde bombshell\u201d star Jean Harlow in Harlow (1965), a cheaply made biopic, which got the better of the glossier Paramount production starring Carroll Baker released at the same time with the same title and subject.\n\nPerhaps Lynley\u2019s most prestigious film was the mystery thriller Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), one of Otto Preminger\u2019s better late films. As an American single mother in London whose four-year-old daughter has disappeared from her nursery school, Lynley held her own among an excellent British cast that included Laurence Olivier, No\u00ebl Coward and Anna Massey. In the same year, Lynley posed nude for Playboy magazine and began a relationship with the broadcaster David Frost.\n\nDespite the decline of her film career in the 1970s and 80s, when she was forced to appear in shoestring straight-to-video movies, Lynley continued to get work in TV series such as Kojak, The Love Boat and Fantasy Island.\n\nYears later, when she was approached by a potential biographer, she explained: \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a scandal. I\u2019ve never been caught running naked down a highway. I\u2019ve not tried to shoot anybody. Nobody\u2019s ever tried to shoot me. My child is legitimate ... I\u2019ve never been to Betty Ford ... No porn ... No drug addictions ... I\u2019ve outlived three of my doctors. So if you\u2019re going to write a juicy book, you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Jill, from her marriage to the publicist Michael Selsman, which ended in 1964 in divorce.\n\n\u2022 Carol Lynley (Carole Ann Jones), actor, born 13 February 1942; died 3 September 2019", "description": "American actor best known for her roles in The Poseidon Adventure, Blue Denim and Bunny Lake Is Missing", "authors": ["Ronald Bergan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c3d96dd4179100fdb0cbab4138cc4f1ae7c4b05/0_36_1863_1117/master/1863.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4d314a677cf2b0adebfc2b831c8df91", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
