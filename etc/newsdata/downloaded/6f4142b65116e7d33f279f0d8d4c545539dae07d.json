A day before, he and Mr. Pence had announced the agreement in Ankara, the Turkish capital.", "description": "A day after Vice President Mike Pence announced a pause in the battle between Turkish and Kurdish forces, shelling continued on Friday, raising questions about the deal\u2019s feasibility.", "authors": ["Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/world/18Syria1/18Syria1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
