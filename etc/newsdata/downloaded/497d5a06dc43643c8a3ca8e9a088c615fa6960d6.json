The major Texas metros\u2014Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin\u2014have collectively grown by more than 3 million since 2010. The most popular destinations for movers are now Phoenix, Dallas, and Las Vegas, which welcome more than 100,000 new people each year.\n\nUntil recently, domestic out-migration was counteracted by international immigration. From 2010 to 2018, immigration accounted for more than 100 percent of population growth in the New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia metros, and more than 80 percent of population growth in the Los Angeles and Boston areas, according to analysis by the Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.\n\nWhat was celebrated as an urban renaissance was in large part an urban-immigration renaissance. In New York City\u2019s five boroughs, the foreign-born share of the population increased from 18 percent in the 1970s to nearly 40 percent today, approaching its early 20th century highs. Following the 1965 Immigration Act, Los Angeles County\u2019s immigrant population saw almost the exact same increase. Incidentally, this is a good thing: Families and young people moving to the U.S. from places such as the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, and Vietnam enrich their new neighborhood\u2019s culture, provide necessary labor\u2014both \u201chigh skill,\u201d like engineering, and \u201clow skill,\u201d like home health assistance\u2014and generate a disproportionate share of new businesses.\n\nIn the past few years, however, population growth in the New York and Los Angeles areas has stalled. For the first time in decades, the nation\u2019s two biggest metros are getting smaller at the same time. Immigrants aren\u2019t coming in at the same rate they used to, and native-born Americans are leaving even faster. Why?\n\nAn easy answer is that America\u2019s suburbs and small cities are not only cheaper than the biggest metros; they\u2019re also not so different from the biggest metros, anymore. In the past decade, urban developers, working off the Instagram blueprint, have standardized an MVMP\u2014Minimum Viable Millennial Product\u2014so that the move from Brooklyn to Boise means trading one set of hipster coffee shops, fast-casual joints, and cocktail bars for another set. Even the ground-floor retail differences between various metros becomes less important as more shopping moves online, where residents of every zip code are looking at the came social-media catalog and visiting the same digital mall.\n\nTo see what\u2019s more deeply afflicting these metros, it\u2019s useful to understand the plight of Chicago, whose growth after the Great Recession was just a blip in an otherwise long period of decline. Some of Chicago\u2019s problems are unique among large metros. It sits on the far hip of the Rust Belt, hundreds of miles from the coastal economic juggernauts, and it has a homicide rate twice that of New York or L.A.", "description": "After a post-recession boomlet, the New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago areas are all seeing their population decline.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTR22D25/facebook.jpg?1567779867", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
