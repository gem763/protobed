It will next be visible from Earth in 2061.\n\nOrionids are named after Orion, because the meteors seem to emerge or radiate from the same area in the sky as the constellation.\n\nAs ever, the best way to see them is to get as far away from light pollution as possible and just look upwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat time is the Orionid meteor shower tonight?\n\nComposite image of the Orionids Meteor shower taken over the McCloud Falls in Northern California.

When the sun begins to rise they will be much harder to see.\n\nThey will still be visible until around November 7, but tonight and tomorrow night are your best chance to see them.\n\nHow best to see the Orionid Meteor Shower\n\nThe Orionids meteor shower in full flow (Shutterstock / Brian Spencer)\n\nThere really is nothing special you have to do, simply get outside and look up, although you may have to be prepared to wait for a while.\n\nThe less light that is shining in surrounding areas the better, and your eyes will have to get used to the dark.\n\nHere\u2019s a few top tips for getting into the meteor-spotting mindset:\n\nFind a secluded viewing spot, away from the city lights. Once at the venue, your eyes may take 15 to 20 minutes to get used to the dark.\n\nDress for the weather, and make sure you are comfortable, especially if you plan to stay out long. Bring a blanket or a comfortable chair with you\u2014meteor watching can be a waiting game.\n\nOnce you have found your viewing spot, lie down on the ground and look up in the direction of the radiant. Use our Interactive Meteor Shower Sky Map or the table above to find the current direction of the radiant in the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat will the weather be like?\n\nPASS IT ON: The Orionid meteor shower peaks Monday night through the predawn hours of Tuesday morning.
