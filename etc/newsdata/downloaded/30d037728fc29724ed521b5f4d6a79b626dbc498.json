And if someone has a sprained ankle, you\u2019re not going to push on him more. With us, once our brain gets to a point of spraining, people do everything to make it worse.\u201d\n\nAt a recent Sunday Service in Utah, West defended his decision to back Trump; last October, he delivered a lengthy soliloquy to a president who many deem racist, telling him he loved him to the dismay of many Democrats and fellow artists.\n\nOn Thursday, he offered another explanation: \u201cFor the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God\u2019s practical joke to all liberals. Like, \u2018No! Not Kanye!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn that wide-ranging interview aired with Apple Music, West also said a 10th, \u201cSunday Service\u201d inspired album could drop on Christmas.\n\nConsidering the shambolic \u201cJesus Is King\u201d rollout, fans probably shouldn\u2019t plan a listening session under the tree just yet.\n\n\u201cThe more I am in service to God, I just clear my head and just wake up more empty every day and let God do the driving and just use me as he may,\u201d West said in the interview.\n\n\u201cYou make plans and God laughs.\u201d", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Critically acclaimed rapper, award-winning producer, fashion designer, Donald Trump supporter, Kim Kardashian\u2019s husband", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/e5dfbd_kanye-west-performs-jesus-is-king-album-film-experience-in-california-yeezy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
