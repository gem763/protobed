The Chinese government, apparently.\n\nChinese censors have banned the release of Christopher Robin, a new film adaptation of AA Milne\u2019s beloved story about Winnie the Pooh, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Winnie the Pooh character has become a lighthearted way for people across China to mock their president, Xi Jinping, but it seems the government doesn\u2019t find the joke very funny.\n\nChina's Twitter erases John Oliver after scathing Xi Jinping skit Read more\n\nIt started when Xi visited the US in 2013, and an image of Xi and then president Barack Obama walking together spurred comparisons to Winnie \u2013 a portly Xi \u2013 walking with Tigger, a lanky Obama.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Winnie the Pooh characters alongside Xi Jinping and Barack Obama.

The website of US television station HBO was blocked last month after comedian John Oliver repeatedly made fun of the Chinese president\u2019s apparent sensitivity over comparisons of his figure with that of Winnie. The segment also focused on China\u2019s dismal human rights record.\n\nAnother comparison between Xi and Winnie during a military parade in 2015 became that year\u2019s most censored image, according to Global Risk Insights. The firm said the Chinese government viewed the meme as \u201ca serious effort to undermine the dignity of the presidential office and Xi himself\u201d.\n\n\u201cAuthoritarian regimes are often touchy, yet the backlash is confusing since the government is effectively squashing an potential positive, and organic, public image campaign for Xi,\u201d the report said at the time. \u201cBeijing\u2019s reaction is doubly odd given the fact that Xi has made substantial efforts to create a cult of personality showing him as a benevolent ruler.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the film\u2019s rejection by the authorities may be that China only allows 34 foreign films to be released in cinemas each year. That leaves Hollywood summer blockbusters, family films and contenders from across the world jockeying for a tiny number of spots.\n\nChristopher Robin is the second Disney film to be denied a release this year, after A Wrinkle in Time was blocked, while the studio\u2019s Ant Man and the Wasp will open this month.", "description": "Memes likening Xi to the portly Pooh have become a vehicle in China to mock the country\u2019s leader", "authors": ["Benjamin Haas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a96cee8d7055ecfcdaf089bb8241a2a09951acf/80_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3c7516d0893b0cf4a239f092407464c7", "published_at": "2018-08-07"}
