Lindsey Graham slammed congressional Democrats as \"sore losers\" for proceeding with the impeachment of President Trump, claiming their efforts would get \"not one vote\" from Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\"You have to accept that President Trump is president,\u201d Graham said in reference to House Democrats' plan to move forward with impeachment. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. They don\u2019t accept that President Trump won the election, and America hates a sore loser as much as any country on the planet. This is an unfair process being driven by sore losers, and there is not one vote [from Republicans] in the United States Senate to impeach President Trump based on this phone call because he did nothing wrong.\"\n\nGraham's defense of Trump comes just two days after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that there would be a resolution in the House to begin impeachment proceedings against the president. \"This week, we will bring a resolution to the Floor that affirms the ongoing, existing investigation that is currently being conducted by our committees as part of this impeachment inquiry, including all requests for documents, subpoenas for records, and testimony, and any other investigative steps previously taken or to be taken as part of this investigation,\" her Monday statement said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pelosi and other House Democrats clarified that the resolution being introduced on Thursday was not an \"impeachment resolution.\"\n\n\"This is not an impeachment resolution,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday morning. \u201cI don\u2019t know what an impeachment resolution is.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans in both the House and Senate have been critical of Democrats and their choice to hold early impeachment-related hearings in secret. Last week, dozens of House GOP members stormed the Capitol basement and barged into the secret room where former Department of Defense official Laura Cooper was being questioned by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"A whole bunch of Republican Congress members who were duly elected just tried to get in to find out what is going on in their closed hearings, because we were elected to Congress and we don\u2019t even know what is going on,\u201d said Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona.", "description": "South Carolina Sen.
