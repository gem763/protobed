They wrote that any failure to comply with their requests on Pence\u2019s part \u201cshall constitute evidence of obstruction of justice of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s office released a statement saying it had received the letter after it was released to the media, and that \u201cGiven the scope [of the letter], it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the three committee chairmen released records of text messages between several U.S. officials that imply the White House tried to coordinate investigations of foreign meddling in the 2016 presidential election and a Ukrainian natural-gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat with Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nHouse Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry against Trump last week after allegations arose that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to conduct an investigation that would damage Joe Biden, his political rival.", "description": "House Democrats on Friday demanded Vice President Mike Pence turn over documents they consider relevant to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
