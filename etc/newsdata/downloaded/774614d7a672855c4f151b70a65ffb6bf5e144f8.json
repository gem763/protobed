Don\u2019t play her game.", "language": "en", "text": "Advice columnist\n\nDear Carolyn: I just got engaged to one of four brothers who are very close. My fiance's oldest brother has been married to \"Jackie\" for a year. I sense Jackie is used to getting a lot of attention for being \"the daughter we always wanted\" to my future parents-in-law, and may also have some vision of herself as the up-and-coming family matriarch (gag).\n\nI don't care about any of this; I am just doing my own thing and hoping to get along with everyone. I happen to be a nurse practitioner and the first medical professional to join the family. I do not brag about this or really talk about it, but the family likes to bring it up when introducing me to new people.\n\nJackie seems to find it threatening and has started telling everyone who will listen that she also has a \"nursing degree,\" which is technically true but pretty misleading. She has an associate degree from a college where she took some pre-nursing courses, but her degree itself is in something else and she never attempted any licensure exams.\n\nWhile I get these weird misstatements are about her and not me, and are not hurting anyone (unless she tries to intervene in someone's medical emergency), it drives me crazy that she's trying to make a competition out of something that isn't one, and I'd really like to nip it in the bud. Any suggestions?\n\n\u2014 It's Not a Competition!\n\nIt\u2019s Not a Competition!: I hear the rest of the family in the kitchen making popcorn.\n\nBut I also hope you and Jackie deny them that satisfaction.\n\nIf it\u2019s not a competition, then prove it by forfeiting \u2014 or outright losing. Voluntarily, kindly, joyously, every time.\n\nPlease take this in the spirit it is intended, as an attempt to be helpful from someone who has spent a lifetime managing (or failing to manage) her own competitive impulses: Jackies can only drive you crazy if you do \u201ccare about any of this,\u201d on some level.\n\nYou can see through Jackie\u2019s attention cravings, not care to be anyone\u2019s matriarch, not need to be the daughter anyone \u201calways wanted\u201d \u2014 I believe you on all counts, by the way \u2014 and still not like the sensation of someone else thinking she beat you. So admit that to yourself. You can know intellectually you\u2019re not competing and still feel a mad impulse to say, \u201cHA HA, LOSER, I DON\u2019T EVEN CARE.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s where you can make a difference in your relationship with Jackie. Recognize the competitive feelings she triggers in you with her competitiveness; be prepared with a healthy outlet for those feelings so you don\u2019t react in the moment (laugh them off, walk them off, repeat a restorative mantra, resuscitate someone); and adopt the type of cooperative mind-set that eases insecurities vs. inflaming them. Such as:\n\n\u25cfGive her time to adjust to you.\n\n\u25cfDon\u2019t judge her forever on her struggle with this.\n\n\u25cfRemember her humanity.\n\n\u25cfNote her strengths.\n\n\u25cfSeek her opinions.\n\n\u25cfLearn when and how to change subjects gracefully.\n\n\u25cfNurture an alliance, if not a friendship.\n\n\u25cfSwear off pettiness in all its forms.\n\nMarriage into a close family comes with a duty not to be the reason it stops being close. If you can\u2019t be pro-Jackie, then be as Jackie-neutral as a person can be.", "description": "Admitting that you do care at least a little bit is the first step in letting it all go.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
