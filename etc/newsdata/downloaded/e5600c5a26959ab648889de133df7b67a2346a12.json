Read on to discover our pick of six interior projects that will transform your home - and with 3 for 2 across all paints and 3 for 2 across flooring and tiles* at B&Q, now is the perfect time to liven up your living space...\n\nUPSCALE YOUR LIVING SPACE\n\nMake it yours: One way to put your stamp on the place is to paint the walls. But rather than sticking to the traditional one colour or feature wall, why not get creative with angular shapes\n\nYou don't need a lot of space - or to own your house - to make it feel like home.\n\nTOP TIP: HOW TO CREATE CRISP LINES WITH PAINT Such a bold look might sound difficult to achieve but it's actually easier than you think: Mark out the areas where you would like using masking tape and a rule, and treat this as the guide for when you paint. Work in 'W' shaped strokes for better coverage, followed by vertical strokes. As soon as you've finished painting, pull of your masking tape in a strong, diagonal motion to create a clean finish.\n\nOne way to put your stamp on a room is to paint the walls. But rather than sticking to the traditional one colour or feature wall, why not get creative with bold, angular shapes in somewhere unexpected, like the corner of the room.\n\nWe love the idea of creating a cool, Scandinavian-inspired vibe with shades of yellow and a pink (why not try the GoodHome Durable Matt Emulsion Paint 2.5L \u00a316, \u00a36.40 per L in Gran Via and Kyoto). For extra 'wow factor' carry this onto part of the ceiling.\n\nNot sure about taking the plunge with a bright colour? Try the visualiser tool to see what shades work best. It might be that contrasting neutrals, or deep colours are a better fit.\n\nTo create a room that feels unified, think about changing out the flooring, too.\n\nAn easy to install laminate flooring is perfect for the living room because it's durable and easy to maintain. One that looks amazing with the bright, bold colour scheme is the Rockhampton Grey Oak Effect Laminate (\u00a38 per m2, \u00a319.74 pack) .\n\nZONE THE KIDS\u2019 BEDROOMS\n\nSleep, work and play: Help your child create distinct 'zones' within their bedroom - and get ready to change it as they grow older. We love adding touches of personality on the walls\n\nTreat your kids - and yourself - by upscaling your little ones' bedrooms so they fit in with the rest of your stylish and sophisticated home.\n\nChildren need to be able to play, sleep and work in their rooms, so why not think about creating three distinct zones within the same room? A fresh and fun way to do this is by choosing a different colour scheme for each of the areas.\n\nSLEEP\n\nThe most important thing your little one will do in their bedroom is sleep. To help soothe them at the end of a long day, think about adding a tranquil colour like burgundy to the area around their bed. Our pick is the GoodHome Durable Matt Emulsion in Kensington (2.5L \u00a316, \u00a36.40 per L).\n\nThis sort of paint is a great pick for children's bedrooms because it is stain resistant and wonderfully 'scrubbable', making it a perfect choice for grubby fingers!\n\nMake it feel comfy and cosy by layering texture through accessories like a squishable GoodHome Easton Cushion (\u00a38) , or a blanket that's perfect for curling up in.\n\nFor a good night's sleep, think about adding a blackout blind like the Colours Ilas Corded Grey Blackout Roller Blind, which will help keep the sunlight out.\n\nINSTANT REFRESH: UPCYCLE A DESK CHAIR First, clean with sugar soap and then lightly sand the surface. Paint at least two coats with a round brush, perfect for those finer details. Finish with GoodHome furniture durable lacquer for added protection from knocks and scratches\n\nWORK\n\nWorking at home doesn't have to feel like a chore for your child. Start by helping the mind focus with a neutral colour like Manhattan for the area around the desk.\n\nBring a splash of colour into this zone by upcycling their desk chair with a lick of furniture paint like the GoodHome Flat Matt Furniture Paint (500ml \u00a39, \u00a318 per L) in Milltown.\n\nPLAY\n\nStimulate your child's imagination with an inspiring shade of yellow like Gran Via) on the wall of their 'play' area.\n\nTo make the room feel uniquely 'theirs' think about applying the paint in bold angles or geometric shapes. You could create a large diagonal point in a corner, for example, to transform otherwise dead space into a cosy nook.\n\nOn the walls, think about hanging their favourite illustration, or a drawing they are proud of.\n\nFind out how to create a chillout zone here.\n\nREVIVE A TIRED HALLWAY\n\nMore than an afterthought: Give your hallway the attention it deserves. We love the idea of separating the upper and lower parts of the wall to create the illusion of height\n\nREVEALED: 3 STEPS TO PAINTING SUCCESS PREPARE It\u2019s worth spending a little time and care over preparing your walls before you paint. It\u2019s important that walls are given a really good clean to ensure they\u2019re free from grease, dust and bits of wallpaper. Don\u2019t forget to fill holes and cracks, and sand down flaky plaster. DO Coat the whole roller in paint. Use a extension pole for any spaces you can\u2019t reach. Starting from the highest point, use a brush to cut around the edges. TOP TIP: Work in `W\u2019 shaped strokes for better coverage, followed by vertical strokes. FINISH Water-based paint can be washed off brushes with water and soap. If you\u2019ve used oil or solvent-based paint, put the bristles in an appropriate cleaner. Once your tools are clean and dry store brushes upside down and rollers flat.

And for guests, it\u2019s the very first impression of your home.\n\nBut despite the important role a hallway plays, it can so often be forgotten when it comes to decorating and designing as a space in its own right.\n\nWhy not give the hallway an instant refresh by painting a colour halfway up the wall to create an illusion of space and light.\n\nChoose a darker colour like Pimlico for the bottom half of the wall to hide foot scuffs and finger prints, and a lighter, brighter colour like the Dulux Easycare Matt Emulsion (5L \u00a326, \u00a35.20 per L) in Polished Pebble for the top half.\n\nAs it\u2019s a high traffic space, the flooring you choose will need to be hardwearing, and easy to clean too.\n\nTiled flooring can withstand the hustle and bustle of rush hour - even in the busiest households! This Konkrete Anthracite Matt Concrete Effect Floor Tile (\u00a315 m2, \u00a322.80 per pack) gets our vote for being extra stylish - it almost looks like poured concrete on the floor.\n\nWant some more inspiration on the best way to transform your hallway?

If you need to work from home, treat yourself to a space that fosters productivity and creativity. Adding wallpaper (pictured) is a good place to start\n\nWhether you like working from home, or simply want a quiet place to get stuck into your bills, a home office can be the perfect place to focus and be productive.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you need to dedicate a whole room to the office: all you need is a spare corner of the living room, a nook in the guest bedroom, or even an underused alcove in the hallway.\n\nHANDY HACK: SAVE TIME WITH 'PASTE THE WALL' WALLPAPER As well as endless designs to choose from, wallpaper with pioneering 'paste the wall' technology allows you to update your home d\u00e9cor in up to 30%** less time than traditional paste the paper methods. Simply paste the wall, hang as desired and you\u2019re done. Easy\n\nIf you have the space, put your desk next to a window to soak up the energy and benefits of natural light, particularly if you need to work for hours at a time. And if you need an artificial light, think about a directional desk lamp.\n\nEasy to install, paste the wall wallpaper is a great way to zone different areas of the room to create your new workspace. The GoodHome Vulpin White Brick Wallpaper (\u00a314) is a great choice because the combination of pattern and colour gives the perception of a bigger and brighter space.\n\nIt works particularly well in medium size rooms that don\u2019t have a lot of natural light.

Try the B&Q online calculator and find out in just a few moments.\n\nWhen it comes to the floor, vinyl like the GoodHome Jazy Natural Grey Wood Effect Luxury Vinyl Click Flooring (\u00a349.28 per pack/\u00a322 per sqm) is the perfect choice if you\u2019re after something functional that\u2019s no fuss when it comes to looking after it.\n\nFinish the look by treating yourself to some new, versatile storage like the Konnect White 3 Cube Shelving Unit (\u00a324), which can be used alone or with additional units to create a practical - yet stylish - place to store all those bits and pieces.\n\nFor more inspiration on creating an amazing work space at home click here.\n\nCREATE SPACE WITH AN OPEN PLAN\n\nZone your living space: Keep the room open and separate to create a bright, sociable feel at home. Our top tips include choosing the right flooring and the right paint\n\nWhether it is entertaining friends or making the most of family time, open-plan living spaces have become a popular way to make any home more sociable.\n\nRenovating the lounge and living room areas into one can be a brilliant way to create extra space and a large entertaining and family room on a budget.\n\nHowever it is important to keep the areas visually separate to keep the room organised and stop it from feeling crowded or cluttered.\n\nHOW TO: MAINTAIN WOODEN FLOORS CLEANING Keep your floor in the best condition by using cleaning products specifically designed to work with hard flooring. These will help ensure that it continues to look great over time. SANDING Sanding and re-lacquering your floor will help extend its life. OILING The oil protects the wood both inside and out, seeping into the wood to deliver long-lasting results. TOP TIP: Use castor cups, rubber feet or pad protectors to distribute weight of the furniture which might dent your floor\n\nA great way to start in an open-plan kitchen living space is by tiling the kitchen and choosing wood floors for the lounge.\n\nThe threshold helps the two zones work seamlessly with one another.\n\nOur favourite for a chic kitchen look is the Konkrete Grey Matt Porcelain Floor Tile (\u00a317 per m2, \u00a323.12 pack) , which works perfectly with the GoodHome Skara solid wood flooring in the living room.\n\nTo work out exactly how many tiles you'll need in the kitchen, use the B&Q online tile calculator.\n\nA quick way to elevate the kitchen is to give the cupboards a refresh with a coat of renovation paint like the GoodHome Durable Cabinet & Wardrobe Paint (750ml \u00a320, \u00a326.67 per L) in a neutral shade like Delaware Matt, which can then be carried through to match other elements in the room.\n\nFinal step is to make sure your walls are given a fresh coat of paint to lift the space and make it look lighter and brighter.\n\nOur pick for a versatile neutral shade is the GoodHome Walls & Ceilings Emulsion (5L \u00a320, \u00a34 per L) in Hampton Silk, which offers great coverage and is the perfect fit for living spaces.\n\nTo make your living room feel even cosier, why not treat the ceiling like another wall and paint it, too.\n\nReady to take the plunge but want even more ideas about where to start?

Blue and white are a great colour combo\n\nThe bedroom is the place where you get ready to face the day ahead, or wind down at the end of it, so it's important to pay it some attention.\n\nDoes it look dated? Are the walls and floors looking a little worn? If the answer is 'yes' then don't panic! It just means it's time to give your bedroom a little TLC.\n\nHOW TO UPCYCLE A WARDROBE IN 6 STEPS Treat yourself (while saving money) by up-cycling your wardrobe. Step 1: Begin by wiping down your wardrobe. Allow it to dry. Remove all the drawers and use a screwdriver to take off the handles. Step 2: Whilst wearing a dust mask, lightly sand it all over to give it a rough surface, this helps the paint to adhere to the wood easier. Step 3: Lay a dust sheet underneath your wardrobe to catch any stray paint drips. Step 4: Open your renovation paint and stir it thoroughly. Apply the paint in thin layers in a consistent direction, starting with the drawer fronts and the doors and shelves. Step 5: Once your paint is dry to touch apply a second coat, just as you did in step 4. Step 6: When your wardrobe is fully dry you can reattach the handles and pop the drawers back in, ready to be centre stage in your room!

B&Q has some amazing inspiration here.\n\nTransform from the bottom up and start by thinking about your floor.\n\nHard wood like the GoodHome Visby Natural Wood Solid Wood Flooring is a great choice because it is durable and still has plenty of character.\n\nPlump for a contrast in the bathroom and choose a bold, patterned tile like the Hydrolic Blue Matt Porcelain Floor Tile (\u00a324 per m2). A top tip on how to apply them? Start by laying down the tiles without glue first to get the best placement. This way you can decide what looks best before sticking. For more help on tiling a floor click here.\n\nOnce the floor is set, it's time to think about the walls. Adding a bold, strong colour might sound intimidating, but in reality it's a great way to bring a sense of tranquility into the bedroom.\n\nWe love the idea of taking in your bathroom tile to B&Q so that the striking blue hue can be colour matched and your own custom paint colour mixed in just a few minutes.\n\nPay attention also to the privacy you want in your room with the windows. An anti-cold curtain will keep the room warm during the winter while providing full privacy and blocking the daylight completely.\n\nFinish off the set-up with a handful of cushions (we love a mixture of patterned styles with neutral ones like the Pondicherry Loop Chevron Beige Cushion, \u00a315).\n\nTo explore the full B&Q range, head in to your local store or visit diy.com\n\n*Three for two on all paint.
