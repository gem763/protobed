These suits were based on \u2014 pick your adjective \u2014 \u201ccreative,\u201d \u201cnovel,\u201d \u201cinventive,\u201d and \u201cimaginative\u201d legal theories that rarely held up in court, and they did their damage primarily by forcing gun companies to incur the costs of defending against them. Congress, seeing the problem, stepped in to put a stop to it \u2014 or at least tried to \u2014 by passing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA).\n\nA decade and a half later, anti-gun activists have responded with yet more new legal theories, and the Connecticut courts have bought one of them. Some families victimized by the Newtown massacre are being allowed to pursue a wrongful-death claim against Remington, which owns Bushmaster, the company that made the rifle used in the attack.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to take the case and reverse the Connecticut supreme court\u2019s decision. It should, as numerous briefs from gun-rights supporters have argued this month.\n\nThe problem here traces back to a flurry of legal activity in the 1980s and 1990s. Anti-gun activists faced a conundrum: It\u2019s easy enough to file a wrongful-death suit against someone who committed murder with a gun, or to sue a company that sold a defective gun, or to go after a gun store that knowingly sold a gun to a criminal. But the activists didn\u2019t just want to punish those who broke the existing rules; they thought the rules were too lax, and they\u2019d had little success getting legislatures to change them.\n\nSo they sued gun companies for following the rules, spinning elaborate theories about why different, stricter rules should apply instead. Those companies were creating a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d They were \u201coversupplying\u201d guns to high-crime neighborhoods, or continuing to send guns to stores that had had too many crimes traced back to them, or making products that appealed to the wrong sorts of people. Never mind how bizarre it is to hold a company liable for the criminal misuse of its legal products; never mind that state and federal governments had already written detailed laws about which guns were legal to sell and how gun sales were to take place; never mind that the targeted companies were following the prescribed process of dealer licenses and background checks; never mind that the alleged \u201cbad apple\u201d gun stores were licensed by the federal government to continue selling guns. If legislatures wouldn\u2019t draw the lines the way the activists wanted, maybe judges and juries would instead.\n\nPractically speaking, the problem with these suits was not that they had much chance of succeeding on the merits. The plaintiffs almost never won. Rather, the suits threatened to drown the industry in a sea of legal costs. Late in the Clinton administration, Andrew Cuomo, who was organizing lawsuits by federally funded housing authorities as the secretary of housing and urban development, told gunmakers they\u2019d suffer \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if they didn\u2019t give in to the gun-control lobby\u2019s demands. Some gunmakers did in fact go bankrupt.\n\nSo Congress decided to nip these suits in the bud. Under the PLCAA, there would be no more lengthy court proceedings: Whenever a court was asked to find a gun company liable simply because someone else had misused its products, the lawsuit would be unceremoniously tossed out. Contrary to some of the lies about the law spread in the media, it didn\u2019t touch legitimate lawsuits. You can still sue gun companies if they sell defective products or break the law. Indeed, gun-rights supporters often cheer such lawsuits.\n\nEventually, though, activists came up with creative theories as to why the law against creative theories didn\u2019t apply.\n\nThe case against Remington alleges that the marketing of the gun used in the Newtown massacre violated the Connecticut Uniform Trade Protection Act, which prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d This is relevant because the PLCAA allows lawsuits when a gun company \u201cknowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product\u201d and the violation was a \u201cproximate cause\u201d of the harm at issue.\n\nThere are several layers of problems here.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s not clear that a generic law like Connecticut\u2019s is \u201capplicable\u201d to guns in the relevant sense. (The word can mean \u201ccapable of being applied\u201d or \u201cspecifically applied.\u201d) As 22 members of the House note in their brief, two different appeals courts have interpreted the word narrowly, and Congress clearly meant to bar lawsuits based on \u201cremote theories\u201d tying marketing to criminal acts.", "description": "In 2005, a wave of lawsuits threatened to bankrupt the gun industry.
