Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Monday pledged to release \u201call\u201d transcripts from the testimony provided by impeachment inquiry witnesses but refused to say when.\n\nHis comments came in response to criticism from Republicans who have said testimony given to House investigators should be made public. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has so far refused to release any of the transcripts from the impeachment inquiry depositions.\n\nThe press has gained access to bits and pieces of testimony through leaks. Republicans have accused House Democrats of cherry-picking and mischaracterizing evidence.\n\n\u201cI do think that it is important to conduct as much [of the impeachment inquiry] as we can, when we can, in open session. Of course, all of these transcripts are going to be made public,\u201d Schiff declared during an interview at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.\n\nThen, the moderator \u2014 New York Times reporter Nicholas Kristof \u2014 asked, \u201cIn what period?\u201d\n\nSchiff responded:\n\nI don\u2019t want to give myself a date, but we want to make sure that we lock down the testimony of people before they can see what others have said, before it influences their own testimony. \u2026 But it will be important to bring the country along for the investigation. To have witnesses testify in open session to let the people evaluate the credibility of witnesses. \u2026 Some of the witnesses we interviewed in closed session we may bring back in open session.\n\nSchiff\u2019s comments about releasing the transcripts echoed recent remarks by Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA), a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment probe.\n\nDuring the interview Monday, Schiff defended having impeachment inquiry witnesses give their deposition behind-closed-doors. He argued that the process is akin to a \u201cgrand jury,\u201d despite it not being a criminal trial.\n\nThe Democrat congressman said:\n\nWe\u2019re doing these initial hearings in closed session and it makes a lot of sense to do that when you\u2019re conducting an investigation because I\u2019m sure the White House would like nothing more than to be able to get their story straight by hearing what these witnesses have to say. And there are good and important investigative reasons not to let one witness know what another witness has said.\n\nWhen pressed by the moderator on whether a grand jury is the best model to pursue, however, Schiff conceded that the analogy is \u201cimperfect,\u201d adding:\n\nI think you\u2019re absolutely right that using the criminal law analogy is an imperfect one and indictment and grand jury are an imperfect analogy. \u2026 So, yes it is a political process and there are good reasons that part of that process should be conducted in the public eye, but I will tell you no two impeachments are alike.\n\nSchiff also responded to Republican criticism that the impeachment inquiry process is unfair, noting that he has granted GOP lawmakers the opportunity to cross-examine his witnesses. Republicans, however, are not allowed to call in or issue subpoenas for any witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are equally represented at every interview, deposition, and hearing,\u201d Schiff argued. \u201cThey ask every question they wish to ask, and so they\u2019re given fair and ample and equal opportunity to question these witnesses.\u201d\n\nHe also blasted Republicans for talking to the press about the testimonies as they complain about leaks, saying:\n\nThe Republicans who are complaining \u2013 and I have to chuckle \u2014 they leave the interviews in the middle of the interview and go out to the press and speak about the interview as they\u2019re complaining about leaks. It really is breathtaking. I give them credit for the most incredible \u201cchutzpah.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Schiff was also cagey when pressed to speculate about an eventual vote on articles of impeachment. He said such a move depends on the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stonewall House Democrats.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no decision made whether we bring articles or what the articles would look like,\u201d he said.", "description": "Rep.
