On such days, a layer of warm air - temperature inversion - acts as a cover keeping impurities near the ground. (AP)\n\nIn 1953, there were no San Gabriel Mountains \u2014 at least, not that Lee Begovich could see.\n\nWhen the 24-year-old kindergarten teacher moved from Chicago to Southern California that year, Los Angeles was choked with smog \u2014 eye-burning, lung-stinging, headache-inducing smog. It hung so thick in the air that it often limited visibility to mere miles for months on end.\n\nSo when Begovich looked northeast from her Compton classroom, the Los Angeles topography faded into a gauzy haze, like peering into the smoke-filled backrooms of the era\u2019s bars. But one day that fall, the wind blew hard; it cleared out the intractable smog and for the first time in her life, Begovich saw the outline of the San Gabriel Mountains. She was stunned, she remembered 66 years later.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t hear that story today, said Ann Carlson, Begovich\u2019s daughter and an environmental law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. For the last two decades, the air has been far cleaner. Now, in most panoramic photographs of the city, the mountains sit atop its skyline like a crown.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize just how bad it was and how much better it is today,\u201d said Carlson, who\u2019s writing a book on the region\u2019s history of air pollution.\n\nThe city and the state have made extraordinary progress in the past half century, and it\u2019s largely because of California\u2019s ability under the Clean Air Act to curb dangerous emissions from the biggest polluters around: automobiles.\n\nBut this week, President Trump said he would revoke California\u2019s ability to set its own auto emissions standards, a provision that gave the most populous state significant sway over the car industry.\n\nOn Friday, California and 22 other states responded, filing a lawsuit that challenged his decision to revoke the waver, which is rooted in Los Angeles\u2019s smoggy past. Trump\u2019s move enraged environmentalists and residents who knew just how far that exception had allowed the city to come.\n\n\u2018The Bay of Smoke\u2019\n\nIn 1542, a group of Spanish explorers gave a prophetic nickname to the land that would later become Los Angeles. A pair of ships, flying the flag of Spain and carrying onboard a couple hundred soldiers, merchants and Native American and African slaves, sailed along the coast of Southern California until they neared present-day Long Beach, where a cloud hung low over the mainland.\n\n\u201cBaya de los Fumos,\u201d they called it. The Bay of Smoke.\n\nThe smoke likely came from the fires burning in the Tongva tribe\u2019s Los Angeles basin settlements, Carlson said. The Spaniards didn\u2019t know it then, but they had seen the earliest signs of a problem that would plague the region for centuries.\n\nWith mountains on three sides and an ocean on the fourth, the region\u2019s geography forms a bowl that pens in polluted air, Carlson said. And for most of the year, an inversion layer of warm air acts as a lid atop it, trapping the cooler air and pollution below. It is the perfect petri dish for smog.\n\nThen came the refineries, the smokestacks, the cars.\n\nBy the 20th century, the basin was besieged \u2014 in 1943, some Angelenos thought, literally.\n\nOne July day that year, a heavy yellow-brown cloud fell over the city, said Beth Gardiner, author of \u201cChoked: Life and Breath in the Age of Air Pollution.\u201d It smelled like bleach.\n\n\u201cPeople really panicked,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cThey freaked out. It was the middle of World War II, and people thought it was a Japanese gas attack.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Los Angeles Times even called it a \u201cgas attack,\u201d writing that \u201cVisibility was cut to less than three blocks ... workers found the fumes almost unbearable.\u201d\n\nThat was just the beginning.\n\nFor years, Gardiner said, scientists couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly was causing the smog. Sure, there were plenty of emissions in the area, but nothing that looked quite like that noxious pall.\n\n\u201cIt was this mystery,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious to us now that it came from cars, but they didn\u2019t understand that at the time.\u201d\n\n\u2018A desperate situation\u2019\n\nIn 1950, Caltech bio-organic chemistry professor Arie Haagen-Smit isolated smog\u2019s main components \u2014 nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds, seasoned with sunlight \u2014 and identified cars as the main culprits. He became known as Arie Haagen-Smog.\n\nBy then, Los Angeles was already the car capital of America.\n\n\u201cL. A. was the place car culture was born,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\nAs the population boomed, suburban bedroom communities sprung up around the city. The sprawl made cars a necessity, said Mike Holland, the Los Angeles city archivist.\n\n\u201cAs the population grew, there were more cars and there was more pollution; more roadways and more gas stations,\u201d Holland said. \u201cSmog, of course, was always one of the end results.\u201d\n\nThe oil and auto industries vociferously challenged Haagen-Smit\u2019s research, attempting to smear and discredit him, yet he kept churning out studies showing smog started in tailpipes.\n\nIn 1953, the same year Begovich first saw the San Gabriel range, Los Angeles Mayor Norris Poulson declared, \u201cWe are in a desperate situation, and drastic steps must be taken.\u201d\n\nPoulson had an uprising on his hands.\n\nThere were roughly two million cars on Los Angeles roads then. And as smog filled the air, angry residents filled local meetings. They came wearing gas masks and toting their children \u2014 also wearing gas masks. They held signs that said \u201cSmog has changed San Gabriel Valley to Death Valley\u201d and they held a party marking over two decades of smog: an \u201cunhappy birthday,\u201d complete with a cake adorned in a skull and crossbones.\n\n\n\nThis is the view, if you can call it that, from the Los Angeles City Hall, Oct. 14, 1954, during the eighth day of an eye-piercing, lung congesting smog that has brought angry protests from citizens demanding that somebody do something about it. Barely visible are the Times and Mirror buildings a block away, with the rest of the downtown business section completely obscured. (Ira W. Guldner/AP)\n\nDuring one acrid stretch in 1954, the air was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in the death of a 10-year-old girl, who choked on the smog, the New York Times reported then.\n\nThe county government responded with some early attempts to regulate the pollution, Carlson said, but it was nearly impossible to control vehicles that moved freely across local and state boundaries.\n\nSacramento intervened in 1959 and set up the California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board, which later became the Air Resources Board, and set the first ozone limit: 150 parts per billion of the pollutant in a cubic meter of air, more than double today\u2019s federal standard.\n\nCarlson\u2019s research on early ozone monitoring data \u2014 which wasn\u2019t as reliable it is today \u2014 shows staggering levels of pollution.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, levels reached 900 parts per billion, nearly double the amount that triggered the most serious smog alert, halting nonessential driving and industrial activity. The region recorded dozens of those serious alerts in the latter half of the decade, Carlson found.\n\nThis public health crisis sent people to the hospital and forced them to miss work, she said. It was less apparent then, but we know now that ozone exposure causes asthma, harms the central nervous system and the lungs and increases cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u2018An invisible achievement\u2019\n\nSo began the pattern of California setting the tone for pollution regulation in the United States.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has always played this role of dragging the rest of the country along behind it,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\nIn the 1960s, Washington tried to catch up, passing several air pollution laws. And in 1967, Congress \u2014 in defiance of auto industry lobbyists \u2014 codified California\u2019s ability to set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. The state\u2019s bipartisan delegation had argued that because California\u2019s problem was so severe and its regulations so advanced, it should be allowed to go its own way. The waiver was born.\n\n\n\nA pall of smog lies over the Los Angeles skyline, July 15, 1978. Air quality officials warned everyone to stay indoors as severely polluted air hung over much of Southern California. (Nick Ut)\n\nIt was then reaffirmed three years later with the federal Clean Air Act of 1970, which Carlson called the \u201cthe most important year in U.S. air pollution history.\u201d It was the first time the government set limits on the pernicious pollutants that were sickening Los Angeles \u2014 ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, she said.\n\nThe catalytic converter was next.\n\nWidely viewed as one of the most consequential environmental inventions, the device controlled car exhaust emissions. Incompatible with leaded gasoline, it also eliminated the use of the harmful fuel.\n\nCalifornia began requiring the technology in all cars manufactured in 1975 and later. Again, the state dragged the country along. Because California \u2014 then as now \u2014 made up such a large share of the car market, its standards became de facto national requirements, as automakers refused to manufacture cars with varied specifications.\n\nOver the years, the air began to clear. The number of severe smog days dwindled. A 1985 headline in The Washington Post announced, \u201cLos Angeles Smog Alerts Decreasing; Pollution Rules Breathe New Life Into Ailing Atmosphere.\u201d\n\nToday, Southern California and the state\u2019s Central Valley still have some of the most unhealthy air in the United States, but it\u2019s far better than it was.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at the history and the 50 years of progress that Californians have made, and that the United States has made, it really does show you how effective this kind of regulation can be,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\nYet it\u2019s an achievement that often goes unappreciated, she said \u2014 one of the reasons, perhaps, that the Trump administration feels it can do away with the waiver that made this progress possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary achievement but it\u2019s an invisible achievement,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cNo one ever thinks about it. None of us ever appreciate clean air.\u201d\n\nBut if Begovich, now 90 years old, could stand outside her Compton classroom today, it\u2019d be obvious to her. She could look to the northeast and see unmistakable peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains. She wouldn\u2019t have to squint into the haze and wonder what was beyond, just out of sight.\n\nRead more:\n\nExtreme climate change has arrived in America\n\nDangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world\n\n\u2018We will make them hear us\u2019: Millions of youths around the world strike for action", "description": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize just how bad it was and how much better it is today,\" said one local historian.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3JO4JhoZBmdHzSumMlOHaITfQAw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JXONWOW2JII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
