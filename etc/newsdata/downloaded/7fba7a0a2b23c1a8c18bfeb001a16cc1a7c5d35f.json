Slamming Johnson as an \"unelected prime minister,\" he also said Brussels will \"not buckle\" under any pressure the U.K. government is trying to assert on its red lines.\n\n\"It is a definite advantage to have an Irish person in charge of this crucial brief over the next five years.\" \u2014 Leo Varadkar\n\nLeaving the EU without a deal will create a \"foul atmosphere\" and have \"serious consequences\" on the prospects of a trade deal between London and Brussels, Hogan said bluntly.\n\nEuropean commissioners are meant to stay out of national affairs and focus on representing the EU's interests as a whole. But Hogan has repeatedly flouted or ignored this rule.\n\nIreland's particularly delicate position when it comes to Brexit will be served well by his continued interest and interference in national affairs. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, while congratulating Hogan on his new position today, said that although the new trade commissioner will work for the bloc as a whole, \"it is a definite advantage to have an Irish person in charge of this crucial brief over the next five years.\"\n\nVaradkar had previously stated that the threat Brexit poses to Ireland was an important factor influencing his nod for Hogan.\n\nOne thing is certain: Britain should brace itself for Hogan's hardball tactics in any future trade talks.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
