Similarly, as generation z gravitate towards TikTok, millennials \u2013 at least some of them \u2013 are wondering what it is and how to use it.\n\nLet's unpack it all and show you how to do it -\n\nWhat is TikTok, and who started it?\n\nTikTok is a short-form video app from Beijing company, ByteDance and users of the app number in the multi-million.\n\nIn December of last year alone it saw the addition of 75 million new users \u2014 a 275 percent increase from the 20 million it added in December 2017, according to a recent report from Sensor Tower.\n\nThe app has been growing steadily since it acquired its U.S.-based rival Musical.ly in November 2017 for north of $800 million, then merged the two apps' user bases last August. So how does it work?\n\nTikTok is like a karaoke app in which you can lip-sync to your favourite song or move in time to specific sounds.\n\nHere's a really good example:\n\nHere's how you get started in four easy steps:\n\n1. First download the app onto your phone.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n2. Login with your Facebook, Instagram, Google or Twitter account.\n\n3. Then look at the different hashtags for great content to inspire you. Of course, some of it is cheesy or cringe-worthy, but that can also help you know what not to do.\n\n4. When you're ready to create your own videos, just go ahead and click the plus video at the bottom of the screen.\n\n(Photos: Screengrab, TikTok)\n\nThen it's straightforward to click on sounds or filters that you would like to add to your own video.\n\nHere's a video guide:\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there lots of South African users on TikTok?\n\nOf course, there aren't official numbers, but there are quite a few uniquely South African hashtags such as #mzansioriginal or #johncenachallenge which is a lovely stream of videos relating to Sho Madjozi's viral song. So there's definitely a local presence for you to join in on!\n\nGet posting!\n\nSources: Sensor Tower, TechCrunch.", "description": "You've probably heard people talking about TikTok, but you're unsure of what it is or how to do it; no worries we've got you covered with this simple guide!", "authors": ["Alex Isaacs"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/91431767bd0f4ce8ad9b528c46ed7b73.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
