He was great for the game of basketball - is great for the game of basketball.\u201d\n\nThe Detroit Pistons are hoping Griffin was right to use the present tense after signing Rose as a free agent this offseason. Now 31, Rose is far removed from his days as an MVP, but the Pistons saw enough upside to bring him in. Detroit also added 38-year-old Joe Johnson.\n\nThe Pistons now have the top picks from the 2008 and 2009 drafts in Rose and Griffin. Rose, Griffin and Johnson have combined for 16 All-Star selections, although the last time they made it at the same time was in 2012. How this trio will do in 2019 is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nDetroit\u2019s moves were certainly interesting, and there were seemingly inevitable questions about whether the Pistons should double down on big names in their 30s by adding Carmelo Anthony. That did not happen, but Detroit has shown a willingness to be creative when trying to add talent.\n\nThe Pistons haven\u2019t won a playoff game since 2008, and they aren\u2019t exactly a prime destination for the game\u2019s top free agents. They also haven\u2019t been bad enough lately to pick near the very top of the draft.\n\nIn 2018, they gave up a first-round pick in a huge deal for the often-injured Griffin. He was tremendous last season, joining LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo as the only players in the league averaging at least 24 points, seven rebounds and five assists per game. The Pistons made the playoffs but were swept in the first round.\n\nNow Rose arrives, fresh off a season in which he averaged 18 points for Minnesota. He appeared in only 51 games because of a variety of injuries, but that was more than double what he played the previous season for the Timberwolves and Cleveland. Last season was his second-highest scoring mark since tearing his left ACL in 2012. He also shot a career-best 37% from 3-point range.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more poised, I\u2019m shooting the 3, I\u2019m more efficient,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that people love to see the reckless way that I played, and the reckless way that I played led me to my injuries.\u201d\n\nThe Pistons would love for Rose to be healthy and resurgent, the way Griffin was for most of last season. Rose often played off the ball last season, so it\u2019s possible he can succeed alongside Detroit point guard Reggie Jackson. He can also be an option at the point if Jackson struggles to produce consistently.\n\nWhile Rose is obviously an important part of the Pistons\u2018 plans, Johnson\u2019s future is murkier. He didn\u2019t play in the NBA at all last season. He ended up in the BIG3 3-on-3 league - he said it was just something to do - where he was named MVP. Detroit acquired him last month.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018I\u2019m going to play in the BIG3, so these people can see me.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t my purpose,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI did it just for the love of the game, just to go out and have fun.\u201d\n\nPistons executive Ed Stefanski said Johnson would be competing for a roster spot, but the team was happy to bring in the veteran with over 20,000 career points. Johnson has averaged 14.8 minutes and 3.8 points in four preseason games.\n\n\u201cJoe has all the traits you need to be a professional. That doesn\u2019t hurt our team to have a guy like that. It doesn\u2019t hurt the younger players to see the work ethic that Joe can bring to the table,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJoe still, we think, has something left to prove. That\u2019s what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nSo Griffin, Rose and Johnson - accomplished players all - enter the season amid varying expectations. Griffin is the team\u2019s undisputed star, Rose the intriguing newcomer and Johnson the former standout trying to extend his career.\n\nAll three sense an opportunity.\n\n\u201cI think the sky is the limit. You\u2019ve got pretty much everything on this team,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cGood point guards, great bigs, some wings. And then you\u2019ve got a great mixture of younger guys and older guys.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Blake Griffin was asked to recall the early stages of Derrick Rose's career, when the dynamic point guard won an MVP for the Chicago Bulls at age 22.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/pistons_76ers_basketball_01309_c0-214-5127-3204_s1200x700.jpg?b3d6a83d5e11e1c264a8c9cf9698f39abf84406f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
