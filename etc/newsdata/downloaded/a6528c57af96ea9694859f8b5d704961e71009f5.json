Relax, relax.\" When they did not leave, Cooper explained how gays and lesbians have stood by people who identified as trans.\n\n\"Let me just \u2014 let me just point out there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay and lesbian and transgendered community of protest, and we applaud them for their protest,\" said Cooper. \"And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media on the lives of transgendered.\"\n\nThe Humans Rights Campaign has reported at least 19 transgender people have been killed so far in 2019, while 26 transgender people were killed in 2018.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/10/2019 22:26:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/283/f0b61b10-4c1b-4c1b-805a-960e5789433e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
