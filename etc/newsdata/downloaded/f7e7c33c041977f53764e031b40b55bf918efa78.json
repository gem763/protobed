That policy remains unchanged.\n\n\"No delays, and I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on October 31.\"\n\nAsking for a delay and negotiating one are two different things - and the PM is only legally obliged to ask, not negotiate.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\n\"I'm absolutely certain he will comply with the law,\" said Sir Oliver Letwin.\n\nYet the PM's spokesman point blank refused to confirm if the delay letter would be sent by 11pm tonight - saying he had nothing to add to Mr Johnson's statement.\n\nJeremy Corbyn declared: \"The Prime Minister must now comply with the law!\" And he warned the Prime Minister must \"think very carefully\" about his apparent refusal to engage with extension.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson even said the Commons sitting should be briefly suspended so the Prime Minister could \"go and send his letter\" while MPs wait.\n\nNaomi Smith, CEO of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain said: \u201cThe success of this amendment shows that MPs do not trust Boris Johnson not to run the country off a No-Deal cliff-edge a year down the line.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister tried to bounce MPs into quickly nodding through a deal which makes Theresa May\u2019s botched effort look good.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another humiliation for the Prime Minister who can\u2019t win a parliamentary vote.\n\n\u201cHe must now do what is right for the country by requesting an extension from the EU, and averting the crisis he created through his last minute renegotiation.\u201d\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg will now make an emergency statement on Monday afternoon to reveal the government's next steps.\n\nHe said he planned to re-table today's motion to give MPs a \"meaningful vote\" on Boris Johnson's deal.\n\nBut the situation was unclear after Speaker John Bercow suggested tabling the motion again may be against Commons rules - and he'd only decide on Monday whether it would be allowed.\n\nMeaningful vote or not, the government can still try to pass Boris Johnson's Brexit deal - which before today's hiccup was facing a knife-edge vote on approval.\n\nMinisters can choose to bring forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which is a separate mechanism to code the deal into UK law.\n\nSir Oliver insisted his amendment was simply an insurance policy to ensure a no-deal Brexit didn't happen by accident on October 31.\n\nBrexit will only have happened legally once MPs have held a series of further votes to pass a law called the Withdrawal Agreement Act.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nSir Oliver feared no-deal would happen by accident if the Act got snarled up in Parliament, and wasn't complete before the October 31 deadline.\n\nBut his amendment meant MPs were denied a straight up-and-down \"meaningful vote\" on the Brexit deal today - with a decision now only due in the coming days and weeks instead.\n\nIf granted by 27 EU leaders, an extension may only last a matter of weeks - as long as Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is passed at a later date and enters into law.\n\nBut if the Brexit deal doesn't pass it could lead to further chaos with a possible vote of no confidence and general election .\n\nBoris Johnson had begged Oliver Letwin to withdraw his \u2018delay Brexit\u2019 amendment - but the MP flatly refused, with allies suggesting he was more likely to play in the Rugby World Cup.\n\n(Image: Tom Corban/REX)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTory Iain Duncan Smith urged Sir Oliver to \u201cwithdraw his amendment and give the British people what they are dying for - a decision on Brexit.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson said it was time to have a proper vote on the deal he won on Thursday, saying: \"Let us come together as democrats to end this debilitating feud.\"\n\nAnd Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove urged MPs to have a clean vote to end the \"depression and dismay and demoralisation\" saying it would be \"a cloud has been lifted\".\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn - who backed the delay amendment - said: \"I totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House.\n\n\"But we simply cannot vote for a deal that is even worse than the one the House rejected three times.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIt came as Parliament sat on a Saturday for the first time since 1982 to approve or reject Boris Johnson \u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nAt the same time, tens of thousands of protesters descended on Westminster demanding a second referendum \u2013 a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d.\n\nBut the vote risked becoming a damp squib after MP Oliver Letwin tabled his amendment to force a delay, win or lose - and put off the final decision until later.\n\nThat prompted No10 to threaten to pull or sit out the vote to avoid handing a symbolic victory to the expelled Tory and his Labour allies.\n\nToday\u2019s vote was already on a knife edge as victory hinged on just a few Labour MPs in Leave seats.\n\nBoris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on October 17 - keeping a transition period to December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill, but scrapping the Irish backstop.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nIn the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system:\n\nNorthern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic.\n\nBut in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.\n\nNorthern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nMeanwhile commitments on workers' rights were deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.\n\nLast night Boris Johnson unveiled a last-minute offer on workers\u2019 rights after his deal watered them down. But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nThe PM was jeered by Labour MPs as he stood up at 9.30am today to insist he would protect workers' rights.\n\nAnd DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds savaged the PM for breaking his promise never to create a customs border down the Irish Sea in an excoriating speech.\n\nBut some swung behind the Prime Minister including Theresa May - who accused anti-Brexit MPs of a 'con trick on the British people'.", "description": "The humiliating result on the Oliver Letwin amendment means the Prime Minister still has no closure on Brexit - yet he flatly refused to \"negotiate\" a delay, leaving the next steps up in the air", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Imag", "Reuters", "Tom Corban Rex", "Pa", "Peter Summers", "Kiran Ridley"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653265.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
