He's playing a quarter-final in front of 40,000 people in Oita where you know that you don't get another day.\n\n'This is the day, and for a young player you can either rise to the occasion or you can find it difficult.' The Australians are convinced the 6ft 3in, 15st 6lbs back is ready though.\n\nScrum-half Will Genia, who inspired Petaia to play the game, said: 'I rate Jordan very highly, he could be one of the best players in the world in the not too distant future.' And centre partner Samu Kerevi added: 'Jordan has rare talent. He is going to be one of the greats.' Wallaby coach Michael Cheika has no concerns he will wilt either.\n\n'I trust him infinitely,' said the boss.\n\n'Yes, it's going to be fast and aggressive and all that type of stuff but I know that lad will rise up to that challenge.\n\nQueensland Reds star Petaia will 'rise to the challenge' of facing England, Cheika has predicted\n\nCheika, who has been in charge since 2014, has been in bullish mood ahead of facing England\n\n'He's just a good young rugby player. He's pretty relaxed but he's very well prepared. That's the one thing I've noticed about him, he gives off a pretty cool and chilled demeanour but he's very well prepared in getting ready tactically and physically.\n\n'He's very resilient in that manner already at a young age, he's had a couple of injuries that have kept him out of games.\n\n'He's been able to establish relationships inside the team when he's been carrying the Wallaby (team mascot) around as our youngest player.\n\n'He's very well liked and is very consistent.' Petaia made the World Cup squad at the last minute after full-back Israel Folau had been sacked for his comments that 'hell awaits' gay people.\n\nAnd the Petaia's mother, Helen, sensationally infiltrated the church Folau was preaching at and leaked details of his controversial views to the Australian media back in July.\n\nReece Hodge has returned to Australia's side for the quarter-final following a three-match ban\n\nTwo of Australia's half-backs, Will Genia (left) and Christian Lealiifano, are starters on Saturday\n\nCaptain Michael Hooper will move a cap shy of his international century in the quarter-final\n\nAustralia prop Allan Alaalatoa was on the weights ahead of Saturday's knockout match in Oita\n\nKurtley Beale has been put through his paces in the Austrlia camp ahead of the quarter-final\n\nShe was deeply concerned about Folau's 'false teachings', her revelations led to the sacking of Folau's cousin Josiah, a teacher, too and she revealed was told to 'go to hell' by Folau's father.\n\nThe Wallaby players refused to go into detail on those recent revelations yesterday but Petaia's close family friend Matt Toomua talked up his mate.\n\n'It's been such a whirlwind year,' said the playmaker.\n\n'He gets excited both sides of the ball, which is unique for a young guy, loves defence and loves attack, loves the rough stuff. It's an exciting occasion for him.'\n\nWallabies head coach Cheika (right) joked that seeing Eddie Jones (left) leading England 'hurts'\n\nCheika drew parallels between Jones and Trevor Bayliss, the former England cricket coach", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN OITA: Teen star Jordan Petaia is already on the cusp of greatness according to his Australia team-mates.
