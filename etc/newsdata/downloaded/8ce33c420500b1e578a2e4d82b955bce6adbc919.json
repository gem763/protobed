The move uphill came after a depressive price action on Wednesday that took the bitcoin price below the $8,000 support level. At its intraday lowest, the cryptocurrency was trading at $7,908.86.\n\nWeak US Economic Data\n\nThe bitcoin\u2019s loss and subsequent mild recovery came amidst the release of vital US economic data on Wednesday morning. The retail sales report showed a drop of 0.3 percent, marking the first contraction in months. It raised concerns over the deteriorating health of the US economy, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to announce fresh rate cuts at its next meeting.\n\nThe weaker-than-expected economic data pushed the US stocks lower on Wednesday. The benchmark S&P 500 index plunged by 0.2 percent at the close. The sentiment towards risk-on assets spread into the Asian markets today. Japan\u2019s Topix was down 0.3 percent while Australia\u2019s S&P ASX 200 plunged by 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, in China, the CSI 300 of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks were up by 0.1 percent.\n\nBrexit Deal Reached\n\nBitcoin held on to its gains also as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that they had reached a Brexit deal with the European Union. The politician confirmed in a tweet:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019\n\nThe new propelled pound to register its best month in months. The sterling surged about 0.70 percent against the dollar after the London market open. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index jumped by 0.60 on the Brexit news.\n\nIn Europe, demand for risk-on assets climbed as well. The benchmark Stoxx 600 surged o.70 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, a Brexit deal expects to spell trouble on Bitcoin, which investors long perceived as a safe-haven asset should the UK-EU negotiations go south. Bitcoin rival Gold is already dropping on the news, down about 0.27 percent now.\n\nMoody Bitcoin\n\nAs NewsBTC noted earlier, Bitcoin\u2019s rate against the pound was forming an interim negative correlation with the pound\u2019s performance against the US dollar. Excerpts:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s gains in the GBP markets are coinciding with the GBP\u2019s losses against the US dollar \u2013 or vice versa, at least in the last seven days. The most visible correlation is GBP/USD\u2019s gains on October 11 and 12, wherein the pair surged by as much as 4.20 percent. On the same days, bitcoin dropped by up to 7.62 percent against the pound.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, speculators believe bitcoin could rise after Fed cut benchmark rates. Lately, the cryptocurrency has reacted mildly to rate cut events. On September 18, for instance, bitcoin was unfazed by the central bank\u2019s announcement of pushing lending rates down to 1-3/4 to 2 percent. The cryptocurrency dropped by more than 6 percent a day after the FOMC statement.", "description": "Bitcoin was attempting to hold $8,000 as support on Thursday after it slipped briefly below the said level yesterday.
