Get down there now.\u2019 So he did it and everything but he was like \u2018don\u2019t put me name on it, don\u2019t let anyone know that I\u2019ve played on this tune and that\u2019 \u2013 because he\u2019s far too cool for all that stuff. He\u2019s devastated that people actually know it\u2019s him. He\u2019s like \u2018what did I tell ya man? You\u2019re messing with me cred!\u2019 I asked him to come out [on tour] and play bongos and he said \u2018no, because I\u2019ll always be remembered for being the bongo guy.\u2019\n\nAccording to Liam, both his sons \u2013 Gene and Lennon \u2013 are keen on making music, but aren\u2019t keen on replicating the sound that their old man has produced for the last 28 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far too soppy for them. They\u2019re into some mad fuckin\u2019 heavy stuff and that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[Gene] he\u2019s got big aspirations, man. He wants to be in a band, but not one that writes soppy music.\u201d\n\nDespite Gene featuring his impressive bongo skills on the new Liam Gallagher record, Liam admits that both of his boys are hesitant to make the long trip out to Australia for the summer tour \u2013 even though Liam would really like them to come.\n\nI was going to [bring them to Falls Festival 2017/2018] but instead, they went \u2018oh how far is it?\u2018 and I said \u2018it\u2019s 24 hours, mate, on the plane\u2018 and they were like \u2018oh that\u2019s a bit far\u2018 and I\u2019ve gone \u2018well I can\u2019t fucking\u2026I can\u2019t change that, mate\u2018,\u201d Liam said.\n\n\u201cThey think it\u2019s a bit too far. Then they went \u2018can they not come to us?\u2018\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Shit The Bloody Bed, Liam Gallagher Just Got Added To The Meredith Lineup\n\nLiam told me that he\u2019d actually love to have his sons come with him this time around, noting that they ground him when he brings them on tour, and that he wants them to get a bit of life experience outside of the UK.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at that age now. I would love to bring them out there, it\u2019d be good for them to see what\u2019s going on, on the other side of the world, but we\u2019ll see how it goes, man.\u201d\n\nAs for Liam, he\u2019ll be out and about in his regular attire.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to miss me, I\u2019ll be the one in the parka.\u201d\n\nLiam Gallagher is in Australia for Fairgrounds Festival and Meredith Music Festival, as well as a string of headline shows around the country over December.
