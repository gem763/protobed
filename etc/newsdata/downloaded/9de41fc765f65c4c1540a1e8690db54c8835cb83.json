Festive clothes are as important as the food you will devour during this season. And your tween will be as excited when it comes to Diwali shopping. It is between the age of 6-12 years that kids develop their own personal tastes and choices. What better time than now to use this festive shopping activity as an excuse to bond with your tween and get to know them better.\n\n\n\nInvolve your kid: The only way you can lean more about your tween's changing preferences is by involving them in the process. Ask them what kind of dresses or clothes they'd prefer, would they like to mix-and-match with casual and ethnic options\u2014let your child know you trust their choices.\n\n\n\nLet them do their research: Online shopping portals have made life easier in more ways than one. Ask your tween to browse through several different sites and compile a list of the collections they love the most. This way, you will be able to take a more informed decision and your child will feel more comfortable expressing their likes and dislikes to you.\n\n\n\nShop together: You've discussed enough.
