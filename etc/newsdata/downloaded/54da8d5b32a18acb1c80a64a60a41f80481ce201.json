He's cut off my head, my dad's head, and most of it is of my bum. It's horrible.'\n\nAmy said her footage looked like it was the 1990s horror film The Blair Witch Project.\n\n'It could've been filmed on an iPhone, a child could've filmed it, it was so shaky,' Amy said.\n\nThe brides also said Ashley, YouTuber and owner of Simplicity Films, promised them the raw footage, but they're still waiting seven months later.\n\n'He's got our memories that we can't take back.
