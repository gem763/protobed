In fact, NPR found that the median sale price on Nantucket this year is $1.6 million.\n\nOne Nantucket couple Gamerman spoke to, Melanie and Bob Sabelhaus, said they are hoping to sell their home (featuring a spectacular custom bar) for $6.275 million. Ms. Sabelhaus wanted the bar, which is the centerpiece of her home, to look like her favorite Herm\u00e8s scarf. It features bright orange lacquered cabinets, Baccarat crystal, a SubZero wine fridge, and mahogany counters \u2014 and it cost $80,000 to build.\n\n\"When I look at my bar it's like looking at a piece of jewelry,\" Ms. Sabelhaus told the Wall Street Journal. \"It sparkles.\"\n\nRead more: Luxury real estate developers are building out elaborate basements for multimillion-dollar mansions, and they include spas, tennis courts, and even ballrooms\n\nThe ultra-wealthy are no strangers to tailoring their homes to their every want and need\n\nSparkling professional-grade, in-home bars aren't the only renovations the wealthy are making to their luxurious homes to best suit their wants and needs.\n\nBusiness Insider's Katie Warren previously reported that some are shelling out half a million dollars to install comfortable, luxe panic rooms that include flat-screen TVs, high-end d\u00e9cor, and yes, bars. Warren also reported that luxury developers are building expansive and extravagant underground spaces for multimillion-dollar homes that feature sports facilities, wine cellars, and in one case, even a ballroom.\n\nThe custom wet bars on Nantucket are the most recent iteration of the lavish home-modification trend, but as Business Insider's Lina Batarags previously reported, that trend has hidden dangers. The luxury real-estate market is hitting a point where homes are so over-customized that they are difficult to sell.\n\nIn Los Angeles, it's not unheard of to find private homes where bedrooms have been converted into recording studios or, in more extreme cases, a basement has been turned into a basketball court. But while those features might appeal to the home's current owner, they do not appeal to every buyer, Alec Traub, an LA-based real-estate agent with Refin, previously told Business Insider.\n\n\"The question isn't 'how much did this cost to build,'\" Traub said. \"Instead, it becomes 'how much would it cost to have this taken out?'\"\n\nAccording to the Journal, the Sabelhauses' Nantucket home was listed at $6.775 million in April. As of September 9, its price has, according to Sotheby's, who has the listing, been dropped to $6.275 million.", "description": "The newest luxury customization trend popping up in multimillion-dollar homes in Nantucket is just one way the wealthy are decking out their homes.", "authors": ["Taylor Borden"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d4d9973d0c436381309c782-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
