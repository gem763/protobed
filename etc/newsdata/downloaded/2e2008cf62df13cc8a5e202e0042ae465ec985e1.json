(City Attorney of San Francisco/Facebook)\n\nA spokesperson for FlightHub and JustFly told CBC News that the lawsuit focuses solely on JustFly and that its claims are baseless, because the agency is transparent and compliant with regulations governing the industry.\n\n\"These allegations are unfounded and JustFly intends to prove it,\" said Pierre Meth\u00e9, FlightHub's director of customer service, in an email.\n\n'I feel so stressed'\n\nAccording to the suit, the Better Business Bureau, Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation have received more than 2,000 customer complaints about JustFly and FlightHub in the past two years \u2014 more than any other online travel site.\n\nFlightHub is geared toward Canadian customers while JustFly targets the U.S. market.\n\nMeth\u00e9 said customers purchased more than five million airline tickets using the agencies in 2018 and that the \"vast majority\" are \"highly satisfied\" with their service.\n\nBut customer complaints have sparked concerns among state officials and consumer organizations.\n\nFollowing its latest review in September, the Better Business Bureau maintained an ongoing consumer alert for both FlightHub and JustFly due to an established pattern of complaints including refund and billing issues.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau has posted an alert for JustFly and FlightHub after identifying a pattern of complaints with the two online travel agencies. (Better Business Bureau)\n\nThe Office de la protection du consommateur \u2014 the consumer protection agency in Quebec where FlightHub Group is based \u2014 reports it's concerned after receiving 77 complaints involving both agencies over the past two years.\n\nCBC News has received more than 20 unsolicited complaints about FlightHub over the past three months.\n\nThey include one from Bernadette Villareal of Airdrie, Alta., who reached out on Tuesday. She was distraught because she still hadn't received a promised $5,200 refund for five airline tickets she cancelled on May 28 \u2014 more than four months ago.\n\n\"I feel so furious, I feel so sad, I feel so stressed,\" said Villareal in tears. \"I don't know what to do.\"\n\nIn March, she booked the tickets through FlightHub for a family trip to the Philippines in June. But then her father, who lived in the Philippines, died, forcing Villareal to cancel the tickets. She repurchased them for an earlier date so the family could attend the funeral.\n\nWhen Villareal's promised refund for the cancelled tickets didn't materialize, she continually called and emailed FlightHub with no success, she said.\n\n\"I don't know why this company is doing this,\" she said. \"It's not a small amount of money and we're not rich.\"\n\nBernadette Villareal, her husband, Mathew, and their three children on their flight to the Philippines. (Submitted by Bernadette Villareal)\n\nShortly after CBC News contacted FlightHub, the agency apologized to Villareal for her experience and said her $5,200 refund is coming by mail.\n\nMeth\u00e9 told CBC News that Villareal caused the long delay by filing a claim for the missing money with her debit card provider, which had to be sorted out first.\n\nVillareal said she didn't file a claim until July 18 \u2014 after waiting more than six weeks for her refund.\n\nMisspelled name fees?\n\nPatricia McPhee in Bowden, Alta., also recently contacted CBC News.\n\nOn Sept. 13, she booked a flight to the Philippines over the phone and said the FlightHub agent misspelled her travel companion's name by one letter on the ticket.\n\nDuring one followup call which McPhee recorded, FlightHub blamed her for the mistake and suggested she may have to cancel and rebook the ticket, plus pay a $465 cancellation fee.\n\nDuring another call, McPhee said, FlightHub told her the airline involved, EVA Air, would do the fix for $300.\n\nOn Sept. 20, she called EVA Air and learned that it wouldn't charge for the fix, which must be done by FlightHub.\n\nOn Sept. 23, CBC News contacted FlightHub about McPhee's case. Later that day, the agency fixed the mistake at no cost.\n\n\"It was nerve-racking,\" said McPhee. \"It should have been fixed within 10 minutes. It took 10 days.\"\n\nFlightHub said it had been working to resolve the issue long before the inquiry from CBC News and that it never requested a name-change fee.\n\n\"What a crock of garbage,\" said McPhee in response. She's glad to hear that the state of California has launched a lawsuit against the company.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that it takes a whole [state] to sue someone for them to get the hint.\"\n\nAlthough only customers in California could benefit financially from the suit, its wider aim is to stop FlightHub Group from engaging in alleged unfair business practices.", "description": "The state of California has launched a lawsuit against online travel agencies FlightHub and JustFly for alleged \u201cunscrupulous business practices.\" The agencies' owner says the allegations are \"unfounded.\"", "authors": ["Business Reporter", "Sophia Harris Has Worked As A Cbc Video Journalist Across The Country", "Covering Everything The Start Of The Annual Lobster Fishery In Yarmouth", "N.S.", "To Farming In Saskatchewan.
