The book is a dizzying 198-page treatise, written under the pseudonym of \u201cBronze Age Pervert\u201d\u2014shorthanded to \u201cBAP\u201d by his ardent fans. And they are legion. It\u2019s a smash hit with the right, and is currently ranked #3 on Amazon\u2019s bestseller list in Ancient Greek History, and #174 in Humor\u2014an inarguably more competitive category.\n\n\n\nThe author\u2019s Twitter presence is a post-post-post-ironic blend of jokey homoerotic photos of bodybuilders and boorish far-right memes. But while BAP\u2019s prose is rather artfully penned, Bronze Age Mindset\u2019s arguments are fractured and incoherent. Imagine the opinions of Jordan B. Peterson, as expressed by Ayn Rand\u2019s Superman, in the playful vernacular of Donald Barthelme. The essay nevertheless manages to exert a sneaky power on the reader, despite being so chopped and screwed. BAP\u2019s introduction to the book is an incantation of sorts, the haunting final sentence of which ends without a terminal period; a detail that is unlikely to have been omitted by mistake:\n\n\n\nI want to prepare you to receive this old spirit\u2014old spirits are moving from behind the reeds... the silhouette shimmers against a river in late summer, and I see already men who know how to honor such uncanny old friends. May they inhabit us again and give us strength to purify this world of refuse\n\nThe far-right literary oeuvre provides ample opportunities for such spirits to be conjured. In the years since Trump\u2019s election, one particular work\u2014Gerald James McManus\u2019s 2001 political thriller Dark Millennium: A Visionary Tale\u2014has felt eerily prescient. Its protagonist, U.S. President Alexander McGrail, is presented as both a hero and a beloved villain. He\u2019s a narcissistic sociopath and a racist. He treats women badly. He betrays trusted allies. As the story progresses, he enlists a top military officer, General Brandt, to help him put a diabolical secret plan into action: together they fake a terrorist attack that kills every Democrat in Congress. McGrail blames Muslim extremists for the tragedy, but the press doesn\u2019t buy his explanation. Their offices are thus raided and the media is eventually shut down completely. Then, as is the case in many of these authors\u2019 fantasy scenarios, things spiral into race war.\n\n\n\nIncited by the media\u2019s accusations against the president, America\u2019s black ghettos ran red with blood and flame. Uprisings broke out first in the eastern cities. ... In Manhattan, Brandt oversaw the execution of thirty thousand captured blacks. They were dragged kicking and screaming to the edge of a huge pit that was dug out of Central Park. Some blacks demanded their rights, most begged for mercy, but they were all thrown into the pit and remorselessly machine-gunned by Brandt\u2019s men.\n\nThe violence spreads throughout the country as McGrail\u2019s America systematically murders all people of color, feminists, socialists, and, of course, Jews. The story ends years into a future wherein McManus\u2019s fictional leader is, despite his personal flaws, venerated as the hero\u2013founder of a pure and enduring whites-only ethno-utopia.\n\n\n\nThe point is not to say that the harrowing plot of Dark Millennium is about to come true. It is, rather, to acknowledge that there exists a broad, far-right subculture, which is actively posting, plotting, and praying that it will. Charlottesville was an attempt to galvanize this very movement. Its organizers sought to \u201cUnite the Right,\u201d and bring together the various outlier factions\u2014men\u2019s groups, paleo-libertarians, \u201csovereign citizens,\u201d and the like\u2014that constitute the nebulous \u201cAlt Right\u201d and \u201cAlt Light.\u201d Instead, things quickly devolved into hooliganism, as the same old clowns rolled up, united only by the same old hatreds of the same old groups that have been targeted for decades, as codified in books like The Turner Diaries, The Camp of the Saints, and Dark Millennium: people of color, feminists, socialists, and Jews.\n\n\n\nDespite this movement\u2019s failure in Virginia, the right has since become increasingly unified online, emboldened by evidence of their influence on Trump, and a mounting sense that they are gearing up for something big. The neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer recently featured a homepage header image of cartoon machine guns circling the Constitution. The site\u2019s publisher, Andrew Anglin, posts multiple times daily, revving up his followers, and has called for a soon-to-come \u201cage of ultraviolence,\u201d followed by a forceful solicitation of compliance with leadership:\n\n\n\nThere will be leaders. You need to be prepared to recognize them for who they are, and you need to be prepared to do whatever they tell you to do, exactly as they tell you to do it. You are going to be required to do things that you cannot possibly imagine yourself doing right now. And if you do not do these things, you will die.\n\nIf Donald Trump loses the presidency next fall, we all know he\u2019ll tweet up a storm on election night\u2014railing against the corrupt media, decrying rigged elections, shrieking about socialism. But\u2026then what? What if he takes it to the next level and calls for violence or declares martial law? One hopes that those to whom we entrust the power of state violence\u2014cops, soldiers, spies\u2014would keep the oaths of a constitutional order. Or, might they instead take us down a new path; a darker one, snaking though clearings felled by norm-breakers like Mitch McConnell and Devin Nunes: hearkening to the paeans to the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d of Tucker Carlson, the fragmented agitations of BAP, or the fascist violence of Andrew Anglin? All of these folktales could quickly come into competition, with the winner determining whether or not a Trumpian crie de guerre will accomplish what Charlottesville could not: calling the lone wolves to the hunt, bolstered by a newly-unified army of Bronze Age Mindset\u2019s \u201cuncanny old friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat if the next Democratic debate kicked off with this question from the moderators: \u201cSenator Warren, let\u2019s say you win the election in a narrow victory. Rather than concede, President Donald Trump goes on live television and whips his crowd into a frenzy, exclaiming, \u2018They\u2019re trying to steal the presidency from us! The time is now! Rise up and fight!\u2019 How would you, as President-Elect, respond?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Beltway set may yet believe this question to be crazy. But in Trump\u2019s America\u2014where Greenland is for sale, weather is changed with the swish of a Sharpie, and tanks roll down Pennsylvania Avenue on July 4\u2014they should know that crazy people are seriously contemplating these questions, and looking to the books they\u2019ve spent a lifetime reading and sharing for prophecy, if not instructions. We so-called normies must be prepared to answer.", "description": "When Trump tweets about \"civil war,\" he's echoing books about race wars and nationalist coups that a violent fringe has long cherished.", "authors": ["Ian Allen"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/9a28ca93493ad8688a21c97a13260e54592fccfd.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
