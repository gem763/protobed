Her role has been described as a poisoned chalice, as linguistically divided parties struggle to form a government.\n\nBelgium has had a caretaker government since December last year when Michel\u2019s four-party coalition collapsed as the Flemish nationalists quit in protest at a UN migration pact.\n\nElections in late May failed to yield a fresh government and reinforced the country\u2019s political divide, with the wealthier Dutch-speaking Flemish north voting in large numbers for the nationalist right, while the francophone south handed victory to traditional socialists.\n\nDescribing her appointment as a \u201cgreat honour and a great responsibility\u201d, Wilm\u00e8s acknowledged leading a caretaker government \u201cdoes not leave us with much opportunity to act\u201d and urged the formation of a fully fledged government as soon as possible.\n\nBelgium went 541 days without a government in 2010-11, a world record for a country in peacetime. Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormont assembly and executive, which has not sat for more than 1,000 days, overtook the Belgian total in August 2018, but is not considered eligible for the record since laws can still be passed at Westminster.\n\nWilm\u00e8s, 44, has had a rapid rise in politics since joining Belgium\u2019s federal government in 2015 as budget minister. Born in Brussels to a political family, she began her political career as a local councillor in the Belgian capital. Wilm\u00e8s was later elected to local government in Rhode Saint-Gen\u00e8se (Sint-Genesius-Rode), one of six Flemish communes encircling Brussels that have large French-speaking minorities, leading to frequent disputes over language rights.\n\nHer task as prime minister is complicated by being a member of the francophone liberal party, which lost ground in the May elections and is only the fourth-largest party.\n\nWilm\u00e8s is seen as an ally of the outgoing prime minister and has been criticised in the fiscally conservative northern Flanders region for not doing more to deliver a balanced budget.\n\nThe Dutch-language daily De Standaard pointed out Wilm\u00e8s was little known in Flanders, but said she spoke good Dutch and had \u201ca good dose of charisma\u201d.\n\nIn a front-page editorial, Le Soir said her nomination was \u201can elevator to the scaffold\u201d, calling Wilm\u00e8s a prime minister that hid a political vacuum. While describing her appointment as a big step forward for women in Belgium, the leader writer B\u00e9atrice Delvaux accused the country\u2019s politicians of \u201cgreat hypocrisy\u201d. She pointed out Michel\u2019s government had failed to reach gender parity during its five years in office.", "description": "Caretaker leader replaces Charles Michel, who will be European council president", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883b02ece11302d32193053815dc1aed5d2e3417/0_30_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6a0cf006776b21ff187ddede270c372", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
