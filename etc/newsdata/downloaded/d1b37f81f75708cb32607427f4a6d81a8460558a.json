(AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams fully understand the risks they took in acquiring volatile cornerback Jalen Ramsey.\n\nThe defending NFC champions believe the potential rewards are well worth it.\n\n\u201cYou want guys with some swag, some personality,\u201d coach Sean McVay said Wednesday while he awaited the star cornerback\u2019s arrival at their training complex. \u201cAs long as those guys love football, they love competing every single day, I think this is a building that will suit him well.\u201d\n\nRamsey flew to the West Coast on Wednesday, a day after Los Angeles traded two first-round picks and a fourth-rounder for an elite defender whose tumultuous tenure with the Jacksonville Jaguars didn\u2019t last four full seasons.\n\nOn his Uninterrupted podcast on SiriusXM\u2019s app, Ramsey pronounced himself \u201coverjoyed\u201d to be with the Rams, and eager to \u201cshow them that they got the best corner in the whole NFL for years and years to come.\u201d\n\nThe Rams are sold on Ramsey\u2019s talent and publicly convinced of their own ability to channel it into a big role on a winning team. General manager Les Snead said he has already spoken to Ramsey\u2019s agents about his future beyond his current contract, which ends in 2020, and that both sides were encouraged by the conversation.\n\n\u201cWe actually did talk to his representatives and give our long-term view, and (get) his,\u201d Snead said. \u201cWe did put a little bit of a timeline in place. I don\u2019t want to give too many details on that, but we\u2019re just meeting Jalen today. He has earned a chance to probably get a nice contract for the job he does and the position he plays.\u201d\n\nRamsey agrees, as he demonstrated in July when he showed up to training camp with the Jaguars in an armored bank truck. The Rams have time to figure out a number that works for both \u2014 but they have less time to turn around a season that has stalled.\n\nMcVay is hopeful Ramsey will play Sunday at Atlanta when the Rams (3-3) attempt to end their first three-game losing streak since 2016, although the corner will need a medical exam first. Ramsey missed the Jaguars\u2019 last three games with a back injury but returned to practice recently.\n\n\u201cYou know the caliber of player that he is \u2014 the competitiveness, the toughness,\u201d McVay said. \u201cReally all the traits that you look for in a corner. Looking forward to getting to know the player and figuring out how he\u2019s going to help this football team.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ramsey won\u2019t be rushed, the Rams need reinforcements in their secondary. Along with starting cornerback Marcus Peters\u2019 departure in a trade to Baltimore on Tuesday, the Rams put two starters in their secondary \u2014 cornerback Aqib Talib and safety John Johnson \u2014 on injured reserve this week.\n\nEven in their depleted state, the Rams felt Ramsey was too good to pass up. Peters and Talib will be unrestricted free agents after this season, and the Rams were more interested in getting Ramsey than in retaining Peters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a handful of players like that, and he happens to be one of them,\u201d Snead said of Ramsey. \u201cNot saying that there\u2019s not a lot of good corners out there, but since he\u2019s been in the league, he\u2019s shown the ability to get out on an island.\u201d\n\nSnead and the Rams have a reputation for rewarding their elite players : In the past two years, they\u2019ve handed out the largest contracts in NFL history for a defensive tackle (Aaron Donald), a running back (Todd Gurley) and a quarterback (Jared Goff), and they gave a huge extension to receiver Brandin Woods before he played his first game for Los Angeles last year.\n\nSnead is well aware of Ramsey\u2019s contentious reputation after the cornerback repeatedly clashed with coaches, the front office and opponents during his tenure in Jacksonville. Los Angeles hasn\u2019t hesitated to acquire players with similar reputations \u2014 like Peters and Talib, for instance \u2014 but has had no public problems with them in McVay\u2019s system.\n\n\u201cWhen you do research on it, the first thing I want to know is, do they love football?\u201d Snead said. \u201cIs this the chapter they\u2019re focused on? And do they love winning? Ultimately, we\u2019re all going to go through some situations (and) you\u2019re going to have some outbursts, but a lot of times, with the research, it was maybe because of a loss or a bad play or things like that. These are young kids, so they don\u2019t have the emotional intelligence that I\u2019ve acquired, but probably didn\u2019t have at Jalen\u2019s age.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Blake Bortles and pass rusher Dante Fowler, two fellow top-five picks by the Jaguars now playing for the Rams, both spoke highly of Ramsey\u2019s work ethic and professionalism, McVay said. Bortles also praised Ramsey\u2019s loyalty to his teammates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a brand that he wants to get out there and have people in the world see, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Bortles said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys that have that and promote that. When he shows up to work and puts his pads on and goes to play football, it\u2019s all business. I think all that stuff kind of gets pushed away and he\u2019s totally focused on football. In the meantime and in his free time he does some funny things.\u201d\n\nFowler believes a move out West will spark Ramsey\u2019s passion for the game, just as it did for him last season.\n\n\u201cYou can never complain when you\u2019re coming out to LA,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cReally, he\u2019s one of my favorite teammates that I\u2019ve ever had. \u2026 We don\u2019t judge a person cause they do this or do that. We embrace personalities. When Marcus was here, we embraced his personality. Jalen is going to be the same way.\u201d\n\nNOTES: S Marqui Christian is likely to replace Johnson alongside Eric Weddle in the starting lineup, while Troy Hill and Darious Williams will be the Rams\u2019 starting cornerbacks at Atlanta if Ramsey doesn\u2019t play. \u2026 David Edwards, a rookie fifth-round pick from Wisconsin who hasn\u2019t taken an offensive snap this season, is expected to start at left guard Sunday in place of Joe Noteboom, who has a season-ending knee injury. Jamil Demby was Noteboom\u2019s backup, but hasn\u2019t impressed this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.
