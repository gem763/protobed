What\u2019s more, Riyadh also said it had an output capacity of more than 11 million barrels per day now, higher than before the attack.\n\nOil bears tightened their grip on the market on Friday after reports suggesting that Saudi Arabia would agree to a ceasefire in Yemen, where it has been fighting anti-government rebels for the last four years.\n\nPeace in Yemen, the focal point of Middle East tensions that have drawn even more attention in recent years than the Palestinian-Israel conflct, could result in much less war risk premium for oil, pushing crude prices even lower.\n\nHot on the heels of the Yemen development were Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s remarks to Reuters that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered to lift all sanctions on Iran in return for talks. Trump tweeted later that he had agreed to no such thing.\n\nBut crude prices remained down anyway as the idea of Iran being allowed to freely export its oil leaves the market vulnerable to additional supplies for which it isn\u2019t immediately prepared.\n\nIran said in May that it intends to produce at least 1.5 million bpd of crude if it is to enter a new nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers to end the sanctions on its oil. Prior to the sanctions, which came into force in November 2018, Iranian oil exports peaked at about 2.8 million bpd.\n\nAside from recurring production, the Islamic Republic also has millions of barrels of readily stored oil in bonded warehouses in China or floating offshore that could end up in short order on the global market.\n\nAdding to oil\u2019s weight on Friday was a Bloomberg report that the White House is considering ways to limit investor portfolio flows into China.\n\nThe stock market tumbled into the red Friday after the report.\n\nThe U.S. government was also considering de-listing Chinese companies from local exchanges and examining limits on Chinese companies included in stock indexes that are managed by American firms, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe report came as officials from the two countries were set to return to trade negotiations on Oct. 10. The White House did not immediately respond to the report.", "description": "Oil Posts Big Weekly Losses as Yemen, Other Negatives Pound Market", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEBA20ZO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
