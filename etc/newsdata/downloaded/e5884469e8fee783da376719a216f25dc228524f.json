Esper, who later recused himself from the final decision, citing a conflict of interest related to his son\u2019s employment with a company that bid on the contract.\n\nMr. Deasy insisted that the process leading up to the decision was conducted properly and fairly. \u201cAt no time throughout this process, have I ever shared any proprietary source information with [team members,] nor have I ever divulged, when we got to the conclusion, who the awardee was,\u201d Mr. Deasy said.\n\nThe JEDI contract \u2014 which could last up to 10 years and ultimately be worth $10 billion over the life of the deal \u2014 will cover the storage and processing of huge amounts of classified Pentagon data, and Microsoft will now be linked in an unprecedented high-tech partnership with the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cJEDI is a unique capability that allows us to move between classification and put information out to the tactical edge,\u201d Mr. Deasy said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be nor is it our only cloud today.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ben Wolfgang contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
