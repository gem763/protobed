United didn\u2019t allow Liverpool to get into the game at all. They were bossed in there today (midfield). It would be hard on Liverpool not to get anything from the game.\n\n'But I think United will take a lot from that game. They showed they can be organised and did carry a threat. United did a great job on Liverpool\u2019s full backs, they stopped them for most of the game. I think Liverpool got away with it today.'\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added that he didn't expect United to adopt such a positive approach.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville was surprised his old side were so positive\n\nNeville said: 'We didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be anywhere near as positive as they were in that back five. They were really positive from the first five minutes. He got it absolutely right, the game plan worked.\n\n'United will be happy, Ole will be happy. If United had conceded 15 minutes earlier I think Liverpool would have gone on to win that game.'\n\nThe 1-1 draw saw Liverpool's 17 game winning run in the Premier League come to an end, with United producing an encouraging display.\n\nFollowing the game Liverpool are six points clear of second place Manchester City, while United are in 13th.", "description": "Graeme Souness believes Liverpool were fortunate to leave Old Trafford with a point after being 'bossed' by Manchester United in Sunday's 1-1 draw.", "authors": ["Jeorge Bird For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/19/19962646-0-image-a-15_1571594805126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
