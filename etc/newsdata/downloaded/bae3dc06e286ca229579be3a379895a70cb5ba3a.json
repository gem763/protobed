But \"a number of members assessed the case for renewed asset purchases as not sufficiently strong,\" according to the account.\n\nThey were quoted as saying that bond purchases would either be ineffective or should be held back as a last resort.\n\nThe 25-member rate-setting council in the end decided by \"clear majority\" to start \u20ac20 billion ($32 billion) in purchases a month and to cut a key interest benchmark to minus 0.5 per cent from minus 0.4 per cent. The bank also said it would keep rates low indefinitely until inflation is clearly coming back in line with the bank's goal of just under 2 per cent.", "description": "Records show an unusual amount of dissent among European Central Bank officials over stimulus, with some members opposing the launch of bond purchases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3829%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_181%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3aa7c27ef71ddbebc57ae98ecaaaae35ff073613", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
