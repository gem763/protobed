Brandt showed the perfect example of Christian love and grace by forgiving the killer.\n\nBrandt then stood and asked the court if he could give the convicted woman a hug to show that he truly did forgive her.\n\nWhat a moment in the courtroom, just now. Botham Jean's brother Brandt took the opportunity to forgive Amber Guyger, tell her to devote her life to Christ, and then asked the judge if he could give Guyger a hug. The judge, wiping tears from her eyes, allowed the moment to happen pic.twitter.com/rxo6sNOwa7 \u2014 Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) October 2, 2019\n\nHowever, Hill took a swipe at Judge Kemp for following the young man\u2019s example and giving the convicted killer a hug in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cHow Botham Jean\u2019s brother chooses to grieve is his business. He\u2019s entitled to that,\u201d Hill dismissively tweeted before taking aim at the judge. \u201cBut this judge choosing to hug this woman is unacceptable. Keep in mind this convicted murderer is the same one who laughed about Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination, and killing ppl on sight.\u201d\n\nHow Botham Jean\u2019s brother chooses to grieve is his business.

The tweets were highlighted during the trial.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Judge Tammy Kemp hugged Amber Guyger and gave her a Bible on Wednesday, after the former Dallas cop and convicted killer was sentenced to", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Tom-Fox-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
