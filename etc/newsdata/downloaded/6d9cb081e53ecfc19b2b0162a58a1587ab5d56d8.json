Na\u00efve in that we didn\u2019t know or ignorant rather \u2014 that\u2019s a better word. Ignorant is a better word.\u201d\n\nFollowing the world premiere of \u201cJudy\u201d at the Telluride Film Festival, there was instantly an outpouring of predictions that Zellweger would return to the Oscar race for her transformative work. Through makeup, wigs, fake teeth and on-the-nose recreations of Garland\u2019s wardrobe, Zellweger is Judy Garland. She was so committed to recreating Garland\u2019s hunched posture that she ended up at a chiropractor \u201ca few times\u201d while shooting the movie in London.\n\nLike Garland, Zellweger spent years being hounded by paparazzi and the tabloid press. But then in 2010, Zellweger decided she need a break. She stopped working in Hollywood and started working on herself, which included seeing a therapist. Is it any wonder that Garland\u2019s life resonated with Zellweger?\n\n\u201cI understand the schedule and I understand the choices have to make,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand public scrutiny and I understand having a public persona where some people might feel that they know you and that\u2019s really lovely and a blessing in so many ways. And then there\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding and misconception in the mix and I understand that, too. Projection, and you know, false narratives.\u201d\n\nHaving first showed off her vocal chops in 2002\u2019s Chicago, Zellweger returns to singing on screen, performing many of Garland\u2019s classics. She also duets with Sam Smith on \u201cGet Happy\u201d on the \u201cJudy\u201d soundtrack.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that ridiculous?\u201d Zellweger said, adding, \u201cIt took him like two minutes\u2026He\u2019s so gifted. What a special, sweet, fun person. He just sparkles. He just came in and he was like, \u2018Here we go!\u2019\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the entire interview of Zellweger on this week\u2019s \u201cThe Big Ticket\u201d below.
