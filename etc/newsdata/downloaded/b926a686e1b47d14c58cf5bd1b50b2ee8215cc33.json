In addition, Utico intends to offer the cash equivalent of a 4 per cent stake in the enlarged Utico group plus additional cash to PNP investors.\n\nBut there is still no deal signed by all parties as Utico claimed that advisers' fees, board representation and management oversight, have \"remained the key gap items even till today.\" Hyflux said that parties had yet to resolve \"final outstanding issues\" in the draft agreements.\n\nIn May this year, Hyflux and three of its subsidiaries had asked for a four-month extension on its debt moratorium, saying it was in discussions with other potential investors.\n\nBack then, the firm had said that in addition to talks with Utico for a S$400 million investment, it was also in talks with Mauritius-based investment fund Oyster Bay Fund for up to S$500 million. A third investor, said to be a large desalination company, had issued a letter of interest for certain assets in Algeria, Oman, the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nFour more companies were also in discussions over a potential investment. They were a large power sector player in Asia looking to merge with Hyflux group, a fund whose corporate strategy included turning around distressed firms, a major Asia-based nuclear and civil engineering contractor, and a major waste treatment player.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - THE High Court on Monday morning allowed debt-ridden water treatment firm Hyflux two more months of reprieve from its creditors - until Dec 2 - as the company continues to work with Utico and some unidentified investors to nail down a restructuring plan. .
