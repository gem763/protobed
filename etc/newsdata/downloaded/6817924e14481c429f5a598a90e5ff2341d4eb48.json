Technicians from the Chinese powerhouse have, in at least two cases, personally helped African governments spy on their political opponents, including intercepting their encrypted communications and social media, and using cell data to track their whereabouts, according to senior security officials working directly with the Huawei employees in these countries.\n\nIn Kampala, Uganda, last year, a group of six intelligence officers struggled to contain a threat to the 33-year regime of President Yoweri Museveni, according to Ugandan senior security officials. A pop star turned political sensation, Bobi Wine, had returned from Washington with U.S. backing for his opposition movement, and Uganda\u2019s cyber-surveillance unit had strict orders to intercept his encrypted communications, using the broad powers of a 2010 law that gives the government the ability \u201cto secure its multidimensional interests.\u201d\n\nBobi Wine, whose full name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is a musician and opposition member of the Ugandan Parliament.

Then they asked for help from the staff working in their offices from Huawei, Uganda\u2019s top digital supplier.\n\n\u201cThe Huawei technicians worked for two days and helped us puncture through,\u201d said one senior officer at the surveillance unit. The Huawei engineers, identified by name in internal police documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, used the spyware to penetrate Mr. Wine\u2019s WhatsApp chat group, named Firebase crew after his band. Authorities scuppered his plans to organize street rallies and arrested the politician and dozens of his supporters.\n\nThe incident in Uganda and another in Zambia, as detailed in a Journal investigation, show how Huawei employees have used the company\u2019s technology and other companies\u2019 products to support the domestic spying of those governments.\n\nSince 2012 the U.S. government has accused Huawei\u2014the world\u2019s largest maker of telecom equipment and second-largest manufacturer of smartphones\u2014of being a potential tool for the Chinese government to spy abroad, after decades of alleged corporate espionage by state-backed Chinese actors. Huawei has forcefully denied those charges.\n\nThe Journal investigation didn\u2019t turn up evidence of spying by or on behalf of Beijing in Africa. Nor did it find that Huawei executives in China knew of, directed or approved the activities described. It also didn\u2019t find that there was something particular about the technology in Huawei\u2019s network that made such activities possible.\n\nDetails of the operations, however, offer evidence that Huawei employees played a direct role in government efforts to intercept the private communications of opponents.\n\nHuawei has \u201cnever been engaged in \u2018hacking\u2019 activities,\u201d said a Huawei spokesman in a written statement. \u201cHuawei rejects completely these unfounded and inaccurate allegations against our business operations. Our internal investigation shows clearly that Huawei and its employees have not been engaged in any of the activities alleged. We have neither the contracts, nor the capabilities, to do so.\u201d\n\nHuawei\u2019s headquarters in Kampala, Uganda. Photo: SUMY SADURNI for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe spokesman added: \u201cHuawei\u2019s code of business conduct prohibits any employees from undertaking any activities that would compromise our customers or end users data or privacy or that would breach any laws. Huawei prides itself on its compliance with local regulations and laws in all markets where it operates.\u201d\n\nIn Zambia, according to senior security officials there, Huawei technicians helped the government access the phones and Facebook pages of a team of opposition bloggers running a pro-opposition news site, which had repeatedly criticized President Edgar Lungu. The senior security officials identified by name two Huawei experts based in a cyber-surveillance unit in the offices of Zambia\u2019s telecom regulator who pinpointed the bloggers\u2019 locations and were in constant contact with police units deployed to arrest them in the northwestern city of Solwezi.\n\nThe ruling Patriotic Front posted on its Facebook page in April that police officers working with \u201cChinese experts at Huawei have managed to track\u201d and arrest the bloggers. The party\u2019s spokesman confirmed to the Journal that the case was handled by the Cybercrime Crack Squad, the unit at the telecom regulator.\n\nThe revelations focus attention on the surveillance systems Huawei sells governments, often branded \u201csafe cities.\u201d The company says it has installed the systems in 700 cities spread across more than 100 countries and regions.\n\nIn Zambia, Huawei\u2019s products are part of the country\u2019s Smart Zambia initiative to implement digital technologies across government departments.\n\nHuawei, in the statement, said it had never sold safe city solutions in Zambia and hasn\u2019t conducted business with Zambia\u2019s Cybercrime Crack Squad.\n\nChinese government officials have played a key role in facilitating deals for Huawei in Africa, attending meetings and escorting African intelligence officials to the company\u2019s headquarters in Shenzhen, according to senior African security officials.\n\nWhile many of the projects are rudimentary, Huawei has sold advanced video-surveillance and facial-recognition systems in more than two dozen developing countries, according to data gathered by Steven Feldstein, an expert in digital surveillance at Boise State University and a former Africa specialist at the State Department.\n\nHuawei lists foreign firms among its partners in its safe-city products, including U.S. smart-sensor manufacturer and systems integrator Johnson Controls International PLC and iOmniscient Pty. Ltd., an Australian producer of AI systems that analyze video, sound and smell. Johnson Controls declined to comment. iOmniscient said it has provided behavioral analytics products through Huawei in the Middle East but not in Africa.\n\nContinental Drift Huawei is Africa's dominant supplier of mobile internet networks and state surveillance systems.

Huawei\u2019s elite systems move beyond that level. According to senior security officials, embedded, hands-on Huawei technicians train security forces and cyber-surveillance units that regularly snoop on political opposition.\n\n\u201cThe big question has been whether Chinese companies are just doing this for the money, or whether they\u2019re pushing a specific kind of surveillance agenda,\u201d Mr. Feldstein said, after being briefed on findings by the Journal. \u201cThis would suggest it\u2019s the latter.\u201d\n\nAfrica\u2019s importance to China \u201cis at least as much about Beijing\u2019s longer-term vision for recruiting foreign countries to embrace Chinese norms of governance in the digital sphere and in terms of its illiberal political values,\u201d said Andrew Davenport, an executive at RWR Advisory Group, a Washington, D.C.-based risk management firm that tracks the international activities of Chinese and Russian firms.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s investigation included classified police documents and parliamentary committee documents, and interviews with more than a dozen senior security officials working with Huawei in African countries, and with diplomats, cyber-defense officials and opposition activists who say they have had their communications compromised.\n\nUganda\u2019s government confirmed Huawei technicians were working with its police and intelligence agencies to bolster national security but declined to comment on the allegations of intercepting communications.\n\n\u201cWe are not at liberty to publicly reveal the specifics,\u201d said Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesman. Mr. Opondo denied that the government is targeting Bobi Wine, saying the opposition lawmaker \u201cisn\u2019t such an important issue\u201d to warrant heightened surveillance.\n\nDorothy Mukasa, director of Unwanted Witness, a Ugandan organization working to fight online censorship. Photo: Cl\u00e9ment B\u00fcrge/The Wall Street Journal\n\nZambia\u2019s ruling party spokesman, Antonio Mwanza, said Huawei technicians, based inside the Zambia Information & Communications Technology Authority, or Zicta, regulator, were helping the government combat opposition news sites.\n\n\u201cWhenever we want to track down perpetrators of fake news, we ask Zicta, which is the lead agency. They work with Huawei to ensure that people don\u2019t use our telecommunications space to spread fake news,\u201d he said.\n\nUgandan officials said that Huawei representatives have stopped attending technical briefings since the Journal submitted questions to the Chinese company.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a written statement that it is common practice for countries to cooperate on policing. \u201cSome African countries have enthusiastically built \u2018safe cities\u2019 in order to improve the lives of their people and their business environments,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cTo equate this positive effort with \u2018surveillance\u2019 smacks of ulterior motives.\u201d\n\nHuawei\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, publicly denied in January that the company spied on behalf of the Chinese government. It was the launch of a global public-relations blitz to counter negative press sparked by the arrest in Canada of Huawei\u2019s CFO and a Trump administration pressure campaign to persuade allies to ban Huawei gear from next-generation 5G networks.\n\n\u201cNeither Huawei, nor I personally, have ever received any requests from any government to provide improper information,\u201d Mr. Ren said at a gathering of foreign journalists.\n\nSurveillance cameras are common around Kampala. Photo: SUMY SADURNI for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn May, President Trump escalated the campaign, signing an executive order that allows the U.S. to ban telecommunications gear and services from \u201cforeign adversaries,\u201d a term widely interpreted to refer to Huawei. The Commerce Department added Huawei to the \u201cEntity List,\u201d citing national security concerns, which effectively bars companies from supplying U.S.-made technology to Huawei without a license. The president said last week that business with Huawei may be a factor in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nHuawei has connected hundreds of millions of African consumers since first doing business in Kenya in 1998. It has built telecom networks in some 40 African nations by offering inexpensive deals often financed by loans with favorable terms and by providing on-the-ground customer service. Huawei now dominates Africa\u2019s internet business. In recent years, it has expanded into digital-surveillance systems.\n\nZambian senior security officials said that in the country\u2019s new $75 million data center, Huawei employees work with the Cybercrime Crack Squad, sitting in cubicles where they monitor and intercept digital communications from a broad spectrum that includes criminal suspects, as well as opposition groups, activists and journalists.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s capital, Huawei has helped build 11 monitoring centers used to fight crime, according to the national police deputy spokeswoman. A new six-story, $30 million hub due to open in November will be linked to more than 5,000 of the company\u2019s cameras equipped with facial-recognition technology.\n\nIn one of the rooms at Uganda\u2019s police headquarters, Huawei has its red logo affixed to the wall. \u201cThey teach us to use spyware against security threats and political enemies,\u201d said one official at the unit.\n\nA few years ago, the East and Southern African nations appeared to be regional models for web freedom: few rules policed social-media usage or restricted freedom of the press, and there was more competition in the marketplace. Programmers and aspiring entrepreneurs from top U.S. colleges flocked to Kampala to launch startups.\n\nWorld Power Huawei has quickly become the largest maker of telecom equipment.

Concerned about the mobilizing power of social media and what he called public immorality online, he asked his intelligence agencies to find better tools to monitor the web and muzzle online dissent.\n\nAs a crash in commodity prices heaped pressure on Mr. Museveni ahead of his fifth election campaign in 2016, Uganda began to deploy surveillance software, including FinFisher, made by Anglo-German company Lench IT Solutions, which they inserted into the Wi-Fi networks of several of Kampala\u2019s top hotels to penetrate the phones of politicians, journalists and activists, according to the senior government officials and Unwanted Witness.\n\nLench IT didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe technology had limitations: It didn\u2019t infiltrate devices that didn\u2019t connect to the targeted Wi-Fi networks and couldn\u2019t crack encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp.\n\nMr. Museveni won the 2016 election but in spring 2017 faced fresh protests over his move to abolish the age limit for the presidency. Mr. Museveni directed then-police chief, Kale Kayihura, to approach the Chinese government to help expand digital surveillance, according to senior security officials.\n\nHuawei had arrived in Uganda in the early 2000s. It won its first major government contract in 2007 and gave the Ugandan government 20 surveillance cameras valued at $750,000 in 2014. At a donation ceremony attended by Chinese government officials, Mr. Museveni thanked Huawei \u201cfor its contribution to corporate social responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe following year Huawei signed a deal to become the Ugandan government\u2019s sole information-communications partner.\n\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni met with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping in Beijing in September. Photo: LINTAO ZHANG/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nWithin weeks of Mr. Museveni\u2019s 2017 order to expand digital snooping on the opposition, Uganda\u2019s communications regulator contracted Huawei to explore setting up a surveillance center with assistance from security agencies, according to senior Ugandan officials.\n\nBy May, Uganda\u2019s police force had sent dozens of officers for technical training in Beijing, accompanied by senior Huawei Africa-based employees and a senior Chinese Embassy official, Chu Maoming. After three days the group was flown to the company\u2019s Shenzhen headquarters, where Huawei executives shared details on the surveillance systems it had built across the world, according to Ugandan security officials who were present.\n\nMr. Chu played a crucial intermediary role in the talks. He accompanied the delegation to meetings with China\u2019s Public Security Agency in the ministry\u2019s cube-like complex near Tiananmen Square, where they were shown the capabilities of the Chinese surveillance state. Mr. Chu then flew with the group to Shenzhen and sat in on meetings with Huawei executives, according to the Ugandan officials present.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t address Mr. Chu\u2019s specific involvement in the deal but said in its statement that when the Chinese government welcomes foreign delegations, \u201cit will organize visits according to their wishes, including to companies.\u201d The ministry said such arrangements are common practice around the world. The Chinese Embassy in Kampala didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHuawei executives recommended to Uganda it look at a surveillance system in Algeria, where the aging autocrat Abdelaziz Bouteflika was trying to stare down simmering opposition after almost 20 years in power, according to the Ugandan officials. Mr. Bouteflika was ousted in April this year.\n\nIn September 2017, a team of senior Ugandan security officials was dispatched to study the video surveillance system in Algiers, which included mass monitoring and cyber-surveillance centers.\n\n\u201cWe discussed hacking individuals in the opposition who can threaten national security,\u201d one of the officials said, adding that Algerians are advanced in that field.\n\nUganda is expanding digital surveillance and tightening censorship. Photo: SUMY SADURNI for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Ugandan and Algerian forces jointly prepared a classified report, reviewed by the Journal, that calls Algeria\u2019s system \u201cHuawei\u2019s intelligent video surveillance system\u201d and says it is \u201can advanced system and provides one of the best surveillance applications.\u201d\n\nLater that month, Mr. Kayihura, the police chief at the time, signed a cooperation agreement with Algeria to have an Algerian team advise on the rollout of Uganda\u2019s Huawei-implemented surveillance program. The project\u2019s lead Algerian adviser was described by the Algerians as a cyber expert trained in Huawei\u2019s headquarters in Shenzhen, according to senior Ugandan officials.\n\nHuawei, in the statement, said it had never sold safe city solutions in Algeria.\n\nAlgeria\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t respond to multiple emails and calls for comment. Multiple visits and calls to the Algerian Embassy in Uganda yielded no comment.\n\nMr. Kayihura, who has been under house arrest since June 2018 and has been charged with several offenses including illegally distributing government weapons to civilian militia, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nIn May 2018, Uganda\u2019s Mr. Museveni signed a $126 million deal with Huawei for the safe-cities project after a classified bidding process involving two Chinese companies, paying $16.3 million up front and financing most of the rest with a $104 million loan from Standard Chartered Bank, according to documents presented to a parliamentary committee. Work began in July to construct a digital surveillance unit at Kampala\u2019s police headquarters and to install hundreds more street cameras.\n\nA product brochure on the Huawei website this year said the first phase of Uganda\u2019s project would connect 83 police stations in the capital and be expanded to another 271 police stations across the country.\n\nSome lawmakers raised concerns about the project and its lack of transparency. \u201cThere appears to be a policy to hand over the country\u2019s entire communications infrastructure to the Chinese,\u201d Maxwell Akora, an opposition party member of the Ugandan Parliament\u2019s Information, Science and Communication Technology Committee, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s unwise given our concerns about spying and creating backdoor channels.\u201d\n\nBefore the Huawei project got rolling, in early 2017, Uganda\u2019s security services received a delivery of spyware, according to Ugandan senior security officials. The spyware was modeled on a product called Pegasus, created by Israeli firm NSO Group. Similar products are sold under different names by a number of cyber-intelligence firms. The spyware can penetrate encrypted messages in smartphones, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe Ugandans received training from five Israeli government technicians. Ugandan intelligence officers said they were taught how to use the spyware for reading emails and texts but not encrypted communications.\n\nThe Israeli government didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe training was short-lived and not very sophisticated like what we got from the Chinese,\u201d one senior Ugandan security official said.\n\nBobi Wine, in his office in Kampala, has become a leader in the opposition to the Museveni rule. Photo: SUMY SADURNI for The Wall Street Journal\n\nUganda\u2019s first cyber unit opened in November 2018, and Huawei technicians were seconded from the Shenzhen headquarters to train Ugandans how to use the Huawei infrastructure and software and tools in part from other companies to monitor the web, according to Ugandan senior security officials.\n\nUgandan social media monitors began to send alerts to security chiefs if they detected \u201coffensive communication,\u201d a euphemism for antigovernment rhetoric, on citizens\u2019 accounts, the officials said.\n\nThe capability gave Ugandan security officials more visibility into opposition activists\u2019 communications as a wave of protests erupted from a new source: the rapper-turned-activist Bobi Wine. In July and August 2018, Mr. Wine, whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu and who had been elected to Parliament in 2017, brought tens of thousands of people into the streets for a series of concerts at which he called for Mr. Museveni to step down. He was arrested and badly beaten, then traveled to the U.S. for medical treatment, where he got support from several congressmen.\n\nIn early December 2018, after Mr. Wine returned, a group of Ugandan intelligence officers in the cyber unit picked up wiretapped phone conversations between the pop star and several of the country\u2019s most high-profile opposition lawmakers, according to Ugandan senior security officials.\n\nMr. Wine appeared to be arranging for the politicians to give speeches at his concerts. But the cyber team monitoring the calls had a problem. They couldn\u2019t decipher the details of the plans because Mr. Wine was speaking to his team using a coded street slang.\n\nA senior police commander relayed a presidential order to access Mr. Wine\u2019s encrypted written and spoken communications, including those through WhatsApp and Skype, to a six-man cyber team based at police headquarters, according to the security officials. They spent days trying to penetrate the communications using the spyware but failed.\n\nThey asked for help from Huawei technicians\u2014who then cracked Mr. Wine\u2019s encrypted communications using the spyware within two days, the security officials said.\n\n\u201cIt was very clear he was organizing a political event, not a music show. We had to act quickly,\u201d one of the officials said.\n\nIn a WhatsApp chat group, Uganda\u2019s cyber team saw a list of 11 lawmakers Mr. Wine was planning to secretly insert into the concert program. The rally, at Mr. Wine\u2019s beach club, was scheduled unusually early to throw off the security services. Using information from the cyber hub, hundreds of police swarmed the venue, arresting dozens of organizers and attendees. Some were arrested before they could reach the club.\n\nPolice officers arrest a Bobi Wine supporter in April. Photo: badru katumba/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe were shocked. They knew everything about the event and the speakers, who we hadn\u2019t announced,\u201d Mr. Wine said.\n\nOne of the security officials showed the Journal screenshots of Mr. Wine\u2019s WhatsApp chats with the Firebase crew where participants were exchanging details on the planned events. The official said the operation would have been impossible without the skills of Huawei\u2019s technicians.\n\nMr. Wine, whose attempts to organize subsequent rallies have also been foiled, said the surveillance has spread to his family, his entourage and the people who frequent bars where his music is played. He now switches between several phones and uses devices of sympathetic members of the public, but he said he is outgunned by Mr. Museveni\u2019s expanding machine.\n\n\u201cThe deal with Huawei is a survivor strategy to consolidate power,\u201d he said in an interview in his Kampala home. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-out assault.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts China has wired Africa. How should the U.S. respond? Join the conversation below.\n\nA similar story unfolded in Zambia.\n\nThe first phase of the project, worth $440 million and mostly financed by the Export-Import Bank of China, began in 2015 after President Edgar Lungu traveled to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping. Since 2016, Huawei has led the construction of an information and communication technologies training hub and hundreds of cellphone and data connection towers.\n\nHuawei has also established a data center complex at Zicta, the telecom regulator, said Brian Mushimba, Zambia\u2019s minister of transport and communications, in a telephone interview with the Journal.\n\nHuawei offices in Lusaka, Zambia. Photo: Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg News\n\nOn the second floor of Zicta\u2019s gray-colored facility, behind biometric scanners, Huawei employees are embedded within Zambia\u2019s new data center, which houses the Cybercrime Crack Squad, Zambian security officials said. Established in February, around half of the 40-strong staff at the data center are Huawei employees, two Zambian officials there said.\n\nIn April, President Lungu\u2019s office ordered a crackdown on news sites that had published a string of damaging stories. Zambia was for decades seen as one of Africa\u2019s most stable and permissive democracies, but in recent years it has moved to muzzle opposition media, shuttering some of the country\u2019s top newspapers and television channels and pushing antigovernment voices onto Facebook sites and WhatsApp forums.\n\nMr. Lungu\u2019s press secretary, Amos Chanda, called the head of the cyber squad, Mofya Chisala, and a senior chief Huawei technician for help, Zambian intelligence officers said.\n\nMr. Chanda said he had \u201cno recollection of the events or meetings\u201d with the cyber squad or Huawei officials. Mr. Chisala didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHuawei technicians helped intercept the communications of opposition bloggers running a news site named Koswe, or \u201cThe Rat,\u201d which had repeatedly criticized Mr. Lungu, the two Zambian officials in the Cybercrime Crack Squad said.\n\nThe Huawei staff accessed the bloggers\u2019 Facebook pages, where they found their phone numbers, and then used spyware from another company to look into and locate the devices.\n\nOn April 18, a team of cyber officials, police intelligence and Zicta experts huddled in Mr. Chanda\u2019s office, on the ground floor of the presidential mansion. Two Huawei technicians opened their laptops to display screens showing live trace routes of several mobile phones linked to the targeted bloggers\u2019 Facebook pages, on maps that also charted Huawei phone antennas, Zambian intelligence officials said.\n\nA satellite and telecommunications tower in Lusaka, where Huawei\u2019s products are part of the country\u2019s Smart Zambia initiative to implement digital technologies. Photo: Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg News\n\nThe cyber squad alerted the police in the northwestern provinces where Huawei had pinpointed the opposition bloggers.\n\nOver the next few days, Huawei experts helped Zambian officials track the targets from the Zicta data center offices, maintaining real-time contact with police officers in the field, the intelligence officials said.\n\nFinally, police swooped in on sites on the outskirts of the copper mining town Solwezi. One suspect was typing on his laptop when officers burst in and seized his electronic devices.\n\n\u201cWe found one of the suspects editing a long, malicious article which he was about to post,\u201d one of the intelligence officials said.\n\nOne official on the cyber squad said the Zambians have \u201cnowhere near the expertise\u201d of Huawei.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nUganda\u2019s security services in early 2017 received a delivery of Pegasus-style spyware. An earlier version of this article incorrectly implied the services received the Pegasus brand of spyware.
