(Image: Netflix, YouTube)\n\nVideo: It\u2019s time for one last ride: Netflix\u2019s BoJack Horseman is coming to an end after six seasons, with a two-part final run that shows BoJack (Will Arnett) on the road to healing... even if the world around him continues to spiral.\n\nThe first trailer for the final season of BoJack Horseman sees the former star of Horsin\u2019 Around in rehab, relieved that he\u2019s finally getting help for his years of alcohol abuse and other problems stemming from his self-destructive behaviour.\n\nMuch of the trailer takes the form of letters between BoJack and Diane (Alison Brie) as BoJack shares the peace he\u2019s found in rehab \u2014 while adding little reminders that he isn\u2019t entirely free of his narcissistic tendencies.\n\nMeanwhile, the world outside of rehab continues in its typical chaotic fashion, with Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) adjusting to life as a parent and Todd (Aaron Paul) getting some shocking news about his mother.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t breaking BoJack\u2019s stride. He\u2019s wasted years being miserable, and he\u2019s tired of it. It\u2019s clear that BoJack is finally trying to get the help he needs, but is it going to be enough?\n\nPart one of BoJack Horseman\u2019s final season will arrive on Netflix October 25, with the second half getting released on 31 January 2020.", "description": "Video: It\u2019s time for one last ride: Netflix\u2019s BoJack Horseman is coming to an end after six seasons, with a two-part final run that shows BoJack (Will Arnett) on the road to healing... even if the world around him continues to spiral....", "authors": ["Elizabeth Blackstock", "James Whitbrook"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/o3ydexarbbsgmfzguujy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
