Consumers who use Facebook\u2019s Messenger service, WhatsApp, or a stand-alone app, will be able to access Libra through a digital wallet managed by new Facebook subsidiary Calibra. Libra\u2019s value will be tied to hard assets, including various currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro.\n\n\u2018If people buy Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency, it will increase distance from the money and create less pain of payment.\u2019 \u2014Dan Ariely, behavioral economist\n\nStarting as soon as next year, Facebook expects that consumers will be able to begin making actual purchases with Libra, although the number of purchases will be limited at first. The announcement is seen as a boon for other cryptocurrencies. This summer, some suggested that the price of bitcoin BTCUSD, -7.99% could quadruple in the coming months.\n\nFacebook isn\u2019t planning on running the cryptocurrency directly. Calibra will be a founding member of the nonprofit Libra Association, which will manage the coin alongside other financial services firms. However, some of the companies that had originally signed onto the project have reportedly begun reconsidering their involvement, including eBay EBAY, +0.35%, Visa V, +0.40% and Mastercard MA, +0.27%. Other companies set to participate include PayPal Holdings PYPL, -1.18%, Lyft LYFT, +0.55%, Uber UBER, +0.09% and Kiva.\n\nSince Facebook revealed its Libra plans in June, the cryptocurrency has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and analysts across the globe. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin raised concerns that the coin could be used for money laundering, while President Trump argued that Facebook should be required to obtain a banking charter to move forward with its plan.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have also taken issue with the cryptocurrency \u2014 Rep. Maxine Waters of California proposed legislation that would prohibit major tech companies from becoming financial institutions or offering cryptocurrencies.\n\nZuckerberg is expected to defend the cryptocurrency project in a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. In prepared remarks, Zuckerberg argued that Libra would \u201cextend America\u2019s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world.\u201d He further emphasized that if the U.S. doesn\u2019t develop a cryptocurrency like Libra, then China could.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Facebook executives have faced congressional scrutiny over Libra. Last summer company executives participated in a pair of congressional hearings before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nConsumers will want to pay attention to the outcome of Wednesday\u2019s hearing. While lawmakers have largely focused on how the stablecoin could be used for nefarious purposes, Libra could also translate into overspending and debt if it does come to fruition and consumers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s everything Apple isn\u2019t telling you about its new credit card\n\nRemoving the pain point\n\nBehavioral economists and psychologists have long said that credit-card usage causes people to spend more money than they would have otherwise spent with cash. Research has shown that spending cash \u2014 the literal act of handing bills and coins over to another person \u2014 triggers the same parts of the brain that process physical pain.\n\nOne 2008 study found that consumers spent more when they were given scrip, a form of a stored-value certificate, rather than cash.\n\nCredit cards famously dull that pain, a reflection of the fact that the transaction feels less salient, said Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University. \u201cWith the credit card, you\u2019re not going to pay now, you\u2019ll pay later, so it\u2019s less salient,\u201d Ariely said. \u201cAs saliency is higher, people feel more pain, and pay less.\u201d\n\nAnd so, credit cards can encourage overspending because they make the act of spending money less painful. The relationship between payment method and overspending isn\u2019t unique to credit cards.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Want to delete Facebook? Read what happened to these people first\n\nA 2008 study from New York University professor Priya Raghubir and University of Maryland, College Park professor Joydeep Srivastava tested whether people approached other forms of payment similar to how they used credit cards. Their study found that consumers spent more when they were given scrip, a form of a stored-value certificate, rather than cash.\n\nSimilarly, research has shown that consumers start spending more money when they begin using mobile wallets instead of credit cards or cash.\n\nThe \u2018house money effect\u2019 suggests that people will take more risks with money if it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s theirs. The concept owes its name to casinos.\n\nCryptocurrency may be viewed by consumers as more akin to credit cards than cash, since it may not feel like \u201cactual\u201d money. \u201cIf people buy Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency, it will increase distance from the money and create less pain of payment,\u201d Ariely said.\n\nAriely argued another factor called the \u201chouse money effect\u201d could come into play. This theory suggests that people will take more risks with money if it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s theirs \u2014 the concept owes its name to casinos and how people don\u2019t hesitate to wager chips as they would if they were betting real cash instead.\n\nA similar disconnect could play out with Libra, since consumers will need to purchase or exchange fiat currency for it. \u201cIn my mind, it would be \u2018Facebook money,\u2019 Ariely said. \u201cI\u2019ll not think of it as money that\u2019s coming from savings.\u201d\n\n\u2018Consumers who can adequately understand and formulate the exchange rate, much like with foreign currencies, are likely to keep spending with cryptocurrency in check.\u2019 \u2014 Ben Smith, founder of Cove Financial Planning\n\nMaking matters worse, consumers\u2019 fortunes with Libra will depend largely on their understanding of how it works. \u201cConsumers who can adequately understand and formulate the exchange rate, much like with foreign currencies, are likely to keep spending with cryptocurrency in check,\u201d said Ben Smith, founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee, Wis.\n\nConsumers will need to know how currency exchange works to understand that when they cash out Libra, it could be worth more or less than when they first purchased Libra, depending on how its value has fluctuated.\n\nKeeping up with the Joneses\n\nConsumers may face a triple-whammy thanks to Libra\u2019s Facebook connection. Social media has been shown to promote spending thanks to peer pressure. A recent study from Charles Schwab SCHW, +0.89% found that 57% of consumers said they paid more attention to how friends spent money rather than how they saved it on social media, while 49% of millennials reported that social media influenced their choices to spend money on experiences.\n\nAlso see: Amazon\u2019s new credit card could backfire on people with bad credit\n\n\u201cThe burden to \u2018keep up with the Joneses\u2019 has been part of our culture for decades, but it appears that social media and the fear of missing out (FOMO) have increased the pressure to spend,\u201d Terri Kallsen, executive vice president and head of Schwab Investor Services, said in the report.\n\nOne bright spot for consumers amid Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency push: People don\u2019t trust the social-media giant. As a result, adoption of Libra may be limited. In a 2018 survey by personal-finance website MagnifyMoney TREE, +0.95%, 91% of respondents said they wouldn\u2019t trust Facebook to handle their payments. And as it stands, only 21% of people have reported using Messenger Payments.\n\nShares of Facebook are down 10.04% over the last three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.21% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.16% are down 1.61% and 0.75% respectively.\n\nThis story was updated on Oct. 23, 2019.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to defend the cryptocurrency in a congressional hearing.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG635_facebo_ZG_20180402153545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-19"}
