(NASDAQ: ) jumped $2.38 to $65.82 on 1.5 million shares, or 1 1/2 times its average volume. The move, on no news, broke the stock out of a 6-week base pattern. Watch for a move next to retest the recent highs at $69-$70.\n\nSunPower Corporation (NASDAQ: ) popped $1.56, or 12%, to $14.50 on 7.5 million shares, more than 2 1/2 times its average volume. The stock, which has been stair-stepping higher all year from below the $5 level, had been pulling back in a month-long pennant pattern prior to Tuesday's breakout. The mid-channel target is $16.\n\nAmong other charts to watch, Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) also had a strong day Tuesday, up $1.14, or 5%, to $20.91 on 876,800 shares, 1 1/2 times its average volume. The move, which came on no news from the distributor of individual and family health insurance plans, broke the stock above lateral resistance from the recent double-top and above the 50-day moving average. Watch for $25 next.\n\nSnap Inc . (NYSE: ) surged $1.07, or 6.7%, to $16.83 on 40 million shares Tuesday, more than double its average volume, after a Susquehanna analyst upgraded the stock to neutral from negative. The stock broke through its declining tops line and lateral price resistance. If it can get through the August high near $17.20, it should test the July high near $18.50 next.\n\nSee Harry's video chart analysis on these stocks.\n\nNo holdings", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Harry Boxer covering: SunPower Corporation, First Solar Inc, Health Insurance Innovations Inc, Snap Inc.
