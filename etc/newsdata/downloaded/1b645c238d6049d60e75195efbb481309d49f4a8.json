They were trading at 151.10 pence on Wednesday morning in London, valuing the company at \u00a3158 million.\n\nThe gloomy trading statement comes less than a month after De La Rue named Clive Vacher as its new chief executive in a bid to turnaround the company which has been hit by a series of crisis in the past 18 months, including an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.\n\nVacher is conducting a \u201cdetailed review of the business\u201d and plans to update investors at the end of November alongside its first-half results.\n\nLast year, De La Rue was dealt a severe blow after it lost the \u00a3490m government contract to make the U.K\u2019s new post-Brexit blue passports to Franco-Dutch company Gemalto. It had been printing the burgundy-colored passport since 2010.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said De La Rue fails a major test for investors. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t exist as a business today, would you really set it up? Being a specialist bank note printer looks anachronistic in an increasingly cashless world.\u201d\n\nMould added: \u201cAdd into the mix the loss of the contract to print British passports, an unpaid debt owed to it by the Venezuelan central bank, a fraud investigation into corruption in South Sudan as well as increasing pressure from activist shareholder Crystal Amber and it is little surprise the company has resorted to a change of management in a desperate attempt to revive its fortunes.", "description": "U.K. listed currency printer has suffered a series of setbacks", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GA242_Britis_ZG_20171214143353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
