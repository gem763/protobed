But if passed, the law's biggest impact could on industries with a lot less buzz than Silicon Valley startups.\n\nTrucking companies, newspaper publishers and cleaning operations could be among those widely impacted by Assembly Bill 5, sometimes referred to as the \"Uber law\"\u2014 although Uber maintains the bill doesn't apply to its drivers. While about 400,000 Californians work for gig platforms like Uber and Doordash, an army of 1.5 million freelance workers in the state could also be covered by the new law.\n\nAs the bill awaits signing by California Governor Gavin Newsom, Uber, Lyft and Doordash have pledged $90 million toward a statewide ballot initiative that would permanently exempt their industries from the law. At the same time, a whole swath of companies in industries such as construction and health services that have come to rely on independent contractors are also likely to feel the bill's bite, experts say.\n\n\"There aren't that many Uber and Lyft workers \u2014 it's just that those companies are the ones making a big push about it,\" said Cathy Ruckelshaus, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project.\n\nIn the \"gig economy,\" more injuries for construction workers and truck drivers\n\nMany traditional businesses across the U.S. have shifted to independent contractors as a way to reduce labor costs. But labor experts say they often misclassify workers as a way to avoid offering costly benefits like health care, paid vacation and sick time, and retirement plans.\n\n\"A lot of these don't pass the laugh test,\" Ruckelshaus said. \"A janitor who gets hired by a contractor to go clean an Applebee's or a movie theater, they're not 'running their own business.' They're not really setting their own hours or setting their own pay rate.\"\n\nWhat is a freelancer?\n\nThis question of control over a worker is central to defining a freelancer. But defining what constitutes a freelancer is no easy task in an economy that's blurring the definition of what it means to be employed, with workers increasingly taking on non-traditional jobs through apps and seasonal work.\n\nAs defined in Assembly Bill 5 \u2014 and as most people might understand it \u2014 an independent contractor is a person who runs an independent business; who is hired by a company to do something outside of that company's usual course of business; and who has full say over how, where and when they complete that job.\n\nThe bill, also called AB5, exempts dozens of occupations, including doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants, private investigators, commercial fishermen, manicurists and estheticians. But that still leaves many industries that have come to rely on contract labor.\n\nOne of these is trucking, which has already paid out millions in settlements to drivers claiming they were improperly classified as freelancers. With the passage of AB5, trucking firms in California that rely on more than 70,000 freelance drivers are concerned they won't be able to afford the extra costs and will lose business, according to Reuters.\n\nSame work, lower costs\n\nUnlike employees, contractors can't apply for unemployment insurance when they lose a gig. They also aren't required to be paid minimum wage or overtime and aren't allowed to form a union, as employees are. And because companies don't pay payroll taxes or benefits for contractors, employers that rely on contractors can shave as much as 20% of their costs, as noted by a 2016 UCLA paper.\n\n\"There are certainly strong incentives for a lot of employers to try to do that to save money,\" said Brad Hershbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. \"It allows the employer in some cases to lower their labor costs \u2014 they can get the same amount of work without paying the benefits.\"\n\nEmployee or contractor: What's the difference?\n\nIt's hard to estimate how many freelancers might, under other circumstances, be called employees. Hershbein's own research finds that between 1.5% and 3% of the U.S. workforce, or 2.4 million to 5 million people, have done work for an online platform in any given week.\n\nBut over the course of a year, that figure is much larger. In 2017, the Census reported that some 25 million businesses without employees earned more than $1,000.\n\nFreelance writers and drivers\n\nAlso known as sole proprietors, independent contractors are spread throughout the American economy. The sector adding them the fastest is transportation and warehousing, with more than 2.7 million independent businesses moving people or shipping goods in 2017, according to Census data.\n\nThere were also 2.8 million contractors in personal services (barbers, beauticians, nail technicians and hairdressers); 2.1 million in administrative and support services (a category that includes call centers, hiring agencies and debt-collection agencies); 1.7 million specialty trade contractors; and 1.3 million athletes and performing artists.\n\n\"The fact is, a lot of companies use freelancers, independent contractors, to provide ancillary services,\" said Kathy Kristof, editor of SideHusl, an independent review website of ways to make money freelancing (and a former contributing writer for CBS MoneyWatch). \"Newspaper companies use independent contractors to deliver the paper. All sorts of media companies hire freelancers to write stories that their staff is not doing, and particularly as media companies scale back on staff, they rely more and more on freelancers.\"\n\nNewspaper publishers have roundly condemned the new law and the \"considerable cost\" it could add to what they say are already razor-thin margins. But being classified as an employee could hurt some freelancers, particularly in the realm of intellectual property, Kristof said.\n\n\"If you're an employee, even a part-time employee, everything you produce on the employers' dime belongs to the employer. But if you're producing something for the employer that is related to something that you produce for yourself, that puts your rights to your intellectual property at risk,\" she said.\n\nWho's in charge?\n\nOwnership of property \u2014intellectual and otherwise \u2014 will be a key factor in the myriad lawsuits that are almost certain to be filed once Governor Newsom signs the bill, as he has indicated he would.\n\nHere Uber and Lyft offer an instructive case. The companies don't own their drivers' cars, nor any of the supplies and insurance services drivers need to do their work (although at least one of them is claiming ownership over its driver list.) That, for some drivers, is a burden.\n\n\"You see a growing trend of Uber and Lyft pushing as many expenses as possible on the driver,\" said Edan Alva, a driver for Lyft and Zum who lives in the Bay Area. \"Anything from gas to accident insurance, anything having to do with the expenses of the work, is driver-paid. It's a massive abuse of labor,\" he said.\n\nUber CEO on impact of California high court ruling on gig economy\n\nDrivers didn't complain much about paying for gas and insurance in the past, when ride-hail companies had high rates and plenty of incentives to entice drivers to use their platforms, Alva noted. But since then, patience with the platforms has worn thin. For Alva, who is active with the group Gig Workers Rising, AB5 is just a first step.\n\n\"We're going to keep fighting for as long as we have to until we get the rights Uber and Lyft are obligated to give us, and until we can unionize,\" he said.\n\nJudging by the level of funding that gig companies have devoted to getting around the bill, and statements that Governor Newsom is open to \"refinements,\" there's a great deal of fighting yet to come.\n\nSaid Hershbein: \"I don't think the state of California is going to allow all the tech platforms to go belly-up. When the legislators realize and their staffers realize that they're not going to get an Uber ride that is less than $50, there will be some compromises.\"", "description": "Proposed law could change the working lives of truckers, house cleaners, janitors and even freelance writers", "authors": ["Irina Ivanova"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/d8eb785f-2bda-4b9f-a349-6d13d5e3acdb/thumbnail/1200x630/fc165e3ef93237738dfff0ad4eaa3fe3/cleaner-gettyimages-517241744.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
