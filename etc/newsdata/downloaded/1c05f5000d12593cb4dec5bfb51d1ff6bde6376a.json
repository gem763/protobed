I think that's something we have to look at ourselves. I won't say it here because it's more internal.\n\n'It's not my thing, I'd like to speak to the players who were on the pitch first.'\n\nDespite his goalkeeper's thoughts, and the way his side played in the final period of the game in Prague, Valverde believes there is nothing to worry about and wants any issues to remain behind the scenes.\n\n'When matches end, everyone leaves with an opinion of what happened on the field,' he said on Monday.\n\nMarc-Andre ter Stegen was unimpressed with their Champions League performance in Prague\n\n'Matches can be seen in many ways, and if we have to solve something, we will solve it with within the club and not publicly.\n\n'When the game ends, people's impression is of the final minutes and they don't think about the overall game.\n\n'In the first half of the Slavia game we had two or three chances on goal, they attacked and we did as well. In the second half, they got an early goal and we managed to get the result we wanted in the end.\n\n'They pressed us and that's it. If it had been a 4-1 win, we would be talking like we had the same result as in Eibar [a 3-0 victory]. This is football and it is normal.'", "description": "The German goalkeeper was publicly critical of Barcelona's display in their narrow Champions League win over Slavia Prague, insisting the players 'need to talk about some things'.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20324088-0-image-a-6_1572351905507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
