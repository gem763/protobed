Reuters reported (link)that the talks, which will end Friday, will focus mainly on agricultural issues, with sessions also scheduled for intellectual property and forced transfer of technology.\n\nBut White House adviser Michael Pillsbury, in an interview with the South China Morning Post (link), warned that if a trade deal is not reached soon, the U.S. could escalate its tariffs on Chinese goods to 50% or even 100%.\n\nMeanwhile, the People's Bank of China cut its one-year loan prime rate from 4.25% to 4.20%, as expected. That came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates for the second time this summer, and the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy unchanged, though it hinted at further easing later in the year.\n\nJapan's Nikkei rose 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite inched up 0.1% while the Shenzhen Composite gained 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi ticked up 0.2%, while benchmark indexes in Taiwan , Singapore and Indonesia were little changed. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, e-commerce company Rakuten (4755.TO) gained in Tokyo trading, along with SoftBank (9984.TO) and Casio (6952.TO) .
