About 3 million refugees have been resettled since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980. The Trump administration is determined to make entry more difficult for all migrants.\n\nIn a statement, Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said: \u201cVulnerable refugees need protection, regardless of their nationality or religion. Restricting their access to safety in the US will undoubtedly cost many lives.\u201d", "description": "Administration officials reportedly aim to slash admissions but candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke says: \u2018We need more refugees, not fewer\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0b8d0d7a93eabc8e96d6e879624152a4cd9eaa/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e73835f1a060dccb9e23aa5e8f5ceee9", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
