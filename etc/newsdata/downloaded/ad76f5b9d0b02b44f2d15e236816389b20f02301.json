Guy Lapointe at a Montreal news conference Wednesday.\n\nAs part of \"Operation Pr\u00e9m\u00e9diter,\" police conducted a series of raids in the greater Montreal region, including in Saint-Jude, east of Montreal, in Terrebonne, north of Laval, and on the island of Montreal itself.\n\nThey arrested Dominico Scarfo, Guy Dion, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Viau and Jonathan Massari. Dion is the fire chief of Saint-Jude, a village of 1,200, SQ sources confirmed to Radio-Canada.\n\nPolice also seized 19 long guns, six handguns, three automatic weapons, nearly 200 boxes of ammunition and two silencers, as well as materials to create explosives.\n\n'Old conflict' as a backdrop\n\nThe three men and one women arrested in the raids are believed to have conspired to kill Lorenzo Giordano, Rocco Sollecito, who were both found dead in Laval in 2016, and brothers Giuseppe and Vincenzo Falduto, who were reported missing in Montreal the same year.\n\nThe primary motive behind the 2016 murders was the acquisition of power, Lapointe said.\n\nHe said the killings occurred against a backdrop of \"the old conflict that persists between Sicilians and Calabrians involved in traditional Italian organized crime.\"\n\nLapointe alleges Massari led the conspiracy, along with a man named Salvatore Scoppa, who was himself killed in May.\n\nA chart provided by investigators shows the suspects they have arrested and the deaths they are believed to have caused. (Submitted by S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec)\n\n\"The murder of Salvatore Scoppa earlier this year is basically payback from the Sicilians, as revenge for these murders that were committed in 2016,\" Lapointe told CBC after the news conference at the SQ headquarters.\n\nLapointe explained that the \"Sicilians\" are part of the Rizzuto clan.\n\nExperts say the death by natural causes of the Montreal Mafia's last known godfather, Vito Rizzuto, in 2013 created a power vacuum in Montreal, paving the way for rival clans to battle each other in the fight to come out on top.\n\nS\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec Chief Insp. Guy Lapointe detailed the raids at a news conference Wednesday. (Radio-Canada)\n\nBut Lapointe said police hope these latest arrests \u2014 and future pending arrests \u2014 signal that investigators will continue to put pressure on the clans' criminal activities.\n\n\"We're making a very loud statement to organized crime that it doesn't matter what they do, eventually we'll catch them,\" he said.", "description": "Quebec provincial police have arrested three men and a woman in connection with the deaths of four known organized crime members, in a series of raids Wednesday targetting the province's criminal underworld.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322865.1571251723!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/saint-jude-raids.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
