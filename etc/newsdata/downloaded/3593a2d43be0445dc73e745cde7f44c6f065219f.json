But His Creator Has Settled Down.", "language": "en", "text": "Child drinks a meager half cup of coffee, claiming to have had a whole pot at home. He insists on paying the check, either out of gallantry or for tax reasons. Then we climb into his distinctly un-Reacher-like electric blue S.U.V. and begin a drive straight out of his novel. He lives 40 or 50 miles from town. The intersection closest to his roost is a 10-minute drive away. That\u2019s also where the paved road ends.\n\nImage The Jack Reacher in \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is older than previous incarnations. He gets into a vicious gang war between Ukrainians and Albanians. \u201cI wanted him completely out of his comfort zone,\u201d Child says.\n\nThe sky is as big as skies get. The high prairie is golden. Miles of dirt road lead upward to an immaculate, rustic house with decks on three sides. Unobstructed views stretch 20 miles into the distance. Child\u2019s place is on 35 acres, protected by thousands of acres of forest, lakes and ranch land. It all cost less than he got for the 900-square-foot apartment on 22nd Street where he used to live. If you want to relocate to the middle of nowhere, this is how it\u2019s done.\n\nChild, an Englishman, has gone native. He\u2019s dressed in boots, jeans, T-shirt and a leather barn coat. He owns two cowboy hats, but didn\u2019t wear one for this interview \u201cfor fear of making you laugh.\u201d He already lived here when he wrote \u201cThe Midnight Line,\u201d and acknowledges that describing a familiar setting was more satisfying than making one up. Though Wyoming\u2019s renown as a tax haven was a factor in his move, he says, the decision had \u201cmore to do with an immigrant\u2019s sense that there\u2019s always somewhere else to explore.\u201d (Child and his wife have numerous homes, including one above St. Tropez and a spread in East Sussex, England, that he bought for bragging rights after growing up poor. He still spends time at an apartment he owns on Central Park West, but Jane has decided she\u2019s through with New York.)\n\nThe Laramie area also happens to abut Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal. Child made waves when he talked about being a regular user; his habit goes back 50 years. He finds it especially handy for reading his work, claiming the high helps him judge his writing. And he likes doing actors\u2019 voices: Tony Curtis, a pretty good Michael Caine.\n\nAs we approach the house for lunch, Child proudly points out a few landmarks. The address number is printed in a clean font and hangs from a sturdy post. He did that himself. The generator on the hillside got them through all of last winter. To the right of the driveway sits what Child calls his rockery. Since his hands, unlike Reacher\u2019s, aren\u2019t the size of small animals, he\u2019s dexterous enough to treat this tiny garden lovingly. So does Jane, who has arranged some low, heathery sprigs in a small vase for lunchtime.", "description": "With a TV project in the works and his 24th Reacher novel in stores this month, Lee Child has put down roots out West.", "authors": ["Janet Maslin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/books/00LeeChild1-promo/00LeeChild1-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
