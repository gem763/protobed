During the 35-minute speech, Zuckerberg pointed to the spread of social movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter as examples of free speech being used for good.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nMark Zuckerberg just slammed China for allegedly censoring Hong Kong protest videos on TikTok: \u2018Is that the internet we want?\u2019\n\n\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged that many of the Russian agents who meddled with the 2016 presidential election used fake identities to pose as Americans and spread \u201cdistasteful\u201d content. But he said rather than restricting what can be said on Facebook, it\u2019s more important for the company to focus on preventing fake accounts from making an impact.\n\n\u201cFocusing on authenticity and verifying accounts is a much better solution than an ever-expanding definition of what speech is harmful,\u201d Zuckerberg said. He said that Facebook identifies 99% of terrorist content before it appears in anyone\u2019s feed, and the company removes billions of fake accounts every year, often within a few minutes of them signing up for the site.\n\nWhile discussing the steps Facebook has taken to defend freedom of expression, Zuckerberg also identified the three largest threats he sees to free speech on the internet, and around the world. He mentioned the increase and spread of laws that restrict free speech online, admitted that Facebook and other social media platforms run the risk of restricting their users\u2019 speech, and said that people are trying to redefine what types of speech are dangerous.\n\nZuckerberg is concerned that regulations in places like China that restrict free speech could spread to other parts of the world.\n\nWang Ye/Xinhua News Agency via AP\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression and people\u2019s human rights,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThese local laws are each individually troubling, especially when they shut down speech in places where there isn\u2019t democracy or freedom of the press. But it\u2019s even worse when countries try to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nMuch of Zuckerberg\u2019s comments on laws limiting free speech were focused on China\u2019s strict media regulations. The country has been the subject of international controversy for restricting certain types of posts on social media and launching counter-campaigns against pro-Hong Kong activists on social media. The NBA also saw many of its Chinese business relationships jeopardized by a lone pro-Hong Kong tweet from an American employee.\n\n\u201cChina is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201d Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There\u2019s no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also talked about Facebook\u2019s former VP for Latin American, Diego Dzodan, being arrested in Brazil for withholding encrypted WhatsApp data from law enforcement. Dzodan told authorities that the company couldn\u2019t produce the encrypted information, and was jailed for 24 hours before a judge ordered his release.\n\nZuckerberg said that social media platforms pose a threat to freedom of expression due to the amount of control they have over their users.\n\nFacebook\n\nZuckerberg also said that social media platform holders are responsible for many of the decisions that control people\u2019s speech online. Facebook and Twitter have been accused of having a leftist bias by President Donald Trump and both platforms are regularly criticised for their moderation policies.\n\n\u201cI understand people are concerned about bias and making sure their ideas are treated fairly,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either. We\u2019d benefit from a more democratic process, clearer rules for the internet, and new institutions.\u201d\n\nLast month Facebook announced that it would establish an oversight board to make content policy decisions. The board will have up to 40 members and is funded by a independent trust.\n\n\u201cBuilding this institution is important to me personally because I\u2019m not always going to be here, and I want to ensure the values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nHe added that while Facebook wont allow speech or expression that promote violence, the company will err on the side of allowing expression rather than restricting it. That includes protecting posts and ads that may contain misinformation, so long as they don\u2019t lead to harm.\n\nFinally, Zuckerberg believes that people attempting to redefine certain types of expression as dangerous could be harmful to the democratic process.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty\n\nZuckerberg said the world is in a state of tension caused by globalization and the spread of technology, comparing the current moment to World War I and the American Civil Rights moment.\n\nHowever, he said the tension has also led to distrust, and people are trying to restrict one another\u2019s voices to protect their own political interests.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, we\u2019re seeing people try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they see as unacceptable,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cSome hold the view that since the stakes are so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said that this type of censorship could do more long term damage to the country\u2019s democratic process than the speech it intends to silence.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
