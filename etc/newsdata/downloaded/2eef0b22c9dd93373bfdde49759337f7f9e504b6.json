REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\n\nImporting the vehicles into Rwanda, which sells itself to foreign investors on its reliable infrastructure, stability and relative ease of doing business, and where VW already assembles cars, is initially intended to test infrastructure and performance in the region\u2019s climate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been investing more than $30 billion (\u00a323.4 billion) into new electric vehicles and platforms and the entire world is moving in that direction,\u201d VW\u2019s Africa boss Thomas Schaefer told Reuters. \u201cThe plan for Africa is that ultimately, we replace the whole fleet into electric.\u201d\n\nVW, which has a global target of producing 600,000 electric cars a year by 2022, is starting small in Kigali, importing 50 eGolf models in the first few months. The vehicles - combustion-engine cars modified to run on electricity - will be integrated into the company\u2019s app-driven \u201cMove\u201d service, launched last December.\n\nGerman power equipment firm Siemens (SIEGn.DE) will build 15 charging stations in Kigali.\n\nThe stations can charge up to 80 percent of a car\u2019s battery within an hour, although it takes around 11 hours to charge a car at home, said Andile Dlamini, the group\u2019s communications officer. The eGolf\u2019s range, fully charged, is up to 230 kilometers. VW\u2019s new ID3 models to be launched next year will have a range of 600 km.\n\nRwanda has an installed power generation capacity of 286 MW the cars would mainly charge at night, when there is an excess of power. Unlike many African nations, Rwandan electricity is relatively reliable.\n\nRwanda\u2019s prime minister Edouard Ngirente said he hoped electric car use could expand, noting fuel products were Rwanda\u2019s biggest import last year.\n\nSchaefer acknowledged the high price of electric cars would not appeal to most African consumers, but said scaling up production and favourable government policy could help bring prices down.\n\n\u201cThe Rwandan government is working on electric vehicle policy and if that policy favours electric cars over traditional, then that development can happen very fast,\u201d Schaefer said.", "description": "Volkswagen is importing a batch of electric powered Golf models into Rwanda for a local ride-hailing service, establishing a bridgehead in the country that it hopes to expand to other nations as it seeks to increase market share globally.", "authors": ["Clement Uwiringiyimana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446214274&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1A1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
