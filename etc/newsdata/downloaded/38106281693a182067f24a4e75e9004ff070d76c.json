She basically ate or destroyed everything except these paintbrushes ... she loved them so much,\u201d Lefson added.\n\nSoon the pig was dipping the brushes into pots of paint and making her mark. Her paintings can sell for almost $4,000, with the proceeds going to animal welfare. She has even had one of her artworks turned into a watch face for Swiss watchmaker Swatch.\n\nSwatch announced a collaboration with the pig last month.\n\nThe limited edition \u201cFlying Pig by Ms. Pigcasso\u201d features green, blue and pink brush strokes and sells for $120.\n\n\u201cPigcasso is definitely an abstract expressionist, you can\u2019t exactly define what she\u2019s painting but I can tell you that her style slightly changes depending on her mood like any great artist,\u201d said Lefson.", "description": "Step aside Francis Bacon.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190312&t=2&i=1365457459&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF2B121", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
