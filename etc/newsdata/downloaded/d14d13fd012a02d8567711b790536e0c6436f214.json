Super cycle * them", "language": "en", "text": "Are you planning on a jumble sale or something then, Mum?\u2019 demands my son, Jimmy, standing at my bedroom door surveying the terrible mess.\n\nPiles of colourful clothes litter the floor. Coats and dresses are heaped on the bed, jackets and trousers dot the carpet, scarves and skirts hang over the back of chairs.\n\nA jumble sale hadn\u2019t been part of the plan, but I am feeling desperate \u2014 despite a cupboard full of clothes, I still can\u2019t find anything I want to wear.\n\nA year ago, I might have fixed that by heading to the High Street to throw money at the problem. This winter, however, the thought of filling my cupboards with yet more clothes, which will have become sale tat within a year, is a great deal less appealing.\n\nThe environmental cost of fast fashion has taken some of the joy out of shopping, and it\u2019s not as if any of the clothes have worn out: I cannot remember the last time I truly wore any item of clothes \u2018out\u2019 until it became unwearable.\n\nClover Stroud, 44, (pictured after) was able to transform her wedding dress with a visit to fashion \u2018upcycling\u2019 company Converted Closet\n\nAnd it\u2019s not that the clothes are unappealing. I cannot pretend I have the budget or lifestyle for high fashion, so the black blazers, flippy floral dresses and tailored trousers that make up much of my wardrobe are the kind of things that can be worn season after season.\n\nIt\u2019s more that they look rather tired, and, depressingly, a little tight. I\u2019m 44, and in the past three years, none of my clothes has got any looser. The pile of favourite dresses I\u2019ve pushed to the back of my cupboard to wear \u2018when I lose half a stone\u2019, is increasing fast.\n\nI\u2019m especially dismayed to find the dress I wore for my second wedding no longer fits, though perhaps it isn\u2019t surprising as I\u2019ve had three more children since then.\n\nOriginally falling mid-thigh with a plunging neckline, and made from a Versace print of coloured butterflies and flowers on a black silk, it\u2019s a million miles from conventional white wedding attire.\n\nWhen I got married in it, though, I felt fabulous. I\u2019d been hoping I could wear it for Christmas parties this year, until I discover it no longer fastens, the sleeves barely fitting over my upper arms.\n\nFortunately, help is at hand in the form of fashion \u2018upcycling\u2019 company Converted Closet. Started by ex-City headhunter Kate McGuire in 2016, it shows you how to transform favourite pieces into totally new garments with a bit of clever stitch work.\n\nKate seems an unlikely face of sustainable fashion, which is only just beginning to shrug off its slightly scratchy image of hemp dresses in sludgy colours.\n\nWhen I get to her house in West London so she can get a sense of what she can do with my dress, she\u2019s immaculately made-up, wearing a superbly cut black coat dress.\n\nClover (pictured on her wedding day) says the environmental cost of fast fashion has taken the joy out of shopping, she told how upcycling can give old garments a new look\n\n\u2018Converted Victoria Beckham,\u2019 Kate says, explaining how she found the dress in a high-end second-hand shop, and, undeterred that it was the wrong size, with a neckline that didn\u2019t suit, had it refitted by a local seamstress.\n\n\u2018I prefer to call this super-cycling, rather than upcycling, as once you get your head around it, the possibilities of what you can do with almost any garment are endless.\u2019\n\nHer route into upcycling, or conversion, started in adolescence, after issues with her weight, which saw her yo-yoing between size 8 and size 16.\n\n\u2018The High Street in its present incarnation, with racks of cheap, throwaway fashion, didn\u2019t exist in Winchester in the Eighties,\u2019 says Kate. \u2018Even if it had, it wouldn\u2019t have suited me, as I had the impulse to alter anything. I got good at buying clothes from charity shops or vintage stores, and altering them.\u2019\n\nHer A-level in fashion and textiles meant that by the time she left home, Kate could create and design an entire outfit from scratch. \u2018Changing clothes I\u2019d bought cheaply became second nature, and I started to appreciate the creative joy in giving an item a new lease of life,\u2019 she says.\n\nThe hobby eventually became a business. After leaving her job as a headhunter in 2012, and following a three-year career break to care for her son, Gus, now seven, and grown-up twin stepdaughters, Kate set up Converted Closet, upcycling pieces for clients and inspiring other women to do the same with their own wardrobes.\n\nKate McGuire (pictured) set up Converted Closet after leaving her job as a headhunter and having a career break to care for her children\n\nSoon word got around and she started advising clients wanting to revive a pair of plain trousers \u2014 perhaps by adding piping down the legs or a flash of colour in the pockets \u2014 to the altering of a vintage men\u2019s tweed suit, to a far more ambitious complete redesign of a couture gown.\n\nFor as little as \u00a330, a pair of unloved trousers can be turned into an original piece, and for upwards of \u00a3150 a designer dress can be entirely reconstructed or turned into a skirt and top.\n\nConverted Closet now has more than 10,000 Instagram followers and the business is expanding, with a video series in the pipeline, as well as investment in place to develop an app.\n\nKate reached a turning point in 2015, after watching Livia Firth\u2019s documentary The True Cost, about the environmental impact of fast fashion, featuring Stella McCartney and environmentalist Vandana Shiva.\n\n\u2018It made me sob my heart out, but also made me realise we as consumers need to take 50 per cent of the responsibility for the waste and environmental cost of the fashion industry.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d been doing upcycling for fun for so long, and saw that it could help people get a fashion fix in a way that was kinder to the planet,\u2019 she says, reminding me that most women wear just 20 per cent of the clothes in their wardrobe. Just think what could be done with the remaining 80 per cent, rather than send it to landfill,\u2019 she says, as I guiltily remember the piles of unworn clothes on my bedroom floor.\n\nKate believes the upcycling concept needs rebranding.\n\nA striking transformation: Cut in half, this vintage kaftan becomes a long, flamboyant top or even a short dress (pictured left: before, right: after)\n\n\u2018Fashion is about more than just looking good. Simply telling people to buy less and wear more is uninspiring, so super-cycling is a way round that.\u2019\n\nSupercycling, she explains, is a movement, not a brand, since customising clothes is something people have always done. But she hopes that by championing the movement, she might create a new way of thinking about clothes.\n\n\u2018Rather than shopping for new clothes that will then end up in landfill, converting something you already own, or buying something second hand and working on it, can give you that satisfying feeling of wearing something new, but with less environmental impact.\u2019\n\nAll this sounds fun if you\u2019re an art student with loads of time and energy, but how does supercyling work for me \u2014 with limited cash and absolutely no time to start tinkering around with a needle and thread?\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t need to be able to sew. All you need are the ideas about how to change a garment:cropping the arms off a jacket to make a gilet, adding ribbon trimming to trousers to update them or embroidering your initials on to almost anything.\n\n\u2018The work can be done by your dry cleaners. And there are local seamstresses all over the UK.\u2019\n\nRecalling the despair I felt trying on my old wedding dress, I\u2019m interested to see whether she can work her magic on it.\n\nA cut above: Chopping this long prairie dress to midlength and tailoring the top to fit has modernised it (pictured left: before, right: after)\n\nI\u2019d also taken an uninspiring navy blue tailored jacket I\u2019d bought from Jigsaw a few seasons ago. Kate casts her eye over the dress, focusing on a thick sash at the back of it, showing me how it can be chopped off, then used to create invisible panels inside the arms and on the waist so it fits properly again. Originally falling to shorter than mid-thigh, it now looks too short, so Kate suggests adding bands of coloured ribbon to lengthen it.\n\nThough Kate sometimes tinkers with her own clothes, when she has items properly altered, she takes them to a seamstress.\n\n\u2018Ask them how long they\u2019ve been working, and perhaps see a few examples of their work, but essentially go on your instinct. You can always get them to work on something small to start with, before moving on to more ambitious reconstructions.\u2019\n\nTo PROVE how easy this is, Kate takes my dress to a seamstress. I visit Kate again, so she can check the fitting of the dress, then I return, nervously, to find out how her vision will translate to real life.\n\nSlipping back into my wedding dress is emotional. The short dress I wore seven years ago in my 30s, and feared I\u2019d never wear again, fits me perfectly.\n\nI can barely see the panels of extra fabric which have been added down the side and on the inside arm to make the dress slightly larger, and the length has been trimmed with thick satin ribbon in navy blue and orange matching the original colours of the dress.\n\nIt\u2019s made the dress slightly longer, but also the thickness of the ribbon has given the skirt a better shape.\n\nAnd the scraps of remaining fabric have been used to add a bolt of colour to the cuffs and collar of my navy blue jacket.\n\nThe jacket cost \u00a360 to update, and reconstructing the dress and adding a hem was \u00a370. \u2018It\u2019s affordable, especially compared to what a completely new item would cost,\u2019 says Kate.\n\nKate\u2019s magic touch means these clothes have a new lease of life, creating original items that no one else is wearing.\n\nWhile I like what Kate has done, there\u2019s something else: the feelgood factor of knowing that a dress which might have been shoved to the back of my wardrobe \u2014 or worse, consigned to landfill \u2014 has survived for another party season.\n\nconvertedcloset.com", "description": "Clover Stroud, 44, took the dress that she wore for her second wedding to Converted Closet.
