I hope I can help the team for as long as I can.\u201d\n\nBoss Mauricio Pochettino left Vertonghen out of the side for the first three games of the season, though insisted that had nothing to do with the contract situation.\n\nVertonghen has always been one of Pochettino\u2019s main men during the last six years and that has not changed.\n\n\u201cI am open to everything, but that is a dealing between the club, him and his agent,\u201d Pochettino said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens. Jan after five years that we are all together, is always an important part of my project.\n\n\u201cThat feeling isn\u2019t going to change.\u201d\n\nVertonghen\u2019s ability to perform at the highest level will be tested when Bayern visit.\n\nBut head coach Niko Kovac believes Tottenham\u2019s development under Pochettino has made them a \u201cpositive light\u201d of European football.\n\n\u201cIt is a very, very positive development,\u201d the Croatian said. \u201cIn 2016 I was here and they were in the old stadium, I was here to watch Tottenham against Swansea, the flair was different, the stadium was smaller, but the atmosphere was strong.\n\n\u201cYou can see what it means when you have a good coach, a good manager.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion Tottenham have a very positive light in European football, they are now able to compete with the very big teams, even if it didn\u2019t look that way seven or eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThey have continuity, he was given time and he has done a great job and that is an example for others.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely going to be a game with level footing, when you look at the players from both teams they are all world class from different countries.\u201d\n\nPA Sport contributed to this report", "description": "Jan Vertonghen insists he still has several years left at the top as contract talks with\u00a0Tottenham rumble on.
