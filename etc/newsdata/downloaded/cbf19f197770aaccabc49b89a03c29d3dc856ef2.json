And even in the regular season, the Nationals\u2019 offense never froze this solid: The fewest runs they scored during any three-game stretch was four, from May 5 to May 7, when their season seemed doomed to end long before late October.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf their offense does not reemerge in Game 6 \u2014 in which the Nationals will face one of the most decorated pitchers of his generation in Justin Verlander \u2014 the Nationals\u2019 improbable postseason charge will end.\n\n\u201cWe hit some balls hard \u2014 we really did,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t get nothing going these last three days.\u201d\n\nWhen a whole lineup struggles, the turnaround often comes suddenly, spurred by one of those bloopers that falls or the line drive that finally sneaks through. The difference, in those cases, is not necessarily in control of the hitters themselves. Trea Turner, for example, hit multiple line drives right at people Sunday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome things you can\u2019t control,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI thought we hit the ball pretty well tonight for scoring one run. Just right at people. Bad aim.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals felt much of their trouble Sunday night was caused by home plate umpire Lance Barksdale, whose strike zone Nationals hitters, catchers and pitchers took issue with all evening. With a man on first and two out in the seventh, Barksdale called Victor Robles out on strikes on a pitch that was shown to be off the plate by online pitch trackers. But Barksdale was not calling pitches Friday or Saturday. He might have slowed one rally. He did not slow their offense.\n\n\u201cLance [Barksdale] isn\u2019t the reason we lost,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. \u201cGerrit Cole beat us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCole isn\u2019t the only one who beat them. Turner went 1 for 14 in Games 3, 4, and 5. Adam Eaton went 2 for 11. Anthony Rendon was 3 for 12 in those three games but did not drive in a run. Until his home run to center in the seventh, Juan Soto was 1 for 9 with one RBI, which came on a weak groundball to first in a rally in Game 4. Zimmerman, who burst onto the World Series stage so memorably with his Game 1 homer, went 1 for 9 and left six men on base in Washington. The Nationals\u2019 seventh and eighth hitters combined to go 5 for 21 in these three games.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[That\u2019s] part of baseball,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cWe went through different series like that where we\u2019ve been hitting balls hard and just nothing to show for it. We have to continue to try to have competitive at-bats, good at-bats.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nationals did have chances this weekend, they did not have good at-bats. In the second inning, for example, Soto and Howie Kendrick led off with back-to-back singles \u2014 no small feat against Cole. Zimmerman struck out. Robles hit a weak groundball that turned into a double play.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals made 32 plate appearances Sunday. Their hitters fell behind in the count 0-2 in 12 of them.\n\nCole has a long history of dismantling rallies and lineups with that kind of precision, but the Nationals have not been facing Cole all weekend. Zack Greinke had pitched inconsistently in these playoffs until he slowed the Nationals on Friday. Jose Urquidy was a relative unknown who stymied them Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the trip back to Houston will revive the Nationals\u2019 offense. Perhaps the dam will break on its own. Another of those universal baseball laws states that when hitters try to change too much, too fast, they rarely make things better. Besides, the Nationals are not working out in Houston on Monday evening. The next time they hit on a field will be for batting practice before Game 6.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in do what got you here,\u201d Turner said. \u201c . . . For me, don\u2019t panic. If you panic, you\u2019re only going to make it worse. We feel good about going into Game 6. Now it\u2019s do or die.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "If Washington\u2019s offense does not reemerge in Game 6, the Nationals\u2019 improbable postseason charge will end.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/by5BG-BAg7PdgnHk996dCoFxBSI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I65EY7HZGII6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
