Both rose to the runoff on the disenchantment of Tunisians, particularly young people and the poor, who feel the governing class hasn\u2019t fulfilled the promises of the 2011 \u201cjasmine revolution\u201d that unleashed revolts around the Arab world.\n\n\u201cI just hope that everything that will happen in the next five years will be better for Tunisia,\u201d said voter Elfi Zaouarda, casting a ballot in Tunis.\n\nSaied is seen as the slight favorite, thanks to an enthusiastic youth campaign machine that cheers him on Twitter and backing from the No. 1 and No. 3 parties in the new parliament: the moderate Islamist party Ennahdha and the Al Karama Coalition, led by a radical Islamist lawyer.\n\nMore than 100,000 police, soldiers and security forces are guarding the 15,000 polling stations, notably on the borders with Libya and Algeria, and thousands of local and foreign observers are monitoring the vote.\n\nPolling agencies are expected to release projections after voting stations close, and official results are expected Monday or Tuesday.\n\nA well-heeled entrepreneur who just started his political party this year, Karoui campaigned on promises to fight poverty. Detractors dubbed him \u201cNabil Macaroni\u201d because his party distributes the noodles to the poor.\n\nHe embraced it: \u201cNabil Macaroni, and proud to be,\u201d Radio Mosaique quoted him as saying Friday.\n\nDuring an unprecedented TV debate, Karoui promised to combat extremist violence by \u201cattacking at its roots\u201d and raising economic prospects in struggling provinces that are fertile recruiting grounds for the Islamic State group and other extremists.\n\nA self-proclaimed modernist, he said he would seek partnerships with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Netflix to create jobs, and holds up women as pillars of society.\n\nSaied, a conservative independent, has drawn in support with his Mr. Clean image and by promising to overhaul the \u201cpyramid of power\u201d to give poorer provinces and youth more decision-making power.\n\nHe sits poker-straight, his blank visage hiding any visible sign of emotion, and speaks in a staccato style \u2014 and in literary Arabic, a tongue inaccessible to many in Tunisia\u2019s rural interior. Firmly conservative, he opposes equal inheritance rights for daughters and sons, arguing that the hot-button issue is decided by the Quran, the Muslim holy book.\n\nDespite the backing of Ennahdha, he describes himself as politically neutral.\n\n\u201cI am independent and will remain so until the end of my life,\u201d he said\n\nBoth men want Tunisia to work to bring peace to neighboring Libya.\n\nFor very different reasons, neither Karoui nor Saied has campaigned in a traditional way.\n\nSaied let youthful supporters do much of the campaigning for him, while Karoui gave the job to his wife while he tried to get released from jail.\n\nAfter their televised debate Friday, they cordially shook hands \u2014 a gesture Tunisians celebrated as a sign that their democracy is on the right track.\n\nBut whoever wins the presidency of Tunisia has tough challenges ahead leading this country of 11 million people. In addition to economic and security troubles, Tunisia is both a source of migrants trying to reach Europe and a transit country for migrant trafficking from elsewhere in Africa.\n\nThe new president will also have to work with a fractious parliament, the result of legislative elections on Oct. 6 that gave no party a clear majority.\n\nThis is only Tunisia\u2019s second democratic presidential election, and is being held early following the July death in office of President Beji Caid Essebsi.\n\n___\n\nElaine Ganley in Paris and Nadine Achoui-Lesage in Tunis contributed.", "description": "TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) \u2014 Tunisians are voting for president Sunday in an unusual contest pitting a populist tycoon who just got out of jail against a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/e9d875_tunisia-presidential-election-62373-nabil-karoui-tunisian-mogul-nabil-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
