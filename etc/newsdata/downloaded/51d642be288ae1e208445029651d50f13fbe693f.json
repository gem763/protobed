(Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)\n\nANAHEIM, Ca. \u2014 In his 11th professional summer, Mike Trout hit 45 more home runs, had 137 more hits, scored 110 more runs, turned 28, made $37 million, mourned a friend, endured foot surgery, earned handfuls of MVP votes \u2026 and prepared to go home.\n\nIn some ways, in how he conducted himself and played the game and dragged a franchise behind him, this summer was as nearly all the others. He\u2019ll turn 29 next summer, his 10th as a major leaguer, and so the summer that qualifies him for future Hall of Fame ballots, having participated in three playoff games, in the same time frame having played for at least three general managers, two field managers and one owner.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe nine major league teams of which he\u2019s been a part will have a .510 winning percentage, plus or minus the coming five games. He will have seen four winning teams. The finest player of his generation, give or take a beery argument, carries 12 postseason at-bats into the second half of a career that promises all of the personal momentum and little of the organizational kind.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, two-and-a-half weeks after his season ended, Trout rolled into a media conference on a scooter designed to keep his weight from his right foot. In the time away, he\u2019d seemed to have come to terms with his season ending too soon. These things happen. He shrugged. And it\u2019s not as though his Los Angeles Angels would play for much beyond parking fees and concession sales in the weeks that followed. Still, he said, sitting and healing and watching baseball and clattering around on crutches isn\u2019t really his style.\n\n\u201cIt was bothering me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut looking at it, and seeing what came out of my foot, it was kinda nasty.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe surgery \u2014 for Morton\u2019s neuroma \u2014 removed thickened tissue from his foot, and the best player from the Angels\u2019 lineup. It also potentially tightened the coming American League MVP vote, held likely to separate Trout from Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, or Bregman from Trout. The fourth-year player who has hit 40 home runs and posted a 1.009 OPS, Bregman finished three places behind runner-up Trout in last year\u2019s vote (Mookie Betts won in a landslide). On Wednesday night in Seattle, Bregman played his 152nd game, 18 more than Trout, with still four games -- in Anaheim -- remaining. Bregman has used Trout\u2019s absence to close the gap in WAR and other metrics that seem to weigh heavy on many ballots. And, of course, help the Astros clinch their third consecutive AL West title. In those 14 games, Bregman has batted .268 with a 1.186 OPS, a .455 on-base percentage and six home runs.\n\nMike Trout's season was cut short because of a foot injury, but his numbers still might good enough to earn him another MVP award.

He will be first or second again.\n\n\u201cI come in all the time, every year, to try to be the best player in the league, best player on the field at all times,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd obviously, if you\u2019re finishing in the top three, you\u2019re doing something. Obviously you want to be No. 1. But that\u2019s my mindset coming into every year.\u201d\n\nTrout and Bregman have become friendly enough to belong to the same fantasy football league. If there is a hint to be gained from that, Bregman\u2019s squad beat Trout\u2019s last week.\n\n\u201cBarely,\u201d Trout pointed out.\n\n\u201cYou can ask any of my teammates \u2014 I follow baseball all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like a baseball nerd, I guess. I\u2019m obviously following him. There\u2019s a lot of guys that I follow. Bregman\u2019s a great dude \u2026 I\u2019m happy for him, he\u2019s having an unbelievable season, and it\u2019s always a battle when we go up against him.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is my best year yet. It obviously sucks I\u2019m not playing the last few weeks. But I follow Bregman all the time, and I see what he\u2019s doing, and I\u2019m happy for him, he\u2019s having a great year.\u201d\n\nThat he\u2019d choose 2019 as his best season from among plenty similar to it points, perhaps, to career highs in home runs and slugging, to the usual filling of box scores on most nights, and to what he called, \u201cJust offensively, in the box, it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve felt. Just squaring up baseballs. Just making adjustments quicker and just barreling up a lot of my balls.\u201d\n\nBut, also, to his production and the team\u2019s resilience through the heartache of teammate Tyler Skaggs\u2019 death on July 1. The season continued. Through tears and memories both painful and pleasant, through long hard farewells, the Angels, all of them, reported for work and did what they could to endure what was next. His uniform still hangs among theirs. His picture is on the outfield wall. At its worst, a couple dozen men looked to Trout and their soft-spoken teammate, unused to a vocal leadership role, stepped to the fore.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a tough year for the whole club, the whole team,\u201d he said. \u201cLosing ... Tyler was tough. Obviously all the guys know in there that if they have any questions or think of anything, they can come to me. I talk to everybody. Even the young guys ask me a bunch of questions, and I tell them what I think. When Tyler passed, it was a time for me to step up and take that role. I think in the past, I just kind of went out there and played, and let my game talk for itself. But I think when the team needed me, and the guys who came up and talked, I think that was big for us.\n\n\u201cI think Tyler would want that. And the team needed it. We were going through \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody, but we were going through some tough times, obviously you guys know, and I felt like the team needed it, and I felt like I had to get up there and talk.\u201d\n\nSo closed his summer. His fall. Hopelessly behind in the AL West. On a scooter. Having done his best. Again. He did his best. And then the season ended.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Mike Trout's season was stopped short due to an injury, but can he still win MVP?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z5BHRs5hCb5T_2ocJK6DDA--~B/aD0yNDMwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/00984170-d7ed-11e9-bfeb-8f2f8951d297", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
