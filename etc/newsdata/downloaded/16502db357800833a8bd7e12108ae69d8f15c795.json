I think she did it. Sadly I really do. I think it\u2019s a shame because she probably never thought she was going to get caught out.\"\n\nChantelle Heskey\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe wife of former England striker Emile Heskey said there was no question that Coleen had done the right thing in calling out who she thought was the mole.\n\nChantelle said she only wished she'd had the same 'hard evidence' that Coleen had when a friend pulled a similar stunt on her 20 years ago.\n\n\"It is heartbreaking to think that someone so close to you would sell stories and leak things like that so I totally get where [Coleen's] coming from,\" she told the Victoria Derbyshire show.\n\nSticking up for her pal, Chantelle added: \"There's only so much you can take and and Coleen's a very private person.\"\n\nPhil Neville\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nPhil Neville, head coach of the England women's team, was one of the first stars of the footballing world to pick a side in the drama.\n\nDespite knowing both the Rooneys and the Vardys, Neville was an early recruit of Team Coleen.\n\nThe ex footballer responded to her bombshell reveal with the prayer hands emoji to signify he was thinking of her and Wayne at this testing time.\n\nToni Duggan\n\n(Image: FIFA via Getty)\n\nJoining boss Neville over on Team Rooney is England footballer Toni Duggan.\n\nToni also commented on Coleen's post to say she was appalled at what she's been through.\n\n\"Wow! This is disgusting! Hope your ok @coleen_rooney,\" Toni tweeted.\n\nKiera Knightley\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nShe's starred in numerous some Oscar winning movies in her time, so Kiera Knightley knows a potential blockbuster when she sees one.\n\nThe actress revealed that she too has been following the real life drama that has gripped the nation this week.\n\nAsked about whether she'd consider playing Coleen Rooney in a film version about the events, Kiera didn't have to think twice.\n\n\"Done,\" she replied.\n\nChris Hughes\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nDespite having no ties to either of the parties involved, former Love Island star Chris couldn't help but speak out on the drama.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter : \"This is the best detective work since Columbo aired in February 1968. Feel for Coleen.\"\n\nLizzie Cundy\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nAs friends of both, Lizzie was torn between the two WAGs this week - before ultimately backing Mrs Rooney.\n\nSpeaking outside her front door to Channel 5, Lizzie said 'detective' Coleen should never be underestimated.\n\n\"Coleen has been doing her detective work for a couple of years now. I know these stories about her have been repeatedly coming out in the press.\n\n\"She really wanted to get to the bottom of it and she did. I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that.\" said Cundy.\n\nTeam Vardy\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\nNicola McClean\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWag Nicola was one of the few footballers wives to come out in support of Becky.\n\nNicola said it was totally wrong of Coleen to bring trouble to 'innocent' Becky's door, especially when she was seven months pregnant.\n\nThe former CBB star said her friend Rebekah was so upset over the media frenzy she has had to take her kids out school.\n\nNot only that, Nicola said she's certain Rebekah is completley innoncent.\n\nShe explained: \"Rebekah has categorically denied. I've spoken to her personally. If it's someone from her account she will find out and she will deal with it.\n\n\"What she's shocked about and what I quite agree with is how public Coleen has done it. Coleen has been very clever to say it's Rebekah Vardy's account so that's not saying its Rebekah, it's saying it's someone else with access.\"\n\nPiers Morgan\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the outspoken Good Morning Britain host waded into the row.\n\nPiers said he thought Coleen has been naive to believe anything she posted online would remain a secret, even among the selected following of her private Instagram account.\n\nIn a column for the Mail Online, Piers said: \"Coleen believes everything she posts there is \u2018private\u2019 and only shared with people who she has allowed to follow her, and who she supposedly trusts enough not to repeat anything they see posted.\n\n\"And it\u2019s at this point that I raise a slightly quizzical eyebrow.\"\n\nRebekah and Piers appear to be unlikely allies, no doubt bolstered by the WAGs constant support of the GMB presenter on social media.\n\nAs followers will know, Becky is a regular fan of Piers' Twitter page and has liked many of his opinionated posts over the last few months.\n\nIain Lee\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAfter having survived weeks in the Australian outback with Ms Vardy, Iain Lee arguably knows her better than most in celebland.\n\nThe pair have an awkward history as Rebekah was accused of bullying the radio presenter during their time on I'm A Celebrity.\n\nBut Iain Lee says he still has sympathy for her situation.\n\nComedian Shappi Khorsandi was the first I'm A Celeb star to tweet about the scandal.\n\n\"BaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhARGHGHGHGHGHGH!!!!!! I'm not commenting... I'm keeping a dignified silence but I will tell you, IT'S SO [expletive] HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Shappi wrote.\n\nWhen pressed about what she wanted to say, Shappi replied: \"I prefer not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.\u201d\n\nIain then weighed in: \"[Expletive] thing and all and most of you know I'm not a fan but struggling to pile on to a pregnant woman. Dunno. Am I being silly?\"\n\nJamie Vardy\n\n(Image: LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nNaturally, Becky's loving husband Jamie gave his full support to her when many famous faces whipped their claws out.\n\nHe gave a simple but effective indication on his feeling by 'liking' Becky's defence post on Twitter.\n\nBy contrast, Wayne Rooney has yet to comment.", "description": "Battle lines have been drawn in the War of the WAGs", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Bbc", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Fifa Via Getty", "Getty Images North America", "Instagram", "Internet Unknown", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556280.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Rebekah-Vardy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
