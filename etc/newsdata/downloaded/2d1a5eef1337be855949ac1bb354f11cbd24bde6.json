With auction day fast approaching, tensions reached boiling point between Jesse Raeburn and Scott Cam over a $600 carpentry bill on Monday's episode of The Block\n\nRenovating apartment five at the end of The Oslo complex, Jesse was warned to take extra care due to the 'hip bend' in the ceiling of the corner apartment.\n\nBut he failed to listen and cut all 17 of his ceiling boards at a 45 degree angle, forcing him to rip them down in order to fix his mistake.\n\nThis resulted in a fight between Jesse and Scott, with the longtime host saying the real estate agent should have picked up on the error much earlier.\n\nFeud: During double verandah week, the teams were tasked with installing boards on the walls and ceilings of levels two and three of their properties. But after Jesse made a mistake with measurements, he tried to shift the blame onto the show's carpenters - leaving Scott furious\n\n'Now, have you heard of a word called improvisation? Because that's exactly what you have to do in carpentry,' Scott told Jesse.\n\nBut Jesse explained it was the 'boys' who built the ceiling 100 millimeters out, meaning he shouldn't be held responsible.\n\nHe went on to say that he didn't believe the first two boards were off centre - but Scott disagreed, saying the mistake would have been obvious.\n\nOh, no! Jesse failed to listen to advice and cut all 17 of his ceiling boards at a 45 degree angle, forcing him to rip them down in order to fix his mistake\n\n'Don't lie to me! Your first two boards were five millimeters out. So you go, \"There's something wrong,\"' Scott said furiously.\n\nJesse continued to blame the show's tradies, saying indignantly: 'So we have to check everything your carpenters do?'\n\n'Of course you do!' Scott replied, once again reiterating that the teams must take responsibility for their own renovations.\n\nFuming: After being confronted by Scott over his mistake, Jesse blamed the show's tradies, saying indignantly: 'So we have to check everything your carpenters do?'\n\nThe argument between the two men ended with Scott storming off the building site, after flatly refusing to pay Jesse's carpentry bill.\n\n'I'm not paying nothing! Get the job done and get it done right,' he said.\n\nThe Block continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine", "description": "The Block has featured plenty of heated arguments so far this season.", "authors": ["Caleb Taylor For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/03/19674314-0-image-a-46_1571020134463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
