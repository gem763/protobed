Yes, of course it does put the union at risk, it puts Northern Ireland at risk, it puts Scotland at risk.\u201d Blair wrote in Sunday\u2019s Observer that Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy risked undermining the peace in Northern Ireland that he had helped to broker.\n\nCiting Labour\u2019s 2015 election campaign, when the Tories used the possibility of a pact with the SNP to undermine Ed Miliband, Blair said: \u201cThe question of whether there is another independence referendum has to be decided completely separately from questions of who forms the government of the UK.\u201d\n\nBlair repeated warnings that a general election focusing on Brexit was an \u201celephant trap\u201d, insisting a referendum was the only way to resolve the issue. \u201cOtherwise there is a substantial risk that we end up with a no-deal Brexit, not because the country wants it, but because the opposition vote is divided,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Conservatives can claim a mandate in a general election for something that I doubt very much would ever pass a referendum specifically on it.\u201d\n\nBlair cautioned that \u201cin the world of real, retail politics\u201d Labour would have 20 seconds to explain its Brexit policy to voters on the doorstep but suggested it was likely to take activists \u201ca good half an hour\u201d at present.\n\nAsked whether he intended to vote Labour at the next general election, he said he was \u201cnot intending to vote anything else\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle, I\u2019ll be honest with you because I worry a lot about the direction of the Labour party. I\u2019ve found the debate and controversy over antisemitism distressing, extremely distressing. And I think there is a sectarianism that\u2019s been brought into the Labour party that\u2019s damaging.\u201d\n\nBlair suggested that the former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson\u2019s departure from frontline politics offered a \u201chuge opportunity\u201d for the Scottish Labour party, which is languishing behind the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in polling.\n\n\u201cMy belief is that it will be clear over these next months that there is potential for renewal of the centre ground of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s true in the UK as a whole, I think it\u2019s true in Scotland, as well. With the departure from the scene of Ruth Davidson, from politics in Scotland, there is a very open space for the competition for that centre ground vote.\u201d", "description": "Former prime minister says Jeremy Corbyn must avoid \u2018horse-trading about the union\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/3500_(5).jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3756a7eaa98af2a9428dedccd0823c9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
