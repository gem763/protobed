His flawless display against the Jets and *that* exquisite touchdown pass into the tightest of windows was especially surprising.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

That\u2019s the biggest way to judge a quarterback\u2019s success, so I hope to win multiple Super Bowls.\"\n\nUnfairly maligned like very few before him, Jones has been forced to deal with last year's No 1 overall pick and Browns star Baker Mayfield blurting out: \u201cI cannot believe the Giants took Daniel Jones. Blows my mind.\u201d The Cleveland quarterback would quickly backtrack, yet the sentiment was evident, while he will also have to contend with assumptions among ill-informed fans on the street.\n\nThis was proven when Jones innocently attempted to buy an ice cream in North Carolina this summer with his sisters, only for the attendant to moan about the Giants' pick, oblivious to the fact the subject of his ire was staring straight back at him. \u201cYeah, man, that\u2019s crazy. Can\u2019t believe they did that,\" Jones responded, refusing to bite.\n\nExpectations are limited for now though, with the organisation floating the unbelievable possibility of Jones holding the clipboard for three seasons before establishing himself as the starter. When that time does come though, Jones should be able to justify the Giants' investment without becoming an MVP candidate; given that beyond the two Super Bowl-winning seasons, Manning has failed to muster even one play-off win in 13 seasons.\n\nAnd besides, transcendent wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr departed, while his replacement, Golden Tate, is suspended for the first four games of the season. Jones is therefore in a rather convenient position, yet his priority remains clear.\n\n\"I think there are a number of things (I can do right now),\" Jones explains when considering how he can best prepare for when his name is called. \"The biggest challenge in the NFL is to understand the playbook.\n\n\"If you\u2019re going to be able to run the offence and earn respect from teammates, you need to understand the playbook, so that\u2019ll be the first challenge.\"\n\nThe Giants venture into Cowboys territory to open up their season this weekend, knowing the Eagles, perhaps the most outstanding roster of talent, are also competing in the NFC East.\n\nYet beneath some inevitable initial struggles this season, Jones has already given a tormented fanbase one of the most valuable commodities in the league: hope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a change (to not start). It\u2019s a little different,\u201d Jones explained after his first pre-season in the NFL. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to figure out where I can be the most helpful for Eli, for the offense. Whatever I can do to help is my role. Help Eli prepare, help the offense, help the defense prepare with the scout team. I certainly understand that.\u201d", "description": "Collective sniggering and outright hysterical laughter spread back in April when the New York Giants decided to pick Daniel Jones at No 6 in the 2019 NFL Draft.\u00a0 The Duke quarterback has an\u00a0ungainly manner and enters the league with\u00a0limited pedigree in the college game: a 17\u201319 record might be deceiving though given the lack of talent surrounding him at college and besides,", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/15/gettyimages-1163261856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
