The action was downright dismal, although a late bounce helped to ease some of the pain. The point loss was substantial, breadth was 2,100 gainers to 5,200 decliners and the number of stocks hitting new 12-month lows expanded to over 250.\n\nConcerns about progress on China trade pushed the market down initially, but market players seemed to be willing to shrug off the same old negative news. The indexes were inching higher when a worse-than-expected manufacturing report was released at 10 a.m. ET. That sent the indexes sharply lower, where they languished the rest of Tuesday.\n\nThe manufacturing number helped confirm concerns about economic slowing that have been building. The number also helps to confirm the negative impact of the trade war.\n\nGoing forward the issue will be whether market players will start to anticipate a more dovish Fed. A quarter-point cut is a near certainty at the next meeting in about two weeks, but watch for talk about a half-point cut to build and for a series of cuts.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the last cut as a mid-course correction, and an insurance policy rather than a full-blown easing cycle, but that debate is going to find some traction after the manufacturing number.\n\nUnfortunately the selling Tuesday wasn't pronounced enough to suggest that the markets may be groping for a bottom. The indexes are still in the middle of a trading range and there is no immediate likelihood of a test of key support or resistance levels. The market is in the middle of nowhere right now and acting like it is lost.\n\nBe patient and stay vigilant. The opportunities will eventually develop again.\n\nHave a good evening. I'll see you tomorrow.", "description": "The market is in the middle of nowhere right now and acting like it's lost, as the first day of the month lives up to September's reputation of weakness.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "September Starts With A Sputter", "The Market Is In The Middle Of Nowhere", "As The First Day Of The Month Lives Up To September'S Reputation Of Weakness.", "Kevin Curran", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a9110a1b-cded-11e9-848d-7161bb1185c1.jpg"}
