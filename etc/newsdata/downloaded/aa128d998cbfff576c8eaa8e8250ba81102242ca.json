Dalvin Cook had nowhere to go. It was a noticeably quiet afternoon for Adam Thielen.\n\nOn the rare occasion the Minnesota Vikings had the ball Sunday, they usually gave it right back to the Chicago Bears.\n\nCousins and Cook were held in check by Chicago\u2019s ferocious defense, sending the Vikings to an ugly 16-6 loss. Stefon Diggs had a costly second-quarter fumble, and Thielen finished with two receptions for 6 yards, both season lows.\n\nMinnesota (2-2) was outgained 269-222 and had the ball for just 24\u00bd minutes in its third consecutive loss to Chicago.\n\n\u201cTo put up a performance like that is so frustrating,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings were looking for their second straight win after Cook rushed for 110 yards and a touchdown in a 34-14 victory over Oakland last weekend. Thielen added two TDs on a 1-yard run and a 35-yard reception.\n\nCousins and company got to face a Bears team that was missing three defensive starters, and then Chicago lost quarterback Mitchell Trubisky to a left shoulder injury on the team\u2019s first possession. But the Vikings were unable to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWould have loved to have come in here and gotten a win, got to 3-1, and it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Cousins, who passed for 184 of his 233 yards in the second half.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve got to not feel sorry for ourselves, but get back to work and find a way to get a win and get right back on track from here.\u201d\n\nCook finished with 14 carries for 35 yards and a touchdown. He began Week 4 with an NFL-best 375 yards rushing, becoming the fifth player in league history with at least 110 yards and one TD in each of first three games.\n\nThe third-year running back had very little room against Chicago (3-1), which took away his rushing lanes by pushing around Minnesota\u2019s offensive line. His longest carry went for 9 yards.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything special,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThey came in and played a good, clean game and like I said, we just didn\u2019t find ourselves today. It just sums up the day.\u201d\n\nCook capped a 13-play, 92-yard drive with a 2-yard TD with 2:58 left, trimming Chicago\u2019s lead to 16-6. Cousins passed to Diggs on the 2-point conversion, but he was stopped short of the end zone.\n\nMinnesota got the ball back with 2:33 left and gained 5 yards in four plays before turning it over on downs. By the time the Vikings had the ball again for their final possession, it was too late.\n\n\u201cWe have to be able to run the ball and pass the ball,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cYou cannot be one dimensional. It is too easy to defend.\u201d\n\nDiggs had seven catches for 108 yards, but he coughed the ball up on a 10-yard reception with 6:36 left in the first half. The Bears then put together a 16-play, 72-yard drive, capped by Eddy Pineiro\u2019s 25-yard field goal.\n\nThe Vikings have scored just six points in the first half in their last four games at Soldier Field.\n\nCousins fumbled on a sack by Khalil Mack on Minnesota\u2019s first play from the scrimmage in the second half, and Pineiro kicked a 38-yarder to give Chicago a 13-0 lead.\n\n\u201cWe talked about it last night in the meeting,\u201d coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cWe got to protect the football in the pocket. They\u2019re big stripping the balls in the pocket. We got to do a better job there and we got to make sure we do that, and we didn\u2019t do it today.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kirk Cousins was sacked six times.
