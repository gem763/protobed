The chain then extended along Fat Kwong Street.\n\nThe protest came after HKSSF\u2019s announcement on October 16 that all ball games scheduled at or after 4pm on weekdays from October 19 to November 1 would be cancelled; and that all ball games scheduled on weekends (October 19, 20, 26 and 27) would be cancelled as well.\n\nStudents at last week\u2019s Interschool Swimming competition sang protest anthem ahead of prize-giving ceremony\n\nThe reasons given were uncertainty and safety concerns.\n\nHKSSF only clarified this morning that the federation is trying their best to rent competition venues from Leisure and Cultural Services Department, hire judges, and arrange for the make-up matches.\n\nJason Wong was one of the students who volunteered to distribute hand-written paper signs to other participants so they could cover their school badges on their uniforms, out of fear their schools would punish them afterwards.\n\nStudents covered their school logos to avoid their schools being recognised.

I want to compete at the inter-school [events]!\u201d and \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d.\n\nThe 16-year-old student, who attends a secondary school in the Kowloon City district, told Young Post: \u201cWhen the students stick the signs on their chests, they\u2019re also trying to express their demands from their hearts.\u201d\n\nHe added that the annual inter-school meet was far more than just a competition. \u201cIt\u2019s an event that allows students to bond with each other and that boosts our team spirits. It also lets other people discover potential futures in the sports industry.\u201d\n\nAs a member of his school\u2019s volleyball team, Jason was angry that the federation keeps postponing the competition for \u201csafety concerns\u201d.\n\nUnsure of what some of the words in the news stories about the protests mean? We explain all here\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been putting in so much effort and hard work to prepare for the competition over the past year. And now, we don\u2019t even know if we get to play the game,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the ongoing protests, although he wasn\u2019t sure if the human chain activities would have an effect, Jason said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, there\u2019ll be no chance [for victory at all]. It\u2019s just like a competition, if you\u2019re not even in the court you\u2019ll never know if you win or lose ... But right now for inter-school competitions, they don\u2019t even let us on the court.\u201d\n\nAt about 5.20 pm, the human chain slowly moved towards the federation\u2019s office on Carmel Village Street, one student waving the American flag as the group progressed along the road.\n\nThe crowd of students headed towards the federation's offices around 5.20pm.

As long as the game won\u2019t be disrupted, I see nothing wrong in chanting political statements,\u201d said Leo Wong, a 15-year-old, who wore a gas mask to the activity.\n\nA member of the school\u2019s basketball team, Leo was annoyed that the federation used what he thought as an excuse to postpone the match.\n\nWondering why the Guy Fawkes mask has become so common at the Hong Kong protests?\n\n\u201cThey just want to silence us, so that we can\u2019t express our political stances during the competition, instead of having concerns over our safety,\u201d he added.\n\nA volleyball player from Delia Memorial School (Hip Wo), Melody Lai, 16, told Young Post, \u201cWe want to tell the HKSSF that we don\u2019t want them to cancel our matches. We\u2019ve been looking forward to our competition and we\u2019ve been training so hard for it.\u201d The 16-year-old was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask from the movie V for Vendetta.\n\n\u201cIf they postpone it to a point where the Form Six students can\u2019t take part anymore, it will be very sad because this is supposed to be their final year to shine at inter-school competitions,\u201d she added.", "description": "The teenagers gathered in Ho Man Tin to call on the HKSSF to let their ball sport matches go ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/img9963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
