The alleged reason was to attend a summit on AI. The real reason to go rent seeking is in a whole new hemisphere.\n\nThe rent-seeking paid off. The Chinese Transport Ministry announced that Chinese Tesla consumers would receive a 10% purchase tax exemption. Currently, Tesla stands as the only foreign-owned manufacturer to be granted such an exemption.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Musk\u2019s overture to China directly conflicts with the best interests of America. After all, President Trump specifically urged companies to avoid negotiating business deals with China and begin seeking alternatives just days before Musk\u2019s move. For matters of national security, American businesses were asked to put country ahead of short-term profits. But Elon Musk simply couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nIt\u2019s obscene, and if Elon Musk had any shame\u2026well\u2026he doesn\u2019t.\n\nAs if Musk\u2019s China double-cross wasn\u2019t bad enough, our own government is throwing scads of money at Musk\u2019s ten-gallon hat, filling it with our tax dollars. This time around, Musk isn\u2019t just lobbying for federal protections and subsidies for Tesla. Now, Musk is panhandling for his aerospace company, SpaceX\u2014and once again he\u2019s directly flaunting the Trump administration\u2019s critical national security directives.\n\nPresident Trump is currently moving forward with the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program via the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). But at every turn, Musk has attempted to undermine the space program for his personal gain.\n\nThe NSSL was created for a specific purpose. As described by the Air Force, \u201cThe NSSL program is designed to continue to procure affordable National Security Space Launch Services, maintain assured access to space, and ensure mission success with viable domestic launch service providers.\u201d\n\nThe key portion of that description is \u201cdomestic launch service providers.\u201d Currently, the US relies on the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine, and we\u2019ve been waiting 25 years for a domestic replacement. America cannot afford any more delays in this program. America deserves to have the best domestic competitors providing the best technology for our national security launches.\n\nEnter Elon Musk.\n\nHis company, SpaceX, sued the federal government because it awarded $2.3 billion to the other three competitors in Phase 1 of the NSSL program\u2026despite admitting that SpaceX wrote a lousy proposal.\n\nThat lawsuit, along with some likely hobnobbing with House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-WA), allowed Musk to get a hugely detrimental amendment slipped into the NDAA.\n\nThat amendment provides something very favorable to Musk and SpaceX: a massive government handout.\n\nIf the amendment passes, SpaceX will have a far easier time getting chosen for Phase 2 of NSSL. Smith\u2019s amendment allows a competitor who wasn\u2019t selected in Phase 1 but did get chosen in Phase 2, to have access to a $500 million \u201ccertification and infrastructure\u201d fund.\n\n\n\nThat would, of course, refer to SpaceX. That\u2019s also why this fund has earned the moniker, \u201cThe SpaceX Earmark.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s bad enough, yet Bongiovi said that $500 million fund could require the Air Force to pony up $1.5 billion once a single Phase 2 contract is awarded.\n\nSo, it isn\u2019t enough that Elon Musk wants $500 million in subsidies for himself. It also means draining our treasury by another billion dollars because he didn\u2019t get his way the first time around. But the House\u2019s NDAA would go even further.\n\nBeyond merely the SpaceX Earmark, the bill contains another provision that would shorten Phase 2 and loosen the NSSL\u2019s competitive structure, which \u201cwould increase per-launch cost while simultaneously introducing risk and costs for some intelligence payloads.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the NDAA is a recipe for disaster, unnecessarily increasing both risk and costs. But the bill\u2019s problems are deeper than mere logistics. It would also sacrifice our military\u2019s commitment to greatness.\n\nRemember, SpaceX failed in Phase 1 of a program specifically designed to select the very best contractors to protect national security. And now, Musk is trying to change the rules of competition so that\u2014despite missing the mark\u2014his company can still be included.\n\nRewarding a loser in Phase 2 is a de-facto weakening of national security. In a massive series of projects that affect both America\u2019s national security its space flight capabilities, there is no room for that kind of error.\n\nThere is some good news, though. The Senate, all the House Republicans who voted against Smith\u2019s amendment, and eight Democrats are all likely to reject the bill. What\u2019s more, the White House strongly objects to Smith\u2019s amendment and is pushing to have it removed. But the amendment itself won\u2019t be the only problem.\n\nThe House version also commits less defense funding than either the Senate or the president want. The Trump administration also indicated that it would veto the NDAA if the House version passes.\n\nThe Senate must hold firm to the original bill, and President Trump should veto the NDAA and send it back. Doing so will not only protect our national security, but it will also send Elon Musk a message. Musk will no longer interfere to weaken America\u2019s defense initiatives. And if he doesn\u2019t like that fact, he can go back to rent-seeking in China.", "description": "Lost amid the ongoing trade war with China was the .09/10/2019 19:26:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Lawrence Meyers", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/297/626b8df4-bc1f-4660-886b-1cb7808404de.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
