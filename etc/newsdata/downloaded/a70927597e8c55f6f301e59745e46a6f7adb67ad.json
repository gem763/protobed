We\u2019re back. It\u2019s episode 127. It\u2019s a tremendous Thursday. The Broncos and playing the Chiefs, the Nationals are in the World Series (kill me), and the Yankees and Astros are still duking it out in the American League Championship Series. It\u2019s been a very busy week\u2014and it will remain that way until the end of the Trump presidency. There is no shortage of liberal media meltdowns.\n\nBut we do have some sad news. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) has passed away at the age of 68. Condolences have been pouring in from across the country. An icon on the Hill and in the civil rights movement, Cummings was one of the key Democratic leaders on the Hill.\n\nYet, as members of Congress mourn Cummings\u2019 passing, the situation in Turkey remains intense, as they\u2019ve launched an incursion into northern Syria. Luckily, today, Turkish forces have promised to remain in a safe zone under a new ceasefire agreement. Vice President Mike Pence was dispatched to the region to settle this dispute. At the same time, where was the United Nations when hostilities broke out. And what could Trump have done? The Kurds did help us smash ISIS and Turkey is a NATO ally. And please, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had zero alternate plan of their own other than bash Trump, so the Democrats can stuff it. Right now, they\u2019re plotting to undo the results of the 2016 election with this impeachment circus.\n\nBy now, you know that House Democrats are secretly working on an impeachment inquiry because Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. That\u2019s the reason. There was supposedly some quid pro quo nastiness, where Trump threatened to withhold aid unless Ukraine opened a corruption probe into Hunter Biden, who was sitting on the board of an energy company despite having zero experience in this field. The Trump White House released the transcript of the call. There was no mention of aid. There was no quid pro quo. It\u2019s a lie. And the fact that Democrats want to keep this effort in the basement says all you need to know about their level of seriousness in this effort. It\u2019s a hit job.\n\nThis came to the attention of Congress because a whistleblower, who is a registered Democrat and had worked for a 2020 Democratic candidate, filed a complaint. Oh, and this person had contact with Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) staff; he knew the contents of the complaint before it was even filed. And this person is reportedly a CIA agent that was assigned to the White House. In the past, this individual was on the National Security Council staff for the Obama White House. With how Democrats and the deep state have operated, I don\u2019t trust a single thing from these clowns. And now, did Schiff try to shake down Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker into admitting there was a quid pro quo when there was none under oath? Our friends at Hot Air have more:\n\nIf so, according to Byron York\u2019s sources, it didn\u2019t work. House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff pressed Ukraine \u2018Amigo\u2019 Kurt Volker to admit knowledge of an explicit quid pro quo demand from Donald Trump for dirt on the Bidens in exchange for suspended military aid. The State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine insisted that it didn\u2019t happen, in part because the Ukrainians didn\u2019t know until later that the aid had been suspended at all\u2026 [\u2026] This did not sit well with Schiff, who wanted to connect dots through Volker. If the Ukrainians didn\u2019t know that the aid had been withheld, of course, then it\u2019s impossible for it to have been used in a quid pro quo by Trump, especially in the Zelensky phone call. That puts a serious dent in the impeachment hypothesis under which House Democrats have been operating since the exposure of the whistleblower complaint, and it leaves Schiff in particular out on a very shaky limb, having curated the complaint in the first place. At one point, an exasperated Schiff remarked at Volker, \u201cyou\u2019re making this much more complicated than it has to be.\u201d That might be a case of projection, considering the box in which Schiff found himself in this exchange. Making the problem worse, Volker testified that the idea of pursuing the Bidens had been dropped by both sides by the time the Ukrainians read that the aid had been held up. Schiff argued that the timing didn\u2019t matter\u2026\n\nNow, Schiff says they don\u2019t need quid pro quo to move forward with this impeachment inquiry. Oh, and the whistleblower may not be asked to testify. House Democrats doing their part to protect the anti-Trump deep state.\n\nWe also discussed the recent Democratic debate, where Elizabeth Warren was put in the crosshairs of the 2020 field\u2014and did not fare well at all. She cannot answer the simple question of her health care plan and whether or not middle-class taxes will go up. The short answer is yes; taxes will go up for everyone. Bernie Sanders just had a heart attack and Joe Biden looks confused, unprepared, and just plain weak. It\u2019s the geriatric brigade leading the charge. Yet, the reason why the Left is pushing impeachment so aggressively perhaps is due to the acknowledgment that they cannot beat this man in 2020.\n\nThe agenda that was laid out on Tuesday night was gun confiscation, a wealth tax, the destruction of private health insurance (it\u2019s the only way Medicare for All can work), censoring free speech, and destroying capitalism. Yeah, on the battlefield of ideas, free speech, tax cuts, fewer regulations, over three million jobs created, economic growth, rising wages, unemployment at historic lows, and small business and consumer confidence reaching their highest marks in years\u2014I think the Trump agenda is looking very, very good.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:02:01PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ccba51c4-ea60-4f5b-9d9a-e3a266faf8bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
