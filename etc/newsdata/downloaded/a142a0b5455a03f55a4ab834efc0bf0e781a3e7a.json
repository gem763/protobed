This is still science fiction,\u201d Tsiaras said, noting that K2-18b orbits a dwarf star in the constellation Leo that lies 100 light years from Earth.\n\nWhile light from the sun takes several minutes to reach Earth, light from K2-18b\u2019s star takes a century to reach our planet, \u201cso for us to travel there is impossible,\u201d he said.\n\nAn artist's impression released by NASA on September 11, 2019 shows the planet K2-18b, its host star and an accompanying planet.
