The mainland banks accounted for 37% of total Hong Kong banking assets last year.\n\nIn the past few days, as thousands of protesters marched through the heart of the financial center, a small group of black-clad protesters frantically pasted posters and spray-painted expletives on shuttered branches of Chinese banks.\n\nIn the commercial and night life district of Wan Chai on Sunday, a branch of China CITIC Bank International, the offshore banking arm of conglomerate CITIC Group, was plastered with posters of protesters\u2019 demands to the government. A StanChart bank branch next door was untouched.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker cleans graffiti sprayed by anti-government protesters at a Starbucks coffee shop a day after a protest in Causeway Bay district, Hong Kong, China, September 30, 2019.

In a separate Chinese statement, the bank expressed its \u201cdeepest anger over the illegal violent behaviour\u201d.\n\nAnti-government protests turned violent early on Tuesday and continued into the night, with intense cat-and-mouse skirmishes marring celebrations in Beijing to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe targeting of the banks in Hong Kong comes weeks after a group of protesters ran online campaigns urging people in Hong Kong to withdraw money from the Hong Kong branches of the Chinese lenders.\n\n\u201cThis protest is sparked because the Hong Kong government and the PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) keep curbing our freedom and our core values,\u201d said Chan, a 25-year-old accountant and protester.\n\n\u201cThe vandalism and damage to the Chinese bank actually also reflects the fact that we don\u2019t want our assets and freedom being kept by the Chinese authority. It has a symbolic meaning which is the same as the proposal of money withdrawal.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker walks next to graffiti sprayed by anti-government protesters on a bank signboard, a day after a protest in Causeway Bay district, Hong Kong, China, September 30, 2019.
