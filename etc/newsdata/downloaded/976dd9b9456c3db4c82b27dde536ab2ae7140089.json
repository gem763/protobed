Lieberman said his father will serve as a \"consigliere\" for his campaign after he convinced him he was prepared for the rigors of a statewide run for office.\n\n\"He's now back to excited, and I would say his competitive juices are flowing a little bit,\" Lieberman said.\n\nHe added that he would start with a name identification advantage, thanks to his father, and said he didn't think it would be difficult for him to get Georgia voters to look past the last name and assess his own merits as a candidate.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The video also focused on the issues of supporting abortion rights and Roe v. Wade; gun control, including universal background checks and an assault weapons ban; and his pledge not to take money from corporate PACs. He also referenced voting rights, pointing to Democrat Stacey Abrams' narrow loss to Kemp in the 2018 gubernatorial race \u2014 and the 2000 election, when his father was then-Vice President Al Gore's running mate, and the Democratic ticket won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.\n\nLieberman had previously expressed interest in running against first-term Republican Sen. David Perdue, but four other Democrats are already running in a primary for that seat. He said running for Isakson's soon-to-be-vacated seat would give him 13 months to campaign and also allow him to focus his bid against Republicans. Still, several other Democrats are weighing bids for the special election, and Lieberman is likely to be in a crowded field. The November 2020 election will be a \"jungle primary\" and the top two candidates will go to a runoff in January if no one receives a majority of the votes.\n\nKemp has not yet decided whom he will appoint to replace Isakson. He has been accepting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from interested applicants via an online portal and publicly releasing those who apply. Several major names, including Rep. Doug Collins, former Rep. Paul Broun and Tom Price, a former congressman and Cabinet secretary, have applied for the post.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/88/ba/9350650245008e67cfba94327a2e/20191002-joe-lieberman-gty-773.jpg"}
