And he thought he could GET AWAY WITH IT.\n\nFiring off some tweets about the Criminal Justice Reform in the US, Big Donny also called John Legend a \u201cboring musician\u201d, in a thread that props himself up as *the* President who signed off on the reform, while diminishing people (read: not Republicans) who were campaigning for the reform \u2013 or so he thought.\n\n\u2026.musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nAfter Chrissy saw the tweet, she had a hell of a field day with it \u2013 considering she didn\u2019t participate in the NBC interview that aired in the US on Sunday night.\n\n.@johnlegend, who founded @LetsFreeAmerica, talks with @LesterHoltNBC about the #JusticeForAll town hall and what he hopes people take away from it.

When mommy was making your sign and the pussy ass bitch president had his 9th meltdown of the day pic.twitter.com/ZFZHJYrDPG \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch pic.twitter.com/9ZkV7bh4FA \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone you\u2019re going to come for online, why the fuck would you go for someone like Chrissy Teigen? Are you\u2026an idiot? I mean that\u2019s already pretty obvious but hell, don\u2019t come for the Queen of Online on her greatest platform you fool.\n\nIf anything it\u2019s got us asking: well fuck, Chrissy, when are YOU running for President? Because at this rate I can assure you that a lotta people would absolutely prefer you over Mr Donut over there. At least your Twitter game is strong and unfailing, instead of just screaming at tantrum-levels into an echo chamber circle jerk.\n\nChrissy Teigen 2020, make it happen. Please for the love of all good homecooked meals and taking the piss out of yourself, make it happen.\n\nAnd if America can\u2019t make that work, at least we\u2019ll have this moment in history:", "description": "Donald Trump's latest Twitter tantrum has him coming for Chrissy Teigen, which is both baffling and essentially social media suicide in 2019.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/chrissy-teigen-trumo-tweet-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
