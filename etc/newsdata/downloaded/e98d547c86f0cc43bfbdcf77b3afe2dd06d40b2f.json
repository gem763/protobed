When the league first issued a statement expressing regret to those who had been \"offended\" by the tweet, a chorus of critics, including both Republican and Democrats in Congress, accused the NBA of succumbing to financial pressure from the authoritarian government in Beijing and failing to protect the free speech rights of an American.\n\nAfter the outcry in the U.S., the league issued another statement, saying it defended \"equality, respect and freedom of expression.\" But the NBA noted that China and the U.S. had different political systems and beliefs, and highlighted the league's \"great affinity\" for the Chinese people.\n\nCruz admitted the NBA was now doing a \"better job\" of defending free speech in the wake of the controversy. But the Texas conservative said the league still needed to do more.\n\nAsked about whether it should be the responsibility of the U.S. government \u2014 and not free enterprise \u2014 to promote democracy and freedom of expression in China and around the world, Cruz returned his focus to the NBA.\n\n\"American businesses shouldn't be in the business of censoring Americans, and we've seen this pattern, whether it's the NBA afraid of losing a bunch of money in China or whether it's Hollywood censoring out any content that is critical of the communist government in China,\" he said. \"You know, it's really an unfortunate dynamic, how China uses its vast resources to promote censorship.\"", "description": "\"t was really sad to see an American company and indeed a global sports league like the NBA being dragooned into censoring the free speech of American citizens in the interest of big bucks,\" Cruz told \"Face the Nation\"", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/13/87b105fd-1390-48d3-9a85-e505515f1a2d/thumbnail/1200x630/f7d3a20b2ec139076923ec33da5fd56d/cruz.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
