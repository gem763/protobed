Traffic and parking in the area led to tensions with the people who lived in the surrounding community. By the late 1990s, larger Asian malls in York Region to the north drew customers away. (supplied/Multicultural History Society of Ontario)\n\nBack in the 1980s, there was an influx of Chinese immigrants to Toronto, mainly from Hong Kong as many saw Canada as a safe haven and hoped to establish roots here ahead of the return of the British colony to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\n\"At the time the City of Scarborough approved the plan without really thinking that so many people would actually come and it would be such a cultural hub,\" said Tam.\n\nThe mall \u2014 which was once home to a roller skating rink \u2014 was the place to go to get Chinese herbs, traditional medicines and, of course, food. The food court and restaurant drew crowds for dim sum on weekends, weddings and Chinese New Year banquets.\n\n\"From the moment it opened it became an instant hit,\" said Tam. \"And suddenly, basically everybody and their family would show up to this mall who wanted Chinese or Asian goods. And so it became really, really busy.\"\n\nHenry Tam, an urban designer and planner with ThinkFresh Group, is hoping to gather stories from the community about the Dragon Centre mall. He will be part of a commemorative event at the mall Saturday. (Philip Lee-Shanok/CBC)\n\nTraffic congestion and parking issues in the area every weekend spilled out onto neighbouring streets.\n\n\"Which of course manifested itself into some racial tensions,\" said Tam. \"There was hate literature distributed in the neighbourhood.\"\n\nThe tensions prompted the city of Scarborough to create a mayor's task force on race relations as well as the multicultural and race relations committee. The Federation of Chinese Canadians in Scarborough was also founded around this time.\n\nSoon, other malls and plazas catering to Chinese-Canadians popped up in the Midland Avenue and Sheppard Avenue area. Tam says Scarborough city council, fearing a backlash, became hesitant to approve any more developments, which pushed investment further north to York Region.\n\nThe creation of other larger malls in the late 1990s \u2014 the Pacific Mall in Markham and Times Square in Richmond Hill \u2014 drew traffic away from Dragon Centre.\n\nJosh Lam, 33, has many childhood memories of Dragon Centre. He got his first pair of glasses at the store in the mall where he now works. (Philip Lee-Shanok/CBC)\n\nChau Chiu, 69, opened Goodies Noodle House in the mall 25 years ago.\n\n\"Oh, lots and lots of people. It had a restaurant, a supermarket, lots of different stores,\" said Chiu. \"Then about 10 years ago, the people is less, less, less.\"\n\nJosh Lam, 33, works at Advance Optical, one of the few original businesses from 1984 left in the mall. He got his first pair of glasses at the store when he was 12 years old.\n\n\"As a kid. I remember coming to the restaurant here to eat with my parents. You'd never find parking. But now, you know, you can always find parking here,\" said Lam.\n\nAndrea Inakazu ran Zees Hair Design in the mall from 1985 to 1999. She remembers that time fondly, but now she says Dragon Centre no longer feels like home. (Philip Lee-Shanok/CBC)\n\nNow, Dragon Centre is very quiet; its restaurants and shops are often empty.\n\nAndrea Inakazu and her husband Eddie ran Zees Hair Design in the mall from 1985 to 1999. They still own Kazu Hair Design in the mall across the street.\n\n\"You know everything has changed. I go there on occasion, but it's not familiar to me anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"I have of the memories of those good old days, you know of during the New Year's celebration, there was so much noise and everybody used to get flowers and the smell that was fantastic.\"\n\nTam says although no one wants the building preserved, he thinks its significance should be marked somehow.\n\nAlong with a plaque, which the city is requesting as part of the redevelopment application, Tam hopes an online project called Dragon Centre Stories will be a living reminder of the role the mall played as a community and cultural hub.\n\n\"Lots of people came here. They shopped here, they ate here, they bought their groceries here and it is a place that's remembered by an entire generation of Chinese Canadians.\"", "description": "When it opened in 1984, Dragon Centre in Scarborough's Agincourt area was immediately popular with Chinese-Canadians.
