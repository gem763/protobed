Late in 1995, the world\u2019s biggest movie star travelled by helicopter to Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire. Waiting on the expansive lawn was director Stanley Kubrick, who\u2019d lived semi-reclusively in the 18th-century pile since 1978. So began their great adventure together making Eyes Wide Shut, the eternally divisive psycho-sexual meditation released 20 years ago in the UK this week.\n\nA still potent mystique hangs over Eyes Wide Shut. That\u2019s partly down to the subject matter. When the glamorous wife (Nicole Kidman) of a successful doctor (Cruise) confesses the desire she felt for a stranger months previously, he plunges down a whirlpool of jealousy.\n\nOver the course of a single hallucinatory evening, Dr Harford embarks on a tour of the murkiest recesses of the human heart. He fends off the daughter of a patient only just passed away, almost hires a manic pixie dream girl prostitute and then blunders upon a masked orgy. It\u2019s nightmarish. The audience is never entirely clear whether what\u2019s happening is real or a dive into Harford\u2019s green-eyed dream-life.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAll of that would be enough to ensure its notoriety. Yet the allure of Eyes Wide Shut also surely flows from the degree to which death intrudes on a film about sex. Kubrick suffered a fatal coronary before its release. Just six days previously, he had screened his final cut for Cruise and Kidman.\n\nEyes Wide Shut, along with all that, appeared to foreshadow the unravelling of Cruise and his co-star Kidman\u2019s outwardly luminous marriage. They divorced in August 2001 \u2013 almost exactly two years since the project\u2019s release.It seemed ominous and more than a coincidence. Had Kubrick\u2019s caper put a stake through the heart of their relationship?\n\nSuch were the questions lurking in the future as Cruise, grinning like the matinee idol he was, sat down to a long lunch with Kubrick at Childwickbury in 1995. The conversation was mostly trivial. They discussed their shared passions: vintage cameras, planes, the New York Yankees. Cruise told Kubrick how seeing the director\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey at age six had blown his mind. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. What is life? What is space? What is existence?\u201d (Some of us will have had the same experience watching Top Gun.)\n\n\u201cHe was just waiting, alone in a garden,\u201d Cruise remembered of meeting Kubrick. \u201cHe walked me around the grounds, and I just remember thinking, \u2018This guy is kind of a magical, wonderful guy.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, they did eventually get around to the matter at hand. Kubrick wanted the star of Top Gun and Cocktail to play the lead in his sexually frank adaptation of an Austrian avant-garde novel from the 1920s. The film was to lay a seemingly solid marriage out on the figurative slab. Like a pathologist peeling back waxy layers of skin, Kubrick would coldly scrutinise what festered beneath.\n\nCruise was all in. And he had a suggestion of his own. He wondered if Kubrick might consider casting his real-life spouse, Nicole Kidman, as the wife. Two decades on, this unlikely teaming-up of hermit director, cocksure actor and screen siren can be considered one of Hollywood\u2019s most fascinating anomalies.

However, this allegorical anti-war movie following four soldiers caught behind enemy lines has more going for it than its reputation would suggest. Rex Features 2/13 12. Killer\u2019s Kiss (1955) Kubrick\u2019s second feature was another shoestring-budget affair, but he stepped up a couple of divisions for this stylish film noir about a boxer involved with a nightclub dancer menaced by her lecherous boss. New Yorker Kubrick made good use of authentic, shadow-filled Manhattan locations for his first outing in dark city which has many classic noir tropes \u2013 the film is told in flashback by a world weary narrator, there\u2019s love, deception, murder and revenge, and a striking denouement as hero and villain battle it out in a warehouse filled with mannequins. Rex Features 3/13 11. Eyes Wide Shut (1999) An affluent doctor is tortured by thoughts that his wife had contemplated cheating on him. Starring then husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Eyes Wide Shut was impossibly hyped as art house porn featuring Hollywood\u2019s golden couple and as the master\u2019s final masterpiece. It\u2019s neither of course, merely a fairly interesting erotic drama that crawls at a snail\u2019s pace at times, even by Kubrick\u2019s standards. Rex Features 4/13 10. Lolita (1962) A case of wrong time, wrong place for Kubrick who was constrained both by the censors and by filming in England, where he had moved with his family the previous year, his adaption of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s infamous novel about a middle-aged professor\u2019s infatuation with a sexually precocious adolescent girl. Kubrick later claimed if he had known beforehand how severe the censorship restrictions would be, he wouldn\u2019t have made Lolita, but Nabokov revealed that Kubrick had incorporated several things into the film that he wished he had thought of for the novel. Rex Features 5/13 9. Spartacus (1960) As mainstream as Kubrick ever got, Spartacus is the archetypal Hollywood sword and sandals blockbuster and the least Kubrick-like movie in his oeuvre, partially because of producer/star Kirk Douglas\u2019s input and also because Kubrick felt hamstrung by Dalton Trumbo\u2019s screenplay which he didn\u2019t much care for. Star and director didn\u2019t always see eye to eye either. Douglas, exasperated by Kubrick\u2019s meticulous attention to detail, reckoned that he spent longer making Spartacus than the slaves\u2019 rebellion lasted. Spartacus remains a great spectacle however, if a bit wordy, and won four Oscars, none of them for Kubrick. Rex Features 6/13 8. Full Metal Jacket (1987) Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam movie is a visceral experience which follows a group of raw Marine volunteers from boot camp to action in the Tet Offensive. Kubrick explores the dehumanising effect that not just combat but the brutal training regime under a profane, bullying instructor has on the recruits. Coming after a succession of highly regarded Vietnam movies, The Deer Hunter (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1987), Full Metal Jacket perhaps suffered by comparison. Rex Features 7/13 7. A Clockwork Orange (1971) From the Burgess novel, Kubrick\u2019s scathing satire set in a dystopian society in the not so distant future predictably caused controversy on release and continued to do so for many years afterwards, with one reviewer accusing Kubrick of creating \u201cintellectual pornography\u201d. Disturbed by reports that the stylised violence in the film had provoked copycat crimes, Kubrick withdrew the film in Britain in 1973 and it wasn\u2019t made available again until 2000, a year after Kubrick\u2019s death. Rex Features 8/13 6. Barry Lyndon (1975) Boasting sumptuous production values, this exquisitely mounted, leisurely paced adaption of William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s novel about the rise and fall of an 18th-century Irish rogue hero received middling reviews when released, but still won four Academy Awards, including not surprisingly, the costume, cinematography and art direction categories; for Barry Lyndon is undoubtedly one of the most stunningly beautiful pictures ever made. Kubrick shot all but a few scenes by natural light and candlelight, investing the film with the authentic look of the period and evoking the works of Hogarth and Gainsborough \u2013 exactly the look that Kubrick desired Rex Features 9/13 5. The Killing (1956) A huge leap forward from Kubrick\u2019s first two ultra-low budget independent features Fear and Desire and Killer\u2019s Kiss, The Killing has shades of The Asphalt Jungle (1950), not least in the casting of Sterling Hayden as the career criminal who recruits a team of specialists for one last racecourse heist. The caper goes to plan perfectly but the aftermath gradually and inexorably unravels in spectacular and bloody fashion. Don\u2019t let the clich\u00e9d Dragnet-style narration or the B movie status put you off \u2013 this is top notch film noir with a lean, mean approach that proved hugely influential in the years to come, serving as the blueprint for Reservoir Dogs (1992). Rex Features 10/13 4. The Shining (1980) Author Stephen King, upset at the wholesale changes made by the director, hated Kubrick\u2019s adaption of his celebrated and terrifying novel. However, The Shining still works as a chilling horror movie with Kubrick putting his own indelible stamp on proceedings \u2013 the jaw-dropping tracking shot of the child on his tricycle, the shocking image of torrents of blood flowing from an elevator. Kubrick was also happy to give his actors full latitude to improvise and Jack Nicholson is in full scenery chewing mode, his descent into madness making for mesmerising viewing. Rex Features 11/13 3. Paths of Glory (1957) There are many Kubrick aficionados who cite Paths of Glory as his greatest film. It is certainly his first masterpiece and may well be the greatest anti-war film ever made, with its shattering portrayal of the slaughter in the trenches of the First World War and the jockeying for promotions of the self-serving army generals who view the men on the frontline as mere cannon fodder in their own quest for advancement. Winston Churchill considered Paths of Glory to have been the most realistic depiction of trench warfare, but the film\u2019s themes could have been set to any war and told from the perspective of any nation. Rex Features 12/13 2. Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) Kubrick is at his most relentlessly cynical with this bitterly hilarious satire on the twisted logic of having the so-called ultimate deterrent in the first place. Perhaps only Kubrick would dare make a film about nuclear Armageddon as the Cold War was intensifying and so soon after the Cuban Missile Crisis, as he speculates on the consequences of the wrong person with their finger on the trigger. With fantastic sets courtesy of Ken Adams, outstanding black and white cinematography, a devastating script with lines quoted ad infinitum, (\u201cGentlemen, you can\u2019t fight in here! This is the War Room!\u201d) and a uniformly brilliant cast, allied to Kubrick\u2019s fearless approach throughout, climaxing in the montage of mushroom clouds to the strains of \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, Dr Strangelove is peak Kubrick, finding humour in the most chilling of subject matters. Rex Features 13/13 1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) A milestone film that places space exploration in the context of humankind\u2019s evolution, whilst contemplating a higher power and the meaning of life in a future where computers call the shots; rarely has a film provoked so much analysis and debate, which was probably Kubrick\u2019s intention from the outset. What, for example, is the head-scratching ending all about, and what is the true purpose of the mysterious black monolith that pops up on Earth, then the Moon and finally in outer space as the spaceship heads for Jupiter? These conundrums all add to the mystery and aura of a film in which Kubrick\u2019s legendary attention to detail with regards to the sets stretched to importing just the right type of sand and washing and painting it to accurately portray the moon\u2019s surface. Rex Features 1/13 13.

These conundrums all add to the mystery and aura of a film in which Kubrick\u2019s legendary attention to detail with regards to the sets stretched to importing just the right type of sand and washing and painting it to accurately portray the moon\u2019s surface. Rex Features\n\nEyes Wide Shut would cast a long shadow. It added to the background noise as Cruise\u2019s public image underwent a post-Kidman meltdown. In 2005, he went on Oprah Winfrey and proclaimed his love of Katie Holmes. He did so in the traditional fashion of bouncing on a couch and baying like a labrador. The maniacal side he had first hinted at when going through the grinder with Kubrick had blossomed into something awe-inducing and frightening.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to watch Eyes Wide Shut today without all of that \u2013 Kubrick\u2019s coronary, the Hollywood divorce, the couch-bouncing \u2013 playing on a continuous loop in your head. The effect is to amp up the already lurid weirdness. It is a deeply dissonant film. Even for Kubrick, certainly for Kidman and Cruise. But it\u2019s also unflinching in its insights into sexuality and brusque about matters of the heart \u2013 and other body parts \u2013 to a degree unthinkable in mainstream entertainment today. Even in 1999, it felt slightly like something from another era. Eyes Wide Shut harked back to the chilliness and stylised nihilism of Seventies cinema.\n\nOn top of all that, it claims the Blue Riband for most famous on-screen orgy in Hollywood history. In the unlikely event of Kubrick and his stars ever being forgotten, it will reign in perpetuity as the group sex fandango to rule them all. Say \u201cscreen orgy\u201d and what most people think of is Cruise gawping in pervy incredulity as revellers in Venetian masks get jiggy with it (and with each other).\n\nThe movie was a boundary-breaker long before its release. It holds the record for longest ever continuous film shoot. The 400 days Kubrick required his cast and crew to toil at Pinewood Studios was laborious even by his painstaking standards. And it played havoc with Cruise, forced to push back Mission: Impossible 2 again and again. As an entire production sat on its hands and waited on the actor in America, Kubrick rubbed his chin and tinkered.\n\nEye\u2019s Wide Shut had been a lifeline obsession for the director. Its origins stretched back to the earliest years of his career. As a hotshot younger photographer in New York, he\u2019d been spellbound by Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler\u2019s 1926 novella Traumnovelle (\u201cDream Story\u201d). He felt it confronted one of the last taboos in society: how to deal with \u201cforbidden\u201d desire within a marriage?\n\n\u201cThe book opposes the real adventures of a husband and the fantasy adventures of his wife,\u201d Kubrick commented. \u201c[It] asks the question: is there a serious difference between dreaming a sexual adventure, and actually having one?\u201d\n\nKubrick had made several previous attempts to adapt Traumnovelle. In 1973, he had the idea of changing the setting from turn of the century Vienna to contemporary Dublin. His plan was to cast Woody Allen in the Cruise role of happily married husband sexually unmoored when his wife confesses her secret desires. Somewhere along the way he concluded, moreover, that the time-frame should be changed from Schnitzler\u2019s Mardi Gras to Christmas \u2013 giving us the least seasonal Yuletide movie ever.\n\nSteve Martin was also considered by Kubrick after the director had decided the adaptation should be set in New York. By the early Nineties he was eyeing A-list Mr and Mrs Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger as his emotionally diseased power-couple. And then Cruise\u2019s name came up.\n\nIt was suggested not by Kubrick but by his producer at Warner Brothers, Terry Semel. The director wanted Warner to stump up a $65m budget for Eyes Wide Shot. Kubrick refused to film outside the UK and much of the production costs would go towards recreating Manhattan in England. Semel was amenable \u2013 but only with a knock-out star in the Dr Harford role. Who was more knock-out than the magnetic lead from Top Gun and Mission: Impossible?\n\nKubrick wasn\u2019t sure. The last big name he\u2019d worked with had been Jack Nicholson on The Shining in 1980. The film was eventually hailed a masterpiece. But the shoot had been hell. Kubrick had been particularly unappreciative of Nicholson\u2019s tendency to speak his mind rather than do as instructed. \u201cStars,\u201d he told Semel, \u201chave too many opinions.\u201d\n\nSemel persevered. And Cruise said \u201cyes\u201d without hesitation. Once that was settled, Kubrick was amenable to casting Kidman as Mrs Harford. \u201cTom and Nicole\u201d were one of the most recognisable couples in the world. Their marriage had been subject to the traditional tabloid tittle-tattle. A real-life husband and wife portraying unravelling spouses introduced a new layer of psychosexual subtext. Kubrick loved it.\n\nKubrick appeared to, additionally, get a kick out of exploring fissures in Cruise and Kidman\u2019s real marriage. He had Kidman disclose her inner-most feelings in extensive therapy sessions, the contents of which were not revealed to Cruise. And he forbade the actor from the set when Kidman was shooting her fantasy trysts with the naval officer who had awoken something in Alice.\n\nHe retained his enthusiasm through the gruelling shoot. Cruise and Kidman found it harder to stay positive. It wasn\u2019t the intensity of the material, nor the semi-nudity required of Kidman (who\u2019d been strict from the outset as to what she would and would not do). It was that it went on and on, seemingly without end. On one occasion, Kubrick had Cruise walk through the same door 95 times. \u201cHey, Tom, stick with me, I\u2019ll make you a star,\u201d he is reported to have joked. Cruise tried to laugh but couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to.\n\n\u201cWe shot for 10-and-a-half months but we were there for a year and a half,\u201d Kidman later lamented. \u201cSometimes it as very frustrating because you were thinking, is this ever going to end?\n\nCruise was meanwhile coming under pressure from Paramount Pictures over Mission: Impossible 2, already put back twice for Eyes Wide Shut. More than once he\u2019d politely taken Kubrick aside and wondered if the director might possibly have an idea when he might done. Kubrick never had a straight answer. Cruise soon had ulcers \u2013 a fact he kept from Kubrick. He didn\u2019t want more complications.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell Stanley,\u201d Cruise told Time. \u201cHe panicked. I wanted this to work, but you\u2019re playing with dynamite when you act. Emotions kick up. You try not to kick things up, but you go through things you can\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing that scheduling was Cruise\u2019s biggest issue. Kubrick made full use of the opportunity to strip away the actor\u2019s movie star aura. Again and again through the 159 minutes, Kubrick went out of his way to paint him unflatteringly.\n\nThe fly-boy glibness central to the actor\u2019s persona was openly ridiculed by the director. In an early scene, Harford flirts with two models at a party. Kubrick has Cruise unleash his trademark boyishness. But he frames it in such way as to make Cruise come across callow and charmless. Being chatted up by Tom Cruise, the film more or less says out loud, is the least seductive experience under the sun.\n\nThere were also winks towards unfounded rumours about Cruise\u2019s sexuality. Navigating New York by night, Harford has a run-in with fratboys who taunt him with homophobic slurs. Kubrick used the same scene to mock Cruise\u2019s \u201cdiminutive\u201d 5ft 7in stature. \u201cI got dumps bigger than you,\u201d one of the aggressors laughs, swatting Harford aside.\n\n\u201cKubrick seems to take immense delight in subverting Cruise\u2019s virile man-of-action image \u2013 Bill is almost pathologically passive, unable to acknowledge, let alone explore, his sexuality,\u201d went a BFI essay marking Eyes Wide Shut\u2019s anniversary. \u201cHe\u2019s also cringe-inducingly bourgeois, introducing himself as a doctor to everyone he meets, as if this automatically grants him moral authority in any situation.\n\nAnd yet, both Cruise and Kidman proclaimed themselves delighted with the finished movie. Kubrick was so anxious that details might leak that when he arranged a screening for them in Los Angeles the projectionist was ordered to look away from the screen.\n\nTheir director\u2019s paranoia notwithstanding they were proud of what their hard work had yielded. Here was an avant-grade film with a message everybody could understand: you can never fully know the person next to you in bed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a morality tale,\u201d said Kidman. \u201cIt\u2019s different for every person who watches it.\u201d\n\nCruise agreed. Kubrick had made a masterpiece of ambivalence. \u201cThe movie is whatever the audience takes from it,\u201d he said. \u201cWherever you are in life you\u2019re going to take away something different.\u201d\n\nTwenty years on, Eyes Wide Shut is an acknowledged classic.

That\u2019s especially true of her directorial debut, 2000\u2019s Love & Basketball, in which Monica (Sanaa Lathan) loses her virginity to childhood sweetheart, Quincy (Omar Epps).

Yet, the film drives them towards one, real truth: their own bisexuality, finally freed during the film\u2019s famous threesome. Though Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n's conclusion is tragic - Julio and Tenoch's reject their own truth, turn their backs on each other, and suppress their feelings - their threesome still marks a moment of genuine, harmonious sensuality. 20th Century Fox 4/10 God's Own Country God\u2019s Own Country star Alec Secareanu admitted he was initially \u201cvery afraid\u201d of the kinds of scenes he would be tasked with filming for the gay drama film. \u201cBut the way each character has sex tells a lot about them; the way that they develop their relationship,\u201d he told Attitude.

As time came to shoot Eye Wide Shut\u2019s carnival of flesh, assistant director Brian Cook joked that they should have hired Tony Scott to help out. The subject at hand far better suited his flashy style.\n\nKubrick\u2019s way of getting his head into the orgy was via the soundscapes of composer Jocelyn Pook. One of his producers had introduced him to her piece \u201cBackward Priests\u201d, which features Romanian Orthodox Divine Liturgy played in reverse. Kubrick was struck by the dark, dissonant quality.\n\n\u201cHe looked at me right in the eyes and said \u2018Let\u2019s make sex music!\u2019 I thought to myself, what the hell is sex music? Is it Barry White?\u201d Pook would tell Dazed and Confused. \u201cStanley didn\u2019t really care to elaborate, he just trusted me to answer the question.\u201d\n\nShe composed 24 minutes of roiling chants and percussion, using the same back-to-front technique pioneered with \u201cBackwards Priests\u201d. \u201cAnd God told to his apprentices,\u201d go the lyrics (when played right way around). \u201cI gave you a command ... to pray to the Lord for mercy, life, peace, health, salvation, the search, the leave and the forgiveness of the sins of God\u2019s children.\u201d\n\nKubrick and his crew were meanwhile immersed in softcore pornography, in particular David Duchovny\u2019s Red Shoe Diaries. They wanted a sense of how far they should be prepared to push the material. And to settle on a line they would not cross.\n\nThe orgy was shot at Mentmore Towers, a rural estate in Buckinghamshire built by the Rothschilds (known to hold mysterious masked balls). Initially, Kubrick wanted the models participating in the sequence to simulate sex at length. They were even asked to peruse the Kama Sutra. The response that came back was that they hadn\u2019t signed up for that level of explicitness.\n\nSo the sequence was instead reimagined as a choreographic piece suggestive of bacchanalia. As Cruises takes it all in, you can\u2019t quite focus on what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s mostly dark, suggestive blurs. The imagination is left to do the heavy lifting.\n\nCruise and Kidman may have adored Eyes Wide Shut but critics were slower coming around to it, even after Kubrick\u2019s sudden death at 70 made this his accidental swan song. That wasn\u2019t unusual with the director. Both 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining had been greeted with bafflement. And A Clockwork Orange had sparked a full-on moral panic. The reaction to Eyes Wide Shut was somewhere between these two poles. Many simply found it distant and a bit dull (it did make back its budget nearly three times over and is Kubrick\u2019s highest grosser).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empty of ideas which is fine,\u201d said The Washington Post. \u201cBut it\u2019s also empty of heat.\u201d \u201cThis is a film about sex that isn\u2019t sexy,\u201d agreed Total Film. \u201cA movie about love with a cold heart.\u201d\n\nKubrick, though, was always about the slow burn. And so it is only with the decades that the true genius of Eyes Wide Shut has been revealed. Christopher Nolan, a self-confessed Kubrick acolyte, is among the many who have confessed to misunderstanding it on first viewing. Only later, older and slightly wiser, did he begin to grasp what Kubrick was reaching for.\n\n\u201cWatching it with fresh eyes, it plays very differently to a middle-age man than it did to a young man,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very real sense in which it is the 2001 of relationship movies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was happy that he had chosen to go after something very difficult: the idea of what should and shouldn\u2019t remain unspoken in a marriage,\u201d agreed Steven Soderbergh. \u201cHe was trying to get at something that was emotionally ambitious in a way that most of his films aren\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "It was the fastest \u201cyes\u201d Tom Cruise ever uttered. Late in 1995, the world\u2019s biggest movie star travelled by helicopter to Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire. Waiting on the expansive lawn was director Stanley Kubrick, who\u2019d lived semi-reclusively in the 18th-century pile since 1978. So began their great adventure together making Eyes Wide Shut, the eternally divisive", "authors": ["Ed Power"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/14/gettyimages-903168.jpg"}
