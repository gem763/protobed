She has no governance ability, she is not suitable to be chief executive.\u201d\n\nSecurity was very tight ahead of Lam\u2019s third policy address, with riot police stationed outside and water cannon on standby.\n\nShe was speaking hours after the US House of Representatives passed three pieces of legislation related to the Hong Kong protests, drawing a swift rebuke from Beijing, which accused the lawmakers of \u201csinister intentions\u201d of undermining stability in the Asian financial hub.\n\nOne of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the US secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to keep receiving the special treatment that has allowed it to be a major financial center.\n\nLam has ruled out making any concessions to the protesters in the face of escalating unrest, saying, \u201cViolence would only breed more violence.\u201d", "description": "Carrie Lam was interrupted twice by angry pro-democracy politicians, who shouted her down during the annual speech", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6a2cfe18da74df57a64a77d1c155416c110a341/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4492aa0848e3b5dc74fb21a4275084de", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
