Therefore, it effectively suspends for a period central bank operational independence,\u201d Vlieghe said. \u201cCentral bank operational independence has served us extremely well in keeping inflation low and inflation expectations anchored.\u201d\n\nVlieghe said \u201cwe should try everything else first.\u201d\n\nHe also said that interest rates all over the world are likely to remain low for years to come.", "description": "Helicopter Money Would Put BOE Independence at Risk,\u00a0Vlieghe Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic70ccaecd0ff0c023b4d53a377ee17efb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
