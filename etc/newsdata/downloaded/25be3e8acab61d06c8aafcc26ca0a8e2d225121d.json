Even if district lines are redrawn to overcome that weakness, it will be (often white) elites who do the drawing.\n\nOr consider the issue of eminent domain, where government acquires private property for public use. Justice Thomas opposes eminent domain not simply to protect the rights of private property, as most conservatives do. He also opposes it because he sees it as a tool of racial oppression.\n\nMidcentury urban renewal programs used eminent domain to clear slums and improve downtown areas. They also uprooted African-Americans. In a 1963 interview, the writer James Baldwin declared that urban renewal \u201cmeans Negro removal.\u201d Citing that very line in his dissent in Kelo v. City of New London, a 2005 case that upheld the use of eminent domain, Justice Thomas wrote, \u201cUrban renewal projects have long been associated with the displacement of blacks.\u201d\n\nDocumenting the devastating effects of such policies on black communities, Justice Thomas cast the court\u2019s support for eminent domain as a jurisprudence of ethnic cleansing. Poorer people will always be the victims of such policies, he said; they are \u201cthe least politically powerful\u201d members of society. Invoking a sacred phrase of civil rights jurisprudence, he called the victims of eminent domain one of the \u201cdiscrete and insular minorities\u201d the political process often fails.\n\nAfrican-Americans, Justice Thomas believes, must look beyond politics. Malcolm X wrote in his autobiography: \u201cThe American black man should be focusing his every effort toward building his own businesses and decent homes for himself\u201d so as to \u201cbuild up the black race\u2019s ability to do for itself. That\u2019s the only way the American black man is ever going to get respect.\u201d Justice Thomas agrees. Indeed, two decades after he read \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X,\u201d he could still recite this passage from memory.\n\nRather than champion the black wage earner, whose subordination to white employers is all too reminiscent of politics, Justice Thomas celebrates the black business owner. He reports that his grandfather, an entrepreneur who helped raise him, liked to say, \u201cI\u2019m doing this for y\u2019all so y\u2019all don\u2019t have to work for the white man.\u201d Rather than amass wealth for himself and his family, Justice Thomas writes, his grandfather assumed \u201cresponsibility for the community\u201d in which he lived . That belief in the saving power of black business owners runs throughout Justice Thomas\u2019s philosophy.\n\nJustice Thomas often invokes his grandfather to critique government redistribution of wealth. Attacks on the wealthy, he declared in a 1987 speech, are attacks on \u201cpeople like my grandfather.\u201d", "description": "Whether or not you agree with his jurisprudence, it is rooted in a commitment to black people.", "authors": ["Corey Robin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/opinion/sunday/29Robin/29Robin-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
