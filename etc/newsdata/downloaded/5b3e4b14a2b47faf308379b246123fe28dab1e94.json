During opening statement at the September debate in Houston, businessman Andrew Yang announced a $120,000 giveaway: 10 families would receive $120,000 over the next year as a sort of dry run for his signature universal basic income initiative, in which every citizen over the age of 18 would receive $1,000 per month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop trusting politicians and start trusting ourselves \u2013 so I\u2019m going to do something unprecedented tonight,\u201d Yang stated. \u201cMy campaign is now going to give a Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month to 10 American families for an entire year, someone watching this at home right now.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement, Andrew Yang says his campaign will give \"$1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families.\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/9BMh0OJXaK \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. In order to apply for Thursday night\u2019s UBI giveaway, debate viewers will have to log their email with the Yang campaign. In a sense, it\u2019s just a flashier rendition of the get-flown-out-for-a-beer-with-a-candidate trick, or signing your email up with a retailer to get a few bucks off a shirt. Yang will be able to direct a rush of traffic to his site, boost his name-recognition, and blast primary voters\u2019 inboxes in perpetuity. Other candidates polling in the single digits must be jealous.\n\nOr not. Though Yang\u2019s legal team claims they\u2019re good to go regarding FEC regulations, former FEC attorney Erin Chlopak told Time: \u201cHanding out money to individuals for their own personal use would seem to be a violation of campaign-finance law. It\u2019s hard for me to envision how taking campaign funds and just handing it out to individuals would not violate the personal use prohibition.\u201d", "description": "During the third Democratic debate in September in Houston, businessman Andrew Yang announced a $120,000 giveaway to promote his signature Universal Basic Income initiative.
