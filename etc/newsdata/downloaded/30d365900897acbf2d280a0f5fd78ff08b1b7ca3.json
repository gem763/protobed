The steep rise follows changes in tax rules which means rising numbers of medics are cutting their NHS hours.\n\nThe highest sum was paid by Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals trust, which this year spent \u00a33,893 covering one 24 hour shift for a gastroenterologist on a bank holiday weekend. North Cumbria University Hospitals trust spent \u00a33,658 for an Accident and Emergency consultant to provide cover for 31 hours in June. And Bedford Hospital trust last year spent \u00a33,686 on one 32 hour shift covered by an obstetrics and gynaecology consultant, the figures show.", "description": "Hospitals are paying locum doctors record sums of almost \u00a34,000 each per shift in a bid to plug a growing staffing crisis across the health service.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/30/TELEMMGLPICT000098364791-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
