The conventional wisdom is that the House will impeach, the Senate will not convict. So what would change that dynamic in the Senate, the signal the dam is starting to break for this president,\u201d Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills explained on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nD.C. veteran Mills added, \u201cOne of the things we have thought is that the president gets a lot of support politically by Fox News and if they get more and more critical and abandon him, that\u2019s where I think the signal on Capitol Hill is that this is something that is very different than in times past and might have a significantly increased chance that the Senate would be willing to convict on any of the impeachment charges the House finds.\u201d\n\nShould Trump lose the support of Fox News \u2014 which arguably helped him win over working class Americans in his ascent to the presidency in 2016 \u2014 that could put his re-election bid in 2020 in serious jeopardy.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 24: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt host \"FOX & Friends\" at Fox News Channel Studios on September 24, 2019 in New York City.

Even if Trump manages to sidestep an impeachment, the loss of the influential Republican focused Fox News would make it quite difficult to win a second term.\n\nConsequently, that ratchets up the prospect of potentially less business-friendly Democratic candidates Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden winning the White House next year. Markets could react especially negative if the borderline socialist Warren wins the presidency.\n\nAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t appear Trump has lost the support of Fox News despite a second whistleblower in the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine coming forward. Trump\u2019s approval rating currently stands at about 40% per a new Gallup poll, surprisingly not too changed from the 43% in early September.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 stands about 2.5% away from its all-time high as investors have generally shrugged off impeachment concerns.\n\nBut again investors, keep an eye on the tone on Fox News. It may decide another election... and the performance of your stock portfolio.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
