While the stock market as a whole has prospered, energy stocks have missed the boat. The price of crude oil hasn\u2019t been particularly favorable and natural gas prices have sunk like a rock. On top of that, investors have been favoring growth while shying away from value stocks. This has left the energy sector orphaned; in fact, energy\u2019s share of the S&P 500 has fallen to its lowest level in many years.\n\nFor investors willing to buy what others are selling, however, energy stocks offer many rewards here. For one, these are the stocks to buy now if you want strong dividend yields. Across the sector, leading energy firms are offering their highest dividend yields in decades. This, while rates on fixed income in general have plummeted.\n\nAdditionally, expect a wave of M&A to help reignite interest in the energy stocks. For example, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) just announced a takeover for pipeline operator Tallgrass Energy (NYSE:TGE). That led to a 35% surge for TGE stock last Wednesday. And as we\u2019ll see, that\u2019s not the only dealmaking activity going on in the sector right now. With everyone abandoning energy stocks, this could be the time to take advantage of the general pessimism.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Stocks to Buy: BP (BP)\n\nEnergy Stocks to Buy: BP (BP) More\n\nSource: AVM Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTallgrass wasn\u2019t the only company making headlines this week. BP (NYSE:BP) also caused a stir with its announcement that it is selling its Alaskan oil interests to Hilcorp, a privately-owned company. Hilcorp will pay BP $5.6 billion; $4 billion of that goes to BP immediately, and Hilcorp will deliver the rest gradually in coming years.\n\nIt seems that BP drove a fair bargain. Its Alaskan properties produce roughly 74,000 barrels of oil a day, and have been declining in production in recent years. Figuring an average oil price in the low $50s per barrel, Alaska was generating around $1.4 billion annually for BP in revenues. Thus, it sold a mature oil field for around 4x annual revenues, even given the poor industry sentiment at the moment.\n\nAdditionally, this sale helps with BP\u2019s promised transformation. BP said that it will divest $10 billion in assets as it transitions to more growth and green energy opportunities. With this deal, they have now reached more than half of their overall target.\n\nManagement is delivering on its corporate strategy. The asset sales also help strengthen the balance sheet. This should give investors more confidence in BP\u2019s gigantic 6.71% dividend yield. In a market starved for yield, it\u2019s hard to think BP stock will stay unloved for too long.\n\n\n\n\n\nExxonMobil (XOM)\n\nExxonMobil (XOM) More\n\nSource: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of dividend yields, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is another income champion that the market is paying no respect right now. ExxonMobil has raised its dividend for 36 consecutive years, making it one of the few companies to manage that feat. Incredibly, it was able to keep raising its dividend even through the oil and gasoline price doldrums in the late 1990s. The great financial crisis didn\u2019t break its streak either.\n\nXOM stock is now offering a 5.1% dividend yield. That\u2019s amazing; it\u2019s the most that ExxonMobil has offered since 1990. Particularly with interest rates plunging ever lower, XOM stock is a fantastic alternative to bank CDs or government bonds yielding 2% or less.\n\nIs the dividend sustainable? Yes. In fact, ExxonMobil still has one of the highest-quality balance sheets in corporate America and is rated a sterling AA+. Even with the slump in oil and natural gas prices, ExxonMobil has still been able to cover its dividend payments out of free cash flow.\n\nStory continues", "description": "2019 has been a rotten, no-good year for energy stocks.
