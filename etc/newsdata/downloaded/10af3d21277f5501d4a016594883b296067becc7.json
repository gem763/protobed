A watery labyrinth.\u201d Occasionally, he sees his friend, The Other, who is doing scientific research into \u201cA Great and Secret Knowledge\u201d. Piranesi records his findings in his journal, but then messages begin to appear, and \u201ca terrible truth unravels as evidence emerges of another person and perhaps even another world outside the House\u2019s walls,\u201d said Bloomsbury, which announced on Monday that it had acquired the novel in a two-book deal.\n\nClarke\u2019s debut, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, took her more than 10 years to write. Running to more than 1,000 pages, it is set in an alternative version of 19th-century England, where magic has almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 faded into the past. Published in 2004, it took the world by storm, selling more than 4m copies, winning prizes including the Hugo and World Fantasy awards, and was adapted by the BBC in 2015.\n\nSince then, the British author has published only a collection of short stories set in the same universe, The Ladies of Grace Adieu, telling interviewers that persistent ill-health had slowed her down.\n\nClarke\u2019s agent, Jonny Geller, said that there are \u201ca few moments in an agent\u2019s life when something so unexpected and so wonderful pops up in your inbox, you can\u2019t quite believe it\u201d.\n\n\u201cSusanna hinted she may be writing again after such a long hiatus, but I never really believed a fully imagined world, a perfectly constructed novel, would just be sitting there,\u201d said Geller.\n\nClarke\u2019s UK editor, Alexandra Pringle, said that she had thought that Jonathan Strange, which \u201cappeared from the ether like an apparition \u2026 couldn\u2019t be equalled\u201d. \u201cBut when I followed Piranesi into his watery Halls, I discovered Susanna\u2019s wit, strangeness and sorrow made new and beautiful in ways I could not have imagined,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be an honour to open the doors to the House, and show its beauty to the world.\u201d", "description": "Susanna Clarke, whose bestselling debut sold 4m copies, will publish her second book, Piranesi, in September 2020", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f73c9d8849d3f7af53b58974e18711d0f9a996/366_952_2283_1369/master/2283.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c20dd3596b07efea704478b3cffc51e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
