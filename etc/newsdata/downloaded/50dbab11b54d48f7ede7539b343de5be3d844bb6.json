A Cabinet minister also refused to rule out the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 if MPs amend the Bill beyond recognition.\n\nThe blatant bullying tactic against wavering MPs was unleashed as the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - which enacts the Brexit deal in UK law - begins rushed scrutiny and knife edge votes in the Commons in a desperate bid to leave by October 31.\n\nA Downing Street source told the BBC: \"If Parliament votes again for delay by voting down the programme motion, and the EU offers delay until 31 Jan, then we will pull the Bill.\n\n\"There will be no further business for Parliament and we'll move to an election before Christmas.\"\n\nIf Mr Johnson dropped the Bill he\u2019d be unable to bring it back without proroguing Parliament or holding an election.\n\nThat would kill the deal he agreed with EU leaders stone dead because it could not pass into UK law. And it would leave Britain either facing a no-deal exit next Thursday or - if EU leaders allow it - another Brexit delay.\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nMPs will vote tonight on a 'programme motion' on whether to accept Boris Johnson's bid to push through all Commons stages of the Bill in three days.\n\nOne vote on a second referendum is due at 1am on Thursday - which Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire said would be a \"security risk\" for MPs and staff leaving in the early hours.\n\nAsked what would happen if the PM loses the programme motion, a No10 spokesman said: \"We would set out in due course.\n\n\"What we\u2019re focused on first is winning support for a deal. If MPs do finally vote for a deal, the public will rightly expect them to get on with passing the legislation so we can leave on Oct 31\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cVoting down the programme motion has serious implications, it means legislation can drift on and on. That\u2019s not in the interests of the UK or the EU. It\u2019s time to get this done.\u201d\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nMeanwhile No10 allies also claim the deal could be dropped if it's heavily amended.\n\nLabour wants to try adding a UK-EU customs union to the deal - which would rip up the Tories\u2019 attempt to stay out of EU rules and strike trade deals with the rest of the world.\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said Today: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compromise the integrity of the deal we\u2019ve negotiated with the EU.\u201d\n\nAsked if that could mean pulling the whole thing, he said: \u201cThat will be a decision for the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not going to compromise on this deal because it\u2019s a good deal, it delivers on the outcome of the referendum.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s the only deal that\u2019s out there that both the EU and the UK consider a good one that can take the whole of Europe forwards.\u201d\n\nIt comes after Downing Street dropped hints yesterday that the whole deal could be dropped if it is amended in a big way.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe deal with the EU has just been agreed, it\u2019s been done, it\u2019s closed. The PM is focused on getting that deal through Parliament.\u201d\n\nHe suggested an amended deal would then get snarled up at the EU end.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf essentially the legislation in the House of Commons steps too far from what was agreed in the original withdrawal agreement and political declaration that does bring into question ratification.\u201d\n\nA senior government source said: \u201cThis is the PM that quit the Cabinet over a customs union, I can\u2019t see him standing for it now\u201d.\n\nBut one minister suggested the PM would simply grin and bear it - and instead turn his focus to the future relationship.\n\nPlus even if the Bill was amended for a Customs Union, there is highly likely to be an election before the future relationship deal is struck with EU.\n\nThat means a future Tory government could override a customs union amendment, because no parliament can bind the hands of a successor.", "description": "Dropping the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be the nuclear option - and leave Boris Johnson unable to bring his deal back", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Leon Neal", "Sky News", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668410.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_The-British-Prime-Minister-Receives-Head-Of-NATO-In-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
