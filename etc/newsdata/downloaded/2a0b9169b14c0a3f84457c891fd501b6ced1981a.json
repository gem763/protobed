Some may even have died.\n\nPolice released a photograph of one boy\u2019s back covered in deep welts.\n\n\u201cWe found around 100 students, including children as young as nine, in chains stuffed in a small room,\u201d Yakubu Sabo, the Kaduna state police spokesman, told reporters.\n\nMen and boys were shackled and beaten Credit: REUTERS TV More\n\n\u201cThe victims were abused. Some of them said they were sodomised by their teachers.\u201d\n\nThe building served both as an Islamic school and an adult \u201crehabilitation centre\u201d, officials said. Children as young as five were among those rescued. Although no child that age was shackled in the basement, all of those rescued appear to have been held against their will.\n\nRelatives of the victims were reportedly duped into believing that the centre was a legitimate private Islamic establishment where students could study the Koran and and pursue secular courses.\n\nVisits were allowed every three months, but always took place outside the building and were carefully monitored, survivors said.\n\nSometimes, however, relatives appeared to have been in collusion with the centre. One adult survivor, Bello Hamza, said he had been tricked into enrolling for an applied mathematics course by family members who wanted to take over his share of a joint legacy.\n\nThe front of the house where police rescued men and boys in Kaduna Credit: REUTERS/Stringer More\n\n\u201cI have spent three months here with chains on my legs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey claim to be teaching the Koran and Islam but they do a lot of other things here. They subject the younger ones to homosexuality.\n\n\u201cThey tie people up and hang them from the ceiling. Within my short stay here, somebody died as a result of torture.\u201d\n\nThe centre is understood to have been in operation for a decade. It did not attract attention until police received a tip-off this week from a neighbour who reported suspicious activity at the building.\n\nThe centre\u2019s owner, who has not been identified, has denied allegations of abuse. He admitted that some students were held in manacles, but sought to justify his actions.\n\n\u201cThose chained are the stubborn ones who attempt to run away,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cThose who don\u2019t attempt running away are not chained.\u201d", "description": "Police have rescued hundreds of boys from a \u201chouse of torture\u201d in Nigeria after raiding an Islamic centre where pupils as young as nine were allegedly tortured, sexually abused and shackled to walls.
