REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo\n\n\u201cWhat I intend to do, perhaps, is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly ... and spread out the wealth,\u201d Trump said during a news conference about the U.S. special forces operation that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the two largest U.S. oil companies operating in the Middle East, declined to comment on his remarks.\n\n\u201cInternational law seeks to protect against exactly this sort of exploitation,\u201d said Laurie Blank, an Emory Law School professor and director of its Center for International and Comparative Law.\n\n\u201cIt is not only a dubious legal move, it sends a message to the whole region and the world that America wants to steal the oil,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former national security advisor and now senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think-tank.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the United States would \u2018keep the oil\u2019 in the hands of ExxonMobil or some other U.S. company is immoral and possibly illegal,\u201d said Jeff Colgan, an associate professor of political science and international studies at Brown University. Colgan also said U.S. companies would face \u201ca host of practical challenges\u201d to operate in Syria.\n\nEven getting Exxon or another major oil company to develop Syrian oil would be a \u201chard sell\u201d given its relatively limited infrastructure and small output, said Ellen R. Wald, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center.\n\nSyria produced around 380,000 barrels of oil per day before the country\u2019s civil war erupted. An International Monetary Fund working paper in 2016 estimated that production had declined to just 40,000 barrels per day.\n\nStill, the United States should be concerned about the fate of the Syrian oil fields, said Alex Cranberg, chairman of energy firm Aspect Holdings LLC, which has explored production in Iraqi Kurdistan but no longer has active projects in the region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the oil itself matters much to the U.S., but that its misuse could fund future problems for us\u201d if it falls into the wrong hands, Cranberg said, noting his company has not been approached by the White House.\n\n\u201cU.S. control over the disposition of the fields and the hard currency they offer would provide a significant influence over the shape of Syria\u2019s future,\u201d he said.\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien, a U.S. National Security advisor to the president, said a U.S. military presence will be required to protect the Syrian oilfields, suggesting it also should have a say on their proceeds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be there for a period of time to maintain control of those and make sure that there is not a resurgence of ISIS and make sure that the Kurds have some revenue from those oil fields,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, speaking to NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion on Sunday that Exxon Mobil or another U.S. oil company operate Syrian oil fields drew rebukes from legal and energy experts.", "authors": ["Lawrence Delevingne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445619752&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0T6", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
