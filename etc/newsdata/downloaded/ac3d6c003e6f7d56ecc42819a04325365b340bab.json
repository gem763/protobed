I think Buckingham Palace didn't like the idea of a member of the Royal Family having anything to do with a book that featured shots of naked guys with towels draped around them.\"\n\n(Image: RICHARD YOUNG / Rex Features)\n\nHe says Diana withdrew at the last minute, claiming she didn't know about the book's contents - which he says was untrue.\n\n\"I wrote back to her, calling her out, telling her how much money she had cost the AIDS Foundation, reminding her that she had seen the book.\"\n\nShe wrote back, but the reply was very formal and \"several\" - starting 'Dear Mr John.'\n\nBut he adds that despite his anger he was very worried about his friend at the time.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe writes: \"I was angry with her, but I was also worried. She seemed to be losing touch with all sorts of really close friends, who would be honest with her, and surrounding herself instead with people who told her what she wanted to hear.\n\n\"I knew from personal experience that wasn't a healthy situation.\"\n\nDiana and Elton didn't speak again until the day Versace died.\n\nShe called him at his holiday home in Nice, apologising for their fall out - saying \"I'm so sorry. It was a silly falling-out. Let's be friends.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThey went to the funeral together and remained friends until Diana's death.\n\nElton sang Candle In The Wind at her funeral, which he originally recorded in 1973 in honour of Marilyn Monroe and reworked for Diana.\n\nIt became one of the fastest selling singles in the country, with 658,000 people buying it on the day it was released.", "description": "Princess Diana and Elton John were friends for years after meeting for the first time at Prince Andrew's 21st birthday party with other members of the Royal Family", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Richard Young", "Rex Features", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529279.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Elton-John-Concert-Backstage-London-Britain-1993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
