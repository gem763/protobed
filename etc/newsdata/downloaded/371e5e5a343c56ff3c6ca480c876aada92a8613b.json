Orwell\u2019s warning was urgent\u2014and timely. Almost overnight, in the wake of the surrender of Germany and Japan that ended World War II in 1945, a new war\u2014the so-called Cold War\u2014had emerged. (Orwell is often credited with coining the term.)\n\nThe Cold War pitted the capitalist West against the communist East, above all the United States against the USSR (and soon China). Just three weeks before the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the Soviet Union lifted the Berlin Blockade, thereby avoiding a potentially deadly showdown with the West that might have triggered World War III. Two weeks later, on May 23, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was officially established, effectively ending prospects in the near future of German reunification. On the very day of Nineteen Eighty-Four\u2019s publication, June 8, fears swept through liberal America of a growing Red Scare when a leaked document named numerous celebrities as Communist Party members (e.g., Helen Keller, Dorothy Parker, Fredric March, Danny Kaye, Edward G. Robinson). That same month, the communist armies of Mao Zedong captured Shanghai, and less than six months later on October 1, declared victory in the civil war against the American-backed Nationalists and the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nWhat educated person is not at least vaguely familiar with the language and vision of Orwell\u2019s novel\u2014even if he or she does not recognize the source? Indeed the very ignorance of the source represents an inadvertent tribute to the power of Orwell\u2019s language and vision. Like Shakespeare\u2019s poetry (\u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage,\u201d \u201cTo be or not to be,\u201d \u201cThis above all: to thine own self be true\u201d), so deeply have some of Orwell\u2019s locutions become lodged in the cultural lexicon and political imagination that most people no longer recognize their author, let alone the source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, as in the case of Shakespeare, hundreds of millions of people mouth Orwell\u2019s coinages and catchphrases, such as \u201cBig Brother\u201d and \u201cdoublethink\u201d\u2014including his name as proper adjective, \u201cOrwellian\u201d (i.e., nightmarish, oppressive). And that\u2019s just in English. Tens of millions more recognize and repeat them in foreign translations, as I [Rodden] discovered in our travels and teaching in the communist East Germany as well as in Asia. Rudimentary acquaintance with such locutions is regarded as a sine qua non of cultural literacy in English\u2014even today, when prolefeed (mindless chatter) floods the print columns and dominates the airwaves.\n\nConception and Composition\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four represents Orwell\u2019s Orwellian vision\u2014in the form of a fictional anti-utopia (or \u201cdystopia\u201d)\u2014of what a nightmarish, oppressive future might hold. It projects a world 35 years away\u2014half the biblical lifespan of three score and ten. Having completed his novel by the end of 1948, Orwell flipped the last two digits to underscore his anti-utopian theme of a world turned upside down and inside out. Or so many scholars have reasonably claimed. The date resultant from the flipped digits also gave the novel its immediacy. Previous anti-utopias, such as Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World (1932), had cast their ominous scenarios far into the future, which lessened their dramatic impact and tended to render them entertaining thought experiments. (Huxley\u2019s action is set in the 26th century.) By contrast, Orwell\u2019s dire future is too close for comfort\u2014and depicts the planet in the immediate aftermath of a global nuclear war that has nearly annihilated the human species. His vision thus projects a world in which middle-aged readers in 1949 might find themselves in old age\u2014and certainly their children and grandchildren were likely to witness it. (If he had lived, Orwell himself would have still been just 80 years old on April 4, 1984, when the story opens.)\n\nThis horrific near-future is controlled by three rival totalitarian regimes (headquartered in America, Russia, and China) that crush all vestiges of freedom and liberty, wage perpetual warfare against one another, reduce their societies to primitive levels of existence, and propagandize the populace into zombies. The physical setting is the ravaged Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One (sections of which were still in rubble after Hitler\u2019s bombing campaigns). Airstrip One is an outpost of the empire of Oceania (a.k.a. America\u2014or perhaps \u201cAmerika,\u201d as anti-American critics of the 1950s began to write). War has raged between Oceania and its rivals, namely Eurasia (the USSR and its satellites) and Eastasia (China), continuously throughout the four decades since the close of World War II.\n\nThe plot is straightforward. Winston Smith is the hero\u2014or antihero. (The name both evokes Britain\u2019s much-admired wartime leader, the former prime minister Winston Churchill, and universalizes the protagonist as an Everyman. The novel\u2019s original title, The Last Man in Europe, also sought to wed the individual and the universal.)\n\nWinston Smith is a small fry. He is not so menial as the mindless peasant-like serfs of the regime, the \u201cproles\u201d (or proletarians). Rather, he is an Outer Party member of the tyrannical ruling party. Secretly, however, Winston is a dissident, hoping to serve the seditious Brotherhood, an underground rebel group resolved to overthrow Oceania\u2019s absolute ruler, Big Brother, and his governing henchmen, the Inner Party elite. (Orwell leaves it ambiguous as to whether the never-glimpsed Big Brother really exists\u2014or is just the regime\u2019s public face.)\n\nSmith\u2019s rebellion takes the form of keeping a private journal of his true opinions (including entries such as \u201cDown with Big Brother!\u201d) and carrying on an extramarital sexual relationship with another Outer Party member, Julia. Any conduct of a private life is illegal in Oceania. So too is non-marital sex, indeed even sex within marriage that is not for procreation. (Sex is referred to as \u201cour duty to the Party.\u201d)\n\nWinston and Julia do not have, or seek, a Shakespearean \u201cmarriage of true minds.\u201d Their affair, at least in the beginning, is not a love story at all. Sheer lust\u2014born of the animalistic urge to copulate and a visceral satisfaction in defying the Party\u2019s edicts\u2014drives them. As their relationship unfolds, it becomes more tender and multifaceted. (A few scholars have suggested that the juvenile \u201csedition\u201d by Winston and Julia in the form of sexual rebellion\u2014which essentially amounts to making out in a park and spending the night in a rundown hotel room\u2014 represents a projection of Orwell\u2019s own immature, adolescent sexual fantasies and frustrations.)\n\nWinston is an intellectual of sorts, though his day job confines him to work as a propagandist hack at the Ministry of Truth. He is mesmerized by anything that recalls the \u201cold world,\u201d the long-ago, near-forgotten days before Oceania, the era of the ancien regime, signified by such useless objects as an old-fashioned notebook with rich, creamy paper or a coral glass paperweight. Born before the age of perpetual war, he has vague memories of yesteryear, a time before the triumph of the Party.\n\nEventually he and Julia are captured by Big Brother\u2019s secret police\u2014known as the Thought Police\u2014a far more menacing version of Hitler\u2019s Gestapo and the USSR\u2019s NKVD (the Stalinist predecessor to the better-known KGB). Thanks to a clever game of entrapment, the Thought Police have been apprised of the couple\u2019s treason from the beginning\u2014and they simply waited until their preferred moment to pounce. Winston is tortured in Room 101 by the diabolical O\u2019Brien, an Inner Party bigwig whom Winston has naively trusted as a Brotherhood dissident. \u201cDo it to Julia!\u201d Winston cries out, an act of betrayal symbolizing his dehumanization. (Julia has already voiced the same sentiments, having capitulated apparently without extensive torture.) As the story closes, the brainwashed Winston awaits execution, little more than a vegetable. The book\u2019s final sentence\u2014\u201cHe loved Big Brother\u201d\u2014captures in four words his condition: unconditional surrender.\n\nArtistry and Impact\n\nWhen Orwell published Nineteen Eighty-Four in June 1949, he was already a very sick man. His lifelong struggle with pulmonary tuberculosis had been aggravated by the strain of revising his masterwork and typing it himself. He had been in and out of sanatoria in Scotland and England during the previous two years, and his weak lungs had collapsed not long after completing it. Lying in a London hospital ward, he was a man on his deathbed. Despite the exciting literary projects that his ever-sharp mind was busily devising (and his marriage in October 1949 to a lovely 31-year-old Sonia Brownell), neither his literary aspirations nor his marital dreams of happiness would save him. By January 1950, just seven months after his book\u2019s appearance, Orwell died at the age of 46.\n\nThe proximity of his last work\u2019s publication to Orwell\u2019s death date\u2014and its contributing role in worsening his health resulting from the stress and strain of finishing it\u2014have induced some readers to charge that it was the dark, vengeful parting testament of a bitter, dying man. They read the book not as a critique of the post-World War II realities prevailing in the outer world, but rather of the psychological realities governing Orwell\u2019s inner world. The \u201cnightmare\u201d was within, not without; the horror was Orwell\u2019s own physical suffering and psychological condition.\n\nFollowing this line of thinking, a few critics\u2014particularly Stalinist and leftist intellectuals who opposed Orwell\u2019s ingenious satire of state socialism (remember the name of the Party is Ingsoc = English Socialism)\u2014have in effect conducted psychological autopsies of Orwell (based on interpretations of letters, journalism, and fiction). So armed, they have proceeded to dismiss Nineteen Eighty-Four as a despairing self-portrait, a vision of Orwell\u2019s desperate, \u201canti-utopian\u201d inner life. Illness engulfed him. Death was in the air.\n\nConclusion? The book depicted his future, not ours.\n\nDid Orwell\u2019s anti-utopia merely express the fevered imagination of a dying man? We know that Orwell certainly did not behave as someone in despair during or after he wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four. All signs were that he passionately wanted to live. His list of literary projects, his marriage, his ongoing engagement with current events during what turned out to be his last months, reflect that hope. His chatty letters, humorous conversations, and ever-sharp pen represent further evidence. He told one friend, half-seriously, that he could not die because he had more books to write; that is, he believed that, so long as he had work of significant value still left to contribute to humankind, he would recover sufficiently to putter along in a semi-invalid state, at least capable of living a physically undemanding life for several more years. Nor are his decisions to marry and his insistence on keeping and raising his five-year-old son (a boy whom he had adopted a few years earlier) the acts of a man soured on life, curdled by hopelessness, a misanthrope expecting to die.\n\nContentions about Orwell\u2019s illness and the \u201cpathological\u201d subtext of Nineteen Eighty-Four are also often adduced by literary critics to buttress their characteristic claims about its purported artistic flaws, such as wooden characters, pedestrian plotting, and poorly conceived and executed themes (e.g., sex as rebellion). Yet these indictments fail to grasp the genre in which Orwell\u2014following great writers ranging from Plato to Thomas More to H.G. Wells and Aldous Huxley\u2014is writing: the satirical utopia. Philosophers refer to this sort of error as a \u201ccategory mistake.\u201d The category of Nineteen Eighty-Four is not the realistic or experimental novel, but rather the utopia.\n\nLike virtually all utopian or anti-utopian satires, Nineteen Eighty-Four presents drab, flat characters living in a grim world. Their journeys are predictable because their freedoms are narrow, often nonexistent and merely imagined. You cannot judge this book by the conventional criteria signaling a \u201cgood\u201d novel. Even the main characters are not three-dimensional figures.\n\nThat is how it should be. What would you expect? In a world like this, it would be inconsistent, if not contradictory, to portray human beings who are not stunted and who live exciting lives with unexpected plot twists and turns.\n\nYet there is a hero in this anti-utopia, and Orwell\u2019s magnificent portrait exemplifies its consummate artistry. The multidimensional, richly drawn \u201chero\u201d is none other than the setting\u2014that is, the empire of Oceania itself. Its history, its corrupt and tyrannical ruling Party, its oppressive and terrifying technology, its ingenious propagandistic language (\u201cNewspeak\u201d), its hatred of the body and sexuality (Julia belongs to\u2014and pretends to support\u2014the Junior Anti-Sex League): all this makes it a rounded, fascinating, creatively elaborated \u201ccharacter.\u201d And there is no room for any other. Because Oceania is omnipotent and omniscient, it determines that its citizenry\u2014whether prole or Party leader\u2014is a cipher. The setting is, as it were, the (pseudo-Marxist) substructure; the superstructure of character and plot are determined by and beholden to it, utterly secondary and \u201csuper-fluous\u201d by comparison.\n\nOrwell created an unforgettable, terrifying character\u2014Oceania\u2014and showed its \u201cdevelopment\u201d (in the spheres of technology, language, warfare, geopolitics, state torture, social relations, and family and sexuality) with astonishing inventive prowess. That development is manifested above all in Oceania\u2019s range of technological gadgets, Newspeak neologisms, and Party slogans and catchwords.\n\nAnd that is why Nineteen Eighty-Four is a gripping \u201cnovel.\u201d That is, moreover, why it not only became a runaway bestseller in the early Cold War era, but also why it has exerted a cultural impact greater than any work of fiction in the 20th century.\n\nUnlike the literary scholars of later decades, the newspaper and magazine reviewers of 1949-50\u2014who were addressing the general public\u2014lauded the book almost without exception. The-Book-of-the-Month Club adopted it as their main choice for June; Reader\u2019s Digest abridged it. Those two events guaranteed that the book would reach millions of readers. Equally valuable boosts appeared in the review pages of Life and Time, which at mid-century stood at the peaks of their influence. Now too the leading left-wing weeklies of the time, which had supported Stalin and the USSR throughout the 1930s and World War II\u2014such as The Nation and The New Republic, both of which had denounced Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm (1945) for political reasons\u2014joined the bandwagon. Nor were the leading literati hesitant with their kudos. For example, the editors of the premier intellectual journal in America at mid-century, Partisan Review, honored Orwell with the first Partisan Review Award in 1949.\n\nContemporary Reception and Relevance\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four remains widely read today\u2014and ubiquitously quoted and cited. In fact, during the spring of 2017, in the wake of the inauguration of President Donald Trump\u2014and controversies about the \u201calternative facts\u201d that his aides marshaled as evidence of record attendance figures at the event\u2014the book achieved the remarkable, unprecedented feat of skyrocketing to number one on fiction bestseller lists. This occurred an astonishing 67 years after its original date of release. Nothing of this kind had ever happened to another book in publishing history. And, in the case of Nineteen Eighty-Four, it was the fourth time that it had topped the bestseller lists: first in 1954, in the U.K., after a BBC-TV adaptation sent sales soaring; second, throughout the English-speaking world during the so-called countdown to 1984 between October 1983 and April 1984; and third, in 2003, as the centennial commemorations of Orwell\u2019s birth dominated the headlines and airwaves on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn fact, it is fair to say that Nineteen Eighty-Four has never not been a bestseller and a publishing phenomenon. According to the website Ranker.com, the work has sold more than 25 million copies since 1949. More than a half century later, Manchester Guardian readers voted Nineteen Eighty-Four the most influential book of the 20th century. Waterstone\u2019s, a British bookstore chain, has ranked Orwell\u2019s dystopia as the second most popular book of the 20th century (behind J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings). That is an amazing feat in its own right, given that most people understandably do not particularly enjoy reading (let alone rereading) nightmarish stories of torture, betrayal, and brainwashing. The book\u2019s ascent to the top of fiction bestseller lists in 2016 and 2017, along with the ceaseless invocation of Orwell\u2019s catchwords to characterize the Trump administration, induced Signet, Orwell\u2019s American publisher, to rush out a new print run of 500,000 copies. Expectations are that total sales will pass 30 million by the time of the 2020 election in the United States.\n\nBetween Prophecy and Warning\n\nSome critics do not fault the book on artistic grounds, but rather judge its vision of the future as wildly off-base. For them, Orwell is a na\u00efve prophet. Treating Orwell as a failed forecaster of futuristic trends, some professional \u201cfuturologists\u201d have catalogued no fewer than 160 \u201cpredictions\u201d that they claim are identifiable in Orwell\u2019s allegedly poorly imagined novel, pertaining to the technical gadgetry, the geopolitical alignments, and the historical timetable.\n\nAdmittedly, if Orwell was aiming to prophesy, he misfired. Oceania is a world in which the ruling elite espouses no ideology except the brutal insistence that \u201cmight makes right.\u201d Tyrannical regimes today still promote ideological orthodoxy\u2014and punish public protest, organized dissidence, and conspicuous deviation. (Just ask broad swaths of the citizenry in places such as North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, and mainland China.) Moreover, the Party in Oceania mostly ignores \u201cthe proles.\u201d Barely able to subsist, they are regarded by the regime as harmless. The Party does not bother to monitor or indoctrinate them, which is not at all the case with the \u201cLittle Brothers\u201d that have succeeded Hitler and Stalin on the world stage.\n\nRather than promulgate ideological doctrines and dogmas, the Party of Oceania exalts power, promotes leader worship, and builds cults of personality. In Room 101, O\u2019Brien douses Winston\u2019s vestigial hope to resist the brainwashing or at least to leave some scrap of a legacy that might give other rebels hope. \u201cImagine,\u201d declares O\u2019Brien, \u201ca boot stamping on a human face\u2014forever.\u201d That is the future, he says, and nothing else. Hatred in Oceania is fomented by periodic \u201cHate Week\u201d rallies where the Outer Party members bleat \u201cTwo Minutes Hate\u201d chants, threatening death to the ever-changing enemy. (Critics of the Trump rallies during and since the presidential campaign compare the chants of his supporters\u2014such as \u201cLock Her Up\u201d about \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton and her alleged crimes\u2014to the Hate Week rallies in Nineteen Eighty-Four.)\n\nYet all of these complaints about the purported shortcomings of Nineteen Eighty-Four miss the central point. If Orwell \u201cerred\u201d in his predictions about the future, that was predictable\u2014because he wasn\u2019t aiming to \u201cpredict\u201d or \u201cforecast\u201d the future. His book was not a prophecy; it was\u2014and remains\u2014a warning. Furthermore, the warning expressed by Orwell was so potent that this work of fiction helped prevent such a dire future from being realized. So effective were the sirens of the sentinel that the predictions of the \u201cprophet\u201d never were fulfilled.\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four voices Orwell\u2019s still-relevant warning of what might have happened if certain global trends of the early postwar era had continued. And these trends\u2014privacy invasion, corruption of language, cultural drivel and mental debris (prolefeed), bowdlerization (or \u201crectification\u201d) of history, vanquishing of objective truth\u2014persist in our own time. Orwell was right to warn his readers in the immediate aftermath of the defeat of Hitler and the still regnant Stalin in 1949. And his alarms still resound in the 21st century. Setting aside arguments about forecasting, it is indisputable that surveillance in certain locales, including in the \u201cfree\u201d world of the West, resembles Big Brother\u2019s \u201ctelescreens\u201d everywhere in Oceania, which undermine all possibility of personal privacy. For instance, in 2013, it was estimated that England had 5.9 million CCTV cameras in operation. The case is comparable in many European and American places, especially in urban centers. (Ironically, it was revealed not long ago that the George Orwell Square in downtown Barcelona\u2014christened to honor him for his fighting against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War\u2014boasts several hidden security cameras.)\n\nCameras are just one, almost old-fashioned technology that violates our privacy, and our freedoms of speech and association. The power of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and other web systems to track our everyday activities is far beyond anything that Orwell imagined. What would he think of present-day mobile phones?\n\nOn the other hand, the basic ideas of \u201calternative facts\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014our updated, revved-up forms of disinformation\u2014were not foreign to Orwell. Working at the BBC as a news producer\u2014a fancy term for war propagandist\u2014he heard some of the Axis powers\u2019 propaganda as well as that of his own side (even if he kept his own hands fairly clean). He justifiably feared that the very concept of objective truth was fading from the modern world. Winston Smith\u2019s job at the Ministry of Truth is to rewrite or \u201crectify\u201d history, so that it follows the current party line, whatever it may be at that moment.\n\nOrwell himself saw all this happen when he read Catalan newspapers as well as British ones during the Spanish Civil War, several years before joining the BBC. Condemning press distortions, above all how several English newspapers reported the war, he wrote: \u201cI saw great battles where there had been no fighting and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed\u2026. I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but what ought to have happened according to various \u2018party lines.\u2019\u201d Given the gridlock in American politics, and the never-ending verbal warfare between news outlets on the Right such as Fox News and on the Left such as MSNBC, Orwell appears all too accurate in his \u201cpredictions.\u201d\n\nOne of the features of the world of Oceania reflecting Orwell\u2019s prescience is its official language, Newspeak, an argot resembling a kind of Morse code that satirizes advertising norms, political jargon, and government bureaucratese. The purpose of Newspeak is to limit thought, on the view that \u201cyou can\u2019t think what you lack the words for.\u201d Ultimately, this impoverished language seeks to narrow and control human thought. (Does Twitter represent a step in that direction?) Purged of all nuance and subtlety, denuded of variety, and reduced to a few hundred simple words, Newspeak ultimately promises to render all independent thought (or \u201cthoughtcrime\u201d) impossible. If it cannot be expressed in language, it cannot be thought. And anything can fill the vacuum, such as 2 + 2 = 5. That is the equation\u2014a perfect example of \u201cdoublethink\u201d\u2014which O\u2019Brien indoctrinates Winston to accept in Room 101 and which marks the final step of the latter\u2019s brainwashing. As the Party defines it, \u201cdoublethink\u201d consists in holding \u201ctwo contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.\u201d In 2018, Trump\u2019s lead lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, declared in a TV interview: \u201cTruth isn\u2019t truth.\u201d A few months later, a talking head defended a critical news report on the grounds that, just because it is \u201cnot accurate doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nIt testifies both to the brilliance of Orwell\u2019s vision and to the bane of our times that Nineteen Eighty-Four retains so much relevance.\n\nLessons\u2014and Unlessons\n\nThe ultimate lesson\u2014or perhaps \u201cunlesson\u201d\u2014of Nineteen Eighty-Four is that, yes indeed, for terror and tyranny to prevail, passive assent to injustice is all that is necessary. Ignorance Is Strength! And vigilance, therefore, is requisite.\n\nWe citizens of anno 2019 are faced hourly with frightening reminders that Orwell\u2019s warnings are evergreen\u2014or rather, ravenblack. The cautionary warnings are simple yet not easy. Let us consider a pair of them.\n\nBe very careful of the power of government, especially as it spreads its tentacles into your private life\u2014for example, as has happened with the snooping of the National Security Agency, which makes Winston\u2019s terror about the Thought Police all too real, given their technical wizardry at penetrating into our daily habits and quotidian transactions.\n\nDitto with the power of those inadequately regulated or supervised corporate entities such as Facebook: that is, watch over your liberty and your right to dissent from social norms, above all the overwhelmingly powerful conformist pressures legislated by the forces of mass culture controlling our lives.\n\nWhether he dons his official robes of Big Government authority or his commercial cloak of Consumer Service, the spectral figure known as Big Brother hasn\u2019t disappeared. Instead he has morphed and mutated into ever more insidious, often digital, forms and formats. Given those realities in our outer world, unless and until the conditions of the modern and postmodern world that have formed present-day humanity fundamentally alter, the warnings of Nineteen Eighty-Four will surely remain ever-ebony\u2014just as they have proven to be throughout the past seven decades.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/george-orwell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
