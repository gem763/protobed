Europe\u2019s welfare states are already very expensive and the relative costs will increase dramatically in coming years because of rising longevity and falling birthrates. So I expect more Greek-style fiscal crises.\n\nThe other part of the problem is attitudinal. I\u2019m not talking about European-wide attitudes (though that also is something to worry about, given the erosion of societal capital), but rather the views of the European elites.\n\nThe notion of \u201cever closer union\u201d is not just empty rhetoric in European treaties. It\u2019s the ideological preference of senior European leaders, including in many nations and definitely in Brussels (home of the European Commission and the European Parliament).\n\nIn practical terms, this means a relentless effort for more centralization.\n\nIt means unending pressure for European-wide taxes.\n\nIt means unending pressure for tax harmonization.\n\nIt means unending pressure for regulatory harmonization.\n\nIt means unending pressure for a transfer union.\n\nAll policies that will accelerate Europe\u2019s decline.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with the taxation of air travel is a good example. Here are some excerpts from a story in U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe Netherlands and France are trying to convince fellow European nations at a conference in The Hague to end tax exemptions on jet fuel and plane tickets\u2026 In the first major initiative on air travel tax in years, the conference on Thursday and Friday \u2013 which will be attended by about 29 countries \u2013 will discuss ticket taxes, kerosene levies and value-added tax (VAT) on air travel. \u2026The conference will be attended by European Union economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici and finance and environment ministers. \u2026The conference organizers hope that higher taxes will lead to changes in consumer behavior, with fewer people flying\n\nThe politicians, bureaucrats, and environmental activists are unhappy that European consumers are enjoying lightly taxed travel inside Europe.\n\nOh, the horror!\n\nA combination of low aviation taxes, a proliferation of budget airlines and the rise of Airbnb have led to a boom in intra-European city-trips. \u2026Research has shown that if the price of air travel goes up by one percent, demand will likely fall by about one percent, according to IMF tax policy division head Ruud De Mooij. He said that in a typical tank of gas for a car, over half the cost is tax\u2026\u201dAirline travel is nearly entirely exempt from all tax\u2026 Ending its undertaxation would level the playing field versus other modes of transport,\u201d he said. \u2026Environmental NGOs such as Transport and Environment (T&E) have long criticized the EU for being a \u201ckerosene tax haven\u201d.\u201dEurope is a sorry story. Even the U.S., Australia and Brazil, where climate change deniers are in charge, all tax aviation more than Europe does,\u201d T&E\u2019s Bill Hemmings said. \u2026The EU report shows that just six out of 28 EU member states levy ticket taxes on international flights, with Britain\u2019s rates by far the highest at about 14 euros for short-haul economy flights and up to 499 euros for long-haul business class. \u2026Friends of the Earth says there are no easy answers and that the only way to reduce airline CO2 emissions is by constraining aviation trough taxation, frequent flyer levies and limiting the number of flights at airports.\n\nThe only semi-compelling argument in the story is that air travel is taxed at preferential rates compared to other modes of transportation.\n\nAssuming that\u2019s true, it would be morally and economically appropriate to remove that distortion.\n\nBut not as part of a money-grab by European politicians who want more money and more centralization.\n\nAs you can see from this chart, the tax burden in eurozone nations is almost 50 percent higher than it is in the United States (46.2 percent of GDP compared to 32.7 percent of GDP according to OECD data for 2018).\n\nAnd it\u2019s lower-income and middle-class taxpayers who are paying the difference.\n\nSo here\u2019s a fair trade. European nations (not Brussels) can impose additional taxes on air travel if they are willing to lower other taxes by a greater amount. Maybe \u20ac3 of tax cuts for every \u20ac1 of additional taxes on air travel?\n\nNeedless to say, nobody in Brussels \u2013 or in national capitals \u2013 is contemplating such a swap. The discussion is entirely focused on extracting more tax revenue.\n\nP.S. There\u2019s some compelling academic evidence that the European Union has undermined the continent\u2019s economic performance. Which is sad since the EU started as a noble idea of a free trade area and instead has become a vehicle for statism.", "description": "I\u2019ve argued for many years that a\u00a0Clean Brexit is the .09/10/2019 3:41:38AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
