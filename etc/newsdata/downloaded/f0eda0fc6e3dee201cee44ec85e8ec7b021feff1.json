Telegram also says, in the letter, that it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the SEC\u2019s decision, and \u201cdoes not agree\u201d with its stance.\n\nThe letter explains,\n\n\u201cTelegram has been trying to interact with the SEC and receive feedback on TON for the past 18 months [\u2026] We do not agree with the position the SEC has taken.\u201d\n\nInvestors were also told, in the same letter,\n\n\u201cTogether with our consultants, we are looking into the best ways to resolve the situation in the interests of all parties. Possible solutions include, but are not limited to, trying to postpone the launch date. We are working hard to quickly resolve these matters. We plan to provide additional information in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nIn a press release, the SEC stated that it had taken the move in order to \u201cprevent Telegram from flooding the United States markets with digital tokens\u201d it believes were \u201cunlawfully sold.\u201d\n\nThe TON Board responded by dropping off the grid, deleting all of its posts on its own Telegram channel, except for a single update on October 13, stating,\n\n\u201cDue to the increased level of regulatory uncertainty, we [will] take a break to analyze new information and adapt our policies.\u201d\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s move, New York Times journalist Nathaniel Popper tweeted that Telegram backers included the likes of Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed. He also added that Telegram had worked with international, New York-based law firm Skadden Arps to \u201cget the Gram out legally.\u201d\n\nTelegram convinced many of its investors that they had taken the necessary steps to avoid this outcome -- but the SEC apparently disagreed. \u2014 Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper)\n\nTelegram has raised USD 1.7 billion in two private sales of the Gram \u2013 with much of the investment believed to have come from individuals and companies in the United States.\n\nThe SEC alleges that over 1 billion of the 2.9 billion Gram tokens already sold have been bought by 39 American residents. Per digital scans of documents filed with a Manhattan court, the SEC says that USD 424.5 million of the USD 1.7 billion investment has been made by America-based parties.", "description": "Telegram admits that it could postpone the launch of its TON network and Gram token after a late intervention from the American regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday.
