So when you look at the evidence of whether or not the sugar tax has worked, the answer is it has.'\n\nEarlier on, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the 'biggest single thing' the PM could do to protect the NHS was to show decisive leadership on sugar and salt in food, and clean air.\n\nHe added: 'Sheltering behind flowery rhetoric about \"nanny statism\" doesn't cut the mustard.'\n\nMr Stevens also hit out at the England and Wales Cricket Board for having KP Snacks sponsor its new 100-ball tournament.\n\nEach team in The Hundred contest will wear shirts featuring a different KP Snacks brand, including Skips, Hula Hoops, Butterkist, Pom-Bear and McCoy's. KP Snacks said it was 'helping to grow cricket and encourage families to get active'.\n\nBut campaigners said they were 'stumped' that the board had thought it appropriate to choose a high-fat, high-salt snacking brand as an appropriate partner for the competition.\n\nThe NHS boss also called on social media companies to take responsibility for some of the root causes of mental health problems affecting young people.\n\nHe recalled sitting down for a meal with young people being treated at a specialist eating disorder clinic.\n\nMr Stevens said: 'If we are thinking about all of the pressures bearing down on young people, including young women in our society, there is a wider responsibility that goes with social media and other companies to deal with some of the root causes of these increasing problems that we are seeing.'\n\nSome social media companies are acknowledging this responsibility and 'don't want to get on the wrong side of what I think is rapidly crystallising public opinion', he added.", "description": "The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, told a conference in Manchester that the obesity crisis shows that poor diet now presents a greater threat to good health than smoking.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/wire-19450686-1570550614-713_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
