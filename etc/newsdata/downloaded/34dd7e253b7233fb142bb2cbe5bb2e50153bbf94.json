He dropped the boy after they continued to hit him outside the pub.'\n\nWest Midlands Police said in a statement: 'At this stage, it is believed that the boy was not injured with any weapons. He suffered minor cuts and abrasions, consistent with him having fallen.'\n\nThe injured two-year-old boy became caught up in the violence after attending a christening with his family, a neighbour revealed.\n\nThey said: 'There was a christening party at the pub and there were lots of kids running about all day.\n\n'It's just pure evil to target somebody at a family christening when they would know children were around.\n\n'It doesn't get lower than that and its fortunate he wasn't seriously hurt. Not even our children are safe these days.'\n\nResidents said the 24-year-old victim was targeted by a masked gang who leapt from a car wielding machetes, baseball bats and crowbars.\n\nOne local, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I heard a commotion, so opened the door and saw loads of coppers and ambulances.\n\n'I heard that a couple of cars pulled up and some men came out with machetes, baseball bats and crowbars.\n\n'They gave the guy a bit of a kicking, jumped back in the cars and then shot off.\n\n'It was a 4x4 and another car. The owner of the pub, Denver Allen, said they were wearing balaclavas and masks.\n\n'All my neighbours are shook up. I've been living here for two years, this is the first bit of trouble I've seen.'\n\nAnother resident added: 'Normally it's really quiet. For a pub there's never been any problems.\n\n'I came out yesterday night and they were wheeling someone into an ambulance.\n\nThe man is in a critical condition in hospital after being stabbed multiple times by the gang\n\n'Some lad ran up to me and said a man was using a machete. It's usually quiet round here. It was a bit out of the blue. You wouldn't expect it.\n\n'I saw the victim on the floor and people surrounding him. I thought it was a brawl at first.\n\n'No one was kicking off or anything, which was weird. It was eerily quiet in the aftermath. When I heard someone had a machete I quickly went indoors.\n\n'I was told someone attacked the man and ran around the back of our street.'\n\nAnother neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'There was a bit of function at the pub last night and it looks like it was a targeted attack.\n\n'To hear a two-year-old has got caught up in the violence is just horrific.\n\n'How could anyone do anything like that when there's a small child around?\n\n'I'm not sure if the kid was related to the bloke, as there were quite a few kids at the party running around the car park earlier in the day.'\n\nDetective Sergeant Paul Cook, from West Midlands Police CID, added: 'I understand the concerns of the community and would like to offer reassurance that we're doing all we can to establish what happened yesterday and find those responsible.\n\n'If you saw what happened, or have any information about the incident please get in touch.'\n\nA West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson added: 'We were called at 6.37pm to reports of a man who has been assaulted by a number of others; they had left scene.\n\n'We sent an ambulance, two paramedic officers and the Midlands Air Ambulance Critical Care Car.\n\n'On arrival they found a man who had been badly hurt with a large crowd of onlookers at the scene.\n\n'A man in 20s was treated for serious injuries and taken on blue lights to hospital with the critical care paramedic travelling.'\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact police via Live Chat at www.west-midlands.police.uk - between 8am and midnight or on 101 at anytime.\n\nCrimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log number 2125 of the 06/10/2019.", "description": "The two-year-boy was injured in the attack which saw a gang stab a man, 24, multiple times outside of a pub in West Bromwich in the West Midlands last night.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/13/19395666-0-image-a-2_1570451737482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
