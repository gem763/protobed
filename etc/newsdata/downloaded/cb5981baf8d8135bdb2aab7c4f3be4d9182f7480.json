The decision affects only Homeland Security\u2019s agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMembers of the Portland chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, a coalition called Close the Concentration Camps, along with Portland City Commissioner JoAnn Hardesty challenged the contract, citing the city\u2019s and state\u2019s sanctuary law, which directs police not to help federal agents enforce immigration policies.\n\n\u201cAfter an internal review, the Portland Police Bureau is no longer allowing use of its Training Division facility by a portion of the United States Department of Homeland Security because the use of the facility must be consistent with the City\u2019s values and Federal, State, and local laws,\u201d the Police Bureau said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nUnder a city resolution, the city of Portland prohibits the use of city funds, personnel or equipment to enforce federal immigration law.\n\n\u201cA mistake was made due to miscommunication during the contract approval process. When the oversight was brought to our attention, we took immediate action,\u201d Chief Danielle Outlaw said in the statement.\n\nPortland Democratic Socialists of America participated in the Occupy ICE protests at the federal immigration enforcement headquarters in Portland. The group seeks an \u201cend to all ICE activities\u201d in the city and any contracts between the city and federal immigration enforcement agents.\n\nIt called the halting of the training center contract with ICE \u201ca small victory in a much larger battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fight against all ICE contracts in the city and the state, whether they be with private business or public government,\u201d a statement by the groups said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Portland Police Bureau has terminated a two-year contract that allowed federal immigration enforcement agents to use the firing range and classroom space at its training center.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/AP_19230012029110_c0-186-4443-2776_s1770x1032.jpg?eb18f62855c42add319920c3f425a2d1e038965c", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
