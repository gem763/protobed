It was only May, but the smell from the bags of rubbish was strong as the food inside started to rot in the warmth.\n\nBlack bin liners, nappies, food \u2013 all items which could contaminate a batch of otherwise recyclable waste \u2013 needed to be separated from the recycling and put in the bins marked \u201cgeneral waste\u201d.\n\nTasked with removing 35 pieces of rubbish a minute from the line, it was sometimes hard for staff to keep up, and it appeared several workers may have felt pressured to \u201cgrab\u201d any items \u2013 including plastic bottles, cardboard and unopened sacks containing recycling \u2013 and discard them in the bins.\n\nWhen the undercover reporter asked what happened to the items put in the bins, they were told: \u201cIf it goes to the bin?
