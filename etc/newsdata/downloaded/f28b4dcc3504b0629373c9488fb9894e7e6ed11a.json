Edwards told a Justice Department attorney, \u201cYou are failing to address the critical statutory objective\u201d of providing vulnerable residents with health coverage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe attorney, Alisa Klein, of Justice\u2019s civil division, said the administration believes that requiring low-income people to work, or prepare for jobs, can improve their health and ultimately help them get private health plans, freeing up money that states could use for additional Medicaid benefits.\n\n\u201cThe other things you say may be laudable goals, but to say they outweigh the principal goal [of Medicaid] seems a bit strange,\u201d said Judge David B. Sentelle, nominated by President Ronald Reagan and the only Republican appointee on the panel.\n\nThe judges also were dismissive of the administration\u2019s argument that work requirements for Medicaid merely extend an idea embedded for two decades in the nation\u2019s main welfare and food assistance programs. Sentelle said the analogies \u201care not comparable at all,\u201d because Congress specifically wrote that financial self-sufficiency is a goal of the other two programs but has never included that in Medicaid law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe hearing turned on controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s promotion of a fundamental redesign of Medicaid, which began as a central piece of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s 1960s-era anti-poverty Great Society, and is today the country\u2019s largest public insurance program.\n\nFriday\u2019s hearing come seven months after a federal district judge placed a major roadblock in the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to let states compel poor people on Medicaid to work in exchange for health insurance.\n\nIn twinned opinions in late March, Judge James E. Boasberg, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, halted work requirements that began last year in Arkansas and blocked similar rules that Kentucky has tried to start.\n\nAD\n\nKentucky and Arkansas are among 9 states that have gotten approval from the Department of Health and Human Services to impose work requirements. Most of those plans have not yet taken effect. Several other states have asked for federal permission and are awaiting an answer.\n\nAD\n\nEarly last year, Kentucky became the first state to win federal permission to impose \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d requirements that certain able-bodied adults must work or prepare for a job. Boasberg\u2019s ruling in March was his second ruling against those changes.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Boasberg blocked Kentucky from moving forward, ruling that HHS had not considered the effects on poor people needing insurance, including a state forecast that as many as 95,000 residents could lose coverage.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the judge\u2019s first decision, HHS officials reviewed Kentucky\u2019s application again and approved it without changes.\n\nBoasberg is handling two other related lawsuits. In July, he blocked work requirements in New Hampshire shortly before they were to begin. He was assigned a similar lawsuit filed last month against Indiana\u2019s requirements, which went into effect earlier this year with state promises that it would be a less-restrictive version with no one removed from the rolls.\n\nAD\n\nIn briefs for the DC Circuit before Friday\u2019s hearing, lawyers for the Trump administration, pointed out that work requirements have existed for years in other public welfare programs, including for cash assistance and food aid.\n\nAD\n\nThey also argued that Arkansas\u2019 and Kentucky\u2019s requirements are intended as experiments to try to help low-income residents become moreself-reliant through \u201cpersonal responsibility and work.\u201d If they succeed, the government contends, that will save money, \u201cthus preserving scarce Medicaid resources for other needy persons.\u201d\n\nEven if the experiment does not lessen people\u2019s need for Medicaid by leading them into jobs with private coverage, the briefs said, work-related activities tend to improve people\u2019s health and, as a result, could reduce the program\u2019s expenses.\n\nLawyers for Kentucky and Arkansas Medicaid recipients who brought the suits, wrote in their briefs that the HHS secretary \u201ceffectively rewrote the Medicaid Act by regulatory fiat, overturned a half-century of administrative practice, ignored swaths of social science evidence and data, and threatened irreparable harm to the health and welfare of tens of thousands of people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFederal health officials used \u201costrich-like\u201d reasoning, they wrote, by ignoring that the central purpose of Medicaid is to provide medical assistance and that the work rules run counter to that core objective.\u201cTransforming and restructuring the social safety net is a job for Congress, not\u201d the executive branch, they argued.\n\nAD", "description": "Judges echo lower-court opinion that Trump administration failed to consider people losing health coverage", "authors": ["Amy Goldstein", "Reporter Covering Health-Care Policy", "Other Social Policy Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mSOwBSIq0bJTHP5Q42KiU1q-3jg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W3D2KXSPHEI6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
