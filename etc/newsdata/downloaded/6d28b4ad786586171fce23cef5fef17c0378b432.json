Kavanagh (@DrRJKavanagh) September 28, 2019\n\nThe room went silent. Gallardo gave the commissioner a thumbs-up and walked away, as Tamarac Mayor Michelle J. Gomez took back the microphone and reminded everyone present that the city appreciated the work of the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe tense exchange, which in recent days has led to an outpouring of support for the commissioner but also left him facing potential censure and the loss of a crucial police union endorsement, stemmed from an incident that took place in July 2015. At the time, Gelin did not hold elected office.\n\nAD\n\nAs Gelin tells it, he was at a Starbucks in Tamarac, a suburban community located roughly 15 miles from Fort Lauderdale, when he noticed that two homeless men were fighting outside and tried to intervene. Three officers showed up, he told local blog Tamarac Talk, and Gallardo was among them.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor some reason, he came over to me, told me to stop recording with my phone,\u201d Gelin told the site. \u201cI asked him why I needed to stop recording, and he gave me an answer, and then he told me that I needed to back up.\u201d\n\nBy then, a crowd of bystanders had gathered, and Gelin, who is black, asked the deputy why he was the only one being asked to move. At that point, he said, Gallardo placed him under arrest. He told Tamarac Talk that the experience was traumatizing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was disrespected, humiliated, embarrassed, and spent nine hours in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent a significant amount of time and money finding a good attorney and dealing with the court system.\u201d\n\nIn the arrest report, Gallardo described the confrontation differently. Gelin approached him from behind, he claimed, and repeatedly ignored commands to move away from the crime scene. \u201cHe advised he was recording the incident and that he did not have to move,\u201d the deputy wrote, adding that he told Gelin he would need to stand behind some nearby bushes \u201cto provide space for when rescue comes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCourt records show that Gelin was jailed for resisting an officer without violence, but prosecutors declined to press charges. A memo obtained by CBS Miami said that the state attorney\u2019s office reviewed the footage from Gelin\u2019s cellphone, and concluded that \u201ca strong likelihood of conviction is not present as images in the video do not support conviction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMore than four years would pass before the two men crossed paths again.\n\nLast April, Gallardo pulled over a man for a traffic stop and, upon running his name, discovered that he was wanted by Interpol for a murder he had allegedly committed in El Salvador. On Wednesday, when Tamarac honored six members of the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office for their work in the community over the past year, Gallardo was named Deputy of the Month for April.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Gelin had any say in the decision, or if he knew that Gallardo would be honored at the meeting. In a Sunday op-ed for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Steve Feeley, the executive lieutenant at the Tamarac District for the sheriff\u2019s office, wrote that when he told the deputy that he would be receiving an award in front of the commission, Gallardo asked him \u201cif it would be okay\u201d given that he had arrested Gelin several years earlier.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI told Gallardo that we were proud of his work and not to worry about something that happened so long ago,\u201d Feeley wrote. \u201cIt was a decision that I would soon come to regret.\u201d\n\nFeeley, who wrote that Gelin\u2019s remarks were \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and \u201cout of line,\u201d wasn\u2019t alone in criticizing the commissioner. Gomez, the mayor of Tamarac, told CBS Miami that she was looking into whether Gelin violated the city\u2019s civility code and could be penalized for the call-out, which she deemed \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Another city commissioner, Julie Fishman, wrote on Facebook that the awards ceremony had been the wrong time and place to bring up a \u201cpersonal matter from four years ago!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen Gelin returned to the commission\u2019s chambers for a budget hearing that took place later on Wednesday, Tamarac Talk reported, his colleagues refused to acknowledge him and blocked him from speaking.\n\nAD\n\nAt the Tamarac Commission meeting the morning of September 25th, the City was recognizing the great work done by our... Posted by Commissioner Julie Fishman on Thursday, September 26, 2019\n\nMarlon Bolton, the only other black member of the city commission, later expressed sympathy for Gelin, telling the blog that seeing the deputy again likely brought back painful memories.\n\nAD\n\nThough Gallardo hasn\u2019t publicly addressed the dust-up, law enforcement groups leaped to his defense. On Thursday, the Broward County Police Benevolent Association, a union representing officers, announced that it was withdrawing its endorsement of Gelin. The group\u2019s president, Rod Skirvin, said in a statement that the commissioner acted with \u201ca complete lack of respect and common courtesy.\u201d\n\nThe Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office Deputies Association, meanwhile, called for supporters to \u201creconsider\u201d doing business with Gelin in his personal capacity as an employee benefits consultant. \u201cIt appears that city commissioner Gelin has borrowed a page out of the radical left wing Democratic congressional playbook where no matter how good of a job we do, law enforcement is the enemy,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Jeff Bell, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut on social media, the response was markedly different. Hundreds of commenters flooded Gelin\u2019s Facebook page and thanked him for speaking out, with many recalling times when they had been arrested for questionable reasons that later didn\u2019t hold up in court. Director Ava DuVernay, who shared a video of the confrontation on Twitter, urged Gelin to \u201cstay strong.\u201d\n\nAmid the controversy, Gelin met with Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony, who told CBS Miami on Thursday that although the commissioner\u2019s behavior had been \u201cunacceptable,\u201d the two had a productive conversation. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna work together to make sure this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Tony told the station.\n\nGelin, for his part, has emphasized that his outburst shouldn\u2019t be taken as a commentary on law enforcement as a whole.\n\n\u201cI have a great deal of respect for the honest and hard-working police officers,\u201d he told Tamarac Talk. \u201cI also believe there are some police officers that need to be held accountable for bad actions and violations of their own rules.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\"You're a bad police officer, and you don't deserve to be here,\" Tamarac Commissioner Mike Gelin told Joshua Gallardo, a cop with the Broward County Sheriff's Office who was being honored as Deputy of the Month.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EqwNjdkdYxLqbs6SmOLknTo9k78=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7KOUQKBBQVFOLAYSWY5MZHGLB4.PNG", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
