They didn\u2019t even talk to that source, a former Yale classmate named Max Stier, directly. They got his account from two unnamed \u201cofficials\u201d who had spoken to him.\n\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\n\nOn this flimsy basis, the story charged that Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a second drunken dorm party nearly four decades ago. (A similar allegation during his bitter confirmation hearings, by Deborah Ramirez, was never corroborated.) What\u2019s more, the story said Kavanaugh was pushed toward a female student, who inadvertently touched his genitals while trying to swat him away.\n\nWith two hours before airtime, two things changed my mind. One was the tweets by the president, which denounced the allegations as \u201clies,\u201d said Kavanaugh should start suing people and, in a strange aside, said the Justice Department should rescue him. (The Kavanaugh camp, by contrast, chose not to give the story any oxygen by commenting.)\n\nThe second factor was when I got on the phone and was able to get a source to give me the key pages from the book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Education.\u201d\n\nI was stunned to find that the alleged victim -- the woman who would have been exposed as Kavanaugh supposedly pulled down his pants -- not only wouldn\u2019t comment on the incident, but \u201cseveral of her friends said she does not recall it.\u201d\n\nThat eye-popping sentence, which in my view completely undercuts the allegation, appears nowhere in the Times story by the same reporters. The woman presumably would have remembered such a traumatic incident.\n\nOn that basis, I went on the air and harshly criticized the Times story. Many of the journalism controversies I cover have shades of gray; this one was not a close call.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThe Times admitted its mistake yesterday with an editor\u2019s note saying the information about alleged victim (who is named in the book, but who I see no reason to identify) should have been included in the story. But that decision must have been made late, as the correction appears only online, not in the print edition.\n\nThere was little pickup on Sunday of these egregious shortcomings in the Times story, in part because I believe many journalists are reluctant to take on the so-called paper of record, and the Kavanaugh allegations seemed juicy. In fact, many news outlets just repeated the Times account\u2014New charges against Justice Kavanaugh! Trump responds!\u2014without even noting the shaky sourcing.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the book pages I\u2019d obtained acknowledged that at least two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee knew of the allegation last year and did nothing with it. Even some Democrats on the panel, I\u2019ve learned, didn\u2019t think it was worthy of mentioning.\n\nBy the time I was back on the air yesterday morning, I\u2019d gotten the first public comment from the justice\u2019s camp. A source close to Kavanaugh said of the Times piece: \u201cThis was a disgusting effort to smear Justice Kavanaugh to sell a few books. There is nothing new here: The woman who supposedly experienced this incident does not remember it. And Senate Democrats had this information before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed but never said a word about it.\u201d\n\nAnd it turns out another major newspaper passed on the allegations:\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment.\u201d\n\nThere were other details\u2014such as Max Stier being described only as a respected lawyer, but not as someone who defended Bill Clinton against sexual allegations\u2014that felt like tipping the scales.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates\u2014Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Cory Booker and others\u2014seized on the story to demand Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. That, of course, is a legitimate part of the story, but I wonder if they will regret having rushed to judgment before seeing the book. As Mitch McConnell noted on the Senate floor yesterday, even after the correction, none of the 2020 contenders has backed off.\n\nOne final point: I still can\u2019t believe that the Times promoted the story with the following disgusting tweet:\n\n\u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\nHarmless fun?\n\nThe paper\u2019s deputy editorial page editor, James Dao, apologized, calling the posting \u201cclearly offensive.\u201d He\u2019s got that right.", "description": "All the political players were ready to pounce, from the 2020 Democrats calling for Brett Kavanaugh to be run off the Supreme Court to President Trump saying the media were telling lies about him.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086803045001_6086802304001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
