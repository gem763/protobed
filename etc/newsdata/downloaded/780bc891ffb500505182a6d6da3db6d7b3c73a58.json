He gave her a beautiful diamond ring, which turned out to be a bit too big for her finger, so they sent it away to be narrowed.\n\nBy chance, the jeweller lived not far from my mother. So last Friday Tallulah picked her ring up from her grandmother.\n\nAs the train hurtled along, we embarked on our hopeless search. Tallulah found the young guard, and asked him to make an announcement. He thought it would be best to hold off until we\u2019d had a good look [File photo]\n\nMy wife and I were there too, and so was my brother, so it was a happy family occasion, all of us admiring the little diamond sparkling on Tallulah\u2019s finger.\n\nTallulah and my wife and I then went to Haslemere station, in Surrey, to catch the train that Tom was already on, as we were all off to stay with Tom\u2019s mum on the Isle of Wight.\n\nWe boarded the train towards the back, but when Tallulah phoned Tom, it turned out he was in the front carriage, and had saved us seats.\n\nSo off we set along the narrow corridor, through the crowded train, bustling along with our bags and cases, banging our way from carriage to carriage.\n\nMy daughter, Tallulah, recently got engaged to her boyfriend Tom. He gave her a beautiful diamond ring, which turned out to be a bit too big for her finger, so they sent it away to be narrowed [File photo]\n\nEventually we reached Tom. Tallulah delightedly held out her hand to show him the diamond ring. And then the drama began.\n\nThe diamond had vanished. It was one of those moments when you simply can\u2019t believe what you are seeing, or, in this case, not seeing.\n\nSomehow, somewhere, at some point as we bustled from one end of the train to the other, it had fallen out of its setting.\n\nTallulah later said that she had made a conscious decision not to burst into tears, and to concentrate on searching for it.\n\nBut what were the chances of locating a diamond roughly the same size as this \u2018O\u2019 on the floor of a crowded train?\n\nI would compare it to finding a needle in a haystack, but needles are a lot bigger than diamonds, and haystacks a lot shorter than trains.\n\nTallulah delightedly held out her hand to show him the diamond ring. And then the drama began. The diamond had vanished [File photo]\n\nAs the train hurtled along, we embarked on our hopeless search. Tallulah found the young guard, and asked him to make an announcement. He thought it would be best to hold off until we\u2019d had a good look.\n\nHe was worried that, alerted by his announcement, someone might chance upon the diamond and pocket it.\n\nWith that, the admirable guard got down on his knees, lit up the torch on his mobile phone, and started scouring the floor, foot by foot. We joined in, though personally I had given up hope, and just felt very sad.\n\nNot long before Portsmouth, the train\u2019s final destination, the guard finally made his announcement over the tannoy.\n\n\u2018There is a young lady on board who has just got engaged. Unfortunately, the diamond on her ring has fallen off somewhere on this train. Could I ask all our passengers to help look for it?\u2019\n\nThe scene that followed was extraordinary: along the length of the train, virtually all the passengers \u2014 tired commuters, youths with cans of beer in their hands, families on their way to the Isle of Wight \u2014 were all down on their knees, searching for the missing jewel.\n\nIn these days of bitterness and strife, it was a heartening sight, even if, as I suspected, the quest would prove fruitless.\n\nBut suddenly, from quite nearby, came a shout of \u2018Is this it?!\u2019 A young man with a beard had something in his hand. But was he just a joker, having a laugh?\n\nTallulah rushed up to him \u2014 his name was Harvey Eliot \u2014 and he showed her what he had found. Yes, it was the missing diamond! She whooped with delight.\n\nBut what were the chances of locating a diamond roughly the same size as this \u2018O\u2019 on the floor of a crowded train? I would compare it to finding a needle in a haystack, but needles are a lot bigger than diamonds, and haystacks a lot shorter than trains [File photo]\n\nStanding nearby, the guard heard her whooping and announced over the tannoy, \u2018Ladies and gentleman! Good news! The diamond has been found!\u2019\n\nIn response, the hundreds of passengers who had been searching got up from their hands and knees, and clapping and cheering erupted throughout the train.\n\nThe moral of the story is that, however unlikely it may sound, life is sometimes like a Richard Curtis film.\n\nComplete strangers can go out of their way to help one another, items lost may be found, disaster is sometimes followed by triumph and, as in this tale of the diamond in the crisp crumbs on the 6.30pm from Haslemere, you should always hold out hope for a happy ending.", "description": "CRAIG BROWN: The diamond had vanished.
