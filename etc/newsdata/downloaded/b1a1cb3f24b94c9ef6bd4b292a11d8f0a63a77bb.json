He is expecting a ferocious encounter but has not been permitted to meet with the referee on the eve of the match, as is customary during the Six Nations and autumn internationals.\n\nSerene England in hunt for statement World Cup win against Argentina Read more\n\nThe opening rounds of the tournament were dominated by a series of controversial refereeing decisions that led to a remarkable statement from World Rugby in which the officials were publicly criticised.\n\nTournament rules dictate however, that coaches cannot meet with the match officials. \u201cIt is a World Rugby regulation and we follow every World Cup regulation to the letter, that is why I am here today [fulfilling media duties],\u201d said Jones. \u201cSo we won\u2019t see the referee before he comes in before the game and he has bodyguards with him, so we can\u2019t get to him, we just smile and say \u2018hello\u2019.\n\n\u201cI think the refereeing has been as good as we could have hoped and that is all we can expect. It is what it is. It will be what it is tomorrow and we will accept whatever comes out way. We have prepared for the referee and I am sure the referee has prepared for this game so that is all we can hope for.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Jones has urged his side to meet Argentina\u2019s confrontational approach head on as England seek to secure their place in the last eight. The Pumas represent England\u2019s first major test of the tournament after two bonus point victories and Jones has warned his team they must match Argentina\u2019s physicality.\n\n\u201cWhen you play against Argentina, they base their game on the scrum so it\u2019s a test of manlihood, you have to take them on up-front,\u201d said Jones. Whether the word he was reaching for was \u201cmanliness\u201d, or \u201cmanhood\u201d \u2013 or both \u2013 the message was clear. \u201cTo beat Argentina you have to take them on up-front \u2013 scrum, maul, ruck attack, ruck defence. That\u2019s where it will be won.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s rallying cry comes after the former Argentina captain Agustin Creevy had said that Saturday\u2019s match would be \u201clike a war\u201d before highlighting his side\u2019s passion as one of their key weapons. Jones warned against fighting emotional fire with fire but after Friday\u2019s last training session, he urged England to book their place in the knockout stages.\n\n\u201c[The players are] looking fit, fast, brutal and ready to go,\u201d he added. \u201cThey know what to do, now they just have to go out there and do it. Rugby is a tough physical game. We have seen that already at this World Cup. The passion and pride come down to the toughness of your play. But then there\u2019s emotional control. Because when you have a lot of passion and pride, it tends to multiply your strengths and multiply your weaknesses. We obviously want to multiply our strengths and attack their weaknesses.\u201d\n\nEngland have won their past nine matches against Argentina \u2013 a run that stretches back to 2009 \u2013 but while the Pumas arrived at the World Cup having lost all of their Rugby Championship matches, Jones has been impressed by their two tournament outings \u2013 a narrow loss to France and a comfortable victory over Tonga \u2013 to date.\n\nArgentina need to win to have any realistic chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals and Jones said: \u201cThey should have won against France \u2013 all the stats show that they should have won, and they had a good win against Tonga, who aren\u2019t the easiest opponents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the greatest respect for Argentina. We have prepared well for the game and physically we are in the best position we have been in. We were absolutely flying this morning.\n\n\u201cMentally I think we are in a good position and we can\u2019t be seduced by Argentina\u2019s state. We know Argentina play with a lot of pride and a lot of passion and that will be multiplied by the fact they are in a game that is very important to them. The first part of the game is going to be very important. It will be a real test of each team\u2019s courage.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones insists \u2018we have prepared for the referee\u2019 after revealing World Cup rules stop coaches speaking to match officials", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612cdeb4d2c63ca7d90a00de854e721bdad49e02/0_25_4400_2639/master/4400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=76f7c1a50d04947d527a1ed22daff156", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
