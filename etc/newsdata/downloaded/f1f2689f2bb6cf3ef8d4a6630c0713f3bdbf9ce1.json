But adulthood means putting that sweet tooth in check.", "language": "en", "text": "Just one wouldn\u2019t hurt, says the sweet tooth.\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 months since I began a whole food, plant-based diet. I thought giving up meat would be tough. It wasn\u2019t. I thought I\u2019d miss milk and eggs. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s the sweet tooth that\u2019s giving me fits.\n\nSweet memories of a childhood are relived through the consumption of sweets associated with them. Eat candy corn, says the sweet tooth, and remember the cornucopia of candies that I used to haul in on Halloween. The snacking would usually continue until Thanksgiving, when I would gobble down coconut walnut cakes and wash away the crumbs with Christmas eggnog by the gallon. Then I would ring in the New Year with peach cobblers until it was time to binge on Valentine chocolates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf I did that now, every pound I have lost would be back \u2014 along with many more.\n\nIf the sweet tooth was an actual tooth, I\u2019d have to pull it. But it\u2019s a craving, perhaps even an addiction, which must be stopped at the source \u2014 somewhere in the mind.\n\nI have learned to counterattack cravings by reading the label of ingredients on foods. Rule of thumb: If the list contains words that you cannot pronounce, do not eat the product inside.\n\nThe Brach\u2019s classic candy corn ingredients were listed as sugar, corn syrup, confectioner\u2019s glaze (shellac), salt, dextrose, gelatin, sesame oil, artificial flavor, honey, Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 3.\n\nI had to look up the definition of \u201cconfectioner\u2019s glaze.\u201d Here\u2019s how the website Taste for Life, which promotes itself as a natural health resource, put it:\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConfectioners\u2019 glaze, made from shellac, is used by numerous candy companies to add a shiny, smooth finish on their products. But shellac \u2014 or \u2018beetle juice,\u2019 as ABC News calls it \u2014 is made of bug secretions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd there was also the gelatin. Financial and business news website Business Insider reported in October 2017 that gelatin is \u201ca protein made from animal parts like hides and bones.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, a poll by Halloween Express listed 21 states including California, Georgia and Maryland as \u201ccandy corn haters.\u201d\n\nThe Takeout followed up with a story headlined \u201cIs candy corn delicious or Satan\u2019s earwax?\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the National Confectioners Association estimates that about 35 million pounds of candy corn are produced each year, mostly around Halloween. That amounts to about 9 billion pieces. And a poll by the association found that candy corn was the second-most popular Halloween candy in the country \u2014 behind chocolate candies.\n\nAD\n\nI also noticed that there were 22 grams of \u201csugars\u201d in a 31-gram serving of candy corn. These were mostly added sugars. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave a list of such sugars in its 2018 report on nutrition. They included brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar and sucrose.\n\nAD\n\nThe list came with a warning:\n\n\u201cAmericans are eating and drinking too much added sugars which can lead to health problems such as weight gain and obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. To live healthier, longer lives, most need to move more and eat better including getting fewer calories from added sugars.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC also noted that Americans age 6 and older consumed about 14 percent of total daily calories from added sugars in 2003 to 2010. The leading sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, grain-based desserts such as cakes and cookies, candy and dairy desserts such as ice cream.\n\nThe CDC didn\u2019t say don\u2019t eat candy corn. It recommended keeping the intake of added sugars to less than 10 percent of the total daily calories. \u201cFor example, in a 2,000 daily calorie diet no more than 200 calories should come from added sugars,\u201d the CDC report said. Also, drink more water and eat more fruit.\n\nAD\n\nThere are about 110 calories in a 15-piece single serving of candy corn. My sweet tooth calculated that I could eat 30 pieces of candy corn a day. Or, if I doubled my daily caloric intake to 4,000, I could eat 60 pieces a day. And so on until I have emptied the whole 40-ounce bag in a couple of days.\n\nAD\n\nThat certainly wouldn\u2019t do.\n\nDr. Neal Bernard, an adjunct associate professor of medicine at George Washington University and president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, gave me a different way to look at the situation.\n\n\u201cSugar itself is relatively easy for the body to metabolize when consumed in moderate amounts,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, what gets dropped into the Halloween bag is not just sugar but a mixture of sugar and fats. It\u2019s like a sweet Trojan horse with harmful butter, fats and hydrogenated oils lurking within.\u201d\n\nNot to mention bug juice, bone bits and that devil\u2019s earwax.\n\nMy sweet tooth would say that\u2019s what makes it tastes so good.\n\nIt may be time to pull it.\n\nTo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/milloy.\n\nAD", "description": "The CDC recommends cutting the intake of added sugars, but it\u2019s not always easy to do.", "authors": ["Courtland Milloy", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sg4CvT1R3gmcwv8BJqAHNURxZV0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WES5QSX2OAI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
