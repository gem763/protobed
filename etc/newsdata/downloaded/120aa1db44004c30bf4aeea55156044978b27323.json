Show Hide Who is in control in north-eastern Syria? Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus. That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now. On 17 October Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. How did the SDF come to control the region? Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers. Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds? For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey. Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis. What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border? Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region. Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border. How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis? Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria. SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.\n\nOn 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials. It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside. Michael Safi\n\nThe Syrian regime and its Russian allies, who have also moved troops into the contested border zone at the invite of the SDF, and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement, had no immediate comment.\n\nTurkey launched Operation Peace Storm aimed at clearing the SDF from its border on 9 October, triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that US troops would withdraw from the region, which effectively removed the buffer that has stopped Turkey attacking the Kurdish-led force.\n\nAnkara maintains the SDF is indistinguishable from Turkey\u2019s outlawed militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) and has long been angered by US support for the group during the five-year-long campaign to defeat Islamic State.\n\nThe offensive has been widely condemned for triggering a humanitarian crisis and risking the re-emergence of Isis amid the chaos. At least 300,000 people have fled their homes in the fighting and at least 71 people have been killed in north-east Syria, according to the UN and a human rights monitor. Over the border in Turkey, 20 civilians have been killed in counterattacks.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said on Friday it was collecting information with regard to possible use of chemical weapons in the fighting.\n\nPlay Video 1:13 Mike Pence: US and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria \u2013 video\n\nA statement released by Washington and Ankara following the ceasefire talks did not define any changes to the size and scope of Turkey\u2019s proposed safe zone, which Turkish officials have previously said should be 20 miles (32km) deep and stretch 270 miles from the contested town of Manbij to the Iraqi border.\n\nThe statement also reiterated the US understanding of Turkey\u2019s need for a safe zone, which will be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish armed forces\u201d after the Kurdish withdrawal, implying that Ankara still intends to occupy the entire area.\n\nKurdish military leaders and politicians have repeatedly rejected the Turkish plan, which would encompass major Kurdish towns and parts of the main highway.\n\n\u201cOur people did not want this war. We welcome the ceasefire, but we will defend ourselves in the event of any attack \u2026 Ceasefire is one thing and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves. We will not accept the occupation of northern Syria,\u201d the Kurdish political leader Saleh Muslim told local television.\n\nErdo\u011fan is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Sochi on Tuesday, where it is expected further concrete talks on the size of Turkey\u2019s planned buffer zone will take place.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Artillery fire and ground clashes reported in violation of US-brokered five-day truce", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6e1e49add9dd7c99b3dd58fa284a8e45fb1e97/0_153_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c9f73786a133ec7a906fd4c510a1dfa", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
