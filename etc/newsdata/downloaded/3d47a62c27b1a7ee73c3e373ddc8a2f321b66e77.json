The S&P 500 advanced 1.1% to 2937.78, its highest close in nearly four weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3% to 7976.88.\n\nStocks in the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong jumped as the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she would formally withdraw the extradition bill that sparked monthslong demonstrations that have hurt the territory's economy. The Hang Seng Index rose 3.9% Wednesday, its biggest one-day gain since November.\n\nThe British pound, which has been hammered in recent sessions over concerns the U.K. could leave the European Union without a deal, gained 1.4% against the dollar after Parliament the night before took steps toward preventing a no-deal Brexit. The U.K.'s FTSE was up 0.6%.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, Italy's FTSE MIB gained 1.6% after two rival parties agreed to form a coalition government, staving off the threat of fresh elections. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.9%.\n\nThere has been a material reduction in risk in Hong Kong and Britain, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network.\n\n\"Markets have been kind of pricing in the worst, and now people are thinking, 'Maybe the world isn't ending just yet,'\" he said.\n\nTechnology stocks were among the best performers, with Intel rallying 4.1% to $48.92 and Apple rising 1.7% to $209.19. The tech sector has outperformed the broader market this year, but was battered by the U.S.-China trade fight last month.\n\nWednesday's broad gains for stocks came despite a backdrop of weak global economic data. A measure of factory activity in the U.S. slipped Tuesday, weighing on major indexes.\n\nStocks have been supported by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials suggesting that they are open to further cuts in interest rates. New York Fed leader John Williams said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank will \"act as appropriate\" to keep the economy moving forward.\n\nNew trade data showed a mixed picture on the U.S. economy, with a healthy consumer sector helping offset weakness in manufacturing. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services decreased to $53.99 billion in July, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\n\nThe data showed a drop in imports of capital goods used by businesses during the first seven months of the year. But imports of consumer goods rose in that period, reflecting the resilience of American household spending despite slowing global growth, volatile financial markets and the specter of tariffs on goods imported from China.\n\nOil rallied on Wednesday, benefiting from perceptions of reduced risk to the global economy. U.S. crude futures surged 4.3% to $56.26 a barrel.\n\nPrices of U.S. government bonds, which have rallied amid the market turmoil of recent weeks, ticked up. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.456%, its lowest settle in more than three years. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nGold also continued to rally. Futures on the precious metal rose 0.3% to $1550.30 a troy ounce, their highest close since 2013.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of other currencies, fell 0.5%.\n\nSteven Russolillo contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com and William Horner at william.horner@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 04, 2019 18:11 ET (22:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
