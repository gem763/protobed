Proud to stand with @UAW to demand fair wages and benefits for their members. America's workers deserve better,\" former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted early Monday. Biden, a longtime supporter of labor unions, has already won the endorsement of the firefighters union.\n\nThe auto workers walked off the job Monday, shutting down 33 manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., as well as 22 parts distribution warehouses, when contract negotiations failed after a midnight deadline.\n\nI am proud to support the @UAW workers who are standing up to the greed of GM. Our message to GM is a simple one: End the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve. https://t.co/nAQoeX82oz \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nAnother ardent union ally, Senator Bernie Sanders, sent a message to GM directly: \"End the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve.\" Sanders' message throughout his presidential campaign has been one that focuses on lifting up working-class Americans. He laid out a plan last month to strengthen unions, with the goal of doubling union membership in his first term as president.\n\nAuto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security. I stand with @UAW as they strike to get what they deserve, and urge GM to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. https://t.co/VRmL7VzSzt \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 16, 2019\n\n\"Auto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security. I stand with @UAW as they strike to get what they deserve, and urge GM to come to the table and negotiate in good faith,\" urged Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nSouth Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg echoed the Massachusetts Democrat, saying GM should \"do right by the workers who fuel its profits.\"\n\nI'm proud to stand with the hardworking members of @UAW in their fight for fair wages, health care, and job security. @GM should do right by the workers who fuel its profits. https://t.co/3XF8OswRRn \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 16, 2019\n\nKamala Harris noted that Americans don't have to be union members to have benefited from organized labor.\n\n\"Unions have organized, marched, negotiated, and gone on strike \u2014 all to ensure dignity and rights for working people,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe auto workers union has complained that GM has not made much movement over months of talks over the new four-year contract. Workers are demanding fair wages, affordable health care, and better profit sharing. The automaker said it has already made substantial offers, including higher wages, higher profit sharing, health benefits, and $7 billion in factory investments that will create new jobs. GM has also offered an $8,000 payment to each worker once the new contract is ratified.\n\nGM would like to see the auto workers pick up more of their health insurance costs. Currently, auto workers pay about 4% of their insurance costs, while employees at other kinds of companies nationwide pay about 34%.\n\nThe auto maker also wants to shrink the wage gap with foreign automakers, who pay about $50 per hour in wages and benefits, compared to GM, which pays about $63 in wages and benefits.\n\nIn a statement, GM said that \"it is disappointing that the UAW leadership has chosen to strike.\"\n\nTalks were scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. ET Monday.\n\nWhile Democrats have encouraged the workers to continue their right to strike, President Trump tweeted that the two parties should just make a deal.\n\nHere we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\n\"Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal!\" he urged.\n\nAnalysts agree a prolonged walkout could hurt the overall U.S. economy.\n\nThis is the first UAW national strike since a two-day walkout in 2007.", "description": "Many of the top-tier presidential candidates voiced their support of those picketing outside GM factories nationwide.", "authors": ["Emily Tillett", "Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter", "Video Editor For Cbs News Digital"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/16/41a60c48-191e-498e-8e4a-b84f46e478fb/thumbnail/1200x630/716c2593f4bc9f2864dd7d361c3852cf/gettyimages-1168651144-594x594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
