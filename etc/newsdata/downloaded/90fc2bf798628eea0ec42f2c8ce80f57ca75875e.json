Master classes in beauty were taught by Tatcha\u2019s Vicky Tsai, celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta, and full brow fanatic Kristie Streicher, and brands like Drybar, Benefit, and Living Proof offered free services.\n\nObviously, the most Instagrammable moments were popular \u2014 like the full-face LED masks, which give you an alarming red glow \u2014 but customization was also a major draw. So were the limited-edition items, like Fenty\u2019s 42 Glossy Posse Set, a collection of mini Gloss Bomb lip glosses that won\u2019t be in stores until October. Urban Decay gave Sephoria attendees the opportunity to get its new Naked Honey palette before everyone else. Korean beauty brand Innisfree also made its debut at the event, announcing Sephora as the brand\u2019s exclusive, global specialty retailer.\n\nThe annual event gives Sephora a kind advantage over competitors like Ulta and Amazon. Not only do attendees get to fully immerse themselves in all their favorite brands and products, but they get to connect with each other. \u201cMeeting other people in the beauty community is a cool aspect to Sephoria,\u201d says Sephora CEO Deborah Yeh. \u201cYou get to say, \u2018I had a great time, I met some cool people, I love beauty even more, and I want to share with other people.\u2019 It\u2019s super simple; it\u2019s like Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, right?\u201d\n\nSee Sephoria in all its candy-colored glory below.\n\nPhoto: Presley Ann/Getty Images for Sephora\n\nPhoto: Presley Ann/Getty Images for Sephora\n\nPhoto: Presley Ann/Getty Images for Sephora\n\nA Sephoria attendee tries on a Dr Dennis Gross SpectraLite LED mask.
