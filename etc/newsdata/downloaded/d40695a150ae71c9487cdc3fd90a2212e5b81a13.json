Lo turned heads on the Grammy red carpet back in 2000 when she stepped out in the Versace jungle green dress with a plunging neckline. It caused such a stir online, Google created an image search for the look.\n\n\"I really didn\u2019t think about it,\" Lopez said of her Grammy awards look, back in 2000. \"I didn't think it was all that risqu\u00e9, to be honest. The dress was just provocative enough to make people interested.\"\n\nThe updated version of her Versace look is sleeveless and maintains its dramatic neckline, but shows even more skin with cutouts at the waist.\n\nLopez's fashion choices aren't the only thing causing a buzz this year.
