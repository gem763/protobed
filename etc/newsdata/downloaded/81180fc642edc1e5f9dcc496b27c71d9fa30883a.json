They admit they found no evidence to support the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford or Debbie Ramirez, although they say their \u201cgut reaction\u201d to the allegations is that they are true. They generously concede that their \u201cgut\u201d tells them that Michael Avennati client Julie Swetnick\u2019s claims are not true, citing the lack of corroboration.\n\nThe \u201clack of corroboration\u201d standard was unevenly held to by the authors. Blasey Ford\u2019s four witnesses all denied knowledge of the party at which her alleged assault took place. Ramirez went from telling Ronan Farrow \u201cI don\u2019t have any stories about Brett Kavanaugh and sexual misconduct,\u201d to telling friends of an incident for which she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be sure\u201d Kavanaugh was involved, to now being the centerpiece of the Pogebrin and Kelly book. Ramirez also had no eyewitness support for her story that allegedly took place at a well-attended party, even after friendly media outlets contacted some 75 classmates trying to find corroboration. Both women had the support of many friends and activists, however.\n\nThe only supposedly new claim made in the book isn\u2019t new and comes from Democrat attorney Max Stier, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s with whom he has a long and contentious history. In the words of the Yale Daily News, they were \u201cpitted\u201d against each other during the Whitewater investigation in the 1990s when Kavanaugh worked for Independent Counsel Ken Starr. Stier defended President Bill Clinton, whose legal troubles began when a woman accused him of exposing himself to her in hotel room she had been brought to. Clinton later settled with the woman for $850,000 and, due to a contempt of court citation for misleading testimony, ended up losing his law license for five years. Stier worked closely with David Kendall, who went on to defend Hillary Clinton against allegations of illegally handling classified information. Kavanaugh\u2019s reference to his opponents being motivated by \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons\u201d met with befuddlement by liberal media, despite the surprisingly large number of Clinton-affiliated attorneys who kept popping up during his confirmation hearings.\n\nIn any case, Stier\u2019s claim, which even two Democratic senators\u2019 offices didn\u2019t find particularly worthwhile, was that he had seen an inebriated Kavanaugh, pants-down, at a freshman-year party. Stier\u2019s claim to the staffers, we\u2019re told, was that other people at the party put Kavanaugh\u2019s genitalia into the hands of a classmate. Another unnamed person alleged said that he or she might have remembered hearing that the female student had transferred out of her college because of Kavanaugh, \u201cthough exactly why was unclear.\u201d\n\nThe reporters, who describe Democrats in glowing terms and Republicans otherwise, say that Stier is a \u201crespected thought leader\u201d in the defense of the federal bureaucracy. They don\u2019t mention his history of working for the Clintons. As for the victim? They say she \u201chas refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.\u201d\n\nTo repeat: Several of her friends said she does not recall it.\n\nSo to summarize, the only new claim in the new book is that a Democratic attorney told two senators that he saw an incident where a third party allegedly did something to Kavanaugh and the young woman. In their book, the authors are upset that this claim didn\u2019t lead to a massive FBI investigation, although they don\u2019t explain why they think it should have.\n\nPogebrin and Kelly left the victim\u2019s denial out of their New York Times story. It is unclear why the reporters and editors allowed the story to be published without this salient fact that they conceded, albeit briefly, in their own book.", "description": "New York Times airs a claim from a Democrat attorney, but they fail to note alleged victim denies memory of the incident.", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10156306814_a2b7ba9b1b_k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
