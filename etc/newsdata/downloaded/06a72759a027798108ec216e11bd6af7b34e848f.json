But his greatest victory, he says, was securing the lead in David Chase\u2019s big screen Sopranos prequel\n\n\u2018I would say a good percentage of the roles I\u2019ve done have only come to me after somebody dropped out at the last minute,\u201d says Alessandro Nivola. I assume he is being self-deprecating, but he assures me he is being honest. He is in London to talk about The Art of Self-Defense, a black comedy that holds toxic masculinity in its satirical crosshairs. \u201cThis one, I\u2019m sure somebody did drop out because I was offered it a week before it started.\u201d\n\nAt 47, Nivola is in the midst of a particularly fruitful period of his career. He has been a working actor since he left Yale in the mid-90s, but the last few years have taken him to a new level. There was Selma, You Were Never Really Here and a remarkable turn in Disobedience. On television, he co-starred with Robert De Niro in the Bernie Madoff film The Wizard of Lies and played Lee Berger in Channel 4\u2019s adaptation of Chimerica.\n\nThis woman marched in and said she was there to make me a black belt in 24 hours\n\nIf, as he says, he is usually the second choice, how is that for his ego? \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a shit, really. If I think it\u2019s a great job, I\u2019m only too happy that the other idiot decided he had better things to do.\u201d\n\nNivola is an excellent and effusive storyteller. In The Art of Self-Defense, Jesse Eisenberg plays Casey, a loner who is beaten up by a gang and takes refuge in a karate class run by Nivola\u2019s absurdly macho, ultra-violent Sensei. \u201cI had just put my bags down in the hotel room and there was this loud knock on my door,\u201d Nivola says, of his last-minute arrival on the project. \u201cI opened it up and this very strong woman just pushed me out of the way and marched into my room \u2013 and announced that she was there to make me a black belt in 24 hours.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a trailer for The Art of Self-Defense, starring Alessandro Nivola and Jesse Eisenberg\n\nHe didn\u2019t quite become a black belt, but it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI mean, look, it was all for comic effect, the stuff that I had to do.\u201d For a long time, the audience is not quite sure who or what Sensei is. \u201cBut I felt like the more convincing I could be, the more this particular deadpan style of humour would work. You\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re supposed to laugh or be horrified or both at the same time.\u201d\n\nPeople often assume that Nivola is English. In fact, he was born and raised in Boston, US, but spent a good portion of his early career doing British films; and he is married to Emily Mortimer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s partly because I have a European name,\u201d he adds. In the early days, his agent would be asked if he could do an American accent. He gets called Alejandro a lot. \u201cEveryone assumes it\u2019s Spanish. My father-in-law [the late barrister and author John Mortimer] called me Alfonso for the first three years that I was with Emily.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat may have been intentional.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nivola as Sensei in The Art of Self-Defense. Photograph: Bleecker Street\n\nWhen we meet, he has just finished shooting The Many Saints of Newark, the film prequel to The Sopranos, in which he plays Dickie Moltisanti, father of Christopher. In this instance, the name worked in his favour. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that my being the son of an Italian immigrant was a big factor in being offered that role by David [Chase, creator of The Sopranos] and I know it really mattered to him.\u201d\n\nNivola brings the conversation back to The Sopranos film at every turn. He loves to research a role, and The Many Saints of Newark, which begins in 1967 and moves through the early 70s, provided a banquet of opportunity. \u201cA friend\u2019s friend was a priest in Newark. He had grown up in that neighbourhood and introduced me to all kinds of people there. You know, the connection between the mob and the church is notorious,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\nHe starts to talk about the famous Newark mob boss, Richie \u201cThe Boot\u201d Boiardo. \u201cI think Coppola may have based some of Marlon Brando\u2019s character in The Godfather on this guy,\u201d he explains. The priest took Nivola to one of the Catholic churches that had been built by Italian immigrants. \u201cHe showed me this incredible stained glass window and said, \u2018Go and look up close.\u2019\n\n\u201cI looked and it says, \u2018Gift of Mr and Mrs Ruggiero Boiardo\u2019.\u201d He beams. \u201cThat\u2019s Richie the Boot!\u201d\n\nHe flicks through photos on his phone. \u201cThe weirdest thing happened,\u201d he begins. \u201cThe day I got offered this job, my brother sent me this screenshot from an episode of The Sopranos where Tony is in Naples, and he\u2019s in these underground catacombs. In the back of this photo was this sculpture. And this sculpture turns out to be made by my grandfather.\u201d\n\nNivola\u2019s grandfather was the sculptor Costantino Nivola, and there had been a travelling exhibition of his work when The Sopranos happened to be shooting in Naples. \u201cI told David after they\u2019d offered me the job and he just couldn\u2019t believe it. He thought it was divine intervention or something.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nivola with his wife, English actor Emily Mortimer. Photograph: Greg Allen/Invision/AP\n\nNivola also met some real-life mobsters. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t have any dirt on anybody, but I had the opportunity to talk to somebody who introduced me to somebody else, who introduced me to somebody else and, finally, I was sitting at a table with a bunch of guys who really were living this life. Trying to determine whether these guys are imitating the movies or the movies are imitating them is such a tricky thing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the person who made the introduction told him not to mention The Sopranos because he was worried they would start to play to type. \u201cThey just thought I was a friend of his. But if those real guys had been in a movie, you would have thought it was a send-up of a mob movie.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nivola as photojournalist Lee Berger in the Channel 4 drama Chimerica. Photograph: Playground/\u00a9 Playground\n\nI ask about James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael, playing the young Tony Soprano, but Nivola starts to worry about how much he can say. \u201cI just don\u2019t want David to kill me,\u201d he reasons. \u201cI can maybe give you a little bit of a feel for it. Dickie was a kind of mentor figure to Tony as a young guy. I think Tony and everyone else in that neighbourhood saw this guy as a perfect man and the story of this movie really reveals otherwise.\u201d\n\nThere are \u201cbig Greek themes running through it\u201d, and it is set against the backdrop of the late-60s race riots. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the fabric of the story, the relations between the Italian-American community and the black community in Newark at that time. The main thing is that this character is, like all of David\u2019s heroes, incredibly complex, morally complex, and just full of kind of every colour that you could imagine.\u201d He sighs happily. \u201cIt was something I could have spent years working on.\u201d\n\nNow he is thinking about what comes next. He is working on a film with Ethan Hawke, about the fractious relationship between the 1950s vocal duo, the Louvin Brothers. Phil Morrison, who directed Nivola in Junebug, is in line to direct. From an outside perspective, it looks as if his career is the best it has ever been. \u201cYeah,\u201d he nods, smiling. Then he turns back to The Sopranos once again. \u201cI had been feeling over these past several years that something was brewing, but I never could have guessed that whatever the thing was would be as great as that.\u201d\n\nThe Art of Self-Defense is released on download on 4 November", "description": "Cast in The Art of Self-Defense after another actor dropped out, Nivola had 24 hours to learn black belt karate.
