(AP) - Injuries in the defensive backfield just keep on coming for the Baltimore Ravens, who likely will play without safety DeShon Elliott the rest of the season.\n\nCoach John Harbaugh said Monday that Elliott suffered a serious knee injury in Sunday\u2019s 23-17 victory over the Bengals. It occurred late in the fourth quarter when Elliott collided with teammate Justin Bethel during Cincinnati\u2019s final drive.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to be out for the year, unfortunately,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s just way worse than we thought it was going to be. So we\u2019ll have to find a replacement there and move forward.\u201d\n\nIn addition, cornerback Maurice Canady - who had a team-high nine tackles Sunday - hurt his hamstring and is \u201cprobably day to day,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nThe Ravens lost cornerback Tavon Young to a neck injury in August and cornerback Jimmy Smith hasn\u2019t played since the opener because of a sprained knee. Last week, Tony Jefferson was put on injured reserve with a torn ACL.\n\nHarbaugh did not rule out the possibility of going outside the organization for help.\n\nInjuries aside, the Ravens (4-2) are off to a solid start in their bid to repeat as AFC North champions. They hold a two-game lead over Pittsburgh and Cleveland and will be looking to extend that gap with a victory Sunday against the host Seattle Seahawks (5-1).\n\n\u201cThe next game is critical,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt won\u2019t make or break us, but it will go a long way in setting us up for where we\u2019re heading down the road and what kind of season we\u2019re going to have.\u201d\n\nAfter facing the Seahawks, the Ravens have a bye before hosting New England on Nov. 3.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe offense put up 497 yards against the Bengals, including a whopping 269 on the ground. Quarterback Lamar Jackson ran for 152 yards and passed for 236.\n\nEven without Jackson\u2019s rushing yardage, Baltimore got 117 yards from its trio of running backs.\n\n\u201cYou usually have a lot more passing yards in this league than running yards,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat makes us a little bit different.\u201d\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nWith all that yardage against a winless team, the Ravens should have blown out Cincinnati. But tight end Mark Andrews fumbled while trying to hurdle an opponent and Baltimore was flagged 10 times for 81 yards.\n\n\u201cWe had some penalties - way too many penalties - and we had the turnovers,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThose are the things that we\u2019re going to continue to work on.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJackson did it all Sunday, zigging and zagging through the Bengals for his third career 100-yard game on the ground.\n\n\u201cHe can hit the edge and run like no quarterback I have ever played against,\u201d Cincinnati safety Shawn Williams said. \u201cWhen he steps outside the pocket, he is as good as anyone. And he also made throws outside the pocket.\u201d\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLeft guard Bradley Bozeman was called for four penalties, including a block in the back and a hold.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTwo key starters, rookie receiver Marquise Brown and middle linebacker Patrick Onwuasor, were inactive with ankle injuries.\n\nThis week, they\u2019ll play if they can practice, Harbaugh said.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n1,000 - Justin Tucker reached the 1,000-point mark faster than any kicker in NFL history.\n\nPlaying in his 118th game, Tucker set the record with a second-quarter field goal.\n\n\u201cI find the coolest thing about reaching this milestone is that I get to share it with Sam (Koch) who has held for every single one of those points, and Morgan (Cox), who has snapped for almost all of them,\u201d Tucker said.\n\nBOLDIN FAREWELL\n\nReceiver Anquan Boldin, who played three seasons with Baltimore and helped the team win the 2012 Super Bowl, retired Monday as a Raven.\n\nBoldin played with Arizona from 2002-09 before signing as a free agent with the Ravens. He had six catches for 104 yards and a touchdown in the Super Bowl vs. San Francisco.\n\nDuring the following offseason, however, he was traded after the season in a salary-cap move by Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI was brought in to help bring a championship to this city. I accomplished that job,\u201d Boldin said at his retirement ceremony, which was attended by his family, Harbaugh, former general manager Ozzie Newsome, current GM Eric DeCosta and team president Dick Cass.\n\nBoldin also played for San Francisco and Detroit.\n\nNEXT STEP\n\nFacing the Seahawks will be a difficult challenge for the Ravens, beginning with containing quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made plays with his arms, with his legs, with his head,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI think he\u2019s the heart and soul of their offense, at least. Probably their team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Injuries in the defensive backfield just keep on coming for the Baltimore Ravens, who likely will play without safety DeShon Elliott the rest of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/bengals_ravens_football_37558_c0-156-3745-2340_s1200x700.jpg?ab40b58575453bf83f148f9dbd39f727ae1160d0", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
