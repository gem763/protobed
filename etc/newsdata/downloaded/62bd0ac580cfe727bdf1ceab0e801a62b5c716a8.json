Leaders from around the world will be attending the event.\n\n\"The eyes of the world will be on them,\" she said. \"We will make them hear us.\"\n\n\"We are doing this to wake the leaders up. We are doing this to get them to act. We deserve a safe future and we demand a safe future. Is that really too much to ask?\n\n\"Right now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action then we will.\n\n\"It should not be that way. We should not be the ones who are fighting for the future. And yet, here we are.\"\n\nShe finished her speech on a powerful and optimistic note.\n\n\"Together and united we are unstoppable.\n\n\"This is what people power looks like. We will rise to the challenge. We will hold those most responsible for this crisis accountable and we will make the world leaders act.\n\n\"We can and we will.\n\n\"And if you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us then we have some very bad news for you.\n\n\"Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming, whether they like it or not.\"", "description": "Demonstrations led by schoolchildren took place in hundreds of cities around the globe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.0/bbc_news_logo.png"}
