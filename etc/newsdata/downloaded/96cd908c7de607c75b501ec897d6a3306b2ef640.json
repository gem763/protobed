Despite sizable disruptions in the oil and money markets, faith in consumer spending and hopes for a trade deal with China have held stocks steady.\n\nMarkets were similarly quiet the previous week, ending a five-week stretch of volatility when the S&P averaged a daily move of at least 0.7% as investors followed the tit-for-tat trade developments between the U.S. and China.\n\nAlthough the recent market stability has been a relief for investors still recovering from August's turbulence, analysts say the pause also reflects skepticism that stocks can surge to new highs. The lull for major indexes contrasts with moves in other assets such as bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note posted its largest weekly rise in six years during the week ended Sept. 13, just days after approaching a record low. Yields rise as bond prices fall.\n\nThe swings come as the U.S.-China trade war has dented business spending and manufacturing activity, and many project lukewarm earnings for large companies in the quarters ahead. Although steady consumer spending has supported U.S. growth, a slowdown in global trade has made some investors wary that weakness overseas will eventually spread and limit the stock market's gains.\n\n\"We don't have dynamic news globally to drive us higher,\" said Ed Cofrancesco, president and chief executive of International Assets Advisory. \"It's a limiting factor.\"\n\nMr. Cofrancesco said his firm is still overweight on U.S. stocks -- meaning it holds a higher position than the benchmark it tracks -- because of the gap between economic growth domestically and in the rest of the world.\n\n\"We have never been as much in U.S. stocks as we have been the last year or two,\" he said.\n\nIn another example of a sideways trading pattern, the broad equity gauge has closed up or down less than 0.75% in each of the past 12 sessions, the longest such stretch since the end of July. Such streaks have become common in recent months with investors increasingly uncertain about the global economic outlook.\n\nDevelopments around coming talks between the world's two largest economies or data points that shift expectations for interest rates could break the recent lull, analysts say. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in recent months last week, but officials were divided on where rates should be in the future given ongoing trade uncertainty.\n\nAs the U.S. and China went back and forth with trade barbs last month, an index of global economic policy uncertainty developed by professors at Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago rose to its highest level ever. Although the two countries have calmed markets by dialing back threats and agreeing to talks next month, some analysts are skeptical the discussions will yield progress that fuels a pickup in economic activity.\n\nLast week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its forecast for global growth this year to 2.9%, which would mark the slowest pace in a decade. And a survey of purchasing managers released Monday showed signs that weakness is spreading to Germany's services sector, indicating Europe's largest economy is on the brink of recession.\n\nAt the same time, the combination of better-than-feared economic data points and cautious optimism about trade has prevented the sharp selloffs that punctuated trading in August, when fears about a recession pushed investors toward bonds, gold and other haven assets. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which tracks expected swings in the S&P 500, has fallen about 21% so far this month.\n\nThe lull has given some analysts renewed confidence in the longest-ever bull market because September has historically been one of the worst months for stocks.\n\nEven though trading appears placid on the surface, market watchers are struggling to determine whether sharp moves in certain sectors reflect optimism about the economy or an unwinding of crowded recession bets from last month. That is another reason investors say coming economic data points will be so crucial.\n\nShares of beaten-down small-cap companies and banks that are sensitive to the outlook for U.S. growth have rebounded alongside bond yields this month. The rise in yields has pushed up shares of such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co., which has risen 8.2% in September, because climbing yields tend to boost lending profitability.\n\nOutsize swings in oil prices and shares of energy companies have also sent conflicting signals about the global economy following attacks in Saudi Arabia that have disrupted production for the world's largest crude exporter. Some analysts use crude as an economic indicator because it is crucial to transportation and shipping.\n\nOil prices have generally stayed in a narrow range in recent months, with tariffs prompting downgrades to demand expectations. Some investors also see trade uncertainty limiting moves in commodities moving forward, just as they do with equities.\n\n\"Unless we get more clarity on that front, I don't think we're going to see a massive breakout in either direction\" for stocks, said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager and head of multiasset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here .\n\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 24, 2019 08:14 ET (12:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
