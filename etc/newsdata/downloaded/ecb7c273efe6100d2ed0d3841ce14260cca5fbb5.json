Individuals at the meeting who support the amendment immediately challenged Hill and said his figures were incorrect.\n\nHill issued a correction over the weekend via Twitter. He said he verified with the bureau that the statistics he used only counted individuals in the D.C. jail. The figures, however, did not account for the thousands of inmates in federal prisons around the nation who committed crimes in the District. Because the District does not have a prison, convicted individuals are sent to federal institutions throughout the United States.\n\nIn his response, Hill wrote the statistics he used \u201csignificantly undercount the total number of D.C. residents incarcerated either in a local or federal facility. We apologize for this mistake.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the amendment have argued that the District has among the highest incarceration rates in the country.\n\nAttendees also noted another error that was made at the meeting. When someone asked why federal prosecutors were against the District amendment but supported a sentence reduction for \u201980s drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III, Wendy Pohlhaus, executive assistant U.S. attorney for external affairs, responded that her office was not seeking a sentence reduction. \u201cThat was Karl Racine.\u201d\n\nKarl A. Racine, the District\u2019s attorney general, has not issued an opinion on whether Edmond\u2019s life-without-parole sentence should be reduced. On Friday, Pohlhaus\u2019s office asked a federal judge to reduce Edmond\u2019s sentence to 40 years.\n\n\u201cWhy are they getting basic facts wrong?\u201d Nazgol Ghandnoosh, 39, asked after Hill issued his correction.\n\nThe D.C. Council is expected to vote on the amendment this fall.\n\nJessie K. Liu, U.S. attorney for the District, spoke briefly at Thursday\u2019s meeting. In August, her office distributed a news release that suggested more than 500 inmates who were convicted of violent crimes would be eligible for early release under the amendment. Supporters of the bill said Liu\u2019s position was misleading because it left out how a D.C. Superior Court judge had to review each inmate\u2019s application, and how there were more than a dozen criteria that must be met other than being between 18 and 24 at the time of their crime.\n\n\u201cThey have been putting out misleading information and these are just some of the most recent examples,\u201d Ghandnoosh said.", "description": "Supporters of early-release amendment highlight two errors prosecutors made at community meeting.", "authors": ["Keith L.
