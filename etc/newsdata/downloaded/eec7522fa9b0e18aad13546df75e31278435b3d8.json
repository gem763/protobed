That money would afford them wiggle room in the schedule if issues pop up.\n\nThe bottom line: NASA needs a new spacesuit for its next mission, but it's unclear if the agency will have the Congressional support it needs to deliver the suit well ahead of the 2024 deadline.", "description": "\"Anything you do just feels like working in your regular shirtsleeves.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/rB-EvhteJjd5IeVr6noVtzzvfFk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/23/1563901845273.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-23"}
