But imagine that we could summon his shade and ask, \u201cJudge, did you intend for your amendment to protect gay men, lesbians, and transgender people from job discrimination? Did your colleagues in the House?\u201d\n\nI suspect he\u2019d say, \u201cI did not understand a word you said. Can I go now?\u201d\n\nSuppose we decide that Smith\u2019s \u201cintention\u201d in introducing the amendment was to protect white women; suppose we conclude that nobody in Congress in 1964 imagined that Title VII might one day be applied to protect LGBTQ people. Would we then be required to read \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d to mean \u201cbecause she is a woman\u201d or even \u201cbecause she is a white woman\u201d? Of course not. The text says \u201cbecause of sex,\u201d and its application starts there.\n\nHow the Supreme Court reads that text this fall will make a huge difference in the lives of people all over the country. If a majority concludes that discrimination by sexual orientation or transgender status is discrimination \u201cbecause of sex,\u201d thousands of LGBTQ people will be protected on the job; if the Court rejects that argument, many stand to lose their livelihoods.\n\nIs discrimination because of sexual orientation, or gender identity, discrimination because of sex, or because of some other thing altogether? In a trio of cases to be argued in October, employers, supported by the Trump Administration, insist that the two things are unconnected. The three cases are:\n\nBostock v. Clayton County, in which an employee of a Georgia county was penalized and dismissed after he joined a gay-themed softball league and asked other players to volunteer for work in the court system; the Eleventh Circuit held that this was not an act of discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d\n\nAltitude Express v. Zarda, in which a skydiving instructor was fired because, while strapping himself to a woman going up for a first jump, he reassured her that he was gay and thus not engaged in groping; the Second Circuit upheld the instructor\u2019s sex-discrimination claim.\n\nHarris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in which a funeral home employee was dismissed after announcing that she was transitioning to female and would henceforth wear the company\u2019s uniform for female, not male, employees; the federal EEOC supported the employee, and the Sixth Circuit agreed.\n\nThus, the lower courts need the Supreme Court to settle the question. That resolution will reveal a good deal about the fidelity of the conservatives to a theory several of them espouse. That theory, pioneered by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is called \u201ctextualism.\u201d To give a simplified summary, textualism holds that judges should not guess at the \u201clegislative intent\u201d behind a statute\u2014or even research it by consulting the committee reports and floor speeches that accompanied its passage. The very words of the statute are the only thing that became law with its passage, textualists argue. \u201cThe text is the law, and it is the text that must be observed,\u201d Scalia wrote in his influential 1997 book, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law. In the same book, he wrote, \u201cA text should not be construed strictly and it should not be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means.\u201d", "description": "If a majority of the Supreme Court concludes that discrimination against LGBTQ people is discrimination \u201cbecause of sex,\u201d thousands of people will be protected on the job.
