Spicer and Arnold danced the Viennese Waltz on Monday, earning 21 points from the judges:\n\nThe bottom two are determined by both judges\u2019 scores and votes from supporters. That considered, the duo ultimately secured a spot in the next round and Spicer maintained his streak of avoiding the bottom two altogether.\n\nMany leftists took to Twitter to express their dismay at Spicer\u2019s continued success on the show, calling his supporters \u201cugly racists.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally wish those ugly racists would STOP voting for that 5\u20195\u201d can\u2019t-dance-for-shit clown Sean Spicer,\u201d one user wrote:\n\nReally wish those ugly racists would STOP voting for that 5\u20195\u201d can\u2019t-dance-for-shit clown Sean Spicer\u2026 #DWTS \u2014 heavy hitter (@w7tchywoman) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cThe racists at it again saving Sean spicer and booting off people who deserve to be there,\u201d another added:\n\nThe racists at it again saving Sean spicer and booting off people who deserve to be there #dwts \u2014 kris-duh (@glassofkris) October 22, 2019\n\nOthers decried conservatives for supposedly rigging the show to \u201cown the libs\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe fact that a train wreck like Sean Spicer has yet to even be in the bottom 2 on #dwts should be the wake up call America needs to vote in 2020,\u201d one Twitter user wrote, adding, \u201cConservatives will stop at nothing to \u2018own the libs.\u2019 They will vote in droves.

The former White House press secretary has repeatedly emphasized that his stay on the show is not about him. It is, he says, a greater movement that is demonstrating that conservatives should have a voice, even in the entertainment industry.\n\n\u201cI think the difference that I have \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this to you before \u2013 that it\u2019s not just about me. It\u2019s about we. And I think people \u2013 that you know your listeners, your readers, everyone \u2013 recognizes that the further I go, it\u2019s more about all of us,\u201d Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about like showing that \u2018hey we are active, we are engaged, we view these shows.\u2019 It reminds people that, you know, you can\u2019t overlook half of the equation if you will, and so that\u2019s good,\u201d he continued.\n\nSpicer previewed Monday\u2019s show on Breitbart News Sunday, warning that it was going to be a \u201cbig test\u201d in terms of the magnitude of the conservative voice:\n\nDuring another appearance on Breitbart News Sunday this month, Spicer addressed the leftist critics who question how it is possible that he is continuing to advance on the show unscathed:\n\nThe thing that I find funny is, it\u2019s the same kind of stuff\u2013 harken back to the last election. \u2018How did this happen?\u2019 And well, it\u2019s because we got out there and we voted. I know this is not even in the same ballpark as an election \u2013 we\u2019re getting real people and real policies \u2013 but it does send a message to these folks that like there are people out there who support the agenda and policies and want to see people do well. And I think it does send a great message that there\u2019s a good amount of support out there. \u2026 When they look at their programming and they look at everything, they may hopefully \u2013 hopefully \u2013 stop to say, \u201cHey this Spicer guy has a lot of support from places like Breitbart, maybe we should start to think just a little or even acknowledge that the programming or even the audience shares that point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope people understand that this is not just about me,\u201d Spicer added. \u201cThis is hopefully about really something bigger.\u201d", "description": "Leftists experienced a collective meltdown after former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer advanced to the next round of DWTS", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Sean-Spicer-DWTS-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
