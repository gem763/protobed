(Image: Clay Mann, DC Comics)\n\nBecause everyone spends so much time going on about Nightwing\u2019s arse and Catwoman\u2019s inexplicably exposed armpits, it can be easy to forget that Bruce Wayne is very much a sex symbol in his own right. But artist Clay Mann has been trying to remind everyone with his illustrations in DC\u2019s ongoing Batman series that\u2019s currently being penned by Tom King.\n\nFollowing a brutal beatdown by Bane that leaves Bruce broken once again, Catwoman\u2019s whisked her former fianc\u00e9 off to help him recover in an idyllic paradise far away from all the darkness and pain that comes part part and parcel with living in Gotham City. The couples\u2019 time on the beach has served as a stark contrast to the horror Gotham\u2019s citizens are living through now that villains have taken over the city, and it\u2019s been more than obvious that Batman and Catwoman\u2019s time in paradise can only last but so long.\n\nWhile they\u2019ve been vacationing (kinda) though, Mann\u2019s gone out of his way to show off just how \u2014 forgive me \u2014 built the series\u2019 heroes are, and the artist has taken special care to give Bruce just as much of the cheesecake treatment as he gives to Selina, which is something of a (very welcome) rarity in mainstream comics.\n\nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Mann unpacked the reasoning behind the garish, fake mustache Bruce has been rocking as part of his Matches Malone disguise for the past few issues, explaining that the look was inspired by his love for Tom Selleck in Magnum P. I., but it\u2019s a tough call to say whether that series ever rendered Selleck as hunkily as Mann depicts Bruce\n\nCatwoman playing with her prey. (Image: Clay Mann, DC Comics/Entertainment Weekly)\n\nBat-thirst aside, what really jumps out about Mann\u2019s illustrations is how their sensuality emphasises an aspect of Batman and Catwoman\u2019s interpersonal dynamic, that too-often gets boiled down to \u201cmoody hero sometimes flirts with that one criminal he\u2019s fond of letting get away.\u201d Even with a botched marriage behind them, Bruce and Selina are one another\u2019s people with decades of history, drama, and an intense intimacy that\u2019s as physical as it is psychological.\n\nThe First Time Batman And Catwoman Really Got Married Batman's been chasing Catwoman for decades in the various iterations of DC Comics' fictional landscapes, and the attraction between the hero and the thief has been a constant subtext. They're getting married soon in the mainline reality of the DC Universe, but it's happened before, in a story that's a classic.

Which Mann\u2019s obviously leaning into with a vengeance.\n\nBatman #79 hits stores this Wednesday.", "description": "Because everyone spends so much time going on about Nightwing\u2019s arse and Catwoman\u2019s inexplicably exposed armpits, it can be easy to forget that Bruce Wayne is very much a sex symbol in his own right.
