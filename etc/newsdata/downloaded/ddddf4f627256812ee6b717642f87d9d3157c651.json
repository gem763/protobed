USA TODAY Sports\n\nST. LOUIS \u2014 Mike Shildt apologizes if he offended you. Yet he\u2019s not about to shrink from the passion he has for his team and his sport.\n\nEven if the whole world knows just how colorful that passion may be.\n\nShildt\u2019s impassioned speech after his St. Louis Cardinals captured the National League Division Series with a Game 5 win at Atlanta was streamed live on Instagram by rookie Randy Arozarena. The raucous address was sprinkled liberally with f-bombs and promises that whom ever St. Louis played in the NL Championship Series, they\u2019d \u201ckick their asses.\u201d\n\nThat would be the Washington Nationals, who captured the other NLDS as the Cardinals watched from their Atlanta hotel lobby bar.\n\nGame 1 is Friday night at Busch Stadium. Shildt opened his Thursday press conference absolving Arozarena for broadcasting comments that typically are kept in house and that, Shildt said, \"should have been private.\"\n\n\u201cI apologize if my language offended anyone,\u201d said Shildt, in his second season managing the Cardinals and a coach or manager in their system since 2004. \u201cI am flawed and have my moments. I grew up in a clubhouse and one of the crosses I bear is my language. I try to represent this organization with class and dignity. I have done a nice job over the many years of curbing that and trying to represent always this organization and myself in a positive light, with class and dignity.\n\n\u201cI will not apologize for having passion about how I feel about our team.\u201d\n\nCardinals manager Mike Shildt prior to Game 5 of the NLDS.

His players have seen the other Shildt with a bit more frequency.\n\nAnd love him for it.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to everybody,\u201d says Cardinals Game 1 starter Miles Mikolas. \u201cWe get to see that fired up side of him when the cameras are off - or supposed to be off. You see your manager get that fired up, that amped up, it\u2019s contagious.\n\n\u201cHe lets us know he has our back, whether we're getting frustrated with umpires and he's going out there talking to them or getting involved in chirping at the other team or rooting for the security guards to tackle the guy on the field.\u201d\n\nShildt\u2019s speech may not have earned him many friends in Atlanta after he noted that the Braves \u201cstarted some (stuff), and we finished it.\u201d\n\nIn his own room, his players would just as soon he keep letting it rip.\n\n\u201cI know he apologized for the words he used,\u201d says catcher Matt Wieters, \u201cbut everybody in the clubhouse knows how much he cares for them.\u201d", "description": "After the decisive Game 5 of the NLDS on Wednesday, Cardinals rookie\u00a0Randy Arozarena streamed his manager's postgame talk in the clubhouse.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
