REUTERS/Russell Boyce\n\nISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would plan for economic growth of 5% in 2020, in comments which followed data on Monday showing the economy contracted 1.5% year-on-year in the second quarter.\n\nTurkey\u2019s economy is looking to shake off a recession brought on by last year\u2019s currency crisis. The contraction in the second quarter was less than a 2% forecast in a Reuters poll, which also forecast zero growth this year as a whole.\n\n\u201cI am giving a growth level for 2020, we will focus on that. We will definitely plan a growth rate of 5%,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe government\u2019s medium-term program, announced a year ago, forecast economic growth of 2.3% this year and 3.5% in 2020. Previous growth forecasts had been 5.5% for both 2019 and 2020.", "description": "President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would plan for economic growth of 5% in 2020, in comments which followed data on Monday showing the economy contracted 1.5% year-on-year in the second quarter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426430063&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840FA", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
