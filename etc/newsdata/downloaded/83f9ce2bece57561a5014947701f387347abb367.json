UAW leaders from across the country voted overwhelmingly here Sunday to authorize the action, instructing nearly 46,000 blue-collar workers at 31 GM plants to either walk off the job or stay home. The UAW confirmed the start of the strike in a statement early Monday. One of the biggest sticking points is the company\u2019s decision in November to close four U.S. factories, a move the UAW\u2019s leadership vowed to fight at the bargaining table. The union is also pressing for higher pay, more job security and better benefits at a time when GM is trying to cut costs ahead of an expected U.S. car industry downturn. Such a slowdown could make it harder for the UAW to win concessions in the years ahead. \u201cI\u2019m ready, I\u2019m prepared. All year I\u2019ve been preparing for this, the wife and I getting our ducks in order,\u201d said Scott Harwick, a 49-year-old UAW-represented worker at GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. \u201cWe knew it was going to be really tough.\u201d Another factor is a U.S. Justice Department investigation into corruption among the union\u2019s top ranks, which is putting pressure on UAW leaders to show strength and gain better terms as the probe erodes the confidence of many rank-and-file members. (WSJ)\n\nTalks will resume Monday at 10 a.m.\n\nPresident Trump urged the two sides to \u201cmake a deal.\u201d", "description": ".09/16/2019 9:01:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/215/af591d9b-0211-4b0a-b192-7082864185d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
