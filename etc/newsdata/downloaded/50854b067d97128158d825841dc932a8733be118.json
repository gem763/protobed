The insect is often made to clamp down to steady itself and wait to die, after which the parasite grows extensions through its victim's exoskeleton. The stalks can then fire spores from this elevated position onto the ground below where the fungus can infect more insects.\n\n'I was checking on the roof slates - maybe 20 in total - I've planted along the edge of my garden, which become a place of hibernation.\n\n'There was no reason to find anything other than worms - and hibernaculum are popular with ants too.\n\n'So when I turned a roof slate over and found this parasitic fungus, I was taken aback.\n\n'I've studied the wildlife for decades now, and I've never seen anything like this.\n\n'This is only the kind of thing that I've seen on documentaries about tropical jungles - it definitely looks like something like that.\n\n'When I kept looking at it, I realised there was something underneath the growth.\n\n'It seemed to me to be a small bumblebee.\n\nHaving studied the wildlife for the best part of 30 years, astonished Nick had 'literally never seen anything like it before'\n\n'Having read around and compared pictures, it seems to match gibellula.'\n\nTaking to Twitter when he found the fungus, Nick posted: 'What in the natural world is this outstanding little punk fungi lichen coral thing? **** (found in Bristol under one of my slow worm slates that has been adopted by yellow meadow ants)'.\n\nHere Gibellula fungus from the Cordyceps species can be seen enveloping a spider - found in Rock Creek Park, Washington DC\n\nA few hours later, he wrote: 'Oh my gosh I've just looked at this for the 20th time and there is a bee inside it!\n\n'Someone please tell me what has made this zombee'.\n\nOne user replied: 'It appears to be a fungal infection - probably Cordyceps?'\n\nAnother said: 'Could be Gibellula pulchra or similar, a fungus that affects spiders'.\n\nAnd one posted: 'If you listen really carefully you'll hear 'brains.....'.\n\nNick found his fungus at around 2pm on October 20.", "description": "Natural history producer Nick Gates, 31, was inspecting the natural shelters in his garden when he made the discovery.
