REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nA day after shooting 62, Na incredibly went even lower in pleasant conditions at TPC Summerlin.\n\nHe capped off his day by rolling in a 12-foot birdie dead centre at the last to post a tournament record-low 22-under 191 total with one round left.\n\nFellow American Patrick Cantlay kept pace for much of the day but his 63 seemed positively pedestrian by comparison.\n\nCantlay did enough, however, to lie alone in second place on 20-under, with Pat Perez four shots back in third place after a 62.\n\nNa, who lives locally, is not the first to ride a hot streak in Vegas, but his performance in what amounts to a home game hardly seemed a co-incidence.\n\nHe recorded the first of his three PGA Tour victory at Summerlin in 2011 and clearly knows every break on the greens.\n\nHe sank seven putts from outside 12 feet, including a 30-footer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hitting a lot of good strokes with good speed ... that are doing what they are supposed to and going in,\u201d the 36-year-old Korean-born American told reporters.\n\n\u201cLook, you need some luck to have some putts lip-in here and there and I\u2019ve been getting a little of that. I\u2019m riding this momentum and using it to my advantage.\u201d\n\nNa\u2019s form certainly impressed the critics.\n\n\u201cThis may well be the best performance on the greens I have ever seen,\u201d said Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee.", "description": "Kevin Na enjoyed another sizzling day with the putter, jumping to a two-shot lead with a 10-under-par 61 in the third round at the Shiners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437556776&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9501B", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
