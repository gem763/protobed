His exploits were later turned into the film Fifty Dead Men Walking starring Jim Sturgess and Ben Kingsley.\n\nThe police document is a \u201cmajor crime unit investigation review\u201d by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire forces.\n\nIts findings appear to support McGartland\u2019s claims over the past two decades that the IRA rather than a local north-eastern criminal gang was behind the murder attempt in Whitley Bay on 17 June 1999.\n\nIn the days, weeks and months after McGartland was shot and seriously wounded, both Northumbria police and the then Labour government refused to confirm that the IRA was responsible.\n\nMcGartland, along with unionist politicians at the time, alleged that the truth was covered up to keep the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in wedded to the fledgling post Good Friday agreement peace process.\n\nIn their review, the three constabularies led by Jon Boutcher, the ex-Bedfordshire chief constable and head of another multimillion investigation into another army spy in the IRA \u2013 Stake Knife \u2013 concluded that republican paramilitaries did try to kill McGartland.\n\nAmong 60 recommendations to the Northumbria police regarding the McGartland shooting, the police forces suggest: \u201cThat Northumbria police must make a formal media release acknowledging the re-investigation of the attempted murder of Mr McGartland. This should be underpinned by a public statement that the original shooting was most likely associated with Mr McGartland\u2019s background within the IRA and having acted as an agent of the security services within the republican areas of Belfast and was carried out by a paramilitary active service unit.\u201d\n\nThe report also dismisses any suggestion that the shooting was connected to a dispute between McGartland and drug dealers in north-east England. McGartland has always alleged that this line of inquiry was \u201cinvented and fed\u201d to media sources by either MI5 or elements of the Blair government to deflect from the IRA\u2019s role in the botched assassination.\n\n\u201cThe review has not uncovered any credible evidence of a specific threat to the victim at the hands of \u2018local criminals\u2019 or indeed that gives any indication of this being related to any of the victim\u2019s business, his work or his private life within the locality,\u201d the report says.\n\nIn addition to calling for a fresh investigation into the 1999 attack on McGartland, the review suggests that \u201cNP (Northumbria police) to consider external force to progress investigation in its entirety\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, it recommends that \u201ckey roles\u201d in that fresh investigation \u201cshould be filled by persons not connected to NP (Northumbria police)\u201d.\n\nThe report also appears to suggest that the IRA line of inquiry was known to the Northumbria police in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.\n\n\u201cMost critically, he (an officer named only as Police R by the review) was of the considered view that the attack was most likely carried out by the Provisional IRA and that this fact was known to the original SIO (senior investigations officer) within a very short timeframe following the attack. He (Police R) would offer no explanation as to why this had not been acknowledged much earlier within the investigation, and that this remained as a significant issue between the victim and the police,\u201d the report says.\n\nMcGartland told the Guardian that this finding in particular proved that from the outset officers in Northumbria police knew that the IRA was behind the shooting. The ex-spy insisted this line was \u201ccovered up and obscured by false, malicious lies\u201d by senior figures in the security and political establishment to conceal the IRA\u2019s role at a delicate stage in the peace process.\n\nOn the report\u2019s main findings, McGartland said: \u201cI am now urging the current chief constable of Northumbria police to immediately admit and acknowledge that the IRA had been behind my June 1999 attempted murder. I am also calling on him to swiftly agree to an external police force to carry out my unsolved attempted murder investigation. I have absolutely no trust, faith or confidence in Northumbria police nor its crime department or any of its chief or senior officers when it concerns me and my cases.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Northumbria police said: \u201cWe can confirm this case has remained open since the shooting in 1999. Following a recent review, the force are investing a significant and dedicated resource into progressing the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe classification of the incident is currently under further review.\u201d\n\nThe Northumbria police at this stage however has declined to confirm or deny that the van believed to have been used by the gang that shot McGartland has since been destroyed.\n\nOn the wider implications of the report\u2019s findings, McGartland added: \u201cThe Northumbria police knew the IRA had been behind my shooting, that they acted in consort with MI5, the Home Office and the then Blair Labour government (and subsequent governments) covered it up to protect not only the IRA as an organisation but the individual IRA members who tried to murder me. And this was done as part of a secret deal between police, security service and government as a result of the Good Friday peace agreement.\u201d\n\nIn 1999 McGartland was shot six times by two gunmen outside his home in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside.\n\nEight years earlier the Belfast-born agent became the only person ever to escape from the IRA\u2019s notorious internal mole hunting unit, the so-called \u201cHeadhunters\u201d or \u201cNutting Squad\u201d.\n\nMcGartland dived out of a third storey flat in west Belfast where the IRA were holding him before he was to be handed over to the head of the Provisionals\u2019 security team which was led by a man named Stake Knife, one of Britain\u2019s most important agents inside the republican terror group.", "description": "Martin McGartland claims 1999 murder plot was covered up to keep peace process alive", "authors": ["Henry Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6c17587eb433b1f09907d53e4631c38acd5837/0_58_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd275c3ccba7313d4703e577608a2618"}
