Mitt Romney (R-UT) as a \u201cDemocrat secret asset\u201d who attempted to \u201cinfiltrate\u201d his administration as secretary of state following the 2016 election in a video shared to Twitter Friday evening.\n\nREPUBLICANS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND FIGHT! pic.twitter.com/chnSNURfFx \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\nIn the one-minute video, the narrator states Romney\u2019s cover was \u201cblown,\u201d andhe was \u201cexposed by news reports as a Democrat secret asset.\u201d The video then shows highlights of the Utah Republican\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign defeat, following by clips of the president\u2019s successful bid in 2016. President-Elect Trump briefly considered Romney for the role of secretary of state, but ultimatly selected Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson for the high-profile post.\n\nThe video\u2019s release comes as Romney, a longtime Trump critic, has criticized the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria and his suggestion for China and Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nOn Thursday, the freshman senator blasted the administration\u2019s announcement of a five-day cease-fire between Turkey and Kurdish military forces in the region. Romney said:\n\nThe announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory. Serious questions remain about how the decision was reached precipitously to withdraw from Syria and why that decision was reached. Adding insult to dishonor, the administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty.\n\nOf President Trump\u2019s plea for foreign governments to probe into the Bidens, Romney called the move \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cagainst the law.\u201d\n\nRomney told Axios:\n\nGoing on TV and saying, \u2018China, will you investigate my political opponent\u2019 is wrong, it\u2019s a mistake; it was shocking, in my opinion, for the president to do so. I can\u2019t imagine coming to a different point of view.\n\n\u201cWe certainly can\u2019t have presidents asking foreign countries to provide something of political value, that is, after wall, against the law,\u201d he added.\n\nIn true Trump fashion, the president hasn\u2019t taken Romney\u2019s most recent criticism laying down. In a tweet earlier this month, the president called the NeverTrump lawmaker a \u201cpompous ass\u201d and demanded he be impeached.\n\nTrump tweeted:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.", "description": "President Trump slammed Mitt Romney as a \"Democrat secret asset\" in a video shared to Twitter on Friday evening.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Romney-Dem-Secret-Asset-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
