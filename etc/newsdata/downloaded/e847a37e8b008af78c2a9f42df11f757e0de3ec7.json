He previously served as a deputy national security adviser under Bolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R. McMaster.\n\nTrump claimed last Thursday he was mulling 15 contenders to take over Bolton\u2019s job, and previewed that he would likely make his final decision sometime this week.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it badly, as you can imagine,\u201d he said last week. \u201cA lot of people want the job \u2014 it\u2019s a great job. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump. It\u2019s very easy actually to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don\u2019t have to work.\u201d\n\nTrump also ruled out appointing Pompeo to take over the post in addition to his duties at the State Department, though White House counselor Kellyanne Conway signaled he will play an outsize role assisting the president in the selection of the administration\u2019s fourth national security adviser.\n\nTrump announced Bolton\u2019s resignation via Twitter last Tuesday after news reports indicated the president and his hawkish aide had clashed over scuttled plans for a Camp David summit with Taliban leaders aimed at ending the war in Afghanistan.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled Lisa Gordon-Hagerty\u2019s name.", "description": "Trump previewed that he would likely make his final decision sometime this week.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/87/a5c2e5ae4b95a670890ba1ced997/190917-trump-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
