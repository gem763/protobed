Or the Judiciary Committee, seeing that outcome as inevitable, would not vote out articles at all. Either way, the effort would peter out and die.\n\nSuch an endgame has long seemed difficult to sustain, given Trump\u2019s mounting corruption and lawlessness. But the scandal around Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden \u2014 and his administration\u2019s seemingly illegal coverup of the whistleblower complaint, which is said to involve that pressure \u2014 throws the untenable nature of that endgame into even sharper relief.\n\nThe Post and the New York Times both have big pieces reporting that this latest story has dramatically increased the pressure on Democratic leaders to move forward more forcefully on impeachment.\n\nTrump has now openly allowed that his call with the Ukrainian president was about how \u201cwe don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Trump appears to have withheld military aid to Ukraine while demanding that it investigate his most likely general election opponent \u2014 even as his administration is violating the law by withholding an \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d whistleblower complaint from Congress that appears to involve this matter \u2014 has combined to exert a new level of pressure on top Democrats.\n\nThus it is that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the Intelligence Committee, has now told CNN that Trump may have \u201ccrossed a Rubicon.\u201d Schiff said that if Trump is \u201cusing the power of the presidency\u201d to seek foreign assistance in an election a second time, while engaging in a \u201ccoverup,\u201d then impeachment may be the \u201conly remedy.\u201d\n\nSubsequent to this, Pelosi warned that if the whistleblower complaint continues to be withheld, Democrats will enter \u201ca whole new stage of investigation.\u201d Schiff\u2019s and Pelosi\u2019s statements were reportedly coordinated.\n\nIt is becoming exceedingly difficult to imagine what an endgame in which impeachment fizzles would look like.\n\nWe\u2019re likely getting articles of impeachment\n\nIn an interview with me, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that if these latest revelations are as grave as they look, it\u2019s all but certain we\u2019ll get articles of impeachment from the committee.\n\n\u201cIf the evidence indeed shows that the president again betrayed the national interest by placing his personal political agenda in front of the rule of law and the interests of the American people, that is easily reducible to an article of impeachment,\u201d Raskin told me.\n\nWhat vaults this to a whole new level is that Trump is doing all of this in real time, right now, as president. The already known facts are damning. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has admitted that Trump has signed off on his ongoing pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t do anything that involves my client without speaking to my client.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need an explicit quid pro quo for this to be extraordinarily serious. Trump is using the leverage of the presidency \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to see how the Ukrainian president could experience this otherwise \u2014 to get a foreign power to interfere in our election on his behalf.\n\nThis comes after Trump and his top advisers already went to great lengths to conspire with and benefit from foreign sabotage of our democracy in the last presidential election. Trump continues to mostly shrug about that, even as he has openly invited more of the same on other occasions as well.\n\nHe\u2019s rubbing our faces in all of it\n\nDavid Leonhardt has a good list of Trump\u2019s many other transgressions. But he leaves off an important one: In committing extensive and likely criminal obstruction of justice, Trump wasn\u2019t merely acting to defend himself against accountability; he was also trying to impede an accounting of a foreign attack on our political system. Impeachment experts have said this may well rise to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.\n\nBut now, not only is Trump again actively soliciting more foreign interference in our election on his behalf. It appears he may again be trying to cover it up: Trump\u2019s top officials are currently withholding the whistleblower complaint from Congress, in plain violation of the law.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know for sure that the pressure on Ukraine was the subject of that complaint. But we do already know that this is an extraordinarily corrupt manipulation of the machinery of government to prevent Congress from carrying out its institutional role in holding the executive branch accountable.\n\nGiven all this, what message will it send to the country if House Democrats don\u2019t exercise the remedy of holding an impeachment inquiry that has the party\u2019s full and forceful backing?\n\nYes, the GOP Senate will acquit. And yes, defeating Trump\u2019s reelection would be a form of accountability. But how will Democrats justify failing to use every institutional tool at their disposal \u2014 not just to take the case to the country that such misconduct is simply unacceptable in a president, but also to compel our political system to seriously grapple to its maximal institutionally designed extent with whether that misconduct merits his removal?\n\nThat means compelling Senate Republicans to take a stand on specific articles that the Democratic-controlled House has institutionally endorsed as rising to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nTrump is serially betraying the country\n\nWhat should make refraining from a fully backed impeachment inquiry even more difficult for Democrats to entertain is the bigger story here. This scandal is the only the latest example of Trump placing his own interests before those of the nation. But it simultaneously underscores how corruptly Trump has been doing this on a regular basis \u2014 that is, how brashly and serially he is betraying the country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s converted the government into an instrument of his own self enrichment,\u201d Raskin told me. \u201cHe\u2019s making money hand over fist from princes, kings and foreign governments. He is also channeling federal taxpayer dollars directly to his businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe unifying theme of the president\u2019s misconduct is his constant betrayal of the oath of office and the national interest,\u201d Raskin continued. \u201cHe continues to place his own financial and political interests above his duty to the rule of law and the country. This is the cardinal sin for a president under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nGiven all this, what happens if Democrats don\u2019t try to use all the tools of accountability at their disposal, and Trump wins reelection? Democrats should seriously ask themselves what would be left of our democracy at that point \u2014 and whether they want such an outcome to be part of their legacy.\n\nRead more:\n\nJames Downie: Begin impeachment hearings now\n\nKaren Tumulty: Yes, there is something the House can do to punish Trump right now\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: What did Trump tell Ukraine\u2019s president?\n\nGeorge T.
