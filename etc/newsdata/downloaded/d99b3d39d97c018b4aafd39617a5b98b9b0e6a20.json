GPRO, +8.26% soared on heavy volume Friday, although the action camera maker has not released any news to the public. The stock shot up as much as 18% earlier in the session, before paring gains to be up 10% in midday trading. Trading volume ballooned to 9.9 million shares, which is already more than triple the full-day average of about 3.2 million shares. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The stock has now run up 35% since closing at a record low of $3.82 on Sept. 3. The last press release the company issued on its website was on Aug. 26, in which GoPro said it did not expect recently announced tariffs to have an impact on second-half 2019 results, as they had already began production in Mexico of U.S.-bound cameras in June. The stock has now rallied 21.5% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.26% has gained 18.8%.", "description": "Shares of GoPro Inc. soared on heavy volume Friday, although the action camera maker has not released any news to the public.
