They demanded jobs, better services and called for the \"downfall of the regime\".\n\nIraq has struggled to recover from the battle against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group between 2014 and 2017. Its infrastructure has been laid to waste by decades of sectarian civil war, foreign occupation, two US invasions, UN sanctions and war against its neighbours.", "description": "Anti-government protests enter third day as government-imposed curfews fail to prevent unrest from spreading.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/83598fc9fcb84dd89838cdabe76f958b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
