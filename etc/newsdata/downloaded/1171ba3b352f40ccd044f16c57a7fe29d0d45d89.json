Peterson film sparks threats: 'We really don't want to have to bring out the guillotine'", "language": "en", "text": "Clinical psychologist Jordan B. Peterson is no stranger to controversy, and threats over a new documentary on his life have added to it.\n\nFilmmakers Patricia Marcoccia and Maziar Ghaderi recently spoke to a Seattle newspaper about their documentary, \u201cThe Rise Of Jordan Peterson,\u201d along with threats to those who want to share it with the world.\n\nTheaters in Toronto and Brooklyn canceled showings. A church pastor also abandoned a showing after receiving threats.\n\n\u201cThe people who run these venues are so worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Mr. Ghaderi said Monday, The Stranger reported. \u201cAn old professor of mine once told me that artists are supposed to be fearless, but when I\u2019m reading these emails from these gatekeepers, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Man, you people should go work for the government or something.\u2019\u201d\n\nAuthor Katie Herzog\u2019s piece then notes the moment Mr. Ghaderi \u201creceived a text message from a pastor outside of Portland. The pastor had agreed to screen the film at his church and had been getting complaints \u2014 and threats.\u201d\n\nOne threat forwarded along gave the pastor a \u201cfair warning\u201d as to what he was getting into be considering the film.\n\n\u201cSeveral community organizations are planning to shut down your showing of the Jordan Peterson propaganda film,\u201d the threat read. \u201cWhile many of us aren\u2019t Christian and some even flat-out condemn the religion, we do not want any harm to come to your place of worship or those within. However, we cannot allow fascism to continue to rise and will not tolerate its presence in our city, whether it is on the streets or on the waterfront or in a church. Read some history books, read about eugenics, read about sex and gender and then compare it to Peterson. Pray on it if you must. Do the right thing. As much as we joke about it, we really don\u2019t want to have to bring out the guillotine to fix society.\u201d\n\nThe creators told the newspaper that their original goal was to make a \u201cvery artistic\u201d film about Mr. Peterson\u2019s friendship with a Native woodcarver on northern Vancouver Island, but their efforts coincided with his rise to stardom and the publication of his successful book \u201c12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.\u201d\n\nMs. Herzog added that \u201cThe Rise of Jordan Peterson\u201d is \u201cnot exactly pro-Peterson propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe film makes ample space for his critics, including one of his old friends and former colleagues who wrote an article calling Peterson \u2018dangerous,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cAll of this \u2014 the myth of Jordan Peterson versus the reality of Jordan Peterson \u2014 is what this film is about.\u201d\n\nThe documentary can also be pre-ordered on iTunes for $6.99 and should be available on the platform on Oct. 29.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
