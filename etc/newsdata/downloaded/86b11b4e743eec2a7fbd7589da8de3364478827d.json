He was a jerk.\n\nThe occasion was the 100th anniversary of my college newspaper, the Daily Texan, where Cronkite had worked as a young man before dropping out of the University of Texas. It was 1999, and the possibility of \u201cPresident George W. Bush\u201d was starting to settle into the brains of American liberals like a particularly malignant neuroblastoma. Cronkite, completely oblivious to the possibility that he was talking to someone with views at variance with his own \u2014 he was one of those media liberals who \u201cclaim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views,\u201d as WFB once put it \u2014 went on, knowingly and smugly, about the Christian crazies who were behind it all. This was about half a decade before his public pronouncements became full-blown bonkers, suggesting to Larry King that Karl Rove was manipulating Osama bin Laden in order to influence U.S. elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Don Aucoin writes in the Boston Globe that \u201cwhat Walter Cronkite was to an earlier generation \u2014 an utterly trusted voice \u2014 Stewart has been to millennials,\u201d I am inclined to agree, though I take from that sad fact something other than what Aucoin intends. Cronkite, for all of his failings and his utterly conventional liberalism, was a real reporter. (And sort of a bad-ass as well, at one point manning a machine gun while covering World War II. I do hope that Brian Williams doesn\u2019t pick up that story, too.) Stewart, who has announced his pending retirement from The Daily Show, is only an intellectual parasite, echoing the conventional liberalism of the old-line media establishment without doing any of the work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay what you will about the biases of the New York Times, the Associated Press, or even up-and-comers such as BuzzFeed: They do real work. I\u2019m annoyed by the Times on the average weekday as intensely as the next reactionary, but at the same time the paper\u2019s investigative work on Rikers Island, to take one recent example, has been invaluable. BuzzFeed may butter its gluten-free bread with dopey features (\u201cThese Before-and-Afters Prove That Every Guy Looks Better with A Beard,\u201d etc.), but it\u2019s doing real reporting, too. And I suspect that BuzzFeed is starting to develop a keen appreciation for the fact that high-quality journalism requires real work on the part of the producers and \u2014 this is the hard part \u2014 real work on the part of consumers, too. There\u2019s a reason People (weekly) has 20 times the circulation of National Review (fortnightly) and 70 times the circulation of The New Republic (monthly).\n\nJon Stewart\u2019s genius \u2014 \u201cand for once that overused word is appropriate,\u201d Aucoin of the Globe insists \u2014 is that he provides intellectually lazy people with an excuse for forgoing the hard work of informing themselves at anything but the most superficial level about political events. Human beings being what they are, there will always be an acute need for humor in our political discourse; Stewart\u2019s contribution has been to substitute humor \u2014 and an easy, vapid, shallow species of humor at that \u2014 for the discourse itself, through what Jim Treacher deftly described as his \u201cclown nose on, clown nose off\u201d approach to commentary: When it comes to Obamacare, the minimum wage, or the national debt, you don\u2019t have to get the economics as long as you get the joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#page#Thus the phenomenon of \u201cJon Stewart Destroys X.\u201d Contemporary progressivism has largely given up on the project of answering conservative arguments and instead concentrates its efforts on discrediting those who make the arguments. How many times have you heard that tea-party protester carrying a placard reading \u201cKeep Government Out of My Medicare!\u201d \u2014 an episode that is at least partly fictitious, incidentally, although Representative Robert Inglis (R., S.C.) reports being told roughly that at a town-hall meeting \u2014 cited as though it were the definitive answer to criticisms of the Affordable Care Act? The implicit argument \u2014 that conservative critics of the ACA don\u2019t understand how Medicare works \u2014 is of course pure horsepucky, as anybody who has read Avik Roy, Reihan Salam, or Ramesh Ponnuru knows. The argument is false, but the joke is a good one, and so the joke prevails over the reality. And that\u2019s Jon Stewart\u2019s real legacy: a Democratic electorate that neither knows nor cares that \u201cI can see Russia from my house!\u201d is a sentence uttered not by Sarah Palin but by Tina Fey pretending to be Sarah Palin.\n\nAnd then of course there is the matter of grotesque and inexcusable intellectual dishonesty, e.g., unscrupulously editing interviews to make Jonah Goldberg look like he can\u2019t land a punch while doing the opposite with Elizabeth Warren. Point that out, though, and it\u2019s clown-nose-on time again: You can\u2019t apply any meaningful standard of probity to me \u2014 I\u2019m a comedian! Now, here\u2019s what you should think about tax policy . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the strange things I\u2019ve encountered in writing about Jon Stewart et al. is that when I criticize progressives for getting their news from a comedy program, the usual answer is \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a conservative version of The Daily Show? Huh? Huh?\u201d As though that erased the stupidity of relying on a comedy show for news and insight. It is true that conservatives have tried \u2014 and failed, utterly \u2014 to do what Stewart does. There are funny conservatives and funny liberals, but they tend to be amusing in different ways, which is why liberal efforts to replicate Rush Limbaugh\u2019s success have failed in the same way as conservative efforts to replicate Jon Stewart\u2019s. It takes a left-wing sensibility to have Lenny Bruce\u2019s career; it takes a right-wing sensibility to have Evelyn Waugh\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it takes a bottomless well of stupidity to rely on either mode of humor for a meaningful map of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut ignorance is the default position, which is one of the reasons why conservatives are at a perennial disadvantage when it comes to taking policy ideas to the general public. To understand the conservative view, you have to know a little something about supply and demand, about what prices do in a modern economy, about unintended consequences, etc. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage you hate poor people and love Wall Street greedheads you racist sexist homophobe!\u201d is, by way of comparison, pretty persuasive among the sort of people inclined to take instruction from Jon Stewart. And that sort of discourse is, unfortunately, not restricted to comedy shows. It is the reason that people like Jamelle Bouie and Amanda Marcotte have prominent media platforms, their respective professional obligations being 1) call something/someone racist and 2) call something/someone sexist, i.e., narrowly focused discrediting campaigns substituted for argument \u2014 Jon Stewart minus the laughs. That Bouie, among others, is so completely blind to that fact is a source of some humor in its own right.\n\nStewart\u2019s retirement announcement coincides with the self-inflicted public humiliation of NBC\u2019s Brian Williams, whose accounts of the dangers he has faced as a newsman are even less grounded in reality than is Stewart\u2019s shtick. Inevitably, there are those who have suggested that Stewart should simply take over for the \u201creal\u201d anchorman \u2014 that the Walter Cronkite of the Millennial generation should have the same sort of job that Cronkite himself once had. I don\u2019t disagree, but that Jon Stewart may accurately be described as the Walter Cronkite of our times is a credit neither to him nor to Cronkite \u2014 and least of all is it a credit to his audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.
