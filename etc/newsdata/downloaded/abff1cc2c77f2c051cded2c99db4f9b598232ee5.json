Or a trends person.\n\nI basically keep fit by walking a lot and occasionally beating up a punching bag. Otherwise, I keep my head in the sand and my sneakers on the treadmill.\n\nBut the world is full of fitness trends straight out of \"Star Trek\" or \"Saturday Night Live.\" I had five days to try the most seemingly bizarre, cutting-edge, or unusual fitness trends that New York has to offer. And New York has a lot to offer.\n\nI ended up focusing on five different kinds of classes:\n\nthe urban sweat lodge\n\ncircus-inspired aerial yoga\n\nnightclub-like HIIT (high-intensity interval training)\n\nprison-style workouts taught by former convicts\n\nwhole-body cryotherapy\n\nOver the course of a week, I sweated for an hour in an infrared blanket, hung upside-down from aerial silks, \"turnt up\" with kettlebells, did countless burpees and push-ups in a prison cell-style room, and stood naked in a futuristic chamber that blasted me with air that was -150 degrees Celsius.\n\nProponents of both sweating and cryotherapy claim that the treatments have calorie-burning and toning effects on the body, along with a whole host of benefits including easing pain and muscle stiffness, increased energy, and better sleep, though these claims have not been verified by the FDA.\n\nWhen I visited my parents shortly after, my mom commented that I looked noticeably thinner than I was the last time I visited a month ago. The scale tells me I weigh the same, but I do feel lither. Maybe one or more of my unusual fitness efforts paid off.\n\nHere's what my week was like:", "description": "I tried some of the most unusual fitness trends like cryotherapy, sweating, aerial yoga, a prison-style bootcamp, and a nightclub-like HIIT class.", "authors": ["Irene Jiang"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5db8f000ef2b0c707b6d53-1920-960.jpg"}
