Underneath, in typography identical to that used by the train system, he wrote \u201cHongKongers stand as one.\u201d The image quickly went viral.\n\nA parody of subway information sign created by Phesti.\n\nLike many involved in Hong Kong\u2019s protests, Phesti hides his identity behind a pseudonym. He is one of hundreds of anonymous creators turning out protest art to support the city\u2019s push for greater political freedom. Phesti says his designs are for \u201cpeople like me, who are in the peaceful camp don\u2019t dare to protest on the front line and engage in more aggressive action.\u201d He hopes the work will make such individuals \u201cfeel like they can still participate in something and find a way of saying what\u2019s on their mind.\u201d\n\nSince Hong Kong\u2019s young people rose up in a pro-democracy rebellion three months ago, protest-related digital graphics, illustrations and paintings have exploded. The collection of agitprop ranges from infographics and memes, to illustrations based on news photos, and various adaptations of the famous 1830 painting by French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People.\n\nAn adaptation of the painting 'Liberty Leading the People' by @harcourtromanticist\n\nA drawing by Fung Kin Fan based on a photo taken by Reuters correspondent James Pomfret showing a young couple in masks.\n\nA drawing by Arto inspired by a photograph of two high school students participating in school strike, in the style of Michaelangelo's fresco painting 'The Creation of Adam.\"\n\nNot all of the work is serious. Some is designed purely to give viewers a good laugh.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are holding in their feelings, so some of these illustrations may offer them emotional relief,\u201d says Arto, a satirist whose cartoons are hugely popular. \u201cFighting ridicule with humor is probably more effective than waging a public opinion war,\u201d he tells TIME.\n\nMuch of the work plays on Cantonese slang and makes reference to local music, global pop culture and advertising.\n\nGraphic design by Arto encouraging people to join a general strike on Aug. 5. The character \u7f77 meaning 'strike' is pronounced as \"ba\". The Chinese on this image reads as \"ba la ba ba ba,\" a reference to a McDonald's jingle. The M is rotated 90 degrees to make a \"3,\" meaning strikes in three sectors: school, business and work.\n\nA poster inspired by Star Wars urging people to join a Sept. 15 march and rally organized by the Civil Human Rights Fronts, which was banned by the police. Source: Telegram\n\nCreations such as Phesti\u2019s and Arto\u2019s thrive in online forums, chat groups, social media and on so-called Lennon Walls, where people leave supportive messages on colorful post-it notes. At protests and on public transport, iPhone users often share images via mass Airdrops.\n\nWhen reading upright, the two characters mean \"conscience.\" When tilted 90 degrees counter-clockwise, one character becomes \"return\" and the other becomes an icon of an eye. The image refers to the incident where a female protester was hit in the eye by a projectile on Aug. 11.

They brainstorm ideas with thousands of people in another chat group and then turn their crowd-refined suggestions into visuals of different styles.\n\nA design in the style of the Chinese almanac encouraging students to boycott classes on Sept. 3.

With no end in sight to the unrest, Y said the workload for artists and designers would only increase, and many report feeling exhausted with some dropping out.\n\nA poster showing protesters, a first aid volunteer and an elderly person in high-visibility vest.

It is one of the mantras of the Hong Kong protests, encouraging people to adopt tactical fluidity and come and go from protests as needed.

If you're willing to share, they're willing to listen.\" Source: Telegram\n\nMost members of the protest creative community are known to each other only by their online identities. Phesti made up his nickname by simply shuffling letters he uses for different online accounts. \u201cJust like how front line protesters wear helmets, goggles and face masks, this name is my mask,\u201d Phesti tells TIME. \u201cI hope that one day, I too get to tear off this mask \u2026 and meet everyone.\u201d\n\nA poster with lyrics of 'Glory of Hong Kong,' the new protest anthem.
