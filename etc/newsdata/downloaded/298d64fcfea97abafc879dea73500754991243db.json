It took place at what Meeks described as a Halloween and homecoming party for university students.\n\nThe shooter is believed to have entered the venue through the back door and begun firing with a handgun, Meeks said. He described \"complete chaos\" at the small venue after shots rang out, with hundreds of people -- including the gunman -- fleeing.\n\nAuthorities also believe the shooter may have been targeting just one person out of roughly 750 people and that others were shot at random, Meeks said.\n\nBEFORE MASS SHOOTING, TEXAS GUNMAN \u2018WAS ON A LONG SPIRAL DOWN,\u2019 INVESTIGATOR SAYS\n\nKevin Berry Jr., 23, of Dallas, and Byron Craven Jr., 23, of Arlington, were killed, authorities said.
