Not only do we live next to each other in Georgia, but we both have this big affinity toward motorcycles.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe now 53-year-old added: \u2018And we spend a lot of time on the roads. It\u2019s kind of a great way to unwind and we have that in common. So I talk to him daily.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s at least 1460 days, everyone.\n\nAnd it\u2019s blatantly obvious that their friendship is just as strong (if not stronger) almost half a decade on, after Jeffrey praised his pal when learning he\u2019d picked up two People\u2019s Choice nominations this year.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s nobody that deserves recognition more\u2026 (he\u2019s gonna hate this btw) I love him,\u2019 the star confessed.\n\nThey talk to each other daily (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThey\u2019re the ultimate goals (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I think most of us do. He is one of the more special people I\u2019ve ever had the privilege to know\u2026 there is no better friend. No one is more loyal, loving, protective, generous.\u2019\n\nYou\u2019d think Norm was his pet pooch or something.\n\nSmothering him some more, the father-of-two added: \u2018People like Norman? Rare. In fact\u2026 there can only be one.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so f**king proud of him. Nobody works harder, nobody shows up with more passion, nobody takes more care with their character\u2026 and all this? After 10 years of being Daryl Dixon.\n\n\u2018Bringing that constant intensity to a role after this long is truly amazing.\u2019\n\nFind someone that looks at you the way Norman looks at Jeffrey (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nWe\u2019re not crying you are (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nWe\u2019re not crying, you\u2019re crying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, it was Norman who was crying as he humbly replied to the huge outpouring of love from his acting soulmate.\n\n\u2018Aw man. Thanks brother I might cry this is really nice of you to say. Love u jeff.\u2019 We have those warm fussy feels in our stomach too.\n\nThe pair are not afraid to show their affection for one another on Instagram, the red carpet, and even on set.\n\nAnd if these pictures weren\u2019t enough to convince you that true love does exist then boy, there is something wrong with the world.\n\nFind someone that looks at you the way Norman looks at Jeffrey, and pray the pair don\u2019t end up killing each other off in the upcoming season of The Walking Dead.\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 kicks off on Sunday 6 October in the US, and returns in the UK on Fox Monday 7 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
