The problem is, the other side, even if we wanted to surrender, will not take our surrender. They hate us because of who we are, the way we live our lives, the way we worship our God,\u201d Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, said during a conference held by the Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201cWhat was working in Syria was that for very little investment, the Kurds were doing all the fighting, the vast majority of the dying, and we were providing intelligence and fire support assistance. And we were winning,\u201d he added.\n\nKelly then called the pullout a\u201dcatastrophically bad idea\u201d and expressed worry that the move will hurt the U.S.\u2019s influence in the Middle East.\n\nHe stated:\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen while I was there \u2014 and a couple of other people recently left the administration and then he went with his instinct. But it was, on a number of levels, the wrong thing to do and it has opened the way for the Russians to be very, very influential in the Middle East.\n\nKelly\u2019s remarks come after President Trump on Wednesday announced a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d in Syria, where a Turkish military offensive had been targeting Kurdish forces \u2014 and said the U.S. has lifted sanctions on the regime in Ankara.\n\nTrump told reporters at a news conference he received assurances the cease-fire, set for five days initially, will be permanent. There also will be a 20-mile safe zone along Syria\u2019s border with Turkey, the president added.\n\nThe move to lift sanctions came exactly two weeks after Turkish forces began the offensive in northeast Syria, which targeted Kurdish fighters with the goal of clearing out a \u201csafe zone\u201d to repatriate thousands of Syrians who have fled across the border into Turkey.\n\nThe president said some U.S. troops will remain to guard oil fields.\n\n\u201cWe have secured the oil and therefore a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be deciding what we\u2019re going to do with it in the future.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump announced plans earlier this month to remove U.S. troops after a discussion with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. When U.S. convoys pulled out, Turkish forces invaded Syria unilaterally with the plan to drive Kurds out of the border zone.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "John Kelly criticized President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, labeling it as a \"catastrophically bad idea.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/wi/ap/11/925899_trump-chief-staff-65109-john-kelly-in-21-2018-photo-white-house-chief-staff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
