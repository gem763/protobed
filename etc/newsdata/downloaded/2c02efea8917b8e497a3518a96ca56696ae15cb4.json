They should be separated.\u201d\n\nOne fan took his passion to another level.\n\nPolice in Jilin province announced on Monday that an overzealous Rockets supporter was arrested after he posted a photo of himself burning China\u2019s flag.\n\n\u201cI live and die with my team,\u201d said the post by the 25-year-old, identified only by his surname Wang.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Can\u2019t shun NBA\u2019 \u2013\n\nChina suffered in the past from territorial depredations or outright invasions by foreign countries \u2014 memories burned into the national consciousness.\n\nAs a result, its government and nationalist voices online lash out at any foreign comments perceived as challenging its territorial integrity, as Morey\u2019s tweet was widely viewed in China.\n\nSilver \u2014 who has defended Morey\u2019s right to free expression and refused to apologise \u2014 was due to arrive in Shanghai on Wednesday for a visit now expected to focus on damage control.\n\nChina\u2019s stability-obsessed Communist Party may also fear upsetting fans too much by banning the NBA, China-watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his daily \u201cSinocism\u201d blog this week.\n\n\u201cFans, sponsors, websites and broadcasters can shun one team, but they cannot and will not shun an entire league,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere would be a social stability cost to banning the NBA in China.
