Biden are the same age. Both are 76 years old.\n\nMr. Jagger, of course, is a freak: Hyper-talented (an official rock star for more than five decades, his celebrity aura has actually ensured that he\u2019s become underrated as a musician and songwriter) and a Peter Pan fantasy brought to life. But the point is still illustrative \u2014 humans age at rapidly different clips; one man\u2019s 76 is another\u2019s 36.\n\nA pathbreaking study in 2015, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, confirmed that many people not named \u201cJagger\u201d age more slowly than others.\n\nThe researchers tracked 954 different people born around the same time and found that \u201cyoung individuals of the same chronological age varied in their \u2018biological aging\u2019 (declining integrity of multiple organ systems). Already, before midlife, individuals who were aging more rapidly were less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain aging, self-reported worse health, and looked older.\u201d\n\nEven in their 30s, people are at wildly disparate physical and cognitive ages.\n\nThis fact has been brought into stark relief during the Democratic presidential race. Mr. Biden, in his mid 70s, is doddering, noticeably more elderly than he was even four years ago. While apparently reasonably physically healthy, he refers to \u201crecord players,\u201d waxes poetic about his relationship with segregationist senators, and has trouble stringing together a coherent paragraph, much less consecutive sentences.\n\nThe writer Matthew Continetti has observed correctly that Mr. Biden has a \u201cfour-sentence problem. He\u2019s on message for four sentences and then, once he hits the fifth, launches into outer space. Then stops mid-sentence-eighteen when he sees his time is up.\u201d It appears that his mind is nowhere near as nimble as it once was.\n\nContrast Mr. Biden\u2019s presence with that of Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is two years his senior. Mr. Sanders may have had a literal heart attack earlier this month, but he still appears far more agile and hearty than the former vice president does.\n\nAt last week\u2019s debate, while Mr. Biden struggled to get out his talking points, the Vermont socialist was forceful and on-message. Then over the weekend, Mr. Sanders held a large rally in Queens \u2014 drawing the largest crowd of any Democratic candidate during this primary season \u2014 and was again hale and powerful. It seems safe to say that Mr. Sanders is a young 78.\n\nOr does it? In a way, it seems that it\u2019s somewhat unfair to say that Mr. Sanders is just plain cognitively younger than Mr. Biden. Mr. Sanders, very real physical health concerns aside, is actually doing something quite easy: repeating the same platitudes he has for decades. After all, Mr. Sanders is a true life-long socialist; for him, it\u2019s always been class warfare, \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d and a deep cynicism about American democracy.\n\nSome might find Mr. Sanders\u2019 unrelenting consistency admirable in its way. Fine. But how much intellectual dexterity, really, does it require to just keep saying the same thing for years on end? A real test of Mr. Sanders\u2019 flexibility would be to ask whether he has ever, in his life, changed his mind about something.\n\nMr. Biden, by contrast, is doing attempting something far more challenging: repudiating just about everything he had stood for in his five decades of public service. The 1990s crime bill, his seminal piece of legislation that put more cops on the beat, stiffened federal prison sentences, and helped contribute to vast crime declines? He now expresses regret for it. The Iraq invasion, which he championed as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee? He now claims, laughably, to have opposed that misadventure. The Hyde Amendment, which prohibits spending taxpayer dollars on abortions? He throughout his career backed it, but now opposes it.\n\nThis level of flip-flopping would be hard for any politician, let alone a 76-year-old, to sell convincingly. Even Mick Jagger might not seem so young if, rather than sing \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u201d for the umpteen-thousandth time, he were forced to all of a sudden start belting out \u201cHey Jude.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ethan Epstein is deputy opinion editor of The Washington Times.
