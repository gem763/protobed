(AP) - Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts is aware that many consider him a top Heisman Trophy candidate.\n\nHe just doesn\u2019t care.\n\nHurts leads the nation in passer efficiency and ranks 10th nationally in rushing yards per game, leading many to wonder if he can become the third straight Oklahoma quarterback to win the Heisman. He calls the hype \u201crat poison\u201d and is focused solely on the sixth-ranked Sooners\u2019 matchup with Texas Tech on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had to block it out,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cWe just focus on what we need to do as a team, what we want to do as a team. I\u2019ve been saying rat poison forever and I\u2019m going to continue to say it because that\u2019s what it is. I\u2019m not worried about none of that. I\u2019m worried about what we want to accomplish as a team and what we need to do as a team to achieve those goals and the process of doing it.\u201d\n\nHurts gained some of his mentality from Nick Saban, his former coach at Alabama.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I went there,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of always been like that. I\u2019m a coach\u2019s kid. Just kind of the rarity of being that way, I guess, seeing different things growing up and having different approaches on different things - that\u2019s why I am the way I am.\u201d\n\nHis transfer to Oklahoma has been smooth - the Sooners lead the nation with 676.7 yards per game.\n\nTexas Tech lost to Arizona two weeks ago against dual threat quarterback Khalil Tate. Texas Tech coach Matt Wells said Hurts doesn\u2019t have Tate\u2019s speed, but he has plenty of other good attributes that make him one of the nation\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cI think Jalen Hurts throws the ball better,\u201d Wells said. \u201cHe\u2019s thicker. He\u2019s stronger. He\u2019s more of a power runner, but don\u2019t confuse power runner for a lack of speed. That\u2019s not the case with No. 1. He\u2019s got really good speed.\u201d\n\nTEXAS TECH QBS\n\nTexas Tech quarterback Alan Bowman is out with a shoulder injury, and Wells said Jett Duffey and Jackson Tyner will share the responsibility of filling in.\n\nDuffey, a dual threat, stepped in during last year\u2019s game against Oklahoma after Bowman left with a collapsed lung. Duffey completed 9 of 17 passes for 139 yards and two touchdowns and ran 13 times for 47 yards and a score, but Oklahoma held on for a 51-46 win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got game experience, he\u2019s a good runner, he\u2019s a very capable thrower,\u201d Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cProbably one of those things, if you\u2019re in a situation like this where you lose your starter to injury, you hope to have a guy like him behind him. So I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be very confident.\u201d\n\nTyner is a transfer from Rice who has thrown three passes this season.\n\nSTRONGER DEFENSES\n\nTexas Tech is allowing just 13.7 points per game this season, 16th nationally, and their pass defense ranks third nationally. Linebacker Jordyn Brooks leads the team with 35 tackles, defensive back Douglas Coleman has two interceptions and defensive lineman Broderick Washington has created havoc up front.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s defense under new coordinator Alex Grinch has caught Wells\u2019 eye. Linebacker Kenneth Murray and defensive lineman Neville Gallimore stand out.\n\n\u201cKenneth Murray is a Sunday (NFL) player,\u201d Wells said. \u201cGallimore is a Sunday player. And they\u2019ve got some younger guys up front and in that front seven that are long, strong and athletic.\u201d\n\nSUTHERLAND\u2019S ARREST\n\nOklahoma kicker Calum Sutherland was arrested last week in Oklahoma on a public intoxication charge. Oklahoma\u2019s depth chart shows that Sutherland or Gabe Brkic will handle kicking duties on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to deal with it,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you how we\u2019re going to deal with it. It\u2019s going to handled internally, but trust me it\u2019ll be handled appropriately and a correct message set on what we expect in our program, conduct that\u2019s expected. And when guys drop below the line, they\u2019re going to be punished.\u201d\n\nSTAR RECEIVER\n\nOklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb got most of the attention heading into the season, but Charleston Rambo leads the team in catches, yards and touchdowns. The speedster had 11 catches for 251 yards and four scores. Lamb has nine catches for 229 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nGROUND AND POUND\n\nEven with an elite passing attack, Oklahoma ranks second in the nation in rushing with 324.3 yards per game. Hurts leads the way with 124.3. The Red Raiders gave up 314 yards rushing against Arizona, including a 13-play, 99-yard drive in the fourth quarter that featured all runs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts is aware that many consider him a top Heisman Trophy candidate.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cliff Brunt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/oklahoma_ucla_football_44235_c0-108-2583-1614_s1770x1032.jpg?be7ef6ddd6f839272311c8e374c10783b0f58b65", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
