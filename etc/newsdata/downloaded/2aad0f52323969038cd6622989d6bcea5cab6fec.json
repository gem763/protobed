Miranda also has another son, Flynn, eight, with ex-husband Orlando Bloom.\n\nMiranda has been with her billionaire tech entrepreneur beau since 2015, and the couple married in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple had announced they were expecting their second baby in March, but the model remained tight-lipped about the gender, revealing the couple knew \u2018the sex and we have names but it\u2019s nice to keep a little to yourself.\u2019\n\nWhile they weren\u2019t going to reveal any details about their baby until he was born, Miranda did share several photos of her growing bump on social media to keep her fans updated.\n\nMiranda also previously revealed she struggled through pregnancy, explaining: \u2018I suffered quite a lot of morning sickness and I was on bed rest for a little while, then I pinched a nerve in my neck.\n\n\u2018Every woman is different. For some reason\u2026 with each three of my pregnancies, I\u2019ve been super nauseous and a little more sensitive.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had morning sickness with all of them. With Flynn I had it, with Hart I had it, and now I have it again. Hopefully it will dissipate.\n\n\u2018It helps when I\u2019m constantly snacking. I\u2019ve just had a ginger apple shot. Ginger tea helps. Fresh ginger and hot water with a little honey and lemon.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
