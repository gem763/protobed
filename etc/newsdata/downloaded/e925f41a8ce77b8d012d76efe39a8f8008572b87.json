First, the saga of Leif Olson, the Department of Labor employee who was canned (and then reinstated) after Bloomberg misreported his sarcastic criticism of the anti-Semitic right as genuine anti-Semitism; and second, the resignation of Jamie R. Riley, an assistant vice president and dean of students at the University of Alabama, who resigned after his tweets criticizing America were highlighted by Breitbart News.\n\nThe stories have the key elements that ought to ignite their respective muses: The too-fast, knee-jerk response of blundering officials to social media posts, and the silencing of free speech by nongovernmental, but still-powerful, means of Discourse Policing. There\u2019s no reason to suspect, however, that any of these columnists working the \u201cWho\u2019s Being Mean To Me, And Therefore America, Online\u201d beat\u2014and it\u2019s not just Stephens and Brooks\u2014are going to mark the connection between one man fired for false accusations of anti-Semitism, and another forced into resigning because his truly-held opinions about white supremacy and America were fed into the internet\u2019s charnel house of disapproval. Just the marketplace of ideas in action!\n\n\n\nThere is an intellectual weakness among the conservative free speech policemen, one that was recently and rivetingly exposed when Stephens went on a campaign to get a university professor fired from his job for the crime of referring to Stephens (in an obscure tweet) as a bedbug. But in these free speech street-fights, columnists like Stephens are just the bagmen. The real villain here is Breitbart, and the utterly shameless right-wing media ecosystem in which it resides. There, the only goal is to ambush the enemy and \u201cown the libs\u201d through whatever means are presently at hand. Consistency and fairness aren\u2019t even on the menu\u2014it\u2019s just all bad faith, all the time.\n\n\n\nBreitbart surfaced just three tweets by Riley, posted in 2017 and 2016, each of which was inarguably fair. The first said: \u201cThe [American flag emoji] flag represents a systemic history of racism for my people. Police are a part of that system. Is it that hard to see the correlation?\u201d How dare he. In another, he asked: \u201cAre movies about slavery truly about educating the unaware, or to remind Black people of our place in society?\u201d It\u2019s a point with which reasonable people could agree or disagree, certainly, but nevertheless clearly within the bounds of acceptable discourse.\n\n", "description": "All bad faith, all the time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/89d7ba5e1bb0916fb7431caf0d3054498d516ca0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
