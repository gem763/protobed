Emery relied on overlapping full-backs or wing-backs for chance creation last season.\n\nHowever, there are potentially more subtle, structural benefits on offer for Emery. A curious sight this season has been Arsenal's midfielders strung across the pitch, often in a flat three, with the two players either side of Granit Xhaka tasked with defending the flanks.\n\nNone of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Sead Kolasinac or Calum Chambers are natural full-backs, so the urge to protect them is an understandable coaching instinct. Arsenal also have a \u00a372 million wide forward in Nicolas Pepe on the right, who Emery seems keen not to overburden defensively.", "description": "Arsenal and Unai Emery have been waiting on the return of full-backs Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney since the start of the season, and the international break bought the pair time in their quest to build fitness.", "authors": ["Daniel Zeqiri", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000211912407-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqnj5f55R6XEVcLbfHVgP9-mI_voTPiZ9y98UHewUTz8w.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
