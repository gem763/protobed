Perhaps not by mistake, the rise of mineral-based makeup seemed to coincide with a growing trend among forward-thinking women to question and scrutinize what they\u2019re putting on their skin and hair. You see, lotion isn\u2019t\n\njust lotion. Shampoo isn\u2019t just shampoo. All of our personal care products are complex formulas that contain 15, 20, sometimes 30 or more ingredients\u2014some of which you recognize (like aloe or coconut oil) and others that you can\u2019t pronounce, much less understand what they\u2019re for. The same can be said of every single product and cosmetic you use on a daily basis, from gel, mousse, serum, and hairspray, to mascara, blush, foundation, lipstick, and mascara, to deodorant and nail polish and beyond. In fact, by the time you\u2019re done getting ready in the morning, you\u2019ve likely applied hundreds of chemicals onto your skin, hair, and nails. There\u2019s no need to worry though, because all of these products are thoroughly tested and deemed safe by the government, right? Unfortunately, no. The beauty industry is largely unregulated. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays a huge role in regulating our food supply and what medications get approved, it has no authority over cosmetics and personal care products. It doesn\u2019t require beauty companies to conduct safety tests, and it doesn\u2019t review or approve/reject most of the ingredients included in formulations. The FDA only gets involved if a product is considered a medication. Furthermore, with the exception of a few prohibited substances, cosmetic companies can use any ingredient they want\u2014again, without government oversight. The cosmetics industry is essentially responsible for policing itself\u2014and you can imagine how that turns out\u2026 There is a panel that reviews ingredients, but to date, it has only deemed 11 unsafe\u2014and this doesn\u2019t amount to a ban, just a \u201crecommendation to not use.\u201d In stark contrast, the European Union (which consists of 28 countries) has banned more than 1,300 compounds from cosmetics due to evidence that they could potentially lead to cancer, genetic mutations, birth defects, infertility, neurological issues, and other health complaints. Over the past several years, consumers have become familiar with some of the more damaging ingredients commonly found in cosmetics and other personal care products. Parabens, phthalates, propylene glycol, and sulfates are a few of the top offenders\u2014so much so that a lot of well-known shampoos and soaps now boast \u201cno parabens\u201d or \u201cno sulfates\u201d on their bottles. Obviously, savvy consumers have demanded change\u2014and the beauty industry has been forced to comply. We\u2019re seeing a move in the right direction\u2026slow as it may be. We\u2019re also seeing new variations of products with marketing taglines such as \u201call-natural,\u201d \u201corganic,\u201d and \u201csafe.\u201d Which brings me back to mineral makeup\u2026\n\nIs Mineral Makeup Safer?\n\nFor a long time, liquid foundation was the main makeup option to even out skin tone and cover up blemishes. Its origins date all the way back to the Ancient Greeks and Romans, who wore sometimes-lethal blends of white lead and mercury to achieve extremely pale skin tone. (It represented privilege and higher class.) Foundation formulas have obviously become safer in the centuries that have followed, but still, questionable ingredients remain. Propylene glycol, talc, aluminum starch, sodium chloride, benzyl alcohol\u2026these are just some of the problematic ingredients in one major cosmetic brand\u2019s liquid foundation. Mineral makeup provides an alternative to liquid foundations. It feels lighter on the skin, and it even has some pretty impressive benefits. Mineral makeup sits on top of the skin rather than soaking in, which helps reduce the risk of clogged pores, breakouts, and other irritation. Many women find it to be much more gentle and soothing than traditional liquid foundation, which is great for skin that is sensitive or suffers from acne, rosacea, or dermatitis. Mineral makeup also creates a barrier on the skin, offering a layer of sun protection. However, it\u2019s important to note that not all mineral makeup is created equal. A little bit of digging is necessary to discover the truth about some mineral makeup brands. Remember, no outside entities regulate what the cosmetic industry does and advertises. So, many mineral makeup brands may claim to be natural and even organic, when they\u2019re far from it. In fact, a product can be labeled \u201call-natural mineral makeup\u201d yet only contain 1-2% actual minerals, and the rest synthetic fillers. What sets true mineral makeup apart is not just what it contains, but what it\n\nReferences\n\nEnvironmental Working Group. Last accessed July 13, 2018.\n\nCampaign for Safe Cosmetics.

High-quality mineral makeup is made primarily of iron oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, mica, or magnesium. If you really want to minimize your exposure to unnecessary and potentially harmful chemicals, find a brand that contains mainly these ingredients and few (or no) other fillers. Ingredients such as parfum/fragrance , waxes, synthetic oils, dyes, preservatives (parabens), etc. are cheap fillers that may irritate your skin and expose you to the very compounds you\u2019re trying to avoid in the first place. Bottom line: Yes, mineral makeup can be a safer alternative. Just make sure you check the ingredient list and read up on the manufacturer. A good place to research cosmetics and personal care products that are safer and contain fewer harmful ingredients is the Environmental Working Group\u2019s Skin Deep database", "description": "If you\u2019re a woman who wears makeup, you\u2019ve likely noticed .09/02/2019 3:14:39AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
