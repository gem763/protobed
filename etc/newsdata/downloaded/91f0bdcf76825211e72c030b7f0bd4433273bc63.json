It's a major step for proving the worthiness of the highly regulated and much-hyped technology.\n\n\"This is a big step forward in safely integrating unmanned aircraft systems into our airspace, expanding access to healthcare in North Carolina and building on the success of the national UAS Integration Pilot Program to maintain American leadership in unmanned aviation,\" Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao said in an FAA release on Tuesday.\n\nRead more: UPS drivers are ditching commercial navigation apps for an in-house tool. The chief engineering and information officer explains how it's already saving the company millions.\n\n\"This certification allows us to fly an unlimited number of drones and an unlimited number of flights with an unlimited number of remote operators,\" Bala Ganesh, who is the vice president of UPS's advanced technology group, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The idea is that now we have the unlock to start scaling throughout the country,\" Ganesh added.\n\nHowever, UPS isn't the first company to receive Part 135 certification.\n\nAnother drone operator \u2014 Wing, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet \u2014 also has the certification. But the scope of its operation is limited to a town called Christiansburg, Virginia.\n\nRead more: Autonomous trucks are now moving UPS loads \u2014 and it shows that driverless trucks may be just a few years away from disrupting the $800 billion trucking industry\n\nIn September, Wing announced that it would pilot deliveries of FedEx Express packages and Walgreens medicine and wellness goods to customers' homes in the Southwest Virginia town, about 210 miles away from the state capital Richmond. In recent years, companies ranging from Domino's to Amazon have made highly publicized pushes into drone delivery.\n\nBut no company has managed to establish a regular, revenue-generating business from the drones. UPS said in March that it was the first to do that.\n\nYour Amazon packages won't arrive by drone anytime soon\n\nHowever, don't expect your Amazon packages or other deliveries to arrive via drone anytime soon. Ganesh at UPS said the weight limit for the Matternet drones currently in operation is five pounds.\n\nThat's why UPS is currently working with hospitals and in healthcare industry \u2014 where there's already a clear use case for how drones can be economically beneficial.\n\n\"There's a lot of economic opportunity on these use cases, before we look at what consumers intuitively kind of think about,\" Ganesh told Business Insider.\n\n\"People just jump to 'when are we going to see coffee being delivered on the front yard?'\" he added. \"But to get to that kind of cost viability, it's going to take some time.\"\n\nInstead, in the next few months, Ganesh said UPS's drone network will be expanding to more hospitals. Presently at WakeMed, UPS drones move lifesaving specimens, like blood or organ samples, from building to building in just over three minutes \u2014 a significant time-saver compared to moving these samples by car, which can take up to 30 minutes in traffic.\n\nHowever, UPS is testing B2C uses for drones in rural areas \u2014 where flying drones is more feasible and more cost-effective than in packed urban settings.\n\nWhat's taking drones so long?\n\nThe financial drawbacks for implementing drones have hamstrung tech companies and retailers alike. That explains why a B2B setting \u2014 providing drones for hospitals \u2014 is where drones saw their first revenue-generating success in the US.\n\nElsewhere, the sluggishness in drone technology adoption is due partially to government regulation. The BBC reported in December that governments worldwide were worried about the potential for \"rogue drone use\" and the safety concerns that could stem from drones malfunctioning and falling from the sky.\n\nBut in May 2018, the Department of Transportation took a major step in better regulating the commercial use of drones, announcing that 10 state, local, and tribal governments were approved to work with private corporations to test drone technology. The North Carolina Department of Transportation, working with UPS and Matternet, is one of the participants, though UPS's involvement in the program was previously undisclosed.", "description": "UPS will now be able to operate drones anywhere in the US \u2014 an industry first that could prove whether drones are financially feasible.", "authors": ["Rachel Premack"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d92568e2e22af294006d72b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
