The outfield is pretty slow and Nathan Lyon cuts off the ball before it reaches the boundary. Advertisement ENG 63-1, Burns 28, Root 21 Cummins jags one off the seam back at Joe Root. It went a long way and beat the bat, the stumps, everything. Cummins then moves one away from Root beating the outside edge. What was I saying about batting getting easier? ENG 63-1, Burns 28, Root 21 Batting looks to be getting easier now. The ball isn't doing as much and the pitch looks pretty good. Burns defends the rest of Siddle's over.

ENG 51-1, Burns 23, Root 14 The first hour belongs to England. After winning the toss and bowling Australia have been poor with the ball.

Root takes one as well with a push into the offside. ENG 49-1, Burns 22, Root 13 Peter Siddle has been poor with the ball and so Mitchell Marsh is introduced into the attack.

Siddle has been too short and it's allowed Root and Burns to score freely. ENG 49-1, Burns 22, Root 13 Better from Siddle.
