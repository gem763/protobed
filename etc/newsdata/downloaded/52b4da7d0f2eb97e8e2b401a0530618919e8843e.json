He further commented that while he has spoken about political issues in the past when he thought it was in the company\u2019s best interests, he did not think that doing so at this time would be a good idea.\n\nDisney is set to release a new streaming service, called \u201cDisney+,\u201d within several weeks.\n\nThe recent standoff between the NBA and China began when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of Hong Kong protesters. Morey swiftly removed the tweet and apologized to Chinese fans, however the Chinese Basketball Association severed all contact with the Rockets in retaliation. The Chinese government blocked TV coverage of two NBA exhibition games being held in China.\n\nESPN sports channel anchors were instructed to refrain from political commentary on the controversy. ESPN is owned by Disney, which is planning to release an ESPN streaming service as well.\n\nDisney operates a theme park in Shanghai and generates billions of dollars in revenue in the Chinese market.\n\nNebraska Senator Ben Sasse slammed Iger in a statement.\n\n\u201cSell your soul to save your profits\u2019 is going to be a helluva plotline for Frozen 2,\u201d said Sasse. \u201cThere are about a million Uyghurs in Chinese communist prisons who aren\u2019t going to be visiting the Magic Kingdom anytime soon.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, former Los Angeles Lakers star Shaquille O\u2019Neal defended Morey\u2019s original tweet, which read \u201cFight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs American people, we do a lot of business in China,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cAnd they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we\u2019re allowed to speak up on injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes.\u201d", "description": "\"To take a position that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake,\" Disney CEO Robert Iger told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
