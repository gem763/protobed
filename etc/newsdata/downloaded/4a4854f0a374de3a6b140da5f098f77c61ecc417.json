Maybe\u2026", "language": "en", "text": "Every case is different, but many players return from a torn Achilles in about nine to 10 months. Kobe Bryant pushed and did it in eight. Other players will take a full year.\n\nIf Kevin Durant returned in nine months it would be March, enough time to get in game shape and be ready for the Nets\u2019 playoff run.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere\u2019s a growing sense from teams we could see just that scenario, and Spencer Dinwiddie talked about it with Brian Lewis of the New York Post.\n\nThough Nets GM Sean Marks refused to rule Durant out for the season, the feeling within the league is trending toward him potentially playing this season. \u201cI know KD is taking the rehab process ultra-serious. He wants to come back as soon as it\u2019s appropriate, and healthy and the right decision for him, and then also subsequently that would also be the right decision for,\u201d said Dinwiddie, who points out that even a slightly-diminished Durant could still be a superstar. \u201cThe beautiful part about this is, the man is 7-foot and one of the best shooters of all time. At worst you get Dirk [Nowitzki], and Dirk was a monster. So we\u2019re ready for him to come back whenever he wants to and whenever he\u2019s ready to do so, and we know that he\u2019s going to be a phenomenal major piece of our roster.\u201d\n\nDurant is an intense competitor who wants to get back on the court. He pushed to get back from a calf injury and play in the NBA Finals only to suffer the Achilles tear. He\u2019s smart enough to be sure he\u2019s all the way back before he steps on the court, if that means he sits out a full season so be it. However, he absolutely could return this season.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf he\u2019s back, the Nets go from interesting team to potential threat to the Bucks and Sixers at the top of the conference. Durant was the best player in the world the past couple of years and he could return to that status quickly, and lift Brooklyn up with him.", "description": "If he returns in nine months it would be March.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nvKlXP6IM_2Jie2UK7qdTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTkuNjQ4NjA5MDc3NTk4OA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FGW6pcsGAeAkWi4kKK926A--~B/aD0zODQ7dz02ODM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/e7c6d968e3761312c942648ffe185c54", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
