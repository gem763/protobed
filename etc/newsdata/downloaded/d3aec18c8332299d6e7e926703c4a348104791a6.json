Some guys prefer a more form-fitting pair with a built-in liner, while others love the comfort of a simple pair of basketball shorts. There\u2019s no one universal gym short for everyone, of course; gym shorts come in a wide range of lengths and styles, so the main things to look for in a good pair are a comfortable fit and a high-tech moisture-wicking material. And bonus points for pairs that look as good when you\u2019re on the treadmill as they do when you\u2019re picking up your post-gym protein shake. Besides those details, though, it really comes down to personal preference. To help narrow down the field, we spoke with a bunch of stylish guys \u2014 from personal trainers to casual gymgoers \u2014 about their favorite gym shorts. The majority tended to favor pairs with built-in liners, which they say provide more support and comfort during a workout, so most of the gym shorts on our list reflect that preference. Still, a lot of the featured pairs also come in versions without liners, so we noted that wherever relevant.\n\nBest 5-inch gym shorts\n\nNike Flex Stride 2-in-1 Running Shorts While a 7-inch inseam length was the general crowd favorite, some guys like a shorter short for working out. Chris Keyloun, a coach at New York City rowing studio Rowgatta, is a fan of these 5-inch Nike gym shorts, which have built-in compression shorts beneath their looser outer layer. \u201cThey\u2019re technically [made] for running,\u201d Keyloun says, but he likes them for cardio rowing workouts too. \u201cThe built-in compression ensures comfort, while the 5-inch length keeps you free from snags on the slide of the boat or rower.\u201d These are also available linerless. $50 at Nike Buy\n\nOutdoor Voices 5\u201d Runner\u2019s High Short Copywriter Jon Roth is a fan of Outdoor Voices\u2019s 5-inch gym shorts. \u201cSince I mostly hate exercise, finding cool workout clothes has been a good motivator,\u201d he told us. \u201cThese are cut high enough to show some thigh, but also lined so nothing else shows.\u201d The stock is low on this specific pair at the moment, but the brand told us that its 5-inch lined Rec Shorts are very similar, with availability in all sizes and multiple color options. $65 at Outdoor Voices Buy\n\nBest 7-inch gym shorts\n\nLululemon Pace Breaker Short 7-Inch Lined Lululemon was the most popular brand of gym shorts among the guys we talked to, with three of the men we spoke with recommending it by name. These 7-inch lined Lululemon shorts are another favorite of Keyloun, who says they\u2019re a great all-around short. He likes that the \u201ccomfortable liner allows you to move in all directions,\u201d and is also a fan of the well-placed pockets, including a \u201czipper pocket\u201d made to hold smartphones. \u201cIt will hold your phone securely in place whether you\u2019re rowing a 6k or sprinting a 2k,\u201d Keyloun says. Lululemon makes a linerless version too, if that\u2019s your preference. $68 at Lululemon Buy\n\nRhone 7-Inch Swift Lined Another 7-inch lined short comes recommended by our former deputy editor, Jason Chen, who says, \u201cI\u2019m not a liner guy, but this lining feels incredible.\u201d These are marketed as running shorts, but would work well for any type of workout. They also have \u201cperforated venting\u201d along the sides, in addition to zipper pockets for keeping your belongings in place. Chen says the shorts \u201cmade running eight miles in Prospect Park a breeze.\u201d $88 at Rhone Buy\n\nTen Thousand 7-Inch Lined Interval Short Certified personal trainer Ariel Brill thinks Ten Thousand makes some of the best gym shorts around, and he loves the \u201clightweight stretch fabric\u201d on the brand\u2019s Interval Short, a pair he says would be great for any sort of \u201cheavy lifting at the gym.\u201d The waistband is designed not to bunch up, and these also have a zipper pocket should you need it. The shorts come with a built-in liner, but they\u2019re also available without it. $68 at Ten Thousand Buy\n\nNike Men's 7-Inch Running Shorts Grub Street editor Alan Sytsma says these 7-inch lined Nike running shorts are \u201cjust short enough to avoid being baggy without being so short and extreme that I look like a marathon wannabe.\u201d He adds that, in addition to the \u201cever-crucial side pockets,\u201d these also have \u201can even-more-crucial, but rarely seen, interior back pocket\u201d that\u2019s great for storing your keys during a run. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nTBMPOY Men's 7-Inch Running Shorts with Zipper Pockets (2 Count) For affordable gym shorts, master personal trainer Joey Levy of Corefit 101 swears by this two-pack of unlined 7-inch gym shorts from TBMPOY. He says they\u2019re a great all-around option for any type of workout, and loves that the pockets have zippers. If you\u2019re deciding between lined or unlined gym shorts, Levy notes that one benefit of linerless options like these is that you don\u2019t need to worry about washing them every time you wear them. $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest 8-inch gym shorts\n\nVuori Lined Kore Short, 8-Inches \u201cVuori makes some of the most comfortable and durable gym shorts,\u201d according to Brill, who likes the versatility of this pair (which is lined) and says it would be great for any \u201csport or outdoor activity.\u201d Tim Sensi of the popular YouTube channel Yoga With Tim is also a fan of Vuori and told us its shorts are among his favorites for yoga. \u201cI love anything that fits comfortably and is not too loud of flashy,\u201d says Sensi. $68 at Vuori Buy\n\nAlo Yoga Advance 2-in-1 Short Brill also loves these \u201c2-in-1\u201d shorts from Alo Yoga, which he says \u201cprovide the flexibility to help you hold any yoga pose.\u201d These come with a built-in boxer-brief-style lining, but Brill told us that Alo Yoga also makes a great unlined yoga short for those who prefer that style. $98 at Alo Yoga Buy\n\nBest 9-inch gym shorts\n\nLululemon 9-Inch Lined Pace Breaker Short Matt Jared, co-founder of yoga and meditation nonprofit United We Om, is another Lululemon Pace Breaker fan, but he prefers the slightly longer 9-inch version. \u201cI wear these shorts when I teach yoga because the fit is loose and relaxed, but they stay in place and don\u2019t pinch, no matter what shape I find myself in during class,\u201d he says, adding that he \u201cespecially likes the liner, which has serious moisture-wicking capabilities and keeps everything in place.\u201d Like their 7-inch cousins, these are also available without the liner. $68 at Lululemon Buy\n\nSAXX 2N1 Kinetic Train Short, 9-Inches \u201cThese are my go-to training short whether I\u2019m working out at the gym or at home,\u201d says Sean Sewell, a personal trainer who runs the gear-review site Engearment and the online-fitness program Mountain Fitness School. Sewell owns \u201cthree or four pairs\u201d of these Kinetic Train shorts from Saxx. \u201cThey\u2019re more expensive, but you\u2019re getting a semi-compression short and a high-quality Lululemon-type gym short,\u201d he explains. Sewell\u2019s favorite part of these shorts is the signature \u201cBallpark Pouch\u201d liner that he says \u201ckeeps everything in place and provides support.\u201d He adds that they also make a 7-inch version, which some might prefer, but he thinks the 9-inch length \u201cis really comfortable for most men, especially taller men.\u201d $78 at SAXX Buy\n\nBest 10-inch gym shorts\n\nUnder Armour Men's Tech Graphic Shorts $20 (was $25, now 20% off) While form-fitting gym shorts with built-in liners were generally the most popular style, some of the guys we spoke with preferred the comfort of an unlined and slightly looser short. For that, Levy likes these simple and affordable 10-inch shorts from Under Armour. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nKuhl Renegade Shorts, 10-Inches For something a little more casual that can work at the gym or on a hike (or on a hike around town), Sewell loves the 10-inch unlined \u201cRenegade\u201d shorts from Kuhl, which he says are \u201cvery comfortable.\u201d Sewell, who lives in Denver, told us that \u201chere in Colorado, everyone wears these because you never know when a hike\u2019s going to break out.\u201d Since they have \u201ca little more material\u201d than other gym shorts, he wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend them for high-intensity workouts, but he says they\u2019re great for everything else. From $55 at REI Buy\n\nBest compression gym shorts\n\n2XU Men's MCS Run Compression Shorts For \u201creally strenuous training sessions,\u201d however, Sewell likes to wear compression shorts, and he says 2xU makes a great pair. \u201cSome people probably have the confidence to rock these on their own,\u201d he adds, but Sewell prefers to wear them underneath a pair of unlined gym shorts. As far as the benefits of compression shorts, he says, \u201cI feel they just give a little extra support. If you\u2019re doing a really deep squat you want a lot of support.\u201d $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
