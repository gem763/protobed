In such situations, the result shall be declared a draw and Teams will be allocated two Match points each and no score registered.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAs outlined during Thursday\u2019s media conference in Tokyo, the core principle that could enable us to explore a departure from the terms of participation, is a fair and consistent application of the rescheduling for all teams in a safe environment for teams, fans and essential match services.\n\n\u201cThe sheer predicted scale and impact of the typhoon, and the complexity of team movements for eight matches, meant that an even-handed application was just not possible without putting safety at risk. Therefore, it was the fair and correct decision for all teams to maintain the position outlined in the terms of participation.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate to make further comment at a time when we are fully focused on the safety of everyone and this weekend\u2019s matches.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s Pool C decider with France and New Zealand\u2019s game against Italy have already been cancelled on Saturday.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is one of the largest tropical storms to threaten Japan for decades.\n\nThe nature of extreme weather means the exact path of the typhoon is somewhat hard to predict, though tropical storms are among the most easy to forecast and predictable natural disasters.\n\nAs things stand, Scotland-Japan will go ahead as scheduled, with World Rugby chiefs to make an assessment and final decision on the morning of the game.\n\nScotland earlier on Friday revealed they had taken legal advice on potentially challenging any decision to cancel the fixture, and that a 24-hour postponement would be a suitable workaround.\n\n\u201cWorld Rugby is pointing us back to the participation agreement. We\u2019ve had legal opinion \u2013 from a leading QC \u2013 that challenges World Rugby\u2019s interpretation,\u201d SRU chief executive Mark Dodson said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that (it\u2019s too late) \u2013 we have to challenge it. But we should be talking about this from a rugby perspective, this is about the game and the rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby. The common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later on perfect safety where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed, and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.\u201d", "description": "World Rugby have hit back at Scotland rugby\u2018s \u201cdisappointing\u201d comments on the potential cancellation of their clash with Japan rugby.
