I would never say it after a defeat.\n\n'We were punished in some defeats and I shut my mouth, I didn't say anything, so it is what it is.'\n\nGuardiola also does not want to complain about the problems that have forced him to play players out of their natural positions in recent weeks.\n\nCity struggled to break down a stubborn Aston Villa side in the first 45 minutes at the Etihad\n\nRaheem Sterling broke the deadlock just after half time as City eventually romped home 3-0\n\nThis has most notably occurred in defence, where Fernandinho and Rodri have had to cover for injuries. John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi are now fit again, but Rodri has since picked up an injury and Fernandinho will be suspended for the Carabao Cup clash with Southampton on Tuesday.\n\nGuardiola said: 'For the short term we can handle it. For a long time, I don't know.\n\n'And of course against top, top, top, top teams, when you don't have players playing in their own position, I don't know what's going to happen.\n\n'But before it's going to happen I'm not going to say it's a disaster or what a pity.'\n\nCity made the breakthrough in the first minute of the second half as Ederson went route one, Gabriel Jesus nodded on and Sterling raced through to score.", "description": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola criticised his players' first half performance against Aston Villa, claiming that his side would be relegated if they continued to play as they did in the opening 45 mins.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20261422-0-image-a-26_1572222887964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
