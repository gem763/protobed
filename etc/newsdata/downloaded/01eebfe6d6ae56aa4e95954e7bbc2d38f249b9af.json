Trump's allies in the Senate are trying to focus public attention anywhere but on Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAnd without a centralized strategy from the White House, House Republicans are taking their cues from Trump, who is treating Schiff as a punching bag in the impeachment fight.\n\nTrump and the GOP are targeting Schiff\u2019s mid-hearing exaggerated rendition of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine to make it sound like a mob boss shakedown and invoking a New York Times report that the whistleblower sought guidance from an Intelligence Committee aide, which Republicans have used to allege without evidence that Schiff helped write the complaint.\n\n\u201cWe need to put everyone on record whether you approve of that type of conduct in conducting an impeachment inquiry,\u201d added Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the new chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who drafted the censure resolution on Schiff.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nThe GOP, however, is having an increasingly difficult time avoiding the more explosive aspects of the Ukraine scandal. On Thursday, Trump openly called for China to open up an investigation into the Biden family \u2014 which is at the center of Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation. And Hill Republicans kept quiet.\n\n\"Almost all of my Republican colleagues remain inexplicably silent in the face of President Trump\u2019s abuse of power \u2014 likely counting on distractions and false narratives that foreign governments have been asked to investigate,\u201d said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \"The plain fact is that President Trump misused the Oval Office to ask a foreign leader to find dirt on a political opponent.\"\n\nIndeed, House Republican leaders are desperately trying to refocus the narrative. In addition to backing the censure resolution and furiously tweeting about Schiff, McCarthy fired off a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday demanding that she halt the impeachment inquiry until Democrats answer more questions about the entire process, which the GOP has tried to cast as \u201crigged.\u201d Republicans are arguing that Democrats are hellbent on undoing the results of the 2016 election.\n\nPelosi shot back at McCarthy with a letter of her own, drawing attention to the one issue Republicans don't want to talk about.\n\n\"As you know, our founders were specifically intent on ensuring that foreign entities did not undermine the integrity of our elections,\" she wrote. \"I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\"\n\nScalise, meanwhile, held a conference call with his whip team Thursday afternoon to discuss next steps and outline a series of all-conference member briefings on impeachment that leadership plans to hold when Congress returns from recess, according to a person on the call. Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) also gave an update on the party\u2019s messaging strategy and Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) talked about his experience as a manager during the Clinton impeachment.\n\n\"Clearly, Trump has been vocal on Twitter and he's very effective. But on our side, we want to make sure our members have all their questions answered while giving them the perspective of what impeachment is supposed to be under the constitution, and how Pelosi is trying to rig it,\" Scalise said.\n\nAcross the Capitol, most Senate Republicans have spent recess in extraordinarily quiet fashion. Many left town generally insisting they hadn\u2019t read the whistleblower report and have spent the congressional recess hunkered down as they try and hold on to their tenuous majority.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has criticized Trump for his conduct in the past, said it was the right course.\n\n\u201cI would just say to all of my friends on both sides of the aisle, that I would absolutely say nothing. Nothing,\u201d Corker said at an event in Chattanooga, Tenn. \u201cIt\u2019s just not appropriate, in my opinion, for senators to be making statements at this juncture.\u201d\n\nBut the quiet GOP senators are obscured by a loud band of Trump defenders, who have spent the past week penning letters to foreign leaders and the intelligence community and devising legislation to troll Joe Biden. It\u2019s an ad hoc strategy by a handful of senators that isn\u2019t being coordinated by Republican leaders, according to two people familiar with party strategy, but has served to redirect public attention away from the Democrats\u2019 central argument that Trump inappropriately coordinated with foreign governments.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote to foreign leaders from Australia, Italy and Britain and urged them to cooperate with Attorney General William Barr\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election. Graham wrote that an Australian diplomat gave the government information as part of the U.S. effort to monitor the 2016 election, a charge that the Australian ambassador to the United States rejected on Thursday in a letter to Graham.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) urged the whistleblower to reveal him- or herself, arguing back in Kentucky this week that \u201cif you\u2019re accusing somebody of something with the ramifications of impeachment, I think really the person ought to come forward.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has penned legislation that would prevent senior government officials\u2019 family from serving on the boards of Ukrainian companies, an obvious ding at Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his role at Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nAnd Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have repeatedly raised questions about changes to federal whistleblower policy despite pushback from the intelligence community itself. Johnson and Grassley wrote to Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, on Wednesday afternoon asking him to start an investigation into who leaked details from the whistleblower report and the phone call.\n\n\u201cNews reports used anonymous sources to report on information relating to the complaint and phone call that were classified at the time. There was only a finite amount of individuals that had access to the complaint and phone call transcript,\u201d the two senators wrote.\n\nYet, Grassley also scolded Trump and other Republicans for attacking the whistleblower earlier this week, suggesting he isn\u2019t going all in as a Trump defender just yet. And Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said Thursday \"whistleblowers should be protected. I stand with Chuck Grassley.\"\n\nBut that's not what McCarthy sounds like these days. And after McCarthy wrote to Pelosi on Thursday afternoon asking her to stop the impeachment inquiry and respond to a series of questions about the impeachment process, Trump\u2019s approval followed soon after.\n\n\u201cLeader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don\u2019t have a chance!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nJohn Bresnahan contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8b/55/200cde7c41b69091417887ead93f/191003-scalise-mccarthy-getty-773.jpg"}
