Images on TV and social media showed flames shooting up residential hillsides, fanned by winds of up to 50mph.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation that we\u2019ve had in Santa Clarita,\u201d Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles county supervisor, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is being done to make sure that we protect not only life but property but also allow our firefighters and first responders to get up there to fight these fires.\u201d\n\nRelated: California wildfires: flames leave destruction across the state \u2013 in pictures\n\nMeanwhile, in northern California, the Kincade fire, which broke out late Wednesday night, continued to ravage the wine-growing region of Sonoma county. The fire has so far destroyed nearly 50 structures and forced the evacuation of 2,000 people in and around Geyserville, a small town and popular tourist destination.\n\nBoth fires are only 5% contained.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, on Friday declared a local emergency to assist with battling the blazes, but firefighters are facing extremely challenging weather conditions \u2013 including strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures of up to 90F. A meteorologist has described the statewide weather event as an \u201catmospheric hairdryer\u201d.\n\nAnd the utility Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has announced it plans power shutoffs across northern California over the weekend, when strong winds are expected to pick up. More than 2 million people are expected to be affected by the blackouts.\n\n\u2018A wall of black smoke\u2019\n\nThe Tick fire has upended life in the suburban Santa Clarita Valley, about 40 miles (60 km) north of downtown Los Angeles, which has been used as the backdrop for many movies and television productions and is home to the Magic Mountain amusement park.\n\nThe fire, which began in Tick Canyon, has spread \u201caggressively\u201d in the last 24 hours.\n\nLocal resident Charles Lindsey, 68, described \u201ca wall of black smoke\u201d and \u201c2o to 30ft flames\u201d. He spent hours trying to protect his home but was eventually forced to evacuate.\n\nClimate scientists had warned for several days before the wildfires broke out that this would be a week of especially intense fire weather across California. Smoke from the two fires is also disrupting life in two of the state\u2019s biggest cities.\n\nA smokey haze drifting toward the Bay Area of San Francisco prompted warnings to residents to stay indoors, close windows and use masks. Los Angeles officials closed dozens of schools in the San Fernando Valley, just south of the blazes, because of fears over hazardous breathing conditions. Warnings that smoke could affect flights at San Francisco and San Jose international airports were also issued on Friday morning.\n\nFirefighters are reckoning with other blazes outside of the Tick and Kincade fires. A brush fire near San Diego, dubbed the Miller fire, started around 1pm and had consumed 10 acres by late afternoon, menacing homes and sending plumes of smoke into the air. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection\u2019s live fire tracking tool identified more than 10 active fires on Friday.\n\nQuestions arise for major power company\n\nCalifornia\u2019s largest utility company, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), is facing scrutiny over the origins of the Kincade fire. On Friday PG&E admitted its electrical equipment may have ignited the blaze.\n\nStrong winds earlier in the week had prompted PG&E to impose sweeping blackouts affecting a half-million people in northern and central California. Power was restored to most people by Thursday evening, PG&E said.\n\nHowever, PG&E said it didn\u2019t turn off a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville that malfunctioned minutes before the fire erupted. The utility reported finding a \u201cbroken jumper\u201d wire on a transmission tower Wednesday night.\n\nBill Johnson, the PG&E CEO, said it was too soon to know if the faulty equipment sparked the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition.", "description": "* Kincade fire in wine country has destroyed nearly 50 structures    * Southern California Tick fire has grown to 4,300 acresFirefighters battle a wind-driven wildfire in the hills of Canyon Country north of Los Angeles, California.
