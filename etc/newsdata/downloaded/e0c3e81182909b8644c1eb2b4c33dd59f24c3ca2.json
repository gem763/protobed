CleanCo has already been handed a shortlist of ten renewable generation and storage projects from which it is expected to select its first generation projects from next year.\n\nProblem is it makes little commercial sense to build more generation in Queensland at the moment. The state is in oversupply. Queensland\u2019s 13GW of conventional generation has been augmented over the last decade by more than 5GW of new rooftop solar and large-scale renewables. There\u2019s more still coming.\n\nQueensland sends its surplus electricity south to help power NSW. That\u2019s been particularly lucrative recently. NSW wholesale prices increased after the Hazelwood power station closed in Victoria in 2017, as NSW generators scrambled to find enough extra coal to cover the shortfall.\n\nBut the current boom in new renewable generation along the east coast combined with a new interconnector between SA and NSW means there will be less demand for Queensland\u2019s abundant electricity after this summer. That means Queensland wholesale prices will soften without CleanCo having to lift a finger.\n\nThere is already so much surplus solar generation in Queensland that during the middle of mild, sunny days wholesale prices regularly fall below zero. This is exacerbated by the contract positions of many coal generators. Large-scale solar generators regularly curtail their output, cutting into their revenue.\n\nIf CleanCo was run like a commercial business, it would augment its handy firming assets by contracting existing renewable generators, or look to acquire some of these increasingly distressed assets.\n\nWhether it contracts, buys or builds its renewables, CleanCo is expected to shift upwards the frequency with which it stores and dispatches from the Wivenhoe Dam. This would enable it to improve the value of oversupplied lunchtime solar power to more valuable evening and morning peaks.\n\nIt may not be quite so easy in practice. Wivenhoe loses around 40 per cent of the electricity it consumes to pump water uphill. The more frequently it dispatches, the less flexible it is to get the critical arbitrage needed to recover these efficiency losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese operational choices are marginal. The fundamental barrier to building new renewables in Queensland is existing coal. Removing it will require a carefully managed, orderly exit choreographed around the completion of adequate replacement capacity.\n\nLast week The Australian Financial Review reported that the Palaszczuk Government had suddenly decided to bring forward the closure date of the 700MW Callide B power station by a decade to 2028.\n\nCallide B was only commissioned in 1989. In coal power station years it\u2019s still a pup. The Queensland Government is trying to wave the announcement off as just a technical adjustment. In reality, removing Callide B early is the only way CleanCo is going to work.\n\nAccepting that reality evaporates CleanCo\u2019s political marketing. The lesson from South Australia and Victoria is simple: the magic pudding story of building more renewables to bring down electricity prices is temporary. When coal generators exit they reduce supply, prices rebound and greenhouse emissions fall.\n\nThis transition from coal to clean is central to the future of electricity in Australia. It should be signalled well in advance to minimise its impact, not hushed up as if it\u2019s never going to happen.", "description": "Queensland must take out coal generation to make way for state-owned CleanCo.
