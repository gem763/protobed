The data is gathered from U.S. Internet service providers and tech firms, however, and includes a significant but unknown number of Americans\u2019 communications.\n\nCourt opinions disclosed Tuesday by U.S. intelligence officials also show that, despite concerns raised by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the FBI resisted for nearly a year to change its procedures for tracking its queries for the data of Americans.\n\nIn August, the FBI acquiesced and agreed to distinguish between queries made using Americans\u2019 phone numbers and email addresses and those that do not, among other changes it has made to address the court\u2019s concerns.\n\nIn the most noteworthy violation disclosed Tuesday, the FBI in March 2017 conducted queries on databases using more than 70,000 email addresses or phone numbers of FBI employees or contractors. The bureau proceeded with the queries despite the advice of its general counsel, though it did not review the results, according to an October 2018 court opinion.\n\nIn another incident, reported in April 2018, the FBI made a series of queries using the emails or phone numbers of 57,000 individuals.\n\nIn both instances, the aim was to uncover foreign intelligence information, which is consistent with the law. But the nature of the searches \u2014 whether for counterintelligence purposes or otherwise \u2014 was not clear from the redacted rulings released Tuesday.\n\nThere were other incidents which involved queries for only one person\u2019s information, which the court found less concerning than the \u201cbatch\u201d queries. But the individual cases nonetheless ran afoul of the law because the FBI had not shown a reasonable belief that the queries were designed to retrieve foreign intelligence information, Judge James E. Boasberg found in the October 2018 opinion.\n\nBoasberg also ruled that the bureau failed to distinguish when its queries involved U.S. people and non-U.S. people, and that it did not adequately document its justification for the queries.\n\nCongress in January 2018 revised Section 702, creating a requirement that the FBI account for each query it made for a U.S. person\u2019s data.\n\nBoasberg criticized what he called the \u201cbroad and apparently suspicionless nature\u201d of the batch queries, and the \u201clack of common understanding\u201d within the FBI and Justice Department of what it means for a query to be \u201creasonably likely\u201d to return foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime.\n\nHe said the FBI believed that \u201caggregation\u201d of individual queries could satisfy the standard even if an individual query might not. The bureau, he said, hypothesized a situation in which a federal contractor might have access to secrets that were compromised, and the bureau might then search for 100 of the firm\u2019s employees to see if it turned up evidence of a crime.\n\n\u201cBy no stretch of language could one say that an individual query for a randomly selected one of those 100 employees would be reasonably likely to return foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime,\u201d he said.\n\nOne congressional aide said that, in his view, the FBI\u2019s violations were \u201cnot particularly alarming\u201d and related more to \u201cFBI culture\u201d than a willful attempt to flout the law. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive law enforcement practices.\n\nRather than addressing Boasberg\u2019s concern that its failure to distinguish between American and foreign searches violated the law, the FBI chose to appeal. It said that being forced to keep track of searches in that way would hamper its ability to carry out its mission. In July, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld Boasberg\u2019s decision. And in September, Boasberg approved the FBI\u2019s new procedures.\n\nIn a briefing Tuesday, a senior FBI official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive law enforcement practices, stressed that the bureau queried its Section 702 holdings not only to respond to specific threats, but also to \u201cproactively\u201d identify threats the FBI might not be aware of. \u201cIf we\u2019re not aggressive enough, the American public is at risk,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf we\u2019re too aggressive, we\u2019ll have numerous compliance incidents and erode confidence of the FISC, Congress and the American public.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a vocal critic of the FBI\u2019s resistance to accounting for its U.S. person searches, said, \u201cToday\u2019s release demonstrates how baseless the FBI\u2019s position was.\u201d\n\nThe congressional aide said the changes in the FBI\u2019s procedures will be \u201cextensive but needed.\u201d And, the aide added, \u201cthey\u2019re likely to be costly, in the millions.\u201d", "description": "The FBI delayed addressing privacy concerns raised by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.", "authors": ["Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "October At Pm", "Ellen Nakashima Is A National Security Reporter For The Washington Post.
