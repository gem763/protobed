This is all true. But if you\u2019re focused on blue light as a major problem affecting your sleep or your eye health, it\u2019s time to step back and get a little perspective.\n\nAs Philip Yuhas, a professor of optometry, writes at The Conversation, blue light isn\u2019t a uniquely technological evil. It\u2019s part of sunlight, and your eyes are exposed to plenty of it all the time. You\u2019re fine.\n\nThere are studies in mice that have found blue light can damage the eyes, but mice are nocturnal creatures whose eyes are different from ours. The pigments and the lenses of our eyes actually block blue light fairly well \u2014 so in a sense, we already have built-in blue blocking protection.\n\nAdding more protection isn\u2019t likely to help, though. You can buy glasses and screen filters that block blue light, but Yuhas points out they are probably a waste of money:\n\nthe products that my patients ask about do not block out much blue light. The leading blue-blocking anti-reflective coating, for example, blocks only about 15% of the blue light that screens emit. You could get the same reduction just by holding your phone another inch from your face. Try it now and see if you notice a difference. No? Then it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that a recent meta-analysis concluded that blue-blocking lenses and coatings have no significant effect on sleep quality, comfort at the computer, or retinal health.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn\u2019t recommend blue-blocking products, either. Instead, if you\u2019re concerned about your eye health or your ability to get to sleep on time, you already know what to do:", "description": "Blue light before bedtime can make it harder to sleep, and the screens on phones, computers, and televisions emit plenty of blue light.
