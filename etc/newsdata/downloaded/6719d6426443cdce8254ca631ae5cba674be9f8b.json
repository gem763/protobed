But time is running out for Netanyahu, who is facing several corruption scandals and may face criminal charges in the near future.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIsrael went to the polls on September 17 in elections meant to decide the future of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pitting a major ally of US President Donald Trump against a former top Israeli military chief.\n\nIf this feels familiar, it is.\n\nIsrael most recently had an election just five months ago, after Netanyahu's government dissolved over clashes with his coalition partners. Early elections were called for April 9.\n\nNetanyahu faced off against Benny Gantz, a 60-year-old who served as the head of the Israel Defense Forces from 2011 to 2015, navigating the country through two incursions on the Gaza Strip.\n\nGantz leads the centrist Blue and White party, which was formed only this year.\n\nMany voters have voiced support for Gantz, who would undeniably bring change after Netanyahu's four terms and 13 years as prime minister. Netanyahu heads the right-wing Likud party.\n\nHe is the longest-serving leader in Israel's history.\n\nBack in April, both Netanyahu and Gantz won 35 seats in Israel's parliament, far short of the 61 needed for an outright majority. (Israel's parliament, called the Knesset, has 120 seats.)\n\nIn the scenario that no party wins a majority, the Israeli president \u2014 currently Reuven Rivlin \u2014 picks a prime minister based on who is considered most able to form a coalition. In April, Rivlin chose Netanyahu, who then failed to form a coalition government. The consequence was the September election.\n\nMemebers of the Joint List party sits next to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin as he began talks with political parties over who should form a new government, at his residence in Jerusalem September 22, 2019.

He now has 28 days to form a coalition government.\n\nNetanyahu's endorsements put him at 55 seats, narrowly inching ahead of Gantz, whose recommendations place him at 54 seats. He now needs 61 seats to secure a victory.\n\nGantz was endorsed by Arab party lawmakers on Sunday, a shock move given that Arab-led parties have not put forward a recommendation for who should lead the government since 1992. But with Netanyahu's strong support with the right-wing and religious parties edged him slightly ahead.\n\nAyman Odeh, leader of the Joint List, gestures as he hands out pamphlets during an an election campaign event in Tira, northern Israel September 5, 2019.

If Netanyahu can figure out a way to remain in power, he would not be required to step down even in the event of an indictment. If he cannot muster up a successful coalition, he may face criminal charges in the near future.\n\nEarlier this week, Netanyahu and Gantz met with Rivlin to discuss prospects of a unity government, a reference to a possible joint rule between his party and Netanyahu's Likud.\n\nDuring their meeting, Rivlin said the two party leaders made \"significant steps\" in negotiations, though neither could agree on who would serve first in a rotating leadership.\n\nGantz initially called for a \"good and desirable unity government,\" but swiftly rejected Netanyahu's concessions and instead called on Netanyahu's religious allies to dump their coalition agreements with Likud.\n\n\"I intend to form a broad and liberal unity government under my leadership,\" Gantz said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nAvigdor Liberman, the leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party \u2060\u2014 a kingmaker in the previous election who has won a crucial 8 seats that could sway either candidate to victory \u2060\u2014 has so far refused to endorse either party.\n\nIf Netanyahu cannot convince Gantz to form a unity government alongside him, or cannot convince other parties to give him the extra endorsements he needs to reach at least 61 seats, he will lose his chance at power.", "description": "Though challenger Benny Gantz has won slightly more seats in Israel\u2019s parliament, Netanyahu has been endorsed by more parties to form a government.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d82011f2e22af6b7e5a71b3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
