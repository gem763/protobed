During the call, the Ukrainian president agreed to investigations of Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The aid was later provided.\n\nU.S. law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nFriday\u2019s subpoenas also called on two officials from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget: acting director Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs, to testify in early November.\n\nLawmakers want Duffey to appear on Nov. 5, and Vought and Brechbuhl on Nov. 6, the committees said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to block current and former officials from appearing before the impeachment inquiry, although the Democrat-led committees have obliged main figures in the scandal, like U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, to testify by issuing subpoenas against them.\n\nPUBLIC HEARINGS\n\nThe impeachment inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges - known as articles of impeachment - which would prompt a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. The Senate is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who have shown little inclination towards removing him.\n\nBut Trump has pressured Republicans to adopt a more robust defence in recent days after two of his recent decisions - the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and the now-reversed move to hold a G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts - drew criticism from members of his party.\n\nThe White House is considering former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to handle its communications for the impeachment probe, a person familiar with the deliberations said.\n\nCongressional Democrats, faced with stepped-up efforts by Trump\u2019s Republican allies to disrupt the impeachment inquiry, are now considering calling only career government employees to testify at public hearings expected to start later next month, according to congressional sources.\n\nU.S. Justice Department building is seen in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2018.
