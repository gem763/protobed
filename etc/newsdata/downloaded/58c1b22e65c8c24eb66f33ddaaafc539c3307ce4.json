The population of people without stable living situations periodically surged, but these waves were temporary, subsiding as the economy improved. The phenomenon we now know as homelessness\u2014pervasive, unremarkable, seemingly intractable\u2014arose only in the 1980s. What had been anomalous suddenly became \u201cthe common misery of millions,\u201d observed the writer and activist Jonathan Kozol in his 1988 book Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America. Set in a towering New York shelter that Kozol likened to an urban refugee camp, the book sought to excavate the causes of this great displacement. Kozol refused the dominant explanations, all of which emphasized some mix of individual and group pathology: teenage pregnancy, mental illness, drugs, a \u201cculture of poverty.\u201d He offered a different view. In 1970, the United States had a surplus of 300,000 affordable rental homes; under President Reagan, federal spending on low-income housing plummeted from $32 billion to $7 billion. (\u201cWe\u2019re getting out of the housing business. Period,\u201d said a top HUD official at the time.) Affordable units evaporated, and with them many of the legal safeguards allowing poor tenants to stay in the relative few that remained. Kozol condensed his findings into a single italicized sentence: \u201cThe cause of homelessness,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis lack of housing.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, beleaguered renters and their allies have taken this perspective as a starting point and begun to organize, fighting their own displacement through a variety of measures. They have formed tenant unions, staged rent strikes, and employed a sort of harm reduction approach to rampant gentrification. In Atlanta, the Housing Justice League, a community-led organization affiliated with the national Homes for All campaign, has engaged in the difficult but vital work of ensuring that low-income residents, overwhelmingly people of color, will no longer be the victims of their city\u2019s success. The group wants a new language for talking about housing. Is safe and stable housing a luxury conferred only on those rich enough to afford it? Or is it a basic right, no less fundamental than literacy or access to food and medicine?\n\n\u201cWhen someone loses their home because it was treated as a commodity to be exploited for profit,\u201d Natalie McLaughlin, an organizer with the group, told me, \u201cwhat\u2019s needed is not charity but justice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not enough, these activists insist, to try to pull people out of homelessness. The task is to prevent it from happening in the first place, by striking at its root source: the vastly bigger but less conspicuous problem of housing insecurity, now afflicting the nearly eleven million renter households that are severely cost-burdened. Homelessness, as Kozol perceived, is merely the tip of this colossal iceberg.\n\n2.4 Factor by which the number of homeless children enrolled in public school nationally during the 2016\u20132017 school year exceeds HUD\u2019s 2017 tally of homelessness. Most funding for homeless services is based on HUD\u2019s much lower numbers.\n\nThe surest way to stem the housing emergency is to protect tenants in the homes they already occupy. Princeton University\u2019s Eviction Lab found that roughly 2.3 million people were evicted in 2016\u2014a rate of 6,300 every day. And nowhere is the power asymmetry between landlords and renters more apparent than in these proceedings: While landlords virtually always appear with lawyers, tenants almost never do. Since spurious cases tend to be dropped when there\u2019s an attorney on the other side, providing low-income renters with access to legal representation, similar to the right to counsel in criminal trials, is a logical first step in curtailing unwarranted removals.\n\nOther measures include temporary cash assistance for vulnerable tenants, just cause eviction laws, and prohibitions against landlords using nefarious tactics in their attempt to\u2014as the lingo has it\u2014\u201cunlock value\u201d from their properties. (When the Darlington Apartments, a 612-unit complex in Atlanta, was sold to Varden Capital Properties in 2017, its tenants, many of them seniors on fixed incomes, were given 60 days to move elsewhere. After they protested, the building\u2019s air conditioner stopped working\u2014it was the middle of August\u2014and trash was left to pile up. Two months later, the apartments were empty.) Then there\u2019s rent control, a controversial and, according to numerous studies, potent weapon against skyrocketing costs. Long reviled by the real estate industry, rent stabilization laws are now being considered in jurisdictions throughout the United States. In February, Oregon became the first to pass statewide legislation of this kind. \u201cRent control is one of the most effective tools to alleviate our renter crisis,\u201d argues a report co-published by the Center for Popular Democracy, Right to the City Alliance, and PolicyLink.\n\nMost advocates agree, however, that lasting change will come only through massive government reinvestment in low-income housing, livable wages (including pay protections for the growing number of gig workers), and an openness to alternative models, such as community land trusts and limited-equity cooperatives. The fruit of the laissez-faire approach\u2014deregulating the private market and hoping that, with enough new construction, affordability will trickle down\u2014can be seen, they suggest, in the hundreds of thousands of Americans doubled up or living in shelters and tent cities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop nibbling around the edges,\u201d argued Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has made addressing the housing crisis one of her chief priorities. Last September, the Democratic presidential candidate introduced a bill, the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, that is by far the most consequential and far-reaching housing plan to be proposed by a national politician in decades. Among the bill\u2019s provisions are a $450 billion infusion of federal funds into the building and preservation of affordable rentals; an expansion of the Fair Housing Act to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, and income source; incentives for local neighborhoods to overhaul zoning ordinances restricting high-density development; and, in a particularly striking move, an attempt to close the racial wealth gap by offering down payments to first-time homebuyers in formerly redlined or segregated areas.\n\nWhether Warren\u2019s bill will go anywhere is an open question, but it seems to have shifted the terms of the national conversation about homelessness and housing instability. Maintaining the current state of affairs\u2014or, as President Trump and his Cabinet seem intent on doing, exacerbating the crisis\u2014would be catastrophic. In early March, the administration released its fiscal 2020 budget request, which, if passed, would cut HUD funding by an astounding $8.6 billion. Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called the proposal \u201ccruel and unconscionable.\u201d Section 8 vouchers and homeless services, public housing repairs and emergency rent assistance: All would be even further reduced, in the name of encouraging \u201cself-sufficiency,\u201d as HUD Secretary Ben Carson put it.\n\nYet this demand for self-sufficiency, both today and under previous administrations, is directed only at certain people. (\u201cWe all too often have socialism for the rich,\u201d Martin Luther King Jr. famously noted, \u201cand rugged free-enterprise capitalism for the poor.\u201d) For years, government spending on the Mortgage Interest Deduction, an entitlement for upper-class homeowners that, in the words of sociologist Matthew Desmond, \u201cmay very well be the most regressive piece of social policy in America,\u201d has eclipsed spending on low-income housing by many billions of dollars\u2014with households earning more than $100,000 receiving roughly 90 percent of the benefits in 2015. Here, in budgetary form, is a kind of microcosm of what cities such as Atlanta are increasingly looking like: extreme and mounting wealth on one side, loss and destitution on the other, and a credo of hard work will be rewarded somehow persisting despite it all.\n\nAs the weeks went by, Goodman\u2019s hope of finding her family a place to live dissipated. Rumors swirled that the city would soon be demolishing her mother\u2019s apartment complex for health and safety violations, but neighbors had been saying that for months. Every night, Goodman and her children arranged themselves crosswise on a single mattress. Winter air poured in through a large gash in the drywall, and they tried to keep warm with the few blankets and bath towels they\u2019d brought with them. The bedbugs gnawed their skin. If it wasn\u2019t so cold that time of year, Goodman said, they would have preferred to sleep on the sidewalk.\n\nShe had given up on receiving assistance from local agencies. One organization, whose stated mission is to \u201cprovide emergency assistance to low-income working Atlantans to help prevent homelessness and hunger during periods of crisis,\u201d told her it could offer aid to people when they were at risk of losing housing, not once they\u2019d already lost it. The group gave her a list of other agencies, and suggested contacting churches in the area. A family shelter told her that it might have enough space for her and the children, but first she needed a referral from Gateway, which never materialized. Yet another agency reported that President Trump\u2019s shutdown of the government over the border wall had wiped out its limited resources. Her several emails to the Atlanta-based filmmaker Tyler Perry, known for his high-profile donations to homeless shelters, went unanswered.\n\nFor Goodman and her children, the emotional and physical toll of their plight grew acute. After Destinee, her 14-year-old, was expelled from school for getting into a fight, Goodman found herself taking fewer and fewer shifts at work. The little income she continued to earn went to her mother to cover utilities, along with the fees\u2014a total of $300 a month, plus $7.95 for insurance\u2014for three storage units where their possessions were kept. The prospect of clawing their way out of this hole seemed ever less likely. One day, Goodman told me that she understood how some people could become homeless and never come back. When we talked, there were long stretches of silence. At times, she fixed on a certain phrase and repeated it again and again: \u201cI\u2019m tired. And when I say I\u2019m tired, I mean I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m just tired \u2026\u201d\n\nShe mainly spoke of figuring out how to get the landlord to return the $2,000 she believed he owed her\u2014$1,000 for the security deposit and $1,000 for a month\u2019s rent. Not long after the Forest Park house was condemned, while they were still at the Rodeway Inn, Goodman contacted Dudar, asking when she could expect to be reimbursed. She reasoned that she might be able to apply the refund toward another residence; there would also be the expense ($200, it turned out) of renting a U-Haul to move their belongings out of the house. But Dudar, who owns numerous rental properties in the area, did not respond to her texts or voice mails. In late October, Goodman checked the mailbox at the deserted house and discovered an order to appear at a dispossessory proceeding at the Clayton County courthouse. She was being evicted from a house she was legally unable to occupy.\n\n80 Percentage of Chicago\u2019s homeless population in 2016 living \u201cdoubled up\u201d with family or friends. Chicago is the rare city that includes people in such circumstances in its tallies; most descriptions of homelessness exclude them.\n\nThe notice accused Goodman of \u201cmalicious destruction of premises and violation of ordinance and misuse.\u201d Goodman panicked. She saw the order as Dudar\u2019s way of punishing her for asking the fire lieutenant to inspect the house\u2014and avoiding paying her back. (For his part, Dudar has disputed his former tenant\u2019s account of what happened, and claimed that she deliberately flooded the basement.) Goodman scrambled to find a lawyer before the court date, and secured the help, through a social worker at her children\u2019s school, of a volunteer Legal Aid attorney named Farley Ezekiel. The lawyer, seeing that Goodman had lived in the house for just part of the month, believed they had cause not only to resist the eviction but to file a counterclaim against Dudar for the unused rent and relocation costs. Goodman felt optimistic as they waited in the courtroom. After both sides argued their positions, the judge rendered his verdict. \u201cNeither party,\u201d he wrote on the judgment form, \u201cpresented sufficient evidence.\u201d He dismissed both the main claim and the counterclaim.\n\nIn early February, Goodman and I were driving near her old rental home in Peoplestown. It was a lovely morning, the temperature in the low 60s, and Atlanta was packed with visitors in town for the Super Bowl, which was taking place that Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s more than about the game,\u201d insisted Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms at a news conference, defending the $28 million the Super Bowl would cost the city, \u201cit\u2019s about a lasting legacy.\u201d Bottoms said nothing about the other controversy surrounding the festivities: A few days earlier, the Southern Center for Human Rights had denounced the city\u2019s sudden crackdown on homeless encampments, calling the mass arrests an immoral attempt to \u201csanitize the image of downtown at the expense of our homeless citizens.\u201d\n\nWe pulled up in front of the small brick house, and Goodman got out of the car to snap some photos. Among the surrounding homes, it appeared incongruously run-down. Goodman pointed to one of them, a fresh two-story bungalow with a wide front porch. Her old rental would soon look like that, she remarked, after it had been purchased and torn down.\n\nShe asked if I\u2019d been to the Beacon yet, and I told her I hadn\u2019t. \u201cOh, then you have to see it!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nLocated a block away, the Beacon was Atlanta\u2019s latest urban rustic \u201cretail, dining, and cultural destination\u201d to appear alongside the BeltLine, a multibillion-dollar megaproject consisting of a 22-mile mixed-use trail around the perimeter of the city. Since its inception, the BeltLine had become the ultimate signifier of a new, stylish, green Atlanta. But it had its critics, too; the Housing Justice League had made it the central focus of much of its activism, alleging that the city never took real steps to honor its pledge to ensure that working- and middle-class residents wouldn\u2019t be displaced by the project. A 2017 investigation by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that, while Atlanta BeltLine Inc. had guaranteed the creation of at least 5,600 affordable housing units, halfway through the development\u2019s completion, only 785 had been funded.\n\nThe Beacon resembled similar establishments in the city\u2014Krog Street Market in Inman Park, Ponce City Market in Old Fourth Ward\u2014and as we made our way slowly around the enormous shared art space and six former industrial buildings, spread out over nine acres, we took in the passing names. Goodman recited them one by one, giggling at a few: Salon Vagabond, Baker Dude Bakery Cafe, Heal Thyself Atlanta, and, her favorite, Kids Dental Studio. \u201cWhat in the world is a \u2018dental studio\u2019?\u201d she laughed. Her mood was more buoyant than I\u2019d seen since we met. She commented on how beautiful the place was. And then, just as swiftly, her smile disappeared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my neighborhood anymore.\u201d", "description": "Housing insecurity in the nation\u2019s richest cities is far worse than government statistics claim.
