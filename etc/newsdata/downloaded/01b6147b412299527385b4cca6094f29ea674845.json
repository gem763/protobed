The relocation was announced Monday by President Joko Widodo.\n\nThe proposed location, near the relatively underdeveloped cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda, is a far cry from the crowded powerhouse which has served as Indonesia's financial heart since 1949 -- and Widodo acknowledged that moving the country's capital to the island will be a mammoth and expensive undertaking.\n\nBut Jakarta's rapid expansion in recent years has presented myriad environmental, economic and safety concerns, prompting the government to look elsewhere and ease the strain on the massive metropolis.\n\n\"As a large nation that has been independent for 74 years, Indonesia has never chosen its own capital,\" Widodo said in a televised speech, AFP reported. \"The burden Jakarta is holding right now is too heavy as the center of governance, business, finance, trade and services.\"\n\nFloating houses on Mahakam river in Samarinda, near the site of the new capital.

The move requires parliamentary approval to be given the go-ahead.", "description": "A jungle-covered area on the east of Borneo island is set to be transformed into Indonesia's new capital city, the country's President Joko Widodo has announced.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170808121517-jakarta-super-tease.jpg"}
