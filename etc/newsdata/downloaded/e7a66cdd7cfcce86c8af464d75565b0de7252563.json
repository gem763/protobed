Fortunately for the general reader, Leah Price is also an excellent writer: intelligent, engaging, knowledgeable and amusing. This makes her uneven but rewarding discourse on books and reading more satisfying than annoying since Price the Writer ultimately triumphs over Price the Pedant.\n\nNot a moment too soon. Book historians, she tells us early on, \u201cstudy inscribed objects. That can mean long-form print, but despite their name, book historians have extended their remit to manuscripts, newspapers, even postcards and tombstones. Some, called bibliographers, focus on the transmission of texts. (These texts can be electronic: one of the field\u2019s most prominent scholars, Matthew Kirschenbaum, specializes in the history of word processing.)\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, this would put \u201cbook historians\u201d in a relationship to writing about as exalted as the relationship of beer can collectors to beer brewers and drinkers: odd enthusiasts fixated on containers vs. content. To continue the bibulous analogy, consider the author\u2019s citation of \u201cartist and scholar Amaranth Borsuk\u2019s lovely metaphor, \u2018rather than offering up crystal goblets\u2019 into which words can be poured, digital-era approaches to reading \u2018invite us to trace our finger along text\u2019s rim and make it sing.\u2019\u201d Lots of graceful but gossamer verbal squiggles and swirls like this adorn Ms. Price\u2019s text, shimmering without casting much light.\n\nBut just when you\u2019re about to give up on Price the Professor, Price the writer comes to the rescue with common sense and humor. \u201c[C]ollege students endorse print no less roundly than any middle-aged professor \u2026 Students in the United States, Germany, and even smart-phone-dense Japan report that they understand and remember more on paper.\u201d This opinion was even shared by one student who inadvertently proved the point by complaining that reading hardcopy \u201ctakes me longer because I read more carefully.\u201d\n\nOr consider the exquisite irony in the following send-up of what might be called books about books: \u201cAs Clay Shirky points out, \u2018an entire literature about the value of reading [Marcel] Proust is now more widely read than Proust\u2019s actual oeuvre.\u2019 Every minute that you give to \u2018How Proust Can Change Your Life\u2019 is a minute that you\u2019re not spending with \u2018Remembrance of Things Past.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough an English professor herself, Ms. Price skewers some of the more egregious trends in today\u2019s English departments where professors nag students to resist the temptation to skip and skim, exhorting them \u201cto care enough to finish the reading. But beyond influencing whether our students read, we also determine (or try to determine) how. We coax freshmen to care less about the world represented in fiction, shaming those who read for the plot or pick favorites among characters. We train them to see past the ostensible subject of a text to its linguistic structures, just as they see past the look and feel of a book to its textual content.\u201d\n\nIn a chapter dealing with the potential therapeutic effect that reading good fiction can have on the depressed, perplexed or jaded denizens of our cluttered, distracting modern age, the author recognizes both up and down sides: \u201cOn mornings when the urge to find out how a story ends is all that gets me out of bed, I think Mood-Boosting Books are on to something. When the telltale compression of pages or the dwindling scroll bar warns me that the imaginative world in which I\u2019m taking refuge is about to come to an end, though, books feel more like intimations of mortality.\u201d\n\nFor years, she confesses, she rationed the novels of Victorian master Anthony Trollope, \u201ckeeping a new one in reserve next to the unopened chocolate bar stashed away for consolation if and when my equally bookish boyfriend walked out. But when I turned the last page of \u2018The Last Chronicle of Barset,\u2019 it was Trollope\u2019s series that abandoned me.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has been an avid reader all his life, and who has been a published critic for half a century now, I still feel a fleeting sense of loss when I reach the last page of a truly good novel. But then I remind myself that finishing a pleasing book is like heading home after a delightful vacation. Parting is always, at best, sweet sorrow. But the supply of new trips worth taking \u2013 and new books worth reading \u2013 is virtually endless.\n\n\u2022 Aram Bakshian Jr., a former aide to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, has written widely on politics, history, gastronomy and the arts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BOOKS: THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF READING\n\nBy Leah Price\n\nBasic Books, $28, 224 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
