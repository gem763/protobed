But please, when you are angry, do not ventilate your anger in destroying your own infrastructure,\" Mashaba said.\n\nHe said the vehicle was the property of every city resident and therefore needed to be looked after by everyone, adding that staff should also be protected from being robbed while they rendered services.\n\nWhile Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) would be accompanying the vehicle for security, it was still the responsibility of all residents to protect and take good care of it.\n\nMashaba said, when the EFF brought the motion to council in 2016 to have mobile clinics, it had made sense. He said that he was pleased that the vehicle would make a \"huge difference\" to the community.\n\nThe clinic would offer chronic system treatment, including HIV counselling and testing, ART initiation, and TB screening and treatment to residents. It would also offer family planning services, including pap smears and prostate cancer screenings.\n\nFour rotating doctors would service the clinic, as well as a professional primary healthcare nurse, two general nurses, two enrolled nurses and an assistant, one administration assistance, and a general worker and driver.\n\nThe mobile clinic to service informal settlements in Joburg's inner city and areas of greater Jeppestown.(Sesona Ngqakamba, News24)\n\nIt would operate from 08:30 to 15:00, Monday to Thursday. On Mondays and Tuesdays, it would be stationed in Booysens Informal Settlement, George Goch on Wednesdays, and Mangolongolo Informal Settlement on Thursday.\n\nThe vehicle is fully furnished with two consulting rooms, a toilet and a kitchen.\n\nPhalatse also reiterated to residents that the City had a challenge of people destroying the good that had been done. She said the City would depend on residents to put an end to vandalism of infrastructure.\n\n\"We are going to depend on you. Your eyes must be opened. This is your clinic. If it is not functioning, you will be the ones suffering. Please be our eyes and ears,\" Phalatse urged.\n\nShe added that, while it had cost a lot to procure the mobile clinic, it was rewarding to see the City being able to bring healthcare closer to the \"poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Outgoing Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has urged residents of George Goch informal settlement in the inner city not to vandalise a newly launched mobile clinic set to service Ward 65 and areas of greater Jeppestown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9530/7c336dba60d94f5da5f7d709b77a7379.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
