In almost all congressional proceedings, the rules are set by the majority party including calling of witnesses and hearings.\n\nHowever, the letter stopped short of demanding Pelosi call a vote of the House.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nDemocratic leaders of several House committees have been issuing requests and subpoenas calling for documents and testimony from several administration and State Department officials as part of their ongoing investigation into whether or not to bring articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. The impeachment efforts were spurred by a whistleblower complaint about a conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Voldymyr Zelenskiy which alleged improper conduct by the president.\n\nThe Trump administration has been actively blocking testimony since the start of the probe.\n\nHouse Democrats issued subpoenas for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and five other State Department officials in late September requesting documents related to the department's role in facilitating meetings between Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, and Zelenskiy. Pompeo responded to the request in a letter stating his intention to block the testimony.\n\nDespite Pompeo's objection, Kurt Volker, the former special envoy for Ukraine, was deposed behind closed doors last week. Republicans have cited the committee's failure to release the entirety of Volker's testimony as a reason they oppose further depositions taking place.\n\nIn response to Pompeo, Democratic Chairmen Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings wrote that \"the failure of any of these Department employees to appear for their scheduled depositions shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nGiuliani is also the subject of a subpoena for documents, which he was compelled to produce to Congress by Oct. 15. He has not yet responded to the subpoenas and cited \"substantial constitutional and legal issues\" that must be considered before he decides how to respond.\n\nAnd earlier Tuesday, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was blocked from appearing for voluntary testimony, prompting House Democrats to announce that they would issue a subpoena for his testimony and documents.\n\nPAC Letter 10.08.2019 by ABC News Politics on Scribd", "description": "The White House sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday calling into question what it referred to as", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-rt-ps-191008_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
