Some rural areas are so severely under-doctored that patient lives could potentially be at risk.\u2019\n\nAcross England, only 13 per cent of consultant appointments last year went to countryside and coastal hospitals, while there were none to non-urban hospitals in Northern Ireland. The situation was better in Wales \u2013 almost two in five consultants were appointed outside of cities and towns.\n\nThe report, which surveyed 8,500 senior doctors, found location was cited as the most important factor when deciding to take a job.\n\nIt is feared local housing shortages and better career opportunities at more prestigious city hospitals are putting them off\n\nIt was prioritised by 55 per cent of women and 51 per cent of men. The report did not report on the reasons for the rural-urban divide.\n\nHowever, coastal areas can have high house prices, and rural hospitals might be unappealing to consultants because of existing staff shortages.\n\nLarge teaching hospitals and centres of excellence are also thought to pull in trainee doctors. Two in five senior doctors said they faced gaps on hospital rotas every day or week, which can put strain on family life and work-life balance where staff are forced to step in.\n\nProfessor Goddard said: \u2018A major part of the problem stems from the fact that medical schools don\u2019t have enough places to offer those who are keen to study the subject.\u2019\n\nIn 2018-19, hospitals in urban areas across the UK \u2013 minus Scotland where there were no comparable figures \u2013 hired 866 doctors, but those with rural patient populations recruited only 153\n\nThe census found 43 per cent of advertised consultant posts go unfilled \u2013 mostly because there are no applicants.\n\nIn the North, the proportion was 46 per cent while it was 30 per cent in London. The Midlands had almost three times as many vacancies as the capital \u2013 161 compared to 62.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \u2018The NHS has more consultants now than at any time in its history, with over 17,300 more doctors working in the NHS since 2010 delivering excellent, safe care to patients.\n\n\u2018We also have record numbers of doctors in undergraduate training, recently adding 1,500 extra training places by opening five new medical schools across England \u2013 the majority in rural areas.\u2019", "description": "A new report from the Royal College of Physicians found hospitals in urban areas across the UK hired 866 doctors in 2018-19 but those with rural patients only recruited 153.", "authors": ["Victoria Allen For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/00/19669718-0-image-a-7_1571007898754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
