Some denounced having once purchased the products or contributing funds to Knixwear\u2019s crowdfunding campaign. According to The Business Journals, the brand \u2014 which is based in Toronto, Canada \u2014 raised more than one million pre-sale dollars for its Evolution Bra several years ago.\n\nWTF knixwear this is at best a terrible facebook campaign for your underwear while at worst feels like some allusion to sexual violence?! pic.twitter.com/gedMFpTa84 \u2014 Linds (@lindsfrances) September 5, 2019\n\nDid someone just hijack the @knixwear account? There is no way this post/ad conveying sexual assault could be from a company that says its\"mission [is] to inspire all women to live unapologetically free.\" CC @cindygallop H/T @AmyVernon pic.twitter.com/cM7Bwsfyi2 \u2014 Allyson Kapin (@WomenWhoTech) September 10, 2019\n\nEntrepreneur Kat Krieger was one of the first people to see the ad, posted to a Facebook support group. \u201cApparently, it\u2019s okay for Knixwear to put up ads that goes beyond hinting at sexual assault?!?!\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs a sexual assault survivor, I\u2019m triggered and I\u2019m angry.

All I see in this photo is sexual assault.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Governor Rauner Ad Stirs Controversy\n\nThe brand has been responding to individual complaints on social media, tweeting to one person, \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry about this. You absolutely did the right thing in flagging this and the ad was immediately taken down\u201d \u2014 along with an offer to explain further in a private message.\n\nWe're so sorry about this. You absolutely did the right thing in flagging this and the ad was immediately taken down. Please feel free to reach out to us at info@knix.com or DM us and we'd be happy to explain how this happened and apologize further. \u2014 Knix (@knixwear) September 10, 2019\n\nKnixwear sent Yahoo Lifestyle a blog post penned by CEO Joanna Griffiths.\n\n\u201c....Trust, especially in regards to women\u2019s bodies, is something that we don\u2019t take lightly. Part of being honest is admitting when you made a mistake, and recently we did just that. We made a mistake that triggered a very intense and difficult topic for some people. For this we are extremely sorry. You deserve an explanation.\u201d\n\nGriffiths explained that the company recently had a team-building event called an Ad Hack-a-Thon during which employees (ranging from creatives to accountants and HR executives) had one hour to pitch ad concepts. \u201cAfter all, a good idea can come from anywhere,\u201d wrote the CEO.\n\n\u201cWe agreed to put a small budget behind some of these ads (certainly not all of them) and see what would happen,\u201d she said. However an \u201cinternal miscommunication\u201d lead to all 60 ideas published to Facebook, \u201cincluding one ad that unfortunately not only caught people off guard (what were they thinking?) but for some, triggered an association with sexual assault. We are so very sorry.\u201d\n\nThe company says that all submissions were individually dropped into a shared Google document and nine were approved as social media ads. \u201cThis particular photo was never considered in any way as an option nor was it approved or added to the \u2018yes\u2019 sheet,\u201d says a brand representative.\n\nThe theme behind the problematic ad was a riff on the slogan, \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\" symbolizing the debauchery associated with Sin City.\n\n\u201cI can promise you there was no intention to connect our product and brand with sexual assault and violence and that no one within our company would make light of something so serious,\u201d wrote Griffiths. \u201cFor a variety of other reasons (like it's a photo of our product in a gutter....next to a cigarette butt and garbage), this particular image was never meant to be shared.\u201d", "description": "Knixwear, a company that sells \u201cleak-proof underwear,\u201d accidentally spilled an ad concept that brought to mind sexual assault. \u201cApparently, it\u2019s okay for Knixwear to put up ads that goes beyond hinting at sexual assault?!?!\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs a sexual assault survivor, I\u2019m triggered and I\u2019m angry.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RIiUag3A9GTCeYti2nKqHg--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/aa347f30-d583-11e9-9ff3-c6a69137658d"}
