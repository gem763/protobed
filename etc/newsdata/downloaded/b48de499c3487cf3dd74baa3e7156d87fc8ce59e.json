Japan Airlines' aircraft map now pinpoints the presence of infants with an icon of a baby - istock\n\nIf being trapped on a plane next to a wailing baby is not your idea of a good time, this news will be promising.\n\nJapan Airline (JAL) has introduced a feature on its website that enables customers booking flights to see where young children are situated, so they can avoid choosing a seat close to them.\n\nThe nation's flag carrier now have aircraft maps that pinpoint the presence of infants using an icon of a cartoon baby.\n\n\"Passengers traveling with children between eight days and two years old who select their seats on the JAL website will have a child icon displayed on their seats on the seat selection screen,\" the site states. \"This lets other passengers know a child may be sitting there.\"\n\nFeedback thus far has been largely positive, judging by the Twitter response, with one frequent flyer (below) suggesting that other airlines follow suit.\n\nThank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip. This really ought to be mandatory across the board.\n\n\n\nPlease take note, @qatarairways: I had 3 screaming babies next to me on my JFK-DOH flight two weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/kQYQFIqqCD\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rahat Ahmed (@dequinix) September 24, 2019\n\nOthers went further, one tweeting: \"I\u2019ve been saying for ages we need a 21+ or 18+ only flight. I would gladly pay a fee for such a flight.\" There were retorts, too, however, with one father stating: \"I can assure you flying with an infant is extremely stressful for the parents, made worse by knowing there are people like you judging.\"\n\nThe system isn't foolproof, since the baby icon won't appear for passengers who booked with a third party, or if there is a change in aircraft. Japan Airlines, which serves 53 countries worldwide, including the UK via London Heathrow from Tokyo, currently doesn't charge for seat selection.\n\nIt isn't the first carrier to offer this function. According to a spokesperson from fellow Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways, its seat maps have been displaying the location of children \u201cfor a while\u201d, though this still puts them in the minority. Whether the concept spreads further afield remains to be seen.\n\nAirlines like Ryanair that do charge for the privilege of seat selection would be wise to take note should the option become positive. Last year, the ancillary revenue collected by the Irish carrier for optional extras, seat selection fees included, rose to $2.8bn (\u00a32.2bn), now accounting for 31.7 per cent of its income.\n\nWith more global air traffic than ever (4.6 billion passengers are expected to take to the skies by the end of 2019, a new record), airlines and plane manufacturers have been competing to innovate when it comes to making the economy experience more bearable, in more ways than one.\n\nUp there with the woes of crying babies, for example, is being lumped with the middle seat - an allocation with no pros and only cons - but there\u2019s hope here too. This summer, a new cabin design which promises to vastly improve the comfort of the middle seat was approved by America\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nThe new staggered seating system, formulated by Denver-based airline interiors firm Molon Labe Designs and dubbed the S1, has the middle seat positioned a few inches behind and below its neighbours; a simple tweak that affords the passenger an extra three inches of width, plus rights to both armrests. At least one US airline has already ordered the system, to be installed on 50 aircraft by the end of the year.\n\nOver to you\n\nIs Japan Airlines' booking feature genius, or do you oppose the idea? And would you be willing to pay extra to avoid sitting near a baby?
