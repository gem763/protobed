The creators of the 1980s hit Thirtysomething are rebooting the series, and Deadline reports that multiple networks are interested in picking it back up. Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick are writing the new treatment, with Zwick lined up to direct, and the new story is said to focus on the children of the original characters \u2014 who themselves are now 30-somethings. Sources tell Deadline that, \u201cthe intention is for original cast members to reprise their roles but no one is set yet and there have been no formal talks.\u201d Those original stars include Melanie Mayron, Timothy Busfield, Patricia Wettig, Peter Horton, Ken Olin, Mel Harris, and Polly Draper.\n\nHollywood loves a preexisting property, and Thirtysomething was also extremely decorated over the course of its four-season run, amassing more than a dozen Emmys and earning a few Golden Globes. Awards bait, nostalgia, and a hopefully preexisting audience \u2014 sounds like a truly Peak-TV content opportunity.", "description": "A reboot of the popular 1980s series thirtysomething is being developed by its original creators, Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-thirtysomething-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
