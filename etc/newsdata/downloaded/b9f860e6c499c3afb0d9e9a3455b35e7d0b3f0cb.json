She\u2019s a feminist writer and social media warrior best known for calling Tucker Carlson a \u201csexist pig\u201d and also for a piece arguing that President Trump was \u201cgaslighting\u201d America. Duca\u2019s star has risen high enough in resistance politics circles that this month she has a book out titled, \u201cHow to Start a Revolution: Young People and the Future of American Politics.\u201d\n\nOver the summer, Duca was also invited to teach a class called \u201cThe Feminist Journalist\u201d at NYU. Because Buzzfeed was doing a profile on Duca for her upcoming book, reporter Scaachi Koul happened to be there on the last day of the six-week class. It sounds as if Duca thought the class went very well, but her students were not so happy. In fact, they made a formal complaint to the J-school about Duca.\n\nShe asked her students to come prepared with questions for her for what would be an AMA-style session in Washington Square Park. Her students sat in a circle around her in the wet grass. It was, I imagine, exactly what Tucker Carlson would envision a liberal journalism class might be: a bunch of kids from varied backgrounds, ethnicities, orientations, and gender identities, who could each afford a $6,500 class, wearing T-shirts that said \u201cGenderQueer\u201d or \u201cKill Patriarchy.\u201d In the park, Duca praised her students for their ideas and pitches: \u201cYou so totally learned what I was trying to teach you.\u201d Nearly four weeks after the course ended, however, her students sent a collective formal complaint to the heads of the NYU journalism school about Duca\u2019s conduct. \u201cWe are disappointed at the department and NYU for hiring a professor with more interest in promoting her book than teaching a group of students eager to learn,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBut the students didn\u2019t just complain to the school. Because they knew Koul, the Buzzfeed reporter, from her visit on the last day of class, many of them reached out to her as well. Of the ten students that contacted her, five agreed to speak on the record but only if they could be anonymous. They were afraid of being targeted by Duca.\n\nAll five students alleged that Duca\u2019s class was disorganized and \u201ca master class in Lauren Duca\u2019s personal life.\u201d (\u201cThe point of it is that I\u2019m oversharing all the time. And I think that, yeah, some people like it, some people don\u2019t. Apparently you fucking hate it, but that\u2019s fine,\u201d Duca told me.) They said that she would vanish for 30 to 45 minutes per class to \u201cmeditate.\u201d (\u201cIt was a three-hour class and we took a break and I would meditate for 15 minutes and they would be gone getting snacks and stuff,\u201d Duca responded.) And that the class was a \u201cwaste of six weeks for all of us, and we don\u2019t want anyone else to make this mistake again.\u201d They claim Duca would snap at them for small problems, accuse them of not having done the readings, and never actually read any of the assignments they submitted to her.\n\nBut what really set the students off was Duca\u2019s treatment of a foreign student who didn\u2019t speak English very well. The other students say Duca singled out this student for criticism and abuse, even making her cry once in front of the whole class. Asked about all of this by Buzzfeed\u2019s Koul, Duca said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if I\u2019m not a great teacher because I\u2019m great at lots of other things.\u201d But when pressed, Duca tried to make herself some kind of feminist victim:\n\nAs I continued asking Duca for comment about the specifics of the complaint, she became more and more agitated. \u201cYou should put in there that my tone was expressly pissed off and frustrated,\u201d Duca told me. \u201cYou\u2019re being so f**king hard on me, Scaachi, and I really, really, really, really would ask you if you would be grilling a man in this same way. It\u2019s amazing. The shit that I have endured to continue to sustain a voice where I\u2019m just fighting every inch for the same thing that I think that you want, which is public power and equality, and I\u2019m trying my goddamn best, okay?\u201d\n\nHey, it\u2019s okay with me, but then I didn\u2019t shell out $6,500 to take her class. But you have to appreciate the humor in having a Twitter-famous resistance personality write a book about young people starting a revolution only to have those young revolutionaries come for her first. One student told Buzzfeed, \u201cIn a way, she is that \u2018worst idea\u2019 that conservatives think liberals are.\u201d Duca should probably put that one in her Twitter bio.", "description": "\"...a professor with more interest in promoting her book than teaching a group of students\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lauren-Duca-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
