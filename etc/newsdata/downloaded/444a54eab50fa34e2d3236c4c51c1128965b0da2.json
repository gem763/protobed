He played with courage and was a beacon of light in his community and in the broader South African context.\n\n\u201cChester Williams had so much more to give. Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife, Maria, his children, family and friends during this very sad time.\u201d\n\nWilliams won 27 caps for the Springboks during an international career that spanned from 1993 to 2000, in which he scored 14 tries for his country, while he also represented the Western Province and Golden Lions at club level, as well as South African Super Rugby side the Cats.\n\nHowever, he is most remembered for being the only black player in the South Africa squad that first won the World Cup 24 years ago \u2013 a triumph that brought a divided nation together like never before following apartheid.\n\nThe tournament followed the country's return to international competition after decades of sanctions and anti-apartheid boycotts. Williams was one the first black players to represent the national team that was dominated by white players, making him the face of the push for multi-racial reconciliation that followed Nelson Mandela's election in 1994 as the first democratic president.\n\nMandela played a large role in uniting the country with his public support of the Springboks, while fans worshipped Williams as he scored four tries in one single match in the quarter-final victory over Samoa on South Africa\u2019s path to victory.\n\nNews of Williams\u2019 death comes just two months after the loss of his fellow wing James Small, who lined up alongside Williams in the 1995 final victory over New Zealand. Small died in July following a heart attack.\n\nAt the time of his death, Williams was still coaching rugby un the form of the University of the Western Cape in the FNB Varsity Cup, having also been involved with the Blitzboks, Cats, the national teams of Uganda and Tunisia and the Phakisa Pumas.\n\nWilliams becomes the fifth member of the 1995 squad to pass away, following Small, coach Kitch Christie, flanker Ruben Kruger and legendary scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen.", "description": "South African Rugby World Cup winner Chester Williams has died of a suspected heart attack, aged 49.
