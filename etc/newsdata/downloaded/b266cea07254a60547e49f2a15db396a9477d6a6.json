During Barack Obama\u2019s presidency Donald Trump promised to find proof that he was not born in the United States and claimed that he had sent people to Hawaii to find the evidence. If he really sent anyone, they never came back with the proof Trump expected. Then in March 2017, as president, he tweeted that Obama had ordered a wiretap on his phone at Trump Tower. That too was false.\n\nOf late, Trump has engaged in several \u201ctweet storms\u201d claiming that a conspiracy by the \u201cDeep State\u201d exists and is doing all it can to delegitimize his presidency and get him removed from office. Trump believes the Deep State was instituted by John Brennan, Obama\u2019s CIA director, and includes all of the intelligence agencies. His latest claim is that before leaving office the Obama team planted an FBI spy in his campaign, tweeting a phrase his supporters would soon repeat: \u201cSPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\u201d\n\nContrary to being SPYGATE, it is becoming apparent that the FBI source (since exposed as academic Stefan Halper) was not put into Trump\u2019s campaign for political purposes but was part of a legitimate counterintelligence operation investigating Russia\u2019s election interference in the U.S. elections and involved three of his campaign aides, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis, whom Halper interviewed. Trump evidently believes that Halper\u2019s interviews were an attempt to entrap his advisers to plant evidence about Russian collusion.\n\nAll of this is to be expected, because this is Donald Trump\u2019s modus vivendi. What is more troubling, however, is that many intellectual Trump supporters are echoing the president and are making the same arguments. Roger Kimball, head of Encounter Books and editor of The New Criterion (for which I have written), argues like Trump that it was Brennan who put together a \u201cworking group\u2026 to stymie Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nHe concludes that a \u201ccabal of CIA and FBI operatives, including the director of the CIA, John Brennan, along with other members of the intelligence \u2018community\u2019 prominently including James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, and various members of the Obama administration, colluded to undermine Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d The cabal, he believes, still exists. Now, Kimball writes, this group has shifted to \u201ca desperate attempt to destroy his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201c Up to this point, Corsi\u2019s book reads as a rehash of all the claims regularly made daily about the conspiracy by Trumpists. But he takes this one original, and scurrilous, step further. \u201d\n\nKimball gives Trump\u2019s tweets intellectual credibility. He goes to the extent of writing that \u201cWhat is being exposed is the biggest political scandal in the history of the United States: the effort by highly placed\u2014exactly how highly placed we still do not know\u2014members of one administration to mobilize the intelligence services and police power of the state to spy upon and destroy first the candidacy and then, when that didn\u2019t work, the administration of a political rival.\u201d\n\nAnd another prominent intellectual, the distinguished historian Victor Davis Hanson, writes that \u201cIf there is such a thing as a dangerous \u2018deep state\u2019 of elite but unelected federal officials who feel that they are untouchable and unaccountable, then John Brennan is the poster boy.\u201d He adds that \u201cBrennan is typical of the careerist deep state.\u201d They operate \u201cthe psychological tactic known as \u2018projection.\u2019 To square their own circles of lying, our so-called best and brightest loudly accuse others of precisely the sins that they themselves commit as a matter of habit.\u201d\n\nOf course, the real reason for this narrative is, as Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes write in Lawfare, \u201cto protect the president from a properly predicated counterintelligence investigation involving the activity of an adversary foreign power.\u201d What we now have is an assault on the very institutions whose members seek to protect us: the FBI, the CIA and other intelligence agencies.\n\nAnd rather than protect sources who work for them and believe that their identities will be protected, the president and members of Congress, especially Devin Nunes, out their names\u2014much in the same manner the far leftist rogue ex-CIA agent Philip Agee did in the 1960s, endangering the lives of many brave agents and individuals who cooperate with U.S. intelligence.\n\nNo one, however, has gone as far as Jerome R. Corsi, the self-proclaimed \u201cinvestigative reporter\u201d whose book during John Kerry\u2019s presidential campaign, the \u201cSwiftboating\u201d of his Vietnam War record, badly damaged Kerry\u2019s campaign, although the charges were false.\n\nHe is the same man who in 2012 wrote a column claiming Obama is a homosexual. This is the same Corsi who argued he had proof of Obama\u2019s Kenyan birth, and that a pattern on a ring Obama wore proved that he was a secret Muslim. Corsi has a Ph.D. from Harvard and uses that credential to assert that his words have credibility.\n\nCorsi is Washington correspondent for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars. Recently, he appeared on C-Span\u2019s book show Afterwords, where he talked about his new book, Killing the Deep State. In a nutshell, here is how Corsi describes his thesis: \u201cThe central premise of this book is that President Trump is the target of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order.\u201d\n\nFrom the moment Trump won, Corsi believes the \u201cdeep state\u201d promised to interfere with his presidency, beginning with the NSA and Brennan at CIA placing Trump under electronic surveillance. Brennan, along with John Podesta, Corsi claims, began the story about \u201cRussian collusion\u201d to delegitimize the campaign. Robert Mueller was made special counsel because he is \u201ca partisan deep state operative with close ties to FBI Director James Comey.\u201d The deep state, Corsi believes, is seeking to force Trump to resign. If that doesn\u2019t work, it plans to move to \u201cimpeachment or a charge under the 25th Amendment that he is mentally incompetent.\u201d\n\nUp to this point, Corsi\u2019s book reads as a rehash of all the claims regularly made daily about the conspiracy by Trumpists. But he takes this one original, and scurrilous, step further. Should that not work, he claims, the deep state operatives have one measure left to take, and that is \u201c\u2018executive action\u2019\u2014a CIA plan to assassinate Trump\u2026 the deep state\u2019s last resort.\u201d\n\nThis Corsi book does not have a mainstream publisher, as one of his earlier ones did. Instead, it has been published by a book division of the far right-wing Newsmax, run by Trump\u2019s friend Christopher Ruddy. The company is carrying on a campaign to push his book, sending out to its lists a 12-page magazine-size flier on its behalf.\n\nThe flier says the book proves that there is underway a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat to take out President Trump,\u201d orchestrated by Obama and his lieutenants. The publisher claims that although the book is a best-seller, The New York Times made a decision to leave it off its list, although for one week it begrudgingly listed it, under pressure, as No. 15, the last number on the paper\u2019s list.\n\nBest-seller or not, Corsi\u2019s narrative is a compendium of all the conspiracy theories put together and is bound to be a basic source for Trump\u2019s defenders, who are taking out the crude edges and using his analysis as the standard for showing why Trump\u2019s presidency must be defended at all costs against the nefarious deep state. In today\u2019s polarized climate, the more that narrative is spread and adopted, the more it poses a serious threat to our democracy.", "description": "Jerome Corsi, the old 2004 Swiftboater, is back with a new theory about how far the \u2018deep state\u2019 will go to destroy Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.
