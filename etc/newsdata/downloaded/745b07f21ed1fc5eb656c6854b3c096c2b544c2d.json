No more nickels and dimes. Nothing but electronic 1s and 0s in a government database.\n\nIn a purely digital-currency world\u2026 the feds will be able to track, monitor, and record all your financial transactions.\n\nWorse, your savings will be subject to whatever crazy policies central bankers come up with to cope with the next financial crisis\u2026 with little chance of escape.\n\nThink of this as a \u201cdigital slaughterhouse\u201d\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a term I (Chris) borrowed from currency expert Jim Rickards. As he put it\u2026\n\nWhen pigs are going to be slaughtered, they are first herded into pens for the convenience of the slaughterhouse. When savers are going to be slaughtered, they are herded into digital accounts from which there is no escape.\n\nAs I showed you yesterday, this is a trend already in motion.\n\nChina plans to roll out a fully digital version of its currency in November. Canada, Britain, Norway, and Sweden are also looking into purely digital versions of their national currencies.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll show you why these countries are creating a roadmap that other governments \u2013 including in the U.S. \u2013 will follow.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see, that\u2019s good news for folks who own private alternatives to these slaughterhouse currencies\u2026 like bitcoin. These are set to become privacy safe havens in the new currency order that\u2019s coming.\n\nElites have been making the case for a cashless America for years\u2026\n\nTake Harvard professor and former International Monetary Fund chief economist Ken Rogoff. You couldn\u2019t find a more perfect example of an establishment economist.\n\nIn 2016, he published a book called The Curse of Cash. The whole thing is about why the U.S. should slowly phase out physical cash from society.\n\nRogoff says cash just helps criminals and people who want to evade the taxman. Here\u2019s his solution\u2026\n\nAll paper currency is gradually phased out, beginning with all notes of $50 and above (or foreign equivalent), then next the $20 bill, leaving only $1, $5, and (perhaps) $10 bills.\n\nIn Rogoff\u2019s world, governments run the money system directly. Payments that can be completely hidden from the government are banned.\n\nAnd his wishes are coming true.\n\nLast year in the U.S., cash payments were just 28% of all transactions\u2026\n\nAnd figures from the Fed reveal that only 6% of all transactions above $100 dollars were made in cash last year.\n\nThere are also already strict restrictions on getting cash out of the bank in America.\n\nIf you try to withdraw, deposit, or convert more than $10,000 to a foreign currency in cash, your bank automatically reports the transaction to the Department of the Treasury as suspicious.\n\nThese are your dollars on deposit. You should be able to move them as you please. But the feds don\u2019t want you to turn them into physical banknotes they can\u2019t monitor.\n\nWhen you transact digitally, you leave a permanent trail\u2026\n\nThis makes a cashless society a key part of the coming surveillance state we\u2019ve been warning you about.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only reason the feds want a purely digital currency system. They also believe it will help them keep the stimulus spigots turned on.\n\nHigh on the agenda are negative interest rates. These are the norm now in Japan and the eurozone. (Just today, the European Central Bank lowered rates to a record sub-zero low of -0.5%.)\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve been warning you, next time the spaghetti hits the fan in America\u2026 the Fed won\u2019t hesitate to cut rates into negative territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical cash makes it hard for central banks to hit you with their negative rates\u2026", "description": "They're coming for your money - every last cent\u2026Source: Shutterstock That may sound like a weird, tinfoil-hat type of thing to say.But it's what's at stake in the War on Cash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs we've been showing you, governments are planning", "authors": ["Chris Lowe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b_02iJstXZJoXZDBmTtvAA--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/08edb3db1c249143cfee99fe5072333e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
