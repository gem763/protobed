The approval drew a sharply worded commentary criticizing Apple in the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily.\n\nApple said in a statement that \"many concerned customers in Hong Kong\" contacted the company about the mapping app. Apple said it immediately began investigating the app's use and found it \"has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.\"\n\n\"The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\" the statement said.\n\nUnder Apple's rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.\n\nIn 2011, Apple modified its app store to remove apps that listed locations for drunken driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.\n\n", "description": "The tech giant said the app violated its rules because it was used to ambush police and by criminals who used it to victimize residents in areas with no law enforcement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106124067-1568213128759tim.jpg?v=1570676928", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
