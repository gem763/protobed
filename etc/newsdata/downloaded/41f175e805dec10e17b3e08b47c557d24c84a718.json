But the more diverse lineup drew mixed reactions on social media. Some praised the company for its efforts. Others flagged the glaring absence of black presenters onstage.\n\n\u201cIs this the most diverse Apple keynote ever?,\u201d tweeted Rakesh Agrawal, a product and marketing strategist. \u201cA lot of women and minorities. (Though, sadly, no African Americans speaking \u2014 some in the ads.)\u201d\n\n[Black lawmakers visit Silicon Valley to press Apple, Twitter and other tech giants on diversity]\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTech giants have long been criticized for a lack of diversity in their workforces, particularly when it comes to leadership positions. A tech industry that is homogeneous is dangerous, critics warn, in part because engineers in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are developing everything from AI assistants to robots. They say a lack of diversity could contribute to problems as new technology plays an ever-growing role in our lives.\n\nIn March, former Facebook manager Mark Luckie told Congress that Silicon Valley\u2019s diversity problem is so severe that discrimination is often built into tech products. Among the examples he cited: an Amazon algorithm that preferred male candidates to female candidates for technical roles and a Google app that automatically labeled images of African Americans as gorillas. (Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[The rarest creature in tech appeared today on Apple\u2019s stage]\n\nLast year, members of the Congressional Black Caucus visited Apple and other large tech companies to discuss why the sector has been slow to diversify its executive ranks, invest in minority-owned start-ups and assist workers who can\u2019t find jobs or afford to live in Silicon Valley. At the time, black employees made up about 9 percent of Apple\u2019s workforce, while white employees represented 54 percent.\n\nThough more recent data shows Apple has gained ground with other minority groups and new hires, the percentage of black employees overall remains at 9 percent. Only 3 percent of high-ranking positions at the company are held by black people.\n\nAs a result of years of criticism, many tech companies \u2014 including Apple \u2014 have stepped up their recruiting efforts and published inclusion reports.\n\n\u201cThings I\u2019ve noticed about #AppleEvent that are rubbing me the wrong way: A ton of upper management white men introducing minorities who do the actual work,\u201d wrote Olivia Moore, a Chicago-based design consultant. \u201cAnother year and so far, not a single black person actually on the stage speaking.\n\nStill, she added, \u201cDiversity matters. They\u2019re learning.\u201d\n\nThings I've noticed about #AppleEvent that are rubbing me the wrong way:\n\n- A ton of upper management white men introducing minorities who do the actual work.\n\n- Another year and so far, not a single black person actually on the stage speaking.\n\n\n\nDiversity matters. They're learning. \u2014 liv \ud83d\ude80 (@oliviamoo_re) September 10, 2019\n\nIn a brighter sign for diversity, multiple women took the stage as presenters at Tuesday\u2019s event, including Sumbul Desai, Apple\u2019s vice president of health, and Kaiann Drance, senior director of product management and marketing for the iPhone.\n\nIn 2015, Apple Vice President Jennifer Bailey gained notoriety for being the first woman to take the stage at an Apple event in recent memory. Before that, Gizmodo said, it could find only six instances of women appearing onstage at main events during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference and product launches, only one of them a company executive.\n\nSome Apple supporters pointed out that the company brought African American icon Oprah Winfrey to the stage for its Apple TV+ announcement earlier this year and that Apple CEO Tim Cook brought his own diversity to Tuesday\u2019s event as a member of the LGBTQ community. (Cook is openly gay.)\n\n[Why emoji are \u2014 finally \u2014 becoming more diverse]\n\nThe conversation about diversity has even extended to emoji, with cultural experts arguing that representation by emoji validates identity and are used throughout the world across language barriers. In July, Apple and Google revealed their designs of new emoji, including depictions of a service dog, wheelchairs and hearing aids. The companies also introduced new versions of people holding hands, with Apple adding 75 new combinations based on skin tone and gender.\n\nApple introduced emoji skin color options beyond its standard light-skinned depiction in 2015. Many users applauded the update, while others felt the changes were poorly executed.", "description": "Usually, Apple\u2019s events are heavily white and male. This year, things changed.
