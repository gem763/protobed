EIA/S\n\n\"The market was under pressure from the Saudis returning to full production much sooner than the market thought plus the bearish inventory stats,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. \"But it turned around as President (Donald) Trump said a China deal could come soon.\"\n\nSources told Reuters that the Saudi Arabia restored production capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day, a quicker recovery than expected after the Sept. 14 attacks that halved more than half the kingdom's output. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and the chief executive of state oil company Aramco, Amin Nasser, have said output will be fully back online by the end of September.\n\nOil prices pared some losses during the session after U.S. President Donald Trump said a deal to end a nearly 15-month trade war with China could happen sooner than people think. markets had weakened on Tuesday after Trump criticized China's trade practices at the United Nations General Assembly and said he would not accept a \"bad deal\" in U.S.-China trade negotiations. is the world's largest oil importer and is second-largest crude consumer after the United States.\n\nTrump also said on Tuesday he saw a path to peace with Iran, cooling other risk premiums built into oil prices, particularly after the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities boosted prices more than 15% in a single day last week. Both the kingdom and the United States have blamed Iran for the attack. market has nearly pared all the gains since the attack.\n\nCommerzbank's Carsten Fritsch said this week's dip in prices was premature.\n\n\"It is reasonable to doubt that Saudi Aramco has already made good the outages in the affected facilities almost completely,\" he said.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/31saE7g U.S. crude stockpiles\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2lyhloz\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "Oil falls about 1% on surprise U.S. crude build, Saudi crude output", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2J0AZ-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
