In the Aeneid, Juno offers Aeolus a wife as a bribe to calm the winds for Aeneas. \u201cI doubt Trump is a student of either Homer or Virgil though,\u201d said Graham Kirby.\n\n2. David Cameron nominated his former adviser Steve Hilton. In his memoir For the Record, published last week, he said Hilton\u2019s ideas \u201ccontinued to be one part brilliant to several parts bonkers, the latter of which included cutting the civil service by 70 per cent, scrapping maternity pay, closing all Jobcentres and \u2013 no joke \u2013 introducing cloud-bursting technology that would, he claimed, stop it raining over Britain. True blue-sky thinking.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n3. Pat Robinson, US televangelist, claimed to have stopped Hurricane Esther and turned it round in 1961, by the power of prayer. Thanks to Steven Fogel.\n\n4.

Nominated by Robert Boston and John Peters.\n\n7. Cloudbuster, a device built by Wilhelm Reich, Austrian psychoanalyst, to draw \u201corgone energy\u201d from the atmosphere, supposedly creating clouds and rain. Inspired \u201cCloudbusting\u201d, the 1985 song by Kate Bush, which describes Reich\u2019s arrest as told by his son, Peter, in A Book of Dreams, 1973. Thanks to No Ordinary Cat.\n\n8. FIDO, Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation, was a successful project to disperse fog around airfields during the Second World War.

In the Judge Dredd comic series Mega-City One had \u201cweather control\u201d, a satellite above the city that kept the weather sunny and warm (or ensured a white Christmas). \u201cIt did create problems for the writers if they wanted atmospheric rain \u2013 they\u2019d have to throw in lines about it malfunctioning,\u201d said Will Cooling.\n\n10. Znamya project: Russian experiments in the 1990s using huge mirrors on satellites to reflect solar power to Earth. \u201cThe reason I remember it,\u201d said Alan Robertson, \u201cis that it was the subject of an item on Radio 2 inviting listeners to contribute a punning headline, with the winning entry being, \u2018The Sun: see it first in the mirror.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the \u201cthere\u2019s always one\u201d category, Star Man nominated the umbrella.\n\nNext week: Marxist-Leninists who went on to other things, starting with Claire Fox, once of the Revolutionary Communist Party, now a Brexit Party MEP.\n\nComing soon: Unlikely things named after battles, such as Chicken Marengo and Maida Vale.\n\nYour suggestions please, and ideas for future Top 10s, to me on Twitter, or by email to top10@independent.co.uk", "description": "This one was inspired by Donald Trump suggesting we should explode a nuclear warhead in a hurricane.
