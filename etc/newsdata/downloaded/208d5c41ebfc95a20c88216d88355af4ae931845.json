The party with the most seats chooses the president. There is no runoff.\n\nElection results are expected to be released within two days of the closing of the polls on Wednesday evening.\n\nVoters started gathering late on Tuesday at Tlogatloga secondary school in Botswana's capital Gaborone, waiting all night to cast their ballot.\n\n\"I have spotted a candidate I think is the right person and I have to get him in,\" 37-year-old banker Chops Maswikiti told AFP news agency. \"He does not belong to the party I voted for in the last two terms but he represents strong sanity on our side.\"\n\nKhama-Masisi fallout\n\nKhama stormed out of the BDP in May after accusing President Masisi - his deputy until last year - of autocracy.\n\nKhama hand-picked Masisi as his successor when he stepped down last year following two terms in office in the diamond-rich country.\n\nBut Masisi moved away from some of Khama's policies, including by loosening restrictions on elephant hunting to appeal to rural voters.\n\nShould Khama fulfil his goal to unseat the BDP, it would be the first time diamond-rich Botswana has seen a change of government in 53 years.\n\nMasisi said earlier this month that he would accept an election loss, while opposition leader Duma Boko was noncommittal.", "description": "Former President Khama broke away from the ruling party and announced his support for the opposition coalition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/a7af9e3095e4413bbca24b6a1d6eeaad_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
