Shigeki Takizaki, the chief of the Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, will visit Washington to listen to more explanations and discuss a response.", "description": "S.Korean Envoy Flies to Washington to Salvage Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/08/2019100800792_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
