Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nYu Hoi-kwan, the senior superintendent of the police public relations branch, told reporters on Tuesday that rumours of deaths and a possible cover-up were \u201ctotally false\u201d.\n\n\u201cCertain people spread such malicious comments to slander the government and stir up grievances in society,\u201d she said.\n\nThe fire services department said the confusion may have come from the fact that first responders initially miscounted the number of injured.\n\nForty-six people were injured at protests that night in particularly tense clashes with police, according to the city\u2019s hospital authority. On 31 August, officers used pepper spray and batons on passengers and suspected protesters inside a subway car.\n\nThe MTR corporation, which operates the subway, took the unusual step on Tuesday of releasing stills from CCTV cameras inside the station.\n\nThe protests have become the worst political crisis faced by Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.\n\nPersistent rumours reflect the deep mistrust with the Hong Kong administration that has emerged since protests began, with 64% of respondents reporting they did not trust the local government in a recent survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.\n\nAmong the rumours that have circulated over the past three months among protesters are reports ranging from an imminent Chinese invasion from across the Shenzhen border to allegations that Hong Kong police may have sexually assaulted female protesters.\n\nMany protesters believe that Chinese police officers are already embedded within the Hong Kong force or that they have attempted to act as agent provocateurs at protests.\n\nMistrust extends across the political spectrum. On Monday, executive council member Fanny Law told a Hong Kong radio station that young women had been persuaded to offer sex to frontline protesters, prompting a political backlash.\n\nCarrie Lam, the Hong Kong leader, said Law\u2019s comments were \u201cher personal views\u201d, but advised residents to be \u201cextremely cautious\u201d in their approach to rumours that circulate online.\n\nChina Daily, meanwhile, said on Facebook that Hong Kong protesters were planning a terrorist attack to coincide with the anniversary of 11 September with \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d planned for non-native speakers of Cantonese.", "description": "Officials say there were no casualties during violent police clearance of subway station", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1b9c18e01551d45a5609f7af7a656e64c7f109/0_337_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02e9307d12e8d5ea90b9f06a016d3747", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
