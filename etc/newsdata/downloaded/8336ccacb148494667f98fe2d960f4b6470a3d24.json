Trump\u2019s personal diplomatic overtures to Kim, including an informal meeting at the Korean Peninsula\u2019s demilitarized zone in June, were put to a test as Pyongyang resumed weapons tests.\n\nNorth Korea tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile on Wednesday, days before the nuclear talks with Washington were set to resume.\n\nKim Myong Gil said that whether Pyongyang breaks its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and missile testing \u201centirely depends on the stance of the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department said Washington is willing to resume discussions with Pyongyang in two weeks, but Pyongyang has not expressed such an intention.\n\nVan Jackson, a former Pentagon official and a lecturer at New Zealand\u2019s Victoria University of Wellington, said Trump\u2019s personal diplomacy with Kim has undermined the nuclear negotiations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom North Korea\u2019s perspective, there is nothing to be gained from working-level talks as long as Trump is a doormat,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nHe said the North Koreans do not intend to engage in sincere negotiations on the working level when they see a bigger gain from directly engaging with Trump.\n\nLast month, Trump said that another summit meeting with the North Korean leader \u201ccould happen soon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRight now, people would like to see that happen. I want to know what\u2019s going to be coming out of it,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\nNorth Korea announces test of new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile\n\nWhile Trump continues to tout North Korea talks as success, signs of any progress are hard to find\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "A State Department spokeswoman said those comments did not reflect \u201cthe content or spirit of today\u2019s 81/2 -hour discussion.\u201d", "authors": ["Min Joo Kim", "Assistant Reporter In Seoul Covering South", "North Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7rjl5ik_Noo4lcymE3gtwT9AkG8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A55BOHH2YI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
