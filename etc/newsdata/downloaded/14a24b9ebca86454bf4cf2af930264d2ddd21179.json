The European Parliament must also ratify the deal.\n\nWhile France is expected to force a conversation about the possibility of issuing a much shorter extension, EU officials said whatever the outcome of that debate, it was clear that Johnson would fall short of his pledge to accomplish Brexit on October 31, \u201cdo or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrexit will not happen end of October,\u201d a senior EU official said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s defeat on the timetable means he will have to accept a Brexit delay if one is officially offered by the EU. Following the vote, Johnson moved to pause the ratification process until there was a decision from Brussels.\n\nEU officials are keen to not be drawn into the U.K.\u2019s internal political fights. To that end, Tusk has proposed granting an extension exactly as requested under the terms of the Benn Act, the U.K. law that forced Johnson to send a letter on Saturday night requesting a delay to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Johnson sent a second letter saying he was against any delay, but the EU has interpreted his first letter as fulfilling the legal requirements of requesting an extension.\n\nTusk said he was going to push for the extension through a written procedure, which would not require leaders to hold another summit in Brussels, to approve the delay. Some diplomats, however, said leaders might insist on meeting in person, since there was still uncertainty about the length of any extension.\n\nParis signaled it was not on board with granting the British request for a delay until January 31.\n\n\u201cIt is up to the British parliament to examine the Withdrawal Agreement as soon as possible. We will see at the end of the week if a purely technical extension of a few days is necessary, to finish this parliamentary procedure,\" a French diplomatic official said.\n\n\"But outside these circumstances, an extension to buy time or to discuss the agreement again is excluded. We have reached a deal, and now it must be implemented without delay.\u201d\n\nRym Momtaz contributed reporting from Paris.", "description": "But Paris signals it is not on board with delay until January 31.", "authors": ["David M.
