Amy Klobuchar said: \u201cAt least Bernie is being honest here, and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.\u201d\n\n\u2022 South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also attacked Warren for not clearly saying whether or not middle-class taxpayers would see higher taxes due to \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d He said: \u201cA yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer. This is why people are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke had this broad criticism: \u201cSometimes, I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Klobuchar had another zinger aimed at Warren, as the Minnesota senator argued for her plan to give Americans a public option over the Massachusetts lawmaker\u2019s approach: \u201cYou are making Republican talking points right here in this room.\u201d She added: \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nRelated: Warren edged Biden last week in an average of polls\n\nAlso read: Some 2020 Democrats are angling for the VP slot \u2014 a gambit that rarely pays off\n\nTaking a different approach, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker warned his fellow Democrats following their attacks on Warren. \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen this script before. It didn\u2019t work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.\u201d\n\nNow read: 12 Democrats square off in Ohio presidential debate \u2014 live blog recap\n\nAnd see: Biden plays defense at debate: \u2018My son did nothing wrong\u2019", "description": "With Elizabeth Warren challenging Joe Biden this month for the front-runner label, she was expected to get extra attention at Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Ohio....", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT381_warren_ZG_20191015213059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
