I refute the claims that I re-applied for a licence with any other accredited sanctioning body (as has been stated in the press).\n\n|Therefore, I have not been refused a licence as alleged. It is my decision to box again (although may be seen by some as \u2018controversial\u2019). However, unlike many boxers, I have continued to maintain my fitness and healthy lifestyle since my last fight with Steve Collins.\n\n\"I acknowledge the risks associated with the sport, and fully understand the importance of being fully assessed by medical professionals. Therefore, I\u2019ve welcomed the requirements of BIBA to clearly establish that I AM \u2018fit to box\u2019.\n\n\"I have undergone numerous and regular medical investigations to confirm this, including periodic MRI brain scans. Now that I\u2019m in the UK, within the next few weeks I have welcomed (at the request of BIBA) a further series of tests \u2013 including another MRI brain scan to provide clear clarification of my state of health.\n\n(Image: Paisley Daily Express)\n\n\"BIBA are also facilitating additional safeguarding at ringside for my fight (which far exceeds the criteria of any other sanctioning organisation).\n\n\n\n\"My desire to box again is something that has remained within me for several years\u2026 It is MY choice alone, and I've not been persuaded or coerced by any other person.\n\n\"I feel like that I am being discriminated against because of my age. I can also confirm that I have chosen to fight an opponent who is a renowned former world champion in his own right. The challenge that I\u2019ve set myself is high.\n\n\"This IS a tough challenge, but one that I feel I need to pursue to bring about final closure and an inner peace of mind for myself as a man. It\u2019s NOT about the money, it\u2019s about closing a desire that remains within my mind, body and soul.\n\n\"This is my dream, and I hope boxing fans around the world will embrace my wishes, and support and respect the fact that this is my decision alone.\"", "description": "Benn will take on fellow former world champion Sakio Bika in Birmingham on November 23", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Pa", "Paisley Daily Express"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540804.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nigel-Benn-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
