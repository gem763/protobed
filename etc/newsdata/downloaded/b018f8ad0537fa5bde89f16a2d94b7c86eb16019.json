The growth has been incredible.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro, leaders of key emerging markets, were also attending the summit along with King Abdullah II of Jordan and four African leaders.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was also leading a high-powered American delegation including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Jared Kushner, son-in-law to President Donald Trump who spoke at the summit of his Middle East peace plan.\n\n\u201cThis is a major victory\u201d for the crown prince \u2014 often known by his initials MBS \u2014 said Samuel Ramani, a doctoral researcher at Oxford University.\n\n\u201cTo see corporate leaders now argue that Saudi Arabia has made both reforms and mistakes under MBS and argue for the value of economic engagement with Riyadh suggests that the business world is moving on from Khashoggi\u2019s murder,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Attention on Aramco \u2013\n\nA prime draw at the Riyadh conference is the much-delayed initial public offering (IPO) of state oil giant Aramco, the world\u2019s most profitable company, for which global banks and consultants are vying for business.\n\nThe kingdom plans to list as much as five percent of the state oil behemoth, raising some $100 billion in an exercise analysts say could put the firm\u2019s value at between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion.\n\nSaudi-owned Al-Arabiya television said Tuesday that Aramco will finally make its stock market debut on December 11, on the Saudi Tadawul exchange.\n\n\u201cI expect that many international observers as well as most attendees will pay more attention to the delayed Aramco IPO than to the Khashoggi legacy,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics.\n\nThe global fallout over Khashoggi\u2019s killing rendered Prince Mohammed a pariah, testing alliances with Western powers and casting a shadow on his reform agenda aimed at weaning the kingdom off its dependence on oil.\n\nThe CIA has reportedly concluded that the crown prince, who controls all major levers of power in the Saudi government, likely ordered the killing \u2014 a charge he has repeatedly denied.\n\nSince then, the government has attempted an image revamp \u2014 hosting Western musicians at concerts and easing restrictions on women\u2019s rights.\n\nOn the sidelines of the conference Tuesday, memorandums of understanding were signed on $15 billion in foreign investment deals billed as representing \u201cthe scale and diversity of the kingdom\u2019s economy\u201d.\n\nBut away from the spotlight, Riyadh has struggled to attract foreign investment and its economy remains heavily reliant on the oil that has brought it unimaginable wealth over the decades.", "description": "Riyadh (AFP) \u2013 Saudi Arabia drew top finance moguls and political leaders to its Davos-style investment summit Tuesday, in stark contrast to last", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/8fce7d_saudi-arabia-hosting-davos-style-economic-conference-is-project-as-dynamic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
