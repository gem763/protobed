The outlet is known for its support of the city\u2019s pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nCoconuts Hong Kong reports that Lung Mun Cafe in Hung Hom, Kowloon, was popular among pro-democracy demonstrators, handing them out free meals and placing posters supportive of their cause. Its support for the protests has led it to be labeled as a \u201cyellow business\u201d supportive of the anti-China demonstrations, as opposed to a \u201cblue business\u201d which backs Beijing.\n\nAccording to local outlet Ming Pao, the vandalism took place at about 5 a.m. on Thursday morning while staff members were preparing food for the morning rush. On arrival, the four men stormed into the restaurant and began overturning tables, breaking crockery, seizing the restaurant\u2019s cash register, and smashing windows with metal bars before fleeing the scene.\n\nVideos posted on social media following the incident showed members of staff assessing the damage and attempting to clean up the mess by the thugs.\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s owner remained undeterred, posting on Facebook that they would be resuming business as normal.\n\n\u201cThere may be a few delays in our service, and we will switch to handwritten orders. I hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cThank you all for your efforts and support. The shop has been cleaned up and business will be resuming as normal.\u201d\n\nLocal outlets reported that after hearing about the vandalism, dozens of people lined up outside the restaurant to eat there and help them get back up and running.\n\n\u201cLots of people keep complaining that protesters are vandalizing certain business, yet some people have just gone on to do exactly that,\u201d one individual standing in the queue named Wan told Apple Daily.\n\nLast week, the restaurant\u2019s manager was featured in a viral video pleading with a woman supportive of Beijing to leave the establishment after she got into a vicious argument with pro-democracy supporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the boss of this restaurant and I\u2019m begging you; I don\u2019t want your business, please leave,\u201d he says in the video.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll let everyone in this restaurant eat for free,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t want your business, I don\u2019t want to take your money, it\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by widespread protests since June after the city\u2019s China-controlled legislature proposed a bill that would have given Beijing the power to extradite its citizens to China. CEO Carrie Lam has since promised to scrap the bill, although the protests have expanded into a wider pushback against Chinese communism and police brutality.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Four thugs believed to have ties to China attacked a\u00a0restaurant in Hong Kong known for its support of the city's pro-democracy demonstrators.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hong-kong-protest-food-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
