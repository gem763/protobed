Kamala Harris (D-CA) is tanking in Iowa \u2013 despite a switch in campaign strategies to blitz the state, sarcastically telling a colleague in September that she is \u201cf*cking moving\u201d to the Hawkeye State \u2013 Emerson Polling results released this week reveal.\n\nThe California senator has experienced a steady decline in both national and early primary and caucus state polls in recent weeks. The trend was seemingly sparked by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s (D-HI) pointed attack on Harris\u2019s controversial prosecutorial record \u2013 jailing hundreds of people for marijuana violations and later making light of smoking marijuana \u2013 during the Democrat debate in July.\n\nHarris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is \u201cf*cking moving to Iowa.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m f*cking moving to Iowa\u2019 \u2013 Kamala Harris,\u201d read an email following the presidential hopeful\u2019s quip.\n\n\u201cShe cut to the chase!\u201d the email stated. \u201cWe\u2019re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.\u201d\n\nThe following month, Harris launched her \u201cI feel your pain\u201d tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more \u201cintimate\u201d settings, even helping some \u201cprepare Sunday suppers.\u201d\n\nDespite the Iowa push, Harris continues to tank in the polls, with the latest Emerson Polling survey showing Harris garnering just two percent among Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa.\n\nThe poll, taken October 13-16, 2019 among 313 Democrat caucus voters, showed Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) topping the field with 23 percent support each. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) overtook Sanders for third place with 16 percent support to the Vermont senator\u2019s 13 percent.\n\nAndrew Yang (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, followed by Gov. Steve Bullock (D) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent and three percent, respectively.\n\nHarris, who once mocked Gabbard\u2019s low poll numbers, tied with both the Hawaiian lawmaker and Tom Steyer (D), with two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 5.5 percent:\n\nHarris mocked Gabbard following their contentious face-off in July\u2019s debate, telling CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper:\n\nThis is going to sound immodest, but I\u2019m obviously a top tier candidate, and so, I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight because there are a lot of people that are trying to make the stage for the next debate.\n\n\u201cEspecially when people are at zero or one percent or whatever she might be at, and so, I did expect that I might take hits tonight,\u201d she added, a direct reference to Gabbard:\n\nKamala Harris on Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s comments regarding her record as a prosecutor: \u201cI\u2019m obviously a top tier candidate and so I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight. \u2026 I'm prepared to move on\u201d #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/kPNYfBs2rB \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) August 1, 2019\n\nHarris continues to struggle in national polls, dropping to fifth place with 5.2 percent in the current Real Clear Politics average, behind Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg.", "description": "Sen.
