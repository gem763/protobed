Additionally, Exception PCB has no visibility or access to any sensitive programme information and there is limited to no risk associated with their minimal role in the programme.\"\n\nIt added: \"Should Exception PCB be determined an unapproved source in the future, GE Aviation has alternate sources of supply that would ensure no impact to the programme.\"\n\nA director at Exception PCB had initially been happy to talk on camera about the firm's F-35 work and show Sky News around its plant on an industrial estate in Tewkesbury.\n\nBut the request was denied when Mike Devine sought approval from his boss and from GE Aviation.\n\nHe responded on Friday night to emailed questions sent the previous day.\n\nImage: Paul Beaver is a defence analyst\n\nMr Devine said Exception has had a close partnership with GE Aviation since the 1980s and promotes its Chinese ownership.\n\n\"We produce bare circuit boards only in the UK for all of our aerospace and defence companies and have no visibility or access to the design data nor drawings for the boards. All that is supplied from any customer is manufacturing data,\" he said.\n\n\"This is 'dumb' Gerber data containing only information to enable Exception to produce only the bare PCB's, no additional electronic information is applied or supplied\".\n\nMr Devine said measures are in place to ensure no Chinese national can access F-35 related information.\n\n\"All data is secured on a separate internal server and access to data is protected by passwords, only accessible by a selected few, of which have been audited by GE,\" he said.\n\nClark Ince, a director of Hallmark Electronics, another printed circuit board manufacturer in the UK, said firms make boards according to a design given to them by their customer.\n\nHe said he thinks it is possible for a company that buys another firm to glean details of what the circuit boards on its acquisition's order books might be used for even if - as in the case of Exception PCB - it is simply bare circuit boards for the F-35.\n\n\"They can look at certain designs and probably recognise what it's used for. If it is similar to what they are making but of a better design then they will copy it,\" he said.\n\nImage: The next generation of F-35 is in production. Pictured: An F35B aircraft\n\nIt is also possible to embed technology such as a chip without a customer's knowledge into a circuit board that could affect the way it functions, he said.\n\nAsked whether he thought there was a risk to allow a Chinese-owned company to make circuit boards for the F-35, Mr Ince said: \"Yes I think so, personally I think so.\"\n\nDocuments on Exception PCB's website show that the company has also done work on other sensitive defence programmes including the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, operated by the Royal Air Force, the US military's F-16 warplanes and the Apache attack helicopter.\n\nAn MoD source said the firm has been involved in Lockheed Martin's F-35 programme since its inception almost two decades ago.\n\nDefence and security experts said it is surprising that a Chinese firm was allowed to acquire a British company with these kind of defence contracts.\n\n\"I think it's breath-taking,\" said Bob Seely, a Tory MP and army reservist who co-authored a paper about concerns on China's Huawei and Britain's 5G mobile network.\n\n\"It's not a question of: Is this bad? But it's a question of: How bad is it?\" he said.\n\nMr Seely has raised the matter with Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt in a letter.\n\nIn it, he said: \"Will you consider a supply chain review for defence and military equipment?\n\n\"May I ask how many firms that bid for UK defence contracts are owned by firms from authoritarian or potentially adversarial states?\n\n\"I believe this example is symptomatic of a wider problem about how open and free nations deal with China's growing economic and digital power.\n\n\"It is clearly vital to continue to seek good relations with China given its expanding influence, but we need to be mindful that the Chinese state has a very different world view to our own.\n\n\"Whether it is in relation to 5G comms and Huawei, or this instance of a Chinese-owned firm now producing equipment for the F35, we need an urgent national conversation about how we deal with high-tech from authoritarian and potentially adversarial states.\"\n\nPaul Beaver, a defence analyst, said there can be a blurring of the line between commercial entities and the state in China, which is particularly relevant when it comes to defence.\n\nBeijing \"believes that commercial companies in China are part of the state effort\", he said.\n\n\"What people are concerned about - and I'm one of those - is if you have anything with a Chinese connection at least it ought to be known and the risks need to be assessed\u2026 To have it in the world's first fifth generation strike aircraft I think is really a cause for concern.\"\n\nLockheed Martin said there are no \"direct F-35 suppliers based in China or under Chinese ownership\". This does not include indirect suppliers like Exception PCB, however.\n\n\"We work closely with our industry partners to manage the F-35 Global Supply Chain in accordance with rigorous defence acquisition standards to ensure no parts and components from unapproved sources are included in aircraft production,\" Lockheed Martin said.\n\nGE Aviation said it \"works closely with all of our suppliers to ensure rigorous compliance with defence acquisition standards, export regulations and all legal obligations, including the F-35 supply chain.\n\n\"Exception PCB - a commonly-used industry supplier - produces bare circuit boards in the UK for GE Aviation and has no visibility to the design or drawing of the F-35 system.\"", "description": "An expert said it's possible to embed technology such as a chip without a customer's knowledge that could change how it functions.", "authors": ["Deborah Haynes", "Foreign Affairs Editor"], "top_image": "https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/1600x900/skynews-f35-jet_4381142.jpg?20180805094309", "published_at": "2019-06-14"}
