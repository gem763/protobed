Mennis Award from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) for their study finding that permanent tariffs on China would drive an employment boom for American workers.\n\n\u201cThe effects of freer trade on the US economy are complex, and often negative for long-term economic growth and income equality,\u201d Ferry said in a statement. \u201cIn this study, we attempted to show that activist trade intervention like tariffs, if implemented correctly, can produce positive results for the US economy.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the study concluded that a permanent 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports would create about 1.05 million American jobs by 2024 and boost the nation\u2019s GDP by $167 billion.\n\nStudy: Permanent Tariff on All Chinese Imports Would Create 1M U.S. Jobshttps://t.co/bLMatDBfsS \u2014 John Binder \ud83d\udc7d (@JxhnBinder) July 26, 2019\n\nCPA Chairman Dan DiMicco said the award is further validation from mainstream economists that permanent tariffs on Chinese imports are key to driving U.S. job growth.\n\n\u201cThis is a very gratifying honor,\u201d DiMicco said in a statement. \u201cIt validates CPA\u2019s longstanding critique of free trade. Mainstream economists are finally recognizing that faulty China trade has hurt America\u2019s workers and domestic manufacturers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Ferry and Byers have demonstrated, returning production to the United States can provide much needed growth and job creation for the overall economy,\u201d DiMicco said.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
