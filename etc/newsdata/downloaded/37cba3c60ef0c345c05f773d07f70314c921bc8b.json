Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. (cut) He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\"President Trump added that U.S. Special Forces suffered no losses during the raid, and he thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq for their support.Following the announcement, French President Emmanuel Macron said Baghdadi's death is a hard blow for the Islamic State, but just one stage in the fight against the terror group.He added that the fight is France's top priority in the Middle East.Russia's defense ministry, however, reacted with skepticism, stating that \"it had no reliable information on the U.S. operation.\"The following day, Baghdadi's right hand man and ISIS spokesman, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir was also killed in a joint raid by Kurdish-led militia and U.S. forces in northern Syria.While the deaths of the top two ISIS leaders deals a significant blow to the terrorist group, security experts believe the extremist organization remains a global threat.Kim Bo-kyoung Arirang news.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
