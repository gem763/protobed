He should pick one with a growing national stature, one with the background to appeal to Republicans and Democrats alike, and one who has openly accused the Democratic Party of playing a rigged game in its primary campaign.\n\nMitt Romney should pick Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nThey agree on little politically, but that is a benefit. A Romney-Gabbard ticket could be based, legitimately, on decency, truthfulness and honor. They could point the American people away from the toxicity that has come to infect American political life, and remind us that we are not two countries seeking disparate futures, but one people experimenting with different means to the same end.", "description": "", "authors": ["Davies", "Newsday.Com Opinion Commentary"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
