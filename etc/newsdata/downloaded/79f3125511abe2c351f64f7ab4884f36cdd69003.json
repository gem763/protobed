'Right now the Republican leaders and members of the Congress, both Senate and House, are holding back because they're terrified of what will happen to any one of them if they speak up. Will they lose a primary? I don't know why that's such a disaster.'\n\n'When they see things that aren't right they need to say something about it,' Powell continued. 'Because our foreign policy is a shambles right now, in my humble judgement. And I see things happening that are hard to understand.'\n\nPowell joined CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria and the first ever female U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for an October 1 lecture, which gained traction after CNN shared video of the event on its Twitter page over the weekend.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Colin Powell said Republican lawmakers need to 'get a grip' and stand up to the president. He said they're 'holding back because they're terrified' they won't win reelection\n\nAt a lecture where he was joined by the first ever female U.S. secretary os state Madeleine Albright (middle), Powell said they would have stood up to the president during their tenure. He also called Trump's foreign policy 'a shambles'\n\n\u201cThe Republican party has got to get a grip on itself,\u201d Former Secy. of State Colin Powell on the state of the current GOP. \u201cRepublican leaders and members of the Congress\u2026 are holding back because they\u2019re terrified of what will happen [to] any one of them if they speak out.\" pic.twitter.com/zkCScy8uA1 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 6, 2019\n\nPowell served as secretary of state under George W. Bush, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in George H. W. Bush's administration and was national security adviser to Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut during the lecture, he appeared hesitant to call himself a Republican, and in recent years Powell has leaned toward Democratic candidates \u2013 expressing support for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\n'I'm a moderate Republican who believes we should have a strong foreign policy, a strong defense policy, but we have to look out for our people,' Powell said. 'And ought to work hard to make sure we're one country, one team. And so on that basis, I called myself a Republican.'\n\nHe also noted that he had not been affiliated with a party throughout his military career.\n\nPowell has been measured when speaking publicly about the current president, and admitted in 2016 that he decided to vote for Hillary Clinton because she was more qualified. Later he conceded that he felt Trump was not a moral leader.\n\nThe year of the 2016 presidential elections, Powell's email was hacked and leaked online, and in one message to a former aide he called then-candidate Trump a 'national disgrace.'\n\nAt the lecture, Powell also referenced a September incident when Trump appeared to share an altered hurricane weather map that contradicted weather forecasts.\n\nPowell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in George H. W. Bush's administration and was national security adviser to Ronald Reagan\n\nHe also served as secretary of state under George W. Bush, but hesitated to call himself a Republican during the lecture, and recently has expressed support for Democrats \u2013 including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\n\n'In my time, in her time, one of us would have gone to the President and said, 'you screwed up,'' Powell said, referring to Albright, who served as head of the State Department under Bill Clinton. 'So we've got to fix it, and we'll put out a correction.'\n\n'You know what happened this time? They ordered the Commerce Department to go out and back up whatever the President has said,' Powell continued. 'This is not the way the country is supposed to run, and Congress is one of the institutions that should be doing something about this. All parts of Congress.'\n\nAs Powell's comments circulate, the president made a controversial foreign policy move that shook up Washington Monday morning.\n\nTrump decided to withdraw troops from parts of northern Syria, which he defended as part of a larger policy of pulling U.S. troops out of 'ridiculous Endless Wars.' He also insisted in a Twitter thread that the ISIS caliphate is now '100%' defeated.\n\nThe removal of troops from this region is a move that will make way for a Turkish invasion in the region and likely doom the Kurdish fighters who the U.S. has been aiding for years.", "description": "A retired four-star general who served under three Republican administrations told the GOP in a recently shared lecture that they need to 'get a grip.'", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19400438-0-image-a-30_1570459632337.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
