As most of the Asian equity markets look bearish amid growing uncertainty on Brexit deal. No doubt that the global equity markets enjoyed a bounce on Thursday from the initial Brexit news, but uncertainty still looms over there till the final parliamentary approval. I find that the growing skepticism looks evident enough to extend exhaustion in global equity markets, as China has posted its weakest growth in nearly three decades, countering a global lift in sentiment on the UK and European Union striking a long-awaited Brexit deal.\n\nOn the other hand, exhaustion looks to extend in global equity markets since the escalation of Sino-U.S. tariff tussle, which may enhance bearish pressure in global equity markets. Secondly, the disappointing Chinese data came as Japan's core inflation slowed to near 2-1/2-year lows in September, raising expectations that the Bank of Japan could add to its already massive monetary stimulus.\n\nI find that the weak Indian economic data announced on Monday; looks evident enough to extend bearishness in Indian equity markets which may continue till weekly closing. Secondly, World Bank on Sunday has already slashed its growth forecast for India's current fiscal year to 6% down from 7.5%, warning that the \"severe\" slowdown could further weaken the country's stuttering financial sector. In its last forecast in April, the bank had said that India's economic outlook was strong and expected growth of 7.5% during the current fiscal year that began in April.
