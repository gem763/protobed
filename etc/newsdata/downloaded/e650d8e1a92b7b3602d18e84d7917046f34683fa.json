WARNER BROS. PICTURES\n\nThe laugh, the green and purple wardrobe, the face paint: No matter where the Joker shows up, he always makes a statement. Usually an explosive one, with a freaky smile on that face.\n\nAlmost as long as Batman has been protecting the denizens of Gotham City \u2013 80 years and counting! \u2013 his archenemy has followed the Dark Knight wherever he's gone, from comic books and TV shows to movies and even the Academy Awards, where the late Heath Ledger was posthumously honored for his iconic version in 2008's \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\nThe latest take is also looking rather Oscar-ready: Joaquin Phoenix reimagines the villain as the center of a dark psychological character study in director Todd Phillips' \"Joker\" (in theaters Friday).\n\nReview: Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' questions if there's empathy for the devil\n\nWhy so serious, Oscar?: 5 reasons why Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' is a bona fide awards threat\n\nHere's how Phoenix ranks among the other Clown Princes of Crime to hit the big screen:\n\nJared Leto stars as a contemporary Joker in \"Suicide Squad.\" (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\n7. Jared Leto (\u2018Suicide Squad,\u2019 2016)\n\nIt takes serious chutzpah to be the first guy to play Joker since Heath Ledger\u2019s Oscar-winning turn \u2013 and probably even more to put a cursive \u201cDamaged\u201d tattoo on your forehead. Say what you will about the polarizing \u201cSquad,\u201d this very different take on the Joker, which makes him a lunatic nightclub owner and over-the-top gangster with a grill, was at least a big swing for something new. And we got Margot Robbie\u2019s Harley Quinn out of his whole deal, so let\u2019s call it a win.\n\nThe Joker (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) revealed his sensitive side in \"The Lego Batman Movie.\" (Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\n6. Zach Galifianakis (\u2018The Lego Batman Movie,\u2019 2017)\n\nEverything\u2019s a lot more family friendly when animated building-block characters are involved, and this animated Joker is no different. He\u2019s all about taking over Gotham City, teaming up with pop-culture baddies like Voldemort and the Wicked Witch of the West to do so, but the overly sensitive antagonist ultimately yearns to be Batman\u2019s No. 1 bad guy \u2013 easier said than done when the macho Dark Knight isn't really a \u201crelationship\u201d sort.\n\nBoston Celtics coach Red Auerbach (center) poses at the 1966 NBA Finals with the villains from \"Batman: The Movie\": Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Lee Meriwether as Catwoman, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin, and Cesar Romero as the Joker.

Cesar Romero (\u2018Batman: The Movie,\u2019 1966)\n\nOf all the actors playing colorful goons who get punched by Adam West\u2019s Caped Crusader, Romero always seemed to be having the most fun, adding a chuckling mastermind to an already-storied career when he was nearing 60. The TV shows were a campy blast, but the movie gave us something special, teaming Romero\u2019s Joker with Burgess Meredith\u2019s Penguin, Frank Gorshin\u2019s Riddler and Lee Meriwether\u2019s Catwoman as the coolest injustice league ever.\n\nMark Hamill reprised his \"Batman: The Animated Series\" role as the Joker for the animated movie \"Batman: The Killing Joke.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS. ANIMATION)\n\n4. Mark Hamill (\u2018Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,\u2019 1993, and \u2018Batman: The Killing Joke,\u2019 2016)\n\nOne of the highlights of the 1990s seminal \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d was the \u201cStar Wars\u201d hero voicing the Joker so well, combining playful charisma and gleeful merriment with malice and mayhem. Hamill stole the show first with the big-screen \u201cPhantasm,\u201d which tied into the cartoon, and also reprised his maniacal role for \u201cKilling Joke,\u201d an adaptation of the violent comic-book story line that dug into the Joker\u2019s enigmatic origins.\n\nJack Nicholson turned in a playfully psychotic, all-time turn as the Joker \u2013 until Heath Ledger redefined the supervillain almost 20 years later. (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\n3. Jack Nicholson (\u2018Batman,\u2019 1989)\n\nMichael Keaton might have been a left-field choice as Tim Burton\u2019s main man, yet Nicholson was a no-brainer as a mob goon who falls into a chemical vat and emerges as a disfigured poster boy for criminal flamboyance. Nicholson brought the unhinged side he showed in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d and especially \u201cThe Shining\u201d to bear with a dark charisma (and serious moves when it came to Prince songs).\n\nArthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) goes down a bad path that involves garish face paint and green hair in \"Joker.\" (Photo: NIKO TAVERNISE)\n\n2. Joaquin Phoenix (\u2018Joker,\u2019 2019)\n\nThe three-time Oscar nominee puts a human face on unbridled anarchy with his portrayal of Arthur Fleck, a troubled Gotham City clown who\u2019s bullied and mocked until he's transformed into a symbol for a crime-ridden city on the verge of a violent revolution. In a twisted flip of the classic hero\u2019s journey, Phoenix dons the green hair and garish makeup of the classic villain in making Joker the star of his own Shakespearean tragedy.\n\nHeath Ledger won a posthumous Oscar for his role as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight.\" (Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\n1. Heath Ledger (\u2018The Dark Knight,\u2019 2008)\n\nUnlike Phoenix\u2019s portrayal, Ledger\u2019s bad guy comes out of nowhere as a mysterious agent of chaos with no background or raison d\u2019etre, and that\u2019s the beauty of his antagonistic turn: \u201cDo I really look like a guy with a plan?\u201d his Joker sneers. Instead he exists as the perfect foil for Christian Bale\u2019s Batman, a twitchy and clever madman who questions human goodness, deliciously delights in pitting people against one another, and has multiple stories for how got his horrific scars. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else being a Joker who is this enjoyable to watch and this terrifying to think could ever be real.\n\nNo cosplay permitted: Landmark Theatres ban costumes, as well as masks, face paint, for 'Joker' screenings\n\nGetting his 'Joker' on: For Joaquin Phoenix's hair, it wasn't always easy going green\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/01/every-movie-joker-even-joaquin-phoenix-definitively-ranked/3819612002/", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix's dark 'Joker' is the latest to hit the big screen.
