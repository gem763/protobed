The company has said it would cut revenues by $20 million.\n\nAlmost 13 per cent of votes cast at the AGM were against Wagners' remuneration report.\n\nMr Wagner said the board acknowledged shareholders' dissatisfaction and was unsure of the exact reasons for the protest vote but that it may be linked to the poor performance of Wagners' stock which has more than halved in value over the past year to close on Wednesday at $1.94.\n\nThe protest vote represented only about 2 per cent of shareholders because the Wagner family - which own 55 per cent of the construction group - and management who own shares did not vote on the remuneration report.\n\nWagners' remuneration committee is chaired by independent non-executive director Peter Crowley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChief executive Cameron Coleman was paid $550,699 last financial year and did not receive a short-term bonus because the company did not meet its pro forma earnings targets. Mr Wagner was paid $200,000 and other directors earned $100,000.\n\nThe five board members include two directors from the Wagner family.\n\nWagners is putting together a long-term incentive plan to be implemented this financial year but is yet to disclose its terms.\n\nMr Wagner said earnings in 2019-20 were not expected to be \"materially better or worse\" than 2018-19, when annual net profits dropped 48 per cent to $12.8 million. However, the company's composite fibre business eventually could outgrow its construction materials business.\n\nThe US market for composite materials was \"huge\", he said, adding that North American engineers and infrastructure owners were starting to see the benefits of composites for use in bridges and boardwalks.\n\nWagners built its first bridge made of composites in North America 15 years ago to replace a 13-year-old bridge made of steel and concrete, and has not had to do any maintenance work on it, he said. The company since has built five road bridges in North America and a boardwalk.", "description": "Construction group Wagners is not worried about being ditched by investors if it works on projects associated with Adani's Carmichael mine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1921%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ef3e88b0d3c5d94ad5f8b0c88ba1a3345c43b9ff", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
