Today he told a group of reporters that he has \u201cevolved past\u201d his earlier hesitance about abortion.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, I said clearly that I was and always would be pro-choice but I also, in a context where I was talking about my own personal faith, expressed something that I no longer believe,\u201d Trudeau said. He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is actually coherent or consistent for someone to say, particularly a man, to say that they are pro-choice but don\u2019t like abortion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like\u2014I evolved past that particular perspective. I continue to be and will always be fully pro-choice, but I no longer feel that I can or need to say that I\u2019m against abortion. That\u2019s not for me, as a man, to say.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s blackface scandal definitely seems to be paying off for the left in Canada. Shortly after the scandal broke he announced a plan to ban \u201cassault rifles.\u201d He also recently announced a plan to plant 2 billion trees and met with Greta Thunberg (who said Trudeau wasn\u2019t doing enough). Now he\u2019s moving left on abortion. If the media discovers one more photo of Justin in blackface, he may be forced to call for full communism.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting Opinion Piece in the Washington Post today which notes that the news about Trudeau\u2019s blackface came from American news outlets rather than Canadian ones:\n\nMany Canadians have wondered why it took an American publication, Time magazine, to break the blackface story, particularly given that the most damning photo was found in the yearbook of the Vancouver school where he once taught \u2014 hardly an obscure source. It evoked memories of the Trudeau \u201cgroping\u201d scandal that captivated Canada months earlier, in which a blogger exposed a damning story from Trudeau\u2019s younger years that had similarly heretofore escaped mainstream attention. Two Trudeau biographies by respected Canadian journalists have been released in recent months, yet neither is interested in the prime minister\u2019s origin story, preferring to study his short career as a politician in isolation. Such ongoing media disinterest in exploring the considerably larger portion of Trudeau\u2019s life spent as a dilettante dauphin has provoked endless right-wing conspiracy theories, often extrapolated from provocative leads the media has avoided chasing. What was the nature of Trudeau\u2019s admitted friendship with Christopher Ingvaldson, a man convicted of child pornography possession in 2013 who taught with Trudeau in Vancouver? Why did Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau respond with \u201cHa! Really?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not saying it did or didn\u2019t\u201d when she was told in a 2015 interview that her husband had denied cheating? What did Trudeau mean when he allegedly told Don Martin a decade ago that he had \u201ctoo many secrets\u201d to run for office? Why is Trudeau continuing to deny having drinks with far-right provocateur Faith Goldy in 2012, despite credible witnesses claiming otherwise?\n\nIn sum, there seems to be a lot about woke Justin Trudeau\u2019s past that the Canadian media isn\u2019t terribly interested in looking into. So long as he keeps moving left on policy, maybe he\u2019ll continue to get a pass.
