the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border.\n\nThe preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal.\n\nHowever, the UK's current red lines, which include leaving the customs union and the single market, make that very difficult.\n\nA technological solution for the border is favoured by many Brexit supporters but the EU are very sceptical about whether it can work without a degree of close regulatory alignment.\n\nWhat if the trade deal or the technology aren't enough?\n\nThen the backstop would be applied.\n\nIt would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border?\n\nThat means that goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards.\n\nIt would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nThese arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary.\n\nWhy has this been so controversial?\n\nIn November 2018, then Prime Minister Theresa May said her cabinet had finally backed a deal between UK-EU negotiators that included agreement on a backstop.\n\nThis sparked a huge backlash from MPs at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThey feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals.\n\nSome MPs said the backstop would only be acceptable if it had a strict time limit or if the UK had a unilateral right to end the arrangement.\n\nThe DUP, a Northern Ireland unionist party that props up the Conservative minority government, also objected strongly saying it would not accept any additional Northern Ireland-only checks, because it is concerned that any differences between NI and Great Britain could threaten the union.\n\nHowever, business and farming groups in Northern Ireland urged support for the backstop saying it was an acceptable way to protect cross-border trade.\n\nNon-unionist political parties in Northern Ireland also support the backstop.\n\nHowever, Mrs May's failure to get parliamentary support for the backstop would ultimately lead to her resignation.\n\nWhat does legal advice on the backstop say?\n\nIn March 2019 the EU and UK agreed a joint interpretation of the backstop, clarifying the earlier deal.\n\nIt explained the ways in which UK could start a \"formal dispute\" against the EU, if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop indefinitely.\n\nIt also emphasised that the EU would undertake joint work to find the technological solutions favoured by Brexit supporters.\n\nThis was intended to help Theresa May win parliamentary support for the backstop.\n\nHowever, her Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, concluded that \"the legal risk remains unchanged\" that if a post-Brexit trade agreement cannot be reached due to genuinely \"intractable differences\", the UK would have \"no internationally lawful means\" of leaving the backstop without EU agreement.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to \"getting rid\" of the backstop, describing it as \"divisive\" and \"anti-democratic\".\n\n\"No country that values its independence, and indeed its self-respect, could agree to a treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does,\" Mr Johnson told the House of Commons.\n\nHe is adamant that a no-deal Bexit is preferable to the backstop.\n\nHowever, the EU has, so far, given no signal that it will be willing to renegotiate.", "description": "BBC News NI assesses the current position on the Irish border and Brexit.", "authors": ["John Campbell", "Bbc News Ni Economics", "Business Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17E0C/production/_101940879_brexitgraphic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-01"}
