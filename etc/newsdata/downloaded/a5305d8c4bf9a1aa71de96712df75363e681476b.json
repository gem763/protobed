The patient\u2019s longstanding treatment is not only becoming less effective; now it is also introducing harmful side effects. A better approach exists, but it is not available at the new doctor\u2019s hospital. And in the facilities where it is available, the doctors are too distracted to take on the case.\n\nThe new doctor is Christine Lagarde, the widely admired former managing director of the International Monetary Fund who will soon succeed Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank (ECB). Her challenge will be to avoid a second lost decade of low, insufficiently inclusive eurozone growth. How the patient fares under her care \u2013 and whether she can get key eurozone governments to provide the necessary treatment \u2013 will define not just her own legacy, but also that of Draghi.\n\nThere is now little doubt that the European economy is losing momentum. The earlier, overly optimistic prognosis of a sustained growth pickup has finally given way to the grim reality that both structural and cyclical headwinds are bearing down on economic activity. The previous consensus growth forecast of around 2% for 2019 is now converging on around 1%; it could well go even lower.\n\nECB has put Europe on a collision course with Donald Trump Read more\n\nStill to come is a broader realisation that Europe is at risk of suffering what economists call \u201cstall-speed growth.\u201d Under such conditions, growth may remain positive, but it will be insufficient to accommodate the demands of other forces: pockets of excessive indebtedness, rising demand for social services, the need for better infrastructure, and deepening popular anger, political polarisation, and alienation.\n\nMoreover, previously unthinkable conditions that could undermine the very integrity of a market system will suddenly become possible \u2013 even likely. Negative interest rates in Europe, for example, do not look likely to be reversed any time soon. Worse, in what is already a structurally impaired economy, Europeans have yet to deal fully with the detrimental impact of global trade tensions, which have hit export-dependent industries in Germany \u2013 the region\u2019s powerhouse \u2013 especially hard.\n\nDespite all of these negative developments, European authorities continue to rely on just one response: unconventional monetary policy involving negative interest rates and large-scale purchases of securities (quantitative easing, or QE). To be sure, this approach was effective in containing a debt crisis that was threatening both the monetary union and the single currency earlier in the decade. But it has proven increasingly ineffective in promoting sustainable economic growth.\n\nConcerns over the ECB\u2019s protracted reliance on the same old medicine have been increasing, even within the ECB, owing to a growing awareness of the detrimental effects of negative interest rates. Negative rates can curtail the provision of long-term financial-protection services (such as life insurance and retirement products) to European households, thereby undermining economic security. They encourage excessive risk-taking, which can lead to financial instability down the road. And they promote an inefficient allocation of resources across the broader economy.\n\nTo the extent that these risks are real and mounting (which I believe they are), the ECB will find it increasingly difficult to continue pursuing the same policy in the face of growing complaints and political pressure. But it cannot simply stand still, given the deterioration in the European economy. And it can scarcely even consider the option of unwinding the unconventional policies of the past decade, as that would raise the risk of immediate economic and financial disruptions.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s lose-lose-lose trilemma can be resolved only through a comprehensive pro-growth approach at both the national and regional levels, involving measures that are not available to central banks. European countries need deeper structural reforms \u2013 including infrastructure modernisation and worker retooling and retraining \u2013 to boost the productivity of both capital and labor. Where possible, they should be pursuing fiscal stimulus, and resolving persistent debt overhangs that are stifling existing growth engines and impeding the emergence of new ones. And at the regional level, Europe needs to expand and improve its policy architecture, not least by completing the banking union and resolving long-standing differences over fiscal integration.\n\nThe hope now is that Lagarde \u2013 with her exceptional mix of interpersonal skills, professional networks, and national and international policy experience \u2013 will jump-start the pivot that Europe needs. The challenge is one of political will, not engineering, and Lagarde\u2019s recent accomplishments at the IMF \u2013 where she put a spotlight on the economic implications of gender bias and climate change \u2013 show that she is capable of ushering in the necessary changes.\n\nThis is not to downplay the scale and complexity of the challenges Draghi has faced. They are real, and they have become deeply embedded in the structure of Europe\u2019s political economy. Still, they are not insurmountable. Lagarde brings a uniquely well-suited skillset to her new position, and she is taking the reins at precisely the right moment for Europe to make the changes needed to avoid a second lost decade. Her legacy will now be bound up with that of Draghi, whose courageous promise in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro has since been overshadowed by the renewed threat of recession and financial instability.\n\n\u2022 Mohamed A El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz.
