They are currently trading at around $4.10.\n\nSpeaking on a panel at fintech conference Intersekt, Prospa chief executive Beau Bertoli said the biggest change for him to overcome since going public was not being able to be as transparent with staff as he'd like.\n\nGoing public has cost Prospa about $1 million a year in public company compliance costs. \u2014 Prospa CEO Beau Bertoli\n\n\"One of the most difficult things has been the information transparency. The ASX disclosure rules, insider trading laws, they\u2019re very strict and clear in this country,\" he said.\n\n\"We had an open book, transparent policy with the team on everything and we\u2019ve had to tighten some of that up and be a little bit less open with the exact details of financial performance.\"\n\nGoing public has cost Prospa about $1 million a year in public company compliance costs, Mr Bertoli estimated, with 5 to 8 per cent of its team in compliance roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Mr Bertoli admitted that he still found himself checking the company's share price more often than he should, but he was careful to tell investors the business was still investing for the long term.\n\n\"The biggest risk of listing a business is the shift from long-term strategic thinking to short term I must hit my numbers ... the market expects over the next 90 days,\" he said.\n\n\"We took the message that ... listing the business was not the end, it was actually the beginning.\n\n\"We also had good advice to not put a screen up in the reception with the ticker and the price that everyone sees each day when they walk into the office. You don't want to create short-termism.\"", "description": "When Prospa returned to the market for a second time and successfully listed on the ASX, the process taught all involved some valuable lessons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_562%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/abb9348634d376a3142449b244c7152df7be4d6f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
