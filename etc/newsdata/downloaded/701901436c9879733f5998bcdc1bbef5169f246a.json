He's just the latest to join the chorus.\n\nDespite that chorus of praise, Hunter says the stocks are inexpensive, as Goldman's basket of dividend growth stocks is trading at a large discount to the rest of the market, and the gap is at one of its highest levels in 13 years.\n\n\"The Dividend Growth basket has lagged S&P 500 by 3 pp YTD (15% vs. 18%) and now trades at nearly the largest discount to the median S&P 500 stock since 2006 (11x vs. 18x),\" he said.\n\nWhile experts say stocks with strong dividend growth are appealing, Goldman Sachs strategist Cole Hunter says those companies are also trading at a big discount.

The stocks on his list are projected to grow their dividends at almost twice the rate of the broader S&P 500 index.\n\nHere are the 13 stocks that Hunter estimates will have the strongest cash return on cash invested based on those criteria.
