The points covered sensitive issues including Medevac laws and the defence of Gladys Liu over her alleged links to the Chinese communist party. Meanwhile, the Coalition has ordered a fresh investigation in to the big four banks for failing to pass on repeated interest rate cuts in full. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the interest rate pricing of residential mortgages.
