Rising home values have been a boon to people who bought homes that year and who have since earned a median $141,000 in equity\u2014quadruple their starting equity of $54,000, according to Redfin\u2019s analysis of about 1.4 million home sales in 2012.\n\n\n\nMore: Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Last Home Goes up For Auction\n\nHomeowners gain equity as the amount they can sell their home for exceeds the amount they still owe on their mortgage.\n\n\n\nHomeowners in major metropolitan areas, where home prices have soared in recent years, have banked the most in equity since 2012. No more so than in San Francisco, where median home equity has increased by a stunning $741,000 as the city\u2019s median home values just about doubled since 2012, according to Redfin\u2019s analysis.\n\n\n\nNine out of the top 10 cities for home equity growth since 2012 are in California, including tech-hub San Jose, where the typical home buyer from that year has seen their home equity increase by $669,000.\n\n\n\nWhile cities have seen the greatest increase in dollar terms, smaller cities near U.S. military bases have seen the greatest percentage growth in home equity. For instance Tacoma, Washington, has seen the median equity of someone who purchased in 2012 skyrocket more than 1,400%.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s largely because these cities have high numbers of military personnel, who would have been able to take out a loan with no or little downpayment through Veteran Affairs or the Federal Housing Administration. In other words, these homebuyers started out with very little home equity.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople in the military are able to obtain VA loans, and military buyers are also often able to obtain low interest rates. That turned out to be hugely beneficial for people in the area who bought homes in the wake of the recession,\" said Redfin agent Jordan Hammond, based in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\n\n\nAfter Tacoma, Virginia Beach saw the second greatest percentage increase in home equity. The median homebuyer from 2012 has gained $80,000, a staggering increase of 1,333%.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Global UHNW Population Flatlines, Combined Wealth Declines for the First Time in Three Years\n\nWhile surging home prices have greatly benefited homeowners, it has kept many would-be buyers out of the housing market.\n\n\"The opportunity to build wealth through home equity when prices hit their low point was available only to a fortunate subset of Americans who had enough cash for a down payment,\" said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather in the report. \u201cAnd now many people who weren't able to buy into homeownership during that window of time find themselves on the other side of the housing market coin: Many areas are just plain unaffordable.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111253?size=1.4988290398126465&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
