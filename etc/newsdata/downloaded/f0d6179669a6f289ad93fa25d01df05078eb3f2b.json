Katie Hill (D-CA) admitted Wednesday to having had an affair with a staffer on her congressional campaign.\n\nHer admission seemed to contradict her denial the day before of an affair with a male member of her congressional staff, though the admission Wednesday may concern a different, female staffer who worked on her campaign but not in her Capitol Hill office.\n\nThe House adopted new ethics rules this year (by voice vote, not roll call vote) banning romantic relationships between members of Congress and their staffers, in response to the #metoo movement.\n\nRep. Hill was elected in 2018 in California\u2019s 25th congressional district as one of seven Democrats who unseated incumbent Republicans in the Golden State. She is vice chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. She also protested vigorously against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last year, calling Kavanaugh a \u201cserial predator\u201d after he faced several sudden uncorroborated accusations from female classmates.\n\nIn fact, Hill repeatedly made the fight against sexual harassment a central theme of her congressional campaign, arguing that electing more female leaders to Congress would be part of the solution to the ongoing problem.\n\nThe only way to honor the bravery of these women is to eradicate sexual harassment from our culture & institutions.https://t.co/1HoIq54mU7 \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) October 11, 2017\n\nThe oppressive systems which produce sexual harassment need to be remade. Only when women have equal access to power can we have lasting social change. Let's work to make that happen.https://t.co/caVoIrcAKB \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2017\n\nStanding up against a culture of sexual harassment is our opportunity & obligation. We need to make stronger policies, elect more women leaders & address the power imbalances which created this problem. Failure to do so will be our great moral shame. https://t.co/kuspCitz7Q \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 1, 2017\n\nWow, Bannon. Spot on. \"It's not Me Too. It's not just sexual harassment. It's an anti-patriarchy movement\u2026 Time's up on 10,000 years of recorded history. This is coming. This is real.\" #metoo #timesup #itsourtime https://t.co/mUUAjx6gRz \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) February 10, 2018\n\nHill also participated in a nationwide \u201cBelieve Survivors\u201d walkout in solidarity with Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with the women who have come forward \u2014 we hear you, believe you, and will fight for you. Across all three valleys of #CA25, we are with @NARAL and #believesurvivors. Today we walked out for #AnitaHill, #ChristineBlaseyFord, and all survivors of assault. pic.twitter.com/TSl4R8NQuL \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) September 24, 2018\n\nLast Friday, the RedState blog published personal and intimate photographs and text messages that suggested \u201cRep. Hill was involved in a long-term sexual relationship with a female campaign staffer.\u201d Rep. Hill and her estranged husband were reportedly involved in a relationship with the female staffer, before Rep. Hill allegedly broke off her relationships with both. According to RedState, she also allegedly became involved with a male Capitol Hill staffer.\n\nHill called the allegations part of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d and her supporters said she was a victim of \u201crevenge porn.\u201d\n\nIn a message to constituents, Hill said she was the victim of a crime and had asked Capitol Police to investigate.\n\nHill also agreed Wednesday to cooperate with an investigation by the House Ethics Committee over the allegations.\n\nJoel B.
