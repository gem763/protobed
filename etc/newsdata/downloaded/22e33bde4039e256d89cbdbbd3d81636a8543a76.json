It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\nShe was supported by Jamie as she returned to London's Heathrow Airport from a family trip to Dubai on Saturday.\n\nIn the emotional pictures, Rebekah is seen struggling to hide her tears as she makes her way through the busy airport hand-in-hand with husband Jamie.\n\nFans have praised Rooney \u2013 calling her \u2018Wagatha Christie\u2019 - for the sensational way in which she revealed Vardy was the alleged culprit by concluding her post with a thriller-worthy 'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nThe saga began when Coleen took to social media to reveal she had suspected someone close to her had been betraying her for years and she had conclusive proof that her friend Rebekah was the guilty party.\n\nVardy is a queen of self-promotion who has risen to the top rank of footballers wives from humble beginnings - the daughter of a BBC local radio DJ and a window cleaner father who has two ex husbands.\n\nBefore meeting current husband Jamie, she was working in a Sheffield nightclub and dating a Vauxhall conference football player who has previously accused her of ditching him to 'trade up' to Premier League star.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\nEarlier this month, The Sun reported that Jamie is so upset with the way things have played out between his wife and Coleen that he has 'unfollowed Wayne on Instagram' - however, Jamie has strenuously denied the claims.\n\nDrama: The break comes as Coleen (pictured left in June 2016) has been embroiled in a so-called WAG war with Rebekah (pictured right in February 2019)\n\nThe statement: Coleen made these claims on Instagram on October 9 after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah's account\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was leaking stories on her life for some time\n\nA source had alleged to the publication: 'Jamie has always got on well with Wayne, but he won\u2019t stand for having his wife hung out to dry in public like this.'\n\nThe source added that Jamie is standing by Rebekah '100 per cent' as she launches a fight to prove her innocence.\n\nSaid a friend: 'He\u2019s totally behind Becky and furious with the Rooneys for the way they have gone about this. He and Wayne always got on well and he likes him. But he has made his feelings clear. Cutting him off on social media is a totally deliberate snub.'\n\nRebekah cut her family holiday to Dubai short after Coleen's dramatic accusation, which has enthralled Britain in the so-called 'war of the WAGs.'\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation\n\nSources close to Becky say leading law firm Kingsley Napley has sent Coleen a letter on her behalf demanding she provides them with the evidence she has against Becky so that she can complete her investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, friends of Coleen say she will not be goaded into coming forward with any further evidence as she is happy with her own investigations.\n\nBecky has called in a forensic team to analyse her Instagram account.\n\nThe aim is to identify the mole who sold fake stories to The Sun from Coleen\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nAs part of that probe, they say, they have asked Wayne\u2019s wife to give them the proof they have that the source must have been Becky\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nIt's been claimed Rebekah has threatened Coleen with legal action over allegations of leaking staged Instagram stories, warning her: 'Believe me or I'll see you in court.'\n\nThe feuding pair are said to be communicating through their lawyers in the wake of the bitter row which has dominated social media and newspapers this week.\n\nA source close to heavily pregnant Vardy now claims she is fully prepared to face her fellow WAG in court if she refuses to believe her innocence.\n\nThe source told The Sun: 'She is prepared to see Coleen in court if necessary.'\n\nColeen wrote on October 9: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nGrandparents: Coleen's parents Colette and Anthony McLoughlin are also on the trip\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\n'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nRebekah hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant.'\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n'I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'", "description": "Coleen Rooney shared a picture of her son Cass on Monday as she revealed she hadn't joined her family on their Barbados holiday as she is unwell.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20027816-0-image-a-58_1571735467103.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
