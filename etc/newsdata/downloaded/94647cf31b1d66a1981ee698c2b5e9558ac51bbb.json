Instead of our regular lineup, we got Alex on the phone with an IPO expert to dig into the year\u2019s IPO cycle both at home and abroad. Helping with the effort was James Clark, the head of Tech and Lifesciences, Primary Markets at the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThat means we had IPO fans from both the U.S. and across the pond to kick into what has happened thus far in 2019, and what\u2019s coming around both in Q4 and in 2020.\n\nWe touched on a few topics, including the declining popularity of startups that don\u2019t make money, the strength of software companies\u2019 debuts (Datadog and CrowdStrike, for example) and a little bit on direct listings (they have a different name in the U.K., it turns out).\n\nWe\u2019re now into the fourth quarter of 2020, and some companies have done better than expected (Beyond Meat), while others have done worse (Uber and Lyft). It\u2019s been fun, and, fingers crossed, we won\u2019t run short of more fodder in the coming months!", "description": "Hello and welcome back to\u00a0Equity, TechCrunch\u2019s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.
