Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Trump has denied the charge, though he has said he\u2019s interested in corruption and has raised questions about the business interests of Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s son, in Ukraine and China.\n\nThe Politico/Morning Consult survey of 1,991 registered voters was taken on Monday and Tuesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
