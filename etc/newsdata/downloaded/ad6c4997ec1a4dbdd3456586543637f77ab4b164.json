Terry Graham went to use the lavatory, as regulations required two people to be in the cockpit at all times. Upon entering, however, Steinaker says she saw an iPad mounted to the windshield showing real-time footage from the plane\u2019s bathroom, per the Arizona Republic.\n\nSteinaker claimed the co-pilot tried to explain it away as a new security feature.\n\nSEE IT: TRAVELER FAKES PREGNANCY TO AVOID BAGGAGE FEES, GETS CAUGHT\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that after Steinaker reported the incident \u2014 as well as her claim that Graham left a loaded gun in the cockpit after disembarking \u2014 she was told not to tell anyone. Steinaker added that she and her husband, also a Southwest flight attendant, have also been subjected to \u201cthreatening\u201d observation by their managers.\n\nBoth pilots involved in the Feb. 27, 2017 flight are still flying with the carrier today, the lawsuit further alleges.\n\n\u201cIt's really hard to imagine a more outrageous kind of conduct,\" said the Steinakers\u2019 attorney, Ronald L.M.
