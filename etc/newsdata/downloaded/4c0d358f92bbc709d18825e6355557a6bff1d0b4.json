My worry was there is no way they're going to go to sleep because they'll be too giddy and I'll be up 'til midnight.\n\nAfter just a short session of sitting on the floor and taking long deep breaths, Luke was visibly more tired and the boys were soon in bed\n\nAfter Anita quizzes the boys on how they found the session, Luke insisted: 'Literally I felt like I was asleep'\n\n'But actually, yeah they've gone to bed.'\n\nThe broadcaster confessed that she employed the method because she had 'no idea' how to put the children to sleep, and insisted that it was after the session she 'fell in love' with the two boys.\n\nShe said: 'I actually got a taste of what that might be when I put them to bed one night.\n\n'I did some meditation with them because I didn\u2019t have a clue about how I was going to get them to go to sleep.\n\nThe broadcaster spent three days looking after the twins, and says that it was after the session she 'fell in love' with the two boys\n\n'So I tried some meditation which worked really well! Afterwards I read them a story and I had one of them on either side of me, just cuddled up to me, I fell in love with these two boys.\n\n'In that moment it was very easy to see how you can become so attached to children. It was in that moment that I realised that you are the adult, you are the protector of their world, they are looking to you for comfort, for structure and safety.\n\n'I very quickly felt those things, so that was a new experience for me.'\n\nShe teased that her method could be expanded into a business, and joked that she already has a name for the company's social media handle.\n\nAnita said: 'Maybe people will take home my idea of meditation for children as a way of getting them to sleep!\n\nAlthough Anita admitted she isn't sold on having a brood of her own, explained that although she still isn't keen on having a child - the show gave her a whole 'new perspective' on kids\n\n'There is a whole new business for me right there! I\u2019ve already come up with an Instagram name!'\n\nThe presenter, who early in the episode admitted she wasn't sold on having a brood of her own, explained that although she still isn't keen on having a child - the show gave her a whole 'new perspective' on kids.\n\nShe said: 'I don\u2019t think a four-day experience with two children is going to make me feel broody.\n\n'I feel the way I feel, but it certainly gave me a new perspective, and I certainly felt something I\u2019ve never felt before.\n\n'That protectiveness. I have a niece who I feel that for, that\u2019s all new and lovely, I can see why people do it.'", "description": "Countryfile host Anita Rani, 42, from Yorkshire got nine-year-old twin brothers\u00a0Luke and Daniel to go to bed in a matter of minutes, on the latest episode of W Channel's 'My Famous Babysitter'.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20286652-0-image-a-70_1572279475699.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
