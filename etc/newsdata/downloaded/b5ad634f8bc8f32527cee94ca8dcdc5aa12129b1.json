Omar during Minn. rally", "language": "en", "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local):\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is attacking Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar in a rally on her home turf.\n\nTrump is calling Omar \u201ca disgrace to our country,\u201d reminding thousands of supporters in a Minneapolis arena of remarks she made on Israel that some people saw as anti-Semitic. Omar denied any anti-Semitic intent but apologized for them.\n\nTrump is also again raising allegations by some conservatives that Omar married her brother to commit immigration fraud \u2014 a claim Omar has called \u201cdisgusting lies.\u201d\n\nTrump has sought to portray the Somali-American lawmaker as a symbol of the liberal shift in her party, and earlier this year tweeted she should \u201cgo back\u201d to her home country rather than criticize the United States. He didn\u2019t repeat that rhetoric Thursday night.\n\n__\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is lashing out at potential Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump says at a rally Thursday in Minneapolis that Biden became Barack Obama\u2019s vice president because he knew how to curry favor with Obama.\n\nThe Republican president is also targeting Hunter Biden, suggesting a T-shirt that says \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nTrump has been spreading groundless claims that the Bidens used their family name to get China and Ukraine to pay them millions of dollars.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House opened an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower complained about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and alleged Trump was abusing his public office for personal political gain. Trump later released a rough transcript of a phone conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president in which he asks for an investigation of Biden.\n\n__\n\n8 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is decrying what he says is a \u201cwretched Washington swamp\u201d that is trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump is telling thousands at a rally Thursday in Minneapolis that the swamp wants to \u201cerase your vote like it never existed.\u201d\n\nBut he says the swamp will fail because \u201cin America, the people rule again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s first campaign rally since the Democratic-controlled House launched an impeachment inquiry over his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nTrump is also predicting that he will win Minnesota in 2020, a state that slipped away from him in the last election.\n\n__\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric is proposing a new chant to be directed at Joe Biden: \u201cLock him up.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has been pushing baseless claims that Biden and his son Hunter traded on the family name to earn millions from governments in Ukraine and China.\n\nEric Trump warmed up a Minneapolis rally crowd for his father Thursday night. He asked the crowd for an assessment of how Hunter Biden is feeling and suggested that the familiar Trump rally chant of \u201cLock her up\u201d \u2014 directed at Hillary Clinton \u2014 become \u201cLock him up.\u201d The crowd then chanted, \u201cLock him up, lock him up.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry over President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and his request to that country\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n__\n\n6 p.m.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are converging on the Minneapolis arena where President Donald Trump is holding his first political rally since the House opened its impeachment inquiry.\n\nProtesters are packing streets surrounding the Target Center hours before the Republican president is due to appear at Thursday\u2019s rally.\n\nMany are clutching helium-filled balloons depicting Trump as a baby. Others are blowing whistles, a nod to the whistleblower whose complaint encouraged Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch the inquiry.\n\nLora Torgerson, who says she is a registered Republican from suburban Inver Grove Heights, is among the anti-Trumpers. She says she has \u201cnever been more ashamed of our party.\u201d Torgerson says she did not vote for Trump.\n\nTrump supporters are turning out in force and are expected to easily fill the roughly 20,000-seat arena. Some had lined up a day earlier to guarantee a seat.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to convert the impeachment investigation in Washington into a political asset \u2014 scheduling three reelection rallies over the next eight days.\n\nThe rally set for Thursday night in Minneapolis is the first since Democrats began proceedings two weeks ago to remove him from office.\n\nIt\u2019ll serve as a proving ground for the president as he tries to use the impeachment inquiry to energize supporters for his 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump has lashed out in tweets and public statements at Democrats, the media and even some Republicans as impeachment has dominated the headlines. He\u2019s claimed that he\u2019s the victim of a \u201ccoup\u201d \u2014 although impeachment is a constitutional process\u2014 and has accused Democrats of trying to undo the 2016 election.", "description": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:45 p.m. President Donald Trump is attacking Minnesota Rep.
