Critics have claimed this reluctance to protect the girls being abused was due to the ethnic and religious backgrounds of the abusers, leading them to fear they would be accused of racism for intervening.\n\nA 2013 study by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection division of the National Crime Agency (NCA) found that 75 per cent of recorded \u201cType 1\u201d group abuse in Britain is carried out by \u201cAsian\u201d men \u2014 which in the British vernacular generally refers to people with roots in South Asia rather than the Far East.\n\nA more recent study by the Quilliam counter-extremism organisation, founded by Islamist revolutionary turned left-liberal commentator Maajid Newaz, was even more upfront about the issue, revealing that some 84 per cent of grooming gang abusers are Muslim men of Pakistani origin.\n\nA report by think tank Quilliam has found that more than eight out of ten men convicted of grooming gang offences have an 'Asian' background, while victims are \"almost exclusively white girls\". https://t.co/WMYGngGPDf \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 10, 2017\n\nWhen the enormous scale of grooming gang abuse in the United Kingdom and the endemic failures of state authorities to act on it first came into the public eye, it began to receive some prominence in the national debate \u2014 with discussion focusing mainly on whether or not it was appropriate to address the racial, religious, and cultural context of the issue.\n\nBut, while politicians and media talking heads generally concluded that yes, people should be able to address uncomfortable elements of the grooming gang problem without being accused of racism, they never seemed to progress from the discussion about whether to have the discussion to the discussion itself.\n\nNow, while police and prosecutors are slowly working through a backlog of cases they had previously turned a blind eye to, some of which date all the way back to the 1980s, the issue of grooming gangs has been returned to the shadows, with media coverage generally relegated to the local press and obscure regional sub-sections of the BBC News website.\n\nThe courts have also resisted treating any of the groomers\u2019 crimes as racially aggravated \u2014 even in the case of a groomer who was on record as having abused a female rail employee by saying \u201cWhite women are good for only one thing \u2013 for people like me to f*** and use as trash.\u201d\n\nControversial letter to Times. Sikh/ Hindu groups claim grooming gangs mainly Muslim, victims mainly white/Sikh/Hindu pic.twitter.com/BEM9MIbKn1 \u2014 Darshna Soni (@darshnasoni) March 5, 2015\n\nSikh and Hindu community leaders have also complained that their communities are targeted by the mostly Muslim groomers \u2014 and have asked the media to stop referring to the gangs as \u201cAsian\u201d \u2014 with police failing to act due to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.\n\nA victim of one of the most infamous grooming networks in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, who was \u201cbeaten, tortured and raped over 100 times\u201d by groomers recalled being \u201ccalled a \u2018white slag\u2019 and \u2018white c***\u2019 as they beat me\u201d in an article for the left-wing Independent, saying they \u201cmade it clear that because I was a non-Muslim, and not a virgin, and because I didn\u2019t dress \u2018modestly\u2019, that they believed I deserved to be \u2018punished\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe further warned that \u201cLike terrorists, they firmly believe that the crimes they carry out are justified by their religious beliefs\u201d and that is \u201csomething that central Government really needs to understand in order to prevent more grooming gang crime in the future.\u201d\n\n'As a Rotherham grooming gang survivor, I want people to know about the religious extremism which motivated my abusers. The men who raped me weren't like paedophiles \u2013 they were like terrorists' https://t.co/d0c3OccLO5 \u2014 The Independent (@Independent) March 18, 2018\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Another tranche of grooming gang rapists operating in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, have been convicted at Leeds Crown Court.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Scales-of-Justice-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
