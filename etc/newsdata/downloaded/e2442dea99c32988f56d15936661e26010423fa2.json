We will preserve Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists. \u2014 Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (@RTErdogan) October 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the face of backlash from both Democrats and Republicans over his handling of the situation, Trump has repeatedly indicated he could sanction Turkey if he feels the operation has gone poorly.\n\n\u201cI think Lindsey [Graham] would like to stay there for the next 200 years and maybe add a couple hundred thousand people every place, but I disagree with Lindsey on that,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. \u201cBut I will tell you that I do agree on sanctions, but I actually think [we\u2019ll need something] much tougher than sanctions if [Erdogan] doesn\u2019t [conduct the operation] in as humane a way as possible.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) announced Wednesday afternoon that he had reached bipartisan agreement with Senator Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) on a package of severe sanctions against Turkey in the wake of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria.\u201cWhile the Administration refuses to act against Turkey", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DuvbjsfpiGq9lHx0Kw.7MA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/32f92a736345c864d78d20b7cf73f207", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
