(Ukraine Presidential Press Service/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nWe now have a rough transcript of President Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, along with the whistleblower complaint. And despite plenty of very passionate arguments, neither contains an explicit quid pro quo. In fact, while we knew there was a \u201cpromise\u201d involved, the only reference to a \u201cpromise\u201d comes from the inspector general, who suggests the promise might have come from Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 not Trump.\n\nBut the operative word there is \u201cexplicit.\u201d And a look at Trump\u2019s history strongly suggests that he knew exactly what he was doing here. Indeed, that history makes it very difficult not to see this as at least an implicit quid pro quo.\n\nIn the phone call, Trump makes multiple references to how good the United States is to Ukraine, and Zelensky then refers to buying U.S. military weaponry \u2014 \u201cJavelins.\u201d Trump then quickly launches into a \u201cfavor\u201d he wants, an investigation related to the 2016 election, and then mentions another investigation, related to Joe and Hunter Biden. Judging by the rough transcript, what Trump hoped to get from the call was obvious.\n\nBut let\u2019s try to suspend our disbelief for a minute. Let\u2019s pretend it could just be some kind of amazing coincidence that Trump was talking about all the nice things he did for Ukraine just before asking a \u201cfavor.\u201d Let\u2019s ignore the power imbalance in their relationship and the fact that Trump had reportedly been withholding a meeting from Ukraine, and then appeared to grant it the moment Zelensky said he would pursue the investigations.\n\nEven setting aside all that, Trump\u2019s history speaks volumes.\n\nHis former personal attorney Michael Cohen explained in his testimony how Trump tells you to do problematic things.\n\n\u201cIt would be no different than if I said: \u2018That\u2019s the nicest-looking tie I\u2019ve ever seen. Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 What are you going to do? Are you going to fight with him? The answer is no,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSo you say, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s the nicest-looking tie I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 That\u2019s how he speaks.\u201d\n\nCohen added: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give you orders. He speaks in code. And I understand the code because I\u2019ve been around him for decades.\u201d\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report includes other examples of Trump using just such a code. When he wants FBI Director James B. Comey to back off Michael Flynn, he doesn\u2019t say it in so many words. He says, \u201cI hope you can let this go,\u201d according to Comey.\n\nMueller reasoned that Trump\u2019s meaning was pretty clear:\n\nA second question is whether the President\u2019s statements, which were not phrased as a direct order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI\u2019s investigation of Flynn. While the President said he \u201chope[d]\u201d Comey could \u201clet[] Flynn go,\u201d rather than affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Comey to close the FBI\u2019s investigation into Flynn.\n\nMueller adds that, \u201cbecause the President is the head of the executive branch, when he says that he \u2018hopes\u2019 a subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the President wants.\u201d\n\nZelensky doesn\u2019t report to Trump, but there is a similar power imbalance.\n\nTrump\u2019s alleged request for \u201cloyalty\u201d from Comey is also in this vein. Again, from the Mueller report:\n\nAccording to Comey\u2019s account, at one point during the dinner the President stated, \u201cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty.\u201d Comey did not respond and the conversation moved on to other topics, but the President returned to the subject of Comey\u2019s job at the end of the dinner and repeated, \u201cI need loyalty.\u201d: Comey responded, \u201cYou will always get honesty from me.\u201d The President said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, honest loyalty.\u201d Comey said, \u201cYou will get that from me.\u201d\n\nThe White House disputed this account, but Mueller found it to be credible and consistent. And it tracks with the idea that Trump knew that asking for \u201cloyalty\u201d was code for something else.\n\nAnother example involves Trump\u2019s apparent repeated efforts to shutter the Mueller probe. At one point in August 2018, he tweeted, \u201cThis is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.\u201d\n\n..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018\n\nThen-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders would soon clarify that \u201cthe president is stating his opinion; it\u2019s not an order.\u201d Except then we found out that Trump did try to shut down the investigation \u2014 including by trying to get others to apply pressure on Sessions. Then-White House counsel Donald McGahn interpreted Trump\u2019s entreaties as orders, and Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn both declined to deliver messages to Sessions because they viewed them as problematic.\n\n(Lewandowski, implausibly, explained in testimony this month that he had merely gone \u201con vacation\u201d and never had the right forum to deliver the message. Mueller\u2019s report says plainly that Lewandowski \u201cdid not want to deliver the President\u2019s message personally\u201d and that \u201cDearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.\u201d)\n\nThere are, of course, times when officials have interpreted Trump in a more friendly light. One of them is former National Security Agency director Michael Rogers. Again, from the Mueller report:\n\nOn March 26, 2017, the day after the President called [then-Director of National Intelligence Daniel] Coats, the President called NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers. The President expressed frustration with the Russia investigation, saying that it made relations with the Russians difficult. The President told Rogers \u201cthe thing with the Russians [wa]s messing up\u201d his ability to get things done with Russia. The President also said that the news stories linking him with Russia were not true and asked Rogers if he could do anything to refute the stories. Deputy Director of the NSA Richard Ledgett, who was present for the call, said it was the most unusual thing he had experienced in 40 years of government service. After the call concluded, Ledgett prepared a memorandum that he and Rogers both signed documenting the content of the conversation and the President\u2019s request, and they placed the memorandum in a safe. But Rogers did not perceive the President\u2019s request to be an order, and the President did not ask Rogers to push back on the Russia investigation itself. Rogers later testified in a congressional hearing that as NSA Director he had \u201cnever been directed to do anything [he] believe[d] to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate\u201d and did not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.\u201d\n\nZelensky seems to be taking the Rogers approach, insisting this week that he didn\u2019t feel pressured by Trump \u2014 and also adding that he never actually \u201cpush[ed]\u201d his \u201cindependent\u201d prosecutor general. He has every reason to leave that impression, of course, if for no other reason than to avoid alienating the very powerful U.S. president who has apparently been leaning on him pretty hard, and to make it look as if he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s stooge.\n\nBut if you look at the examples above, is it really at all ambiguous that Trump dances around problematic requests like this and clearly wanted to leave the impression that bad things could happen if Zelensky didn\u2019t play ball?\n\nTrump has exploited plausible deniability throughout his presidency; at some point, people who suspend their disbelief are truly doing so willfully.", "description": "From the Mueller report to today, a clear pattern emerges.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wQGmsbMeWPWvx4hH5Y9PqNOR4o4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C6TWUEG72MI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
