It was still the fifth-biggest hotspot for shoplifting in the country, however.\n\nWhile shoplifting may be on the decline, in contrast, commercial crime increased to its highest level in six years, jumping 14% in a single year, with 83 823 cases reported by the South African Police. These crimes included fraud, embezzlement, corruption, forgery, money laundering and certain cybercrimes.\n\nBut many business-related crimes involving physical force declined: robberies of cash in transit fell by 23% to 183, bank robberies fell by 70% to only four in the entire country, and truck hijackings fell 2% to 1 182.", "description": "The Durban Central police station reported the most shoplifting cases in South Africa.", "authors": ["Helena Wasserman"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7213/09806be18efb428b8fa5cd51fbf8e6dc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
