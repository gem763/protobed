The plan is to go to a gravitational \"sweetspot\" just behind the Earth in its orbit around the Sun known as \"Lagrangian Point 5\".\n\nSpacecraft that are sited there do not have to use so much fuel to maintain station - but there is an even bigger operational rationale to use this location: it is the perfect spot to see that part of the Sun which is about to rotate into view of the Earth.\n\nIn other words, the Lagrange satellite would get a preview of emerging storm systems. And being off to one side would also allow it to estimate how quickly any big outburst might arrive at Earth.\n\nSpace weather is an issue of growing concern. There's a recognition that society's heavy reliance on technology has probably made it more vulnerable to the type of interference solar storms can initiate.\n\nIf a major outburst knocked satellite navigation systems offline, for example - a not-inconceivable scenario - the economic losses would run in to the billions.\n\nImage copyright NAS/SDO Image caption Activity at the Sun can disrupt modern infrastructure\n\nOn Thursday, the European Science Foundation\u2019s European Space Science Committee issued a series of recommendations intended to lead to greater resilience.\n\nThe panel wants to see: more research on the topic; improvements in the models used for forecasting; a greater awareness of the risks; better coordination among everyone's efforts across Europe; and, obviously, a much enhanced system of observations.\n\nThis is where missions like Lagrange come in. And it's hoped the European satellite would have an American partner in space. This would take up a position directly between the Earth and the Sun, at Lagrangian Point 1.\n\nLast month, the UK government, which has supported the Lagrange feasibility studies through its Esa membership, put a further \u00a320m towards space weather research.\n\nThis money is going principally to the Met Office, which is Britain's centre of excellence on the subject.\n\nThe Exeter-based agency works closely with US colleagues in issuing forecasts and warnings to users. These users include satellite operators. The alerts will tell them if they need to turn their spacecraft to shield sensitive electronics from the full force of a storm.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter.", "description": "The Sun's outbursts can disrupt technology on Earth, and Europe needs better protection.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B74/production/_109186486_whatsubject.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
