I definitely played well out there. It was really tough because you\u2019re definitely watching what Jessica is shooting and scoring, and always just try to keep in my own game,\u201d said Kang.\n\nKang birdied the 15th to pull two strokes ahead, but Korda responded with a birdie of her own on 17. Kang then holed a 3-foot par putt on the 18th to win her third career title.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of birdie opportunities. I made some really great up and downs. I\u2019ve never been more nervous than the last putt for some reason, but I made it,\u201d Kang said.\n\nKorda had three birdies and three bogeys for even par on the day.\n\n\u201cYou know, just couldn\u2019t get anything going today. It was just one of those days where it just wasn\u2019t meant to be, I guess,\u201d said Korda.\n\nLiu Yu of China shot a 7-under 65 to surge into a three-way tie for third with Japan\u2019s Nasa Hataoka and LPGA rookie Kristen Gillman at 13 under and the best finish of Gillman\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cI definitely knew I would be able to do it, but also being a rookie and being in Asia - or at least in China for my first time - you don\u2019t really expect to have this good of a finish and your best finish so far this year out of the country,\u201d said Gillman.\n\nAmerican Megan Khang tied the 18-hole scoring record with an 8-under 64, including a hole-in-one on the par-3 11th to finish tied for seventh.\n\nBrooke Henderson of Canada shot a 1-over 73 to drop from third place into a tie for ninth with top-ranked Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda at 9 under.\n\nThe Buick LPGA Shanghai was the first of four straight events in Asia. The tour moves to Busan, South Korea next week for the BMW Ladies Championship.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Danielle Kang shot a bogey-free 2 under 70 to win the Buick LPGA Shanghai for the second consecutive year on Sunday with a tournament record 16-under par 272.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
