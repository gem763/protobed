The poems are plain-spoken and restrained: they resist easy consolation. Their austerity serves to intensify the unmediated emotion they almost don\u2019t want to capture. The spare, scissor-sharp couplets of a small poem simply called Gone, for example, confront the reader with the intractable: \u201cno dawn / in the day of gone // no spring/ in the year of gone // no gate / in the wall of gone\u2026\u201d\n\nMany of Clarke\u2019s poems are rooted in the landscape of the west of Ireland (she grew up in Roscommon), and the farming context in which the lives of individual humans are played out asserts its own rhythm and narrative. In honouring this larger context Clarke enlarges her poetic field with an unobtrusive but important ecopoetic dimension.\n\nWhen winter comes is placed quite early in the collection, and, while not disconnected from the main events, its focus is very much on the particular. This focus \u2013 on the craft and art of the metal-worker \u2013 has implicit breadth, uniting alchemy with modern physics, rural tradition with industrial processes. The imperative voice gives the poem a gently didactic tone, reminding us that it has more general implications. Cast as advice to the reader, and perhaps the self-as-reader, it says there is more than one kind of winter to be survived, more than one kind of steel to be forged.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch Jane Clarke read at the Ledbury festival\n\nWikipedia is helpfully explicit: \u201cBecause they must be able to see the glowing colour of the metal, some blacksmiths work in dim, low-light conditions ... The key is to have consistent lighting, but not too bright. Direct sunlight obscures the colours.\u201d\n\nSo the blacksmith may be kin to the Celtic bard, traditionally composing his verse at night, able to access his vision more clearly in the dark. This figure can also represent visually impaired people in their unchosen lack of light, their other senses sharply honed, their minds acquiring an insight that sees furthern than eyesight. Incidentally, like all artists, and others who must \u201cmake it new\u201d for whatever reason, the blacksmith is responsible for enabling his gift: he usually makes his own tools.\n\nSymbolism gets a painfully sharp nudge between stanzas three and four. This is the point when the colour cycle reaches the yellow stage \u201cthat tells the steel is ready // to be held in the mouth / of the tongs \u2026\u201d Every time I read those lines, the break after \u201cmouth\u201d makes me, for an instant, imagine the searing metal on my tongue. The mouth of the tongs (a tongue-like word) is briefly a human mouth \u2013 one that speaks difficult words, utters cries of pain, but survives the searing material it has to swallow.\n\nIt\u2019s the metal itself, of course, not the furnace, that changes colour. Wiki helps again: \u201cColour is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal. As iron heats to higher temperatures, it first glows red, then orange, yellow, and finally white. The ideal heat for most forging is the bright yellow-orange colour that indicates forging heat.\u201d The \u201cforgiving\u201d metal in the poem is subjected to a fierce alchemical process, a series of shape-changing ordeals that result in its final transmutation \u2013 not quite to gold, but to the shine of gold.\n\nThe paradox of the elegy is that the poem is finite: grief, in that circumscribed world, comes to an end\n\nThe colours in When winter comes are reminders of autumn. I used to think I knew \u2013 at least vaguely \u2013 why leaves changed colour, and that it was primarily a matter of decay. But it\u2019s more complicated than that. When there\u2019s less daylight and the temperature cools, leaves stop producing chlorophyll, the green pigment involved in photoshythesis. As the green colouration lessens, other colours emerge \u2013 the previously hidden yellow and orange pigments (xanthophyll and carotene). The metal\u2019s colour is changed through heating, and its brightness through polishing; the autumn colour of the leaves is innate and was present, though invisible, all along. But the similarity of the colours, for this reader at least, connects the processes, and adds to the richness of the lessons the poem teaches.\n\nThe paradox of the elegy is that the poem is finite: grief, in that circumscribed world, comes to an end. Gone, the poem quoted earlier, illustrates continuity beyond absence with a final view of \u201cthe cattle / content in long grass\u201d \u2013 entering a new present, though the man who watched the cattle is no longer there. Similarly, a poem might be born of personal loss, but, once completed and published, it has entered a different timespan, and becomes the forge where other minds are shaped and brightened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The rich colours of a forge, and the controlled violence of the blacksmith\u2019s tools offer vivid imagery for an elegy about grief", "authors": ["Carol Rumens"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a11064fa1139e3e73f05fbd2a0e090708cc415/0_185_5550_3329/master/5550.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=feec812d7578e2e6cd18c38738d33a68", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
