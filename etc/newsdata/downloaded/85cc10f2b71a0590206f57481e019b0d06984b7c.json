In just five years, 95,943 people seeking refugee status arrived lawfully by air, the government has revealed (pictured are asylum seekers boarding a plane at Cocos Islands in July 2014)\n\nThe number of asylum seekers arriving by air more than tripled from 8,652 in the 2014-15 financial year to 27,884 in 2017-18.\n\nLabor's immigration spokeswoman Kristina Keneally, who asked a parliamentary question on notice on August 20, said a 'staggering' 80 asylum seekers a day were arriving by plane.\n\nAt the present rate, she predicted a 'record-breaking' 29,470 were likely to arrive by air 'which would be the highest number of asylum claims in any year ever'.\n\nBetween July 1 and August 19 this year, 4,037 asylum seekers arrived by plane.\n\nSenator Keneally, Labor's American-born deputy leader in the Senate, suggested asylum seekers arriving by plane had been exploited by unscrupulous employers.\n\n'There's nothing wrong with claiming asylum \u2013 it's an important right,' she said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe number of asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by plane between July 2014 and August 2019 was double the number who came by boat when Labor was in power between 2007 and 2013 (illegal vessel west of Christmas Island pictured)\n\n'However, in 90 per cent of these particular cases, the individuals are not legitimate refugees and are often being trafficked to Australia for the explicit purpose of being exploited.'\n\nHow many asylum seekers came by plane? Between July 1, 2014 and August 19, 2019, 95,943 asylum seekers arrived by plane. \u2022 2014-15 \u2013 8,562 persons \u2022 2015-16 \u2013 12,673 persons \u2022 2016-17 \u2013 18,267 persons \u2022 2017-18 \u2013 27,884 persons \u2022 2018-19 \u2013 24,520 persons \u2022 2019 to date \u2013 4,037 persons Immigration Minister David Coleman confirmed 84.2 per cent of those who applied for a protection visa were refused, which added up to 62,732 people.\n\nWhen Labor was last in power, 50,000 asylum seekers arrived on 800 boats between 2007 and 2013.\n\nThis slowed to a trickle when the Coalition came to power, and stopped the former department of immigration and border protection from publishing media alerts every time an illegal boat arrived in Australian waters.\n\nSenator Keneally pointed out the number of asylum seekers that had arrived by plane in five years was double the number that came by boat during Labor's six years in power.\n\nThe Coalition has argued that under Labor, 1,200 people died at sea, including 48 asylum seekers from Iran and Iraq who died in 2010 when their boat washed on to cliffs at Christmas Island.\n\nSenator Keneally said Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton had overlooked the number of asylum seekers who arrived by plane only to be exploited.\n\n'Peter Dutton boasts \"no one dies on a plane\" but the truth is we have no idea how many airplane people may have been critically injured or even died on his watch because of exploitation and slavery that is taking place under his nose,' she said.\n\nMr Coleman said asylum seeker numbers were 'trending down' but declined to provide exact figures on boat arrivals.\n\n'Despite having brought havoc to our refugee system, Labor continues to stand by policies that weaken our border protection,' he said.\n\n'Labor's track record on border security is clear. They cannot be trusted.'", "description": "In just five years, 95,943 people seeking refugee status arrived lawfully by air, the government has revealed.
