Tulsi Gabbard to win the White House, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan reasoned Friday.\n\nMr. Amash, an independent who left the Republican Party in July, stated the assumption on Twitter after Mrs. Clinton referred to Ms. Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat seeking her party\u2019s presidential nomination, as a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset,\u201d Mr. Amash wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHillary does\u2014and did\u2014drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Amash tweeted. \u201cHer attack on Tulsi does likewise.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee who lost to Mr. Trump in 2016, caused an uproar after suggesting in an interview released earlier Friday that Russia is \u201cgrooming\u201d the Hawaii congresswoman and current White House hopeful to drop her bid for the party\u2019s nomination and instead run in 2020 as a third-party candidate.\n\n\u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said without mentioning Ms. Gabbard by name.\n\nMs. Gabbard fired back Friday, saying she would not run as a third-party candidate and blasting Mrs. Clinton as \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nHer campaign has since challenged Mrs. Clinton to enter the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton accused Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 a combat veteran, soldier and Major in the Army National Guard \u2014 of being \u2018groomed\u2019 to be a \u2018Russian asset,\u2019\u201d Ms. Gabbard\u2019s campaign said in a fundraising email Saturday, The Hill reported. \u201cTulsi fights back and demands Hillary join the race and face her directly.\u201d\n\nMr. Amash was first elected to Congress in 2010 and is currently serving his fifth term representing Michigan\u2019s Third Congressional District, which includes Grand Rapids, the state\u2019s second-largest city. He left the GOP in July, weeks after becoming the first Republican member of Congress to publicly accuse Mr. Trump of committing \u201cimpeachable conduct.\u201d Democrats have since initiated impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has assessed that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 race using a range of tactics meant to undermine public faith in the democratic process, denigrate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and harm her electability. The Department of Justice has since filed criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals implicated in the effort, several accused of meddling in the race on social media in part by posting content encouraging American users to vote for a third-party presidential candidate.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
