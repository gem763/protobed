A shore call brings the opportunity to head to the ancient village of Viet Hai aboard one of the ship\u2019s bicycles or by motorised buggy. This jungle oasis draws visitors from across the globe to its pristine, verdant setting. Wander the village vegetable garden, and perhaps taste local produce, before returning to the ship to cruise further into beautiful Lan Ha Bay. Weather permitting, cocktails will be served on the beach (bring your swimwear) before dinner is served on board once again.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://holidays.theguardian.com/tourimg.php?a=img&img=aabcf45904a3ffba063ca96a1930d9c3", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
