Trump, who had said previously he was concerned about sending aid to Ukraine because of corruption he alleged there, gave a new explanation Tuesday saying he ordered the aid frozen \u2013 before the call \u2013 because he was unhappy with how much European countries were contributing to Ukraine.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, a rapid succession of Democrats have embraced impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her caucus were on the brink of going forward Tuesday, with at least 160 Democrats \u2013 more than two-thirds of the caucus - now publicly supporting impeaching President Trump. The full Senate \u2013 both Republicans and Democrats \u2013 passed a non-binding resolution calling on the Trump administration to release the secret whistleblower complaint to Congressional Intelligence Committees.\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Newscom\n\nSupporters are seeking an impeachment inquiry since the recent whistleblower complaint about President Trump's phone call with the Ukranian president and reports he pressured the foreign leader to investigate the Democratic rival, something Trump denies although he's said they discussed it. Those supporting impeachment include several prominent committee chairs and freshman Democrats from formerly GOP-held congressional districts that Pelosi was trying to shield from impeachment pressure if it would make them vulnerable when facing reelection.\n\nSo far, 11 Democrats presidential candidates have explicitly called for impeachment, a list which includes: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Miramar, Florida Mayor Wayne Messam, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Marianne Williamson, a motivational speaker and billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nWarren was one of the first to call for impeachment.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg shifted his position Monday, going further by saying he supports \"the House on taking on impeachment proceedings.\n\nHowever, one of the two candidates who, as a House member, would actually get a vote on impeachment \u2013 Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, is not on board, and thinks it would be \u201cterribly divisive.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on impeachment over President Trump's phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/joe-biden-rt-jef-190910_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
