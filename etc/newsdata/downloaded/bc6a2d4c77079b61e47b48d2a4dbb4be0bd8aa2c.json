That led to some back and forth between people who adore Greta and those who find her a bit overwrought. There was even a hashtag trending among the Greta defenders: #HowDareYou. What\u2019s interesting is that most of the people using the hashtag weren\u2019t talking about climate change, they were talking about Greta. She really has become a kind of cult figure for some.\n\nBecause I know how this game works, I should say up front that I don\u2019t free threatened by Greta Thunberg and I\u2019m not looking to attack her, nor am I terrified of her power. Greta is an idealized version of left-wing politics: innocent, passionate, determined to change the world. Greta is what a lot of adults who aren\u2019t changing the world would like to imagine themselves being (or having been in the past). I think that\u2019s why people get so worked up defending her. She\u2019s not just a teen, she\u2019s their own inner political child. How dare you criticize her!\n\nIndeed the whole point of making Greta the focus is that you can\u2019t criticize her without being a mean adult. This makes her perfect for the left\u2019s purposes. But while that may be strategic on the part of her parents or whoever is funding her world tour, the cult of Greta is completely sincere in its adoration. For a certain type of progressive, she is the platonic ideal of the concerned global citizen. To criticize her is to criticize all that is good and right in the world.\n\nEnter Trump. The elephant stampeding through the midst of all that gauzy reverence.\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nNot surprisingly, the Greta fanbase is furious at this lack of respect for their teen heroine. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza turning #HowDareYou into a column:\n\nWas she passionate? Yes. Was she upset? Yes. Does she have every right to those feelings \u2014 particularly given the dire predictions about the warming climate and what it could mean for our planet? Absolutely yes. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not at all surprising that Trump saw fit to make fun of Thunberg\u2019s passion and emotion. This is who he is \u2014 a schoolyard bully who doesn\u2019t differentiate between a 16-year-old girl and Joe Biden\u2026 Here\u2019s the thing: Even pieces like this one condemning Trump for his comments on a 16-year-old girl \u2014 and I can\u2019t emphasize that fact strongly enough \u2014 will be lumped into the broad category of \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d by the President\u2019s supporters. Trump is messing with the media so bad! They don\u2019t know what to do! He must be doing something right! He\u2019s not. Take the politics out of it. Think of your own teenager or a friend who has a teenager. Would you want the President of the United States mocking him or her solely because what they believe is different than what he believes, and they have the audacity to speak out about it?\n\nAgain, \u201ctake the politics out of it\u201d is utter nonsense. First of all, Greta isn\u2019t some random teen from down the block. She has 2 million followers on Twitter. She\u2019s speaking to the UN. Her every statement appears in hundreds of news stories around the world. She\u2019s a mega-celebrity with a massive international following. Second, if you take the politics out of it then Trump shouldn\u2019t be the president in this scenario, just an old guy who lives around the corner.\n\nThird, this battle isn\u2019t nearly so one-sided as Greta\u2019s fans would like to portray it. If you want to see a one-sided attack on random teens, look back at the left\u2019s attack on the Covington kids and Nick Sandmann in particular. Whatever this is, it\u2019s not that. In fact, Greta is being celebrated right now for her clever \u201cclap back\u201d at President Trump:\n\nIn general, people seem eager to present Greta and Trump as the opposite ends of a spectrum. One old, one young. One cavalier, one concerned. One who benefits from the system and one who wants to upend it. But I think the Greta phenomenon and the Trump phenomenon actually have a lot in common. They both seem to be carefully cast TV show characters. Trump comes from the show about the brash guy who fires people who displease him and Greta comes from the show about an emotional teen overwhelmed by the world and disappointed in her parents\u2019 generation.\n\nGranted, these are different shows for very different audiences, but they\u2019re ultimately both shows being stage-managed by a lot of people who don\u2019t appear on camera. Trump vs. Thunberg on Twitter isn\u2019t an outrageous outrage. It\u2019s a marketing war from rival networks and probably the closest to the truth of the modern world as we\u2019ll get today.", "description": "#HowDareYou", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Thunberg-media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
