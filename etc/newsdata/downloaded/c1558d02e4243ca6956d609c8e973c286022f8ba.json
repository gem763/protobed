So this is a unique opportunity to see it with personal, small telescopes.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Aste-RISK! NASA warns space rock twice the size of Eiffel Tower is bearing down on Earth\n\nMasi also produced a handy star map (no, not the kind that shows where Hollywood celebrities live) for those who want to dust off their home telescopes and see for themselves.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make it out over the next few nights to catch a glimpse, the asteroid will be back again\u2026 in October 2140.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
