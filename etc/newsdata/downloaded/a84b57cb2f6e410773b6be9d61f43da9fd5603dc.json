In the past, we\u2019ve used them to save gorillas (RIP Harambe), protest against shitty presidents and generally shift people\u2019s perceptions on issues by spreading positive and/or vital messages throughout the internet. So who\u2019s the next person to benefit from the world wide web\u2019s warm embrace? Could it be prodigal Kiwi pop star Lorde, by any chance?\n\nYup, that\u2019s right. In the most internet thing to happen since yesterday\u2019s Coleen Rooney notes app takedown of Rebekah Vardy, social media has banded together to #FreeLorde. But why?\n\nWell, the roots of this story lie in very specific Kiwi political discourse. Right now, the opposition party in New Zealand\u2019s Parliament is arguing that any parents who take their child out of education before the age of 16 will be liable to a fine in excess of $3000. If they don\u2019t pay it, they risk jail time.\n\nWe all know by now that Lorde, Generation Z\u2019s most prominent musical voice, was itching to get out there and do her thing from the age of 12, when she was scouted by Universal, so she\u2019s spent much of her childhood balancing school life with recording. In fact, she left Auckland\u2019s Takapuna Grammar School in 2013.\n\nAlthough she was of legal age to leave by the time she finally flew the nest and became the star we knew now, the internet has run with the idea of Lorde being imprisoned because she is both young and from New Zealand. Make sense? No? Well, just accept it.\n\nEven though the hashtag is inspired by a factual error (turns out Twitter can't do maths), it\u2019s nonetheless a movement that\u2019s spawned plenty of memes and viral tweets already. Here are some of our favourites.\n\nSo there you have it! While we have some very solid intel that Lorde is, in fact, not in jail nor at risk of being incarcerated, we recommend you join the movement. We support you Lorde.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Plz don't send Lorde to jail. :(", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f5685de8f530009b20751/lede/1570723624349-in-conversation-with-lorde-what-ella-did-next-body-image-1496644165jpg_crop1xw3A0.jpeg?crop=0.9991111111111111xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
