Castro last visited in 2015 to address the United Nations General Assembly. His children are also believed to have rarely travelled to the United States. Mariela Castro Espin, a gay rights activist, made stops in New York and San Francisco in 2012.\n\nPompeo also accused Castro, Cuba\u2019s most powerful figure, of overseeing \u201ca system that arbitrarily detains thousands of Cubans and currently holds more than 100 political prisoners.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban government, which strongly rejects such accusations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of punitive measures that Trump has taken against Washington\u2019s old Cold War foe since taking office in 2017, steadily rolling back the historic opening to Havana under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nTrump has focussed especially on Cuba\u2019s support for Maduro, a longtime ally of Havana. Earlier this year, the United States and dozens of other countries recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful president, though Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China as well as the OPEC nation\u2019s military.\n\n\u201cIn concert with Maduro\u2019s military and intelligence officers, members of the Cuban security forces have been involved in gross human rights violations and abuses in Venezuela, including torture,\u201d Pompeo said. Cuba has strongly denied the U.S. accusations.\n\nSpeaking in New York while attending the U.N. General Assembly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza scoffed at the U.S. measure against Castro, saying it was an attempt to humiliate him.\n\n\u201cAnd neither Raul Castro nor his family even want to come to this country! We are forced to come here because the U.N. headquarters is in New York, for now,\u201d said Arreaza, referring to a similar U.S. travel bar on Venezuelan officials and citing a Russian offer to host the United Nations in Sochi.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration ordered the expulsion of two members of Cuba\u2019s delegation to the United Nations.\n\nWashington has made clear that a key objective of its tough approach to Cuba is to force it to abandon Maduro, something Havana has said it will never do. However, Trump has stopped short of breaking off diplomatic relations with Cuba restored by Obama in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility.\n\nMaduro has accused Guaido - who earlier this year assumed an interim presidency after alleging that Maduro had rigged the last election - of trying to mount a U.S.-directed coup.\n\n\u201cCastro is complicit in undermining Venezuela\u2019s democracy and triggering the hemisphere\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis,\u201d Pompeo said.", "description": "The Trump administration on Thursday imposed U.S. travel sanctions on Cuban Communist Party chief Raul Castro over his support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro, and involvement in what it called \"gross violations of human rights.\"", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434216106&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1FL", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
