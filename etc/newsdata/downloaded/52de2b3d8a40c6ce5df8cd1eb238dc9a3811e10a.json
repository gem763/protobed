The site\u2019s four Facebook page administrators are said to be situated in India.\n\n\u201cSince 24 October 2018, 47% of the articles are word-for-word copies of articles from RT.com,\u201d reported the EU\u2019s East StratCom taskforce.\n\n\u201cOf the 17,697 articles published under the news section between 6 April 2017 and 23 August 2019, there were only 25 contributions from \u201cMEPs or other decision-makers \u2026 a mere 0.14%\u201d.\n\nBefore 24 October, EP Today only republished articles from Voice of America, the US government\u2019s international radio and television service.
