The matches go down as scoreless draws, eliminating the Italians and leaving them furious.\n\nItaly needed to beat New Zealand for the first time, and with a bonus point, to qualify from Pool B and while that was highly unlikely, Parisse argued they at least deserved a shot.\n\n\"If New Zealand needed four or five points against us, it would not have been cancelled,\" he fumed.\n\nWhitelock claimed the All Blacks wanted to play but \"we don't make those decisions - it's come from higher up. Maybe ask those guys\".\n\nThe long-serving Crusaders lock has experienced the cancellation of Super Rugby matches because of tragic events - the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, in which 185 people died and the mosque shootings early this year which claimed 51 lives.\n\n\"I've had a couple of Super Rugby games cancelled, with the earthquake and the shooting, and both those games you understand why. Rugby is just a small thing,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes the right thing is not playing. There would be nothing worse than if we did play and people were getting hurt. That's the right thing.\n\n\"We've listened to advice from above and we can't change it, so we just have to play the cards that have been dealt to us.\"", "description": "New Zealand have rejected accusations of preferential treatment over their cancelled final Rugby World Cup pool match as Typhoon Hagidis steams towards Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7802/f3f62ea148794c23ac35445c07700749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
