We have no one to call to speak for us, yet we pay more in taxes per capita than any state, yet we pay more taxes than 22 states. This Congress has the constitutional authority, the full conditional power to correct this problem of our democracy,\u201d D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, told the lawmakers.\n\nRepublicans argued that the Founding Fathers intended the federal government to belong to the entire nation and not fall within the territory of a single state. The concern at that time was that the state surrounding the seat of the federal government would exercise undue influence over the nation\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cThis new state would have incredible power over the other states,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the committee\u2019s top Republican.\n\nHe made the point that the proposed lines separating the new state from a smaller federal enclave would place the federally owned being leased to the Trump Organization and operating as the Trump International Hotel under the state\u2019s authority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally because you wanted the money. You wanted the revenue,\u201d Mr. Jordan said to the D.C. officials testifying before the panel.\n\nDemocrats argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel should not get special treatment, noting that the Hotel Monaco also is on federal land and would be within the proposed state\u2019s lines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that the political rights of 700,000 people might be conditioned on the business rights of one man,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, Maryland Democrat.\n\nThe two sides battled over whether the proposed State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, could be added to the union via legislation or by a constitutional amendment.\n\nBut most on both sides of the aisle acknowledged it\u2019s unlikely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, would take up the bill after it clears the House.\n\nThere\u2019s some confusion over whether President Trump would get on board. In 2015, then-candidate Trump backed statehood for the District. But in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post editorial board, the president walked that back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see statehood for D.C.,\u201d Mr. Trump reportedly said.\n\nThe city does have a delegate in the House \u2014 Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat \u2014 who can participate in committee business but cannot vote on bills and resolutions.\n\nShe introduced the bill being debated Thursday in the first congressional hearing on D.C. statehood since 1993.\n\nThe District was created by Congress in 1791, when Maryland and Virginia donated land picked by George Washington. Yet until the seat of government moved from Philadelphia to the District in 1801, residents continued to vote in elections in those states.\n\nOnce Congress claimed jurisdiction in 1801, those rights ceased.\n\nIt was thought that if residents needed to raise issues with Congress, they could walk to the Capitol to do so, said Jane Levey, chief historian at the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.\n\nBut Ms. Levy said that arguments a new state would have undue influence compared to others runs afoul of modern-day communication.\n\n\u201cBeing closer to Congress physically has no meaning whatsoever,\u201d she told The Washington Times.\n\nCongress has relinquished some of its control in recent decades.\n\nThe District gained three votes in the Electoral College in 1964 and held its first modern elections for city council and mayor in 1974.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
