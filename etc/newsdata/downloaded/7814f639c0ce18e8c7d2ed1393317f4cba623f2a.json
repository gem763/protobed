Her family grew worried after she missed her flight home on Monday following a business trip.\n\nHer parents told the San Jose Mercury News they feared she may have suffered a manic episode.\n\n\"We talked to her for hours on and off\" on Monday night, her mother Whitey Valenti told the newspaper. \"Her thoughts were disconnected. She talked a mile a minute. She'd say I'm coming home for Thanksgiving, then in the next she was saying she's in the Matrix,\" a reference to the science fiction movie.\n\nHowever, Erin Valenti's husband said she had no history of mental illness.\n\n\"There's never any history of anything like this, no mental health diagnosis, no hospitalization, no substance use, no arrests \u2014 as clear of a record as you can get. This is incredibly unlike her,\" Harrison Weinstein said during the search. \"She is an extremely high achievement, successful person.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
