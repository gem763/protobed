National Australia Bank is still predicting a November move.\n\nAn October cut would follow two back-to-back cuts in June and July to 1%.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Australia\u2019s center-right government announced the budget was in balance for the first time in 11 years and a surplus next year was all but certain. The government has repeatedly said it is not prepared to significantly boost spending to revive growth and inflation.\n\nWilliamson said \u201cearly evidence\u201d indicated that household saving would continue to oustrip spending amid ongoing low wages growth, rising income taxes and falling consumer sentiment.\n\nHe also cited an increase in global downside risks for bringing forward his rate cut call, noting a recent jump in oil prices could temper household spending while slower growth in China was a major overhang for Australia\u2019s export-heavy economy.", "description": "Economists at Citi on Friday joined Australia's major banks in predicting a third interest rate cut by the country's central bank in October, citing more spare capacity in the labor market and a smaller chance of fiscal support in the near term.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
