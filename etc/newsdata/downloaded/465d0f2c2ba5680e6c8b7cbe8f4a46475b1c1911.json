(Photo: Rich Gabrielson, WireImage)\n\nLarry Junstrom, an original member of the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd and the longtime bassist for .38 Special, has died. He was 70.\n\nHis death was announced Sunday on the official Facebook account of .38 Special, a rock band that Junstrom joined in the 1970s following his stint with Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\n\"The Big Man on the Big Bass has left us,\" the statement began. \"He rocked arenas all over the world and succeeded in living his dream. He was truly one of a kind, a congenial traveling companion and a great friend to all with a humorous slant on life that always kept our spirits high - a kind man with a big heart for everyone who crossed his path. There will never be another like him.\"\n\n'Our time is coming to an end': Lynyrd Skynyrd on new music, loss and farewell tour\n\nJunstrom formed Lynyrd Skynyrd with singer Ronnie Van Zant, drummer Bob Burns and guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins in 1964, but left before the band recorded their 1973 debut album, \"Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd.\"\n\nThe bassist went on to join the rock band .38 Special in 1977, fronted by Van Zant's younger brother, Donnie. Junstrom performed with the group for nearly four decades, playing on hits songs \"Hold On Loosely,\" \"Caught Up in You\" and \"Rockin' Into the Night.\"\n\nJunstrom retired from .38 Special in 2014 following a serious hand injury.\n\n\"We are sending our devoted love, strength and comfort to his wife Thania and Larry\u2019s family. We will miss our friend and partner,\" .38 Special's statement added.\n\nMore:Cream drummer Ginger Baker dies at 80\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/07/lynyrd-skynyrd-founding-member-larry-junstrom-has-died-70/3902524002/", "description": "Larry Junstrom, an original member of\u00a0Lynyrd Skynyrd and the longtime bassist for 38 Special, has died at age 70.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
