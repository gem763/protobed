Morgan, a rabid All Blacks supporter, cannot bear the thought of his team ever losing and doesn\u2019t trust his already weak heart to cope if they don\u2019t win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same every big game they play, worse if it\u2019s the World Cup, I just don\u2019t think I could handle a loss and would rather not know,\u201d he tells the Guardian from a shed on his Canterbury farm, decorated in Silver Fern flags and the odd splash of black paint.\n\nRugby World Cup: All Blacks cover up tattoos in Japan to tackle yakuza link Read more\n\n\u201cWhen the All Blacks were in the 2011 final I was a nervous wreck the whole week leading up to the game. Just before kick off I drove and drove and drove until I saw I didn\u2019t have mobile reception any more and then just lay down on the ground looking at the stars \u2026 I tell you it was a sweet feeling when I was back in civilisation and I saw messages from my mates telling me they had won.\u201d\n\nIf Morgan has an acute dose of All Blacks fever then it is fair to say it is a condition shared by a large proportion of his fellow New Zealanders, and the symptoms have flared up in the weeks leading up to the World Cup opener.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The All Blacks won when the teams met in the last Rugby World Cup.

Happily, the All Blacks won. \u201cThey had to win. We didn\u2019t want our baby to be born when the All Blacks lost,\u201d Tait said at the time.\n\nBut what about those for whom the All Blacks, and rugby in general, is of little interest?\n\nSome may choose to spend the next month or more at home with the curtains drawn and good book at hand, while others might go the way of New Zealand writer Sara Young. She had \u201czero\u201d interest in rugby until 2011 when she had to take part in a writers festival that featured a play about the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cI had to watch it \u2018for research\u2019 with my hubby as my guide and by the time the final came around I was hooked,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNow my eyes no longer roll when I read headlines like \u2018the poetry of rugby\u2019.\u201d", "description": "For some, watching the game will be too much, and the only option is to drive until you lose mobile reception", "authors": ["Angela Cuming"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7072004f3d4fa85280341bd14efd1610dd0ae0fb/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20c28ea0e27b784cbc83f49bcb1f638b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
