Some of us remember our dreams quite clearly while others never remember them. Listen to these six people talking about the dreams they have had recently and then answer the questions about what they say.\n\nVoice 2: Hi, I\u2019m Jenny. I\u2019m really dreading my English exam next week. I\u2019ve done a lot of revision and preparation, and I was feeling okay until last night. I had a dream about the exam. I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my mind went completely empty. I couldn\u2019t remember a thing. I just sat there for an hour and a half and didn\u2019t write one word. A horrible teacher was standing behind me all the time and I could feel her starting at me. When the papers were collected, my paper was completely blank. I feel terrible, absolutely terrible.\n\nVoice 1: My name is Peter and I had a great dream last week. I can\u2019t remember which night. It was so real. A man knocked on my bedroom door, came in and told me I had won ten million dollars in the Mark Six. He had some of the money in a bag and he emptied it onto my bed. There I was in bed covered with bank notes. What a great feeling. I\u2019m definitely going to buy a Mark Six ticket this week.\n\nVoice 2: Hello. I\u2019m Molly. I don\u2019t usually remember my dreams but I had a very funny one last weekend and I\u2019ve been laughing about it ever since. I was walking in a country park somewhere and suddenly three elephants come out from behind some trees. They suddenly started to chase me. I ran as fast as I could and so did the elephants. When I couldn\u2019t run any faster, I looked behind me and there was nothing there. What a funny dream. It really made me laugh.\n\nVoice 1: Hello, I\u2019m Denis. I know we dream all the time but I don\u2019t usually remember what I dream about. But I won\u2019t forget the dream I had on Monday night. I was all alone in a cemetery. It was scary. Suddenly a man jumped up from behind one of the grave stones and grabbed of me. He was tall and thin and was wearing a black top hat. He was squeezing all the breath out of me. Luckily I woke up at that point. I didn\u2019t go back to sleep for ages.\n\nVoice 2: Hi, I\u2019m Helen. I had a nightmare the night before last. It was terrible. I was in the bath... completely naked in the bath. Suddenly I realised I wasn\u2019t alone in the bathroom. There was a young girl looking at me. She was six or seven. I felt very surprised and was about to ask her who she was when she opened her mouth..Wow.. she had vampire teeth! I was alone in the bathroom with a vampire. I closed my eyes...and when I dared open them again, the bathroom was empty. The little girl had gone.\n\nVoice 1: Hello. I\u2019m John. I had a very weird dream on Saturday night. I was swimming all alone in the sea somewhere. The water was very hot and still. Suddenly, this really beautiful girl popped her head up out of nowhere. She has lovely blue eyes and long blond hair. She smiled at me. I felt very happy. I was about to ask her who she was when she leapt out of the water and splashed back down again. She had a tail like a big fish. The girl was a mermaid. I\u2019d had a dream about swimming with a mermaid. How odd is that?", "description": "Dreams Voices: Nick Walton and Rachel Crowther Voice 1: All of us dream.
