REUTERS/Kate Munsch\n\nWeWork, whose parent We Company lost $1.9 billion in 2018, had hoped to raise at least $3 billion in the abandoned IPO and borrow a further $6 billion in a loan from banks that was contingent on the listing.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of an IPO and associated senior secured debt raise, WeWork does not have sufficient funding to meet its growth plan,\u201d Fitch wrote in a note.\n\nAdditionally, Fitch warned that there is a potential for WeWork\u2019s customers, particularly big companies, to \u201chesitate to sign membership agreements\u201d given the current flux. It said there was no evidence of this yet.\n\nWeWork\u2019s rating outlook is also negative, Fitch added.\n\nWeWork declined to comment.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision to scrap the IPO marked the conclusion of a tumultuous few weeks for WeWork, which failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its ballooning losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for a short term.\n\nFellow ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s last week downgraded WeWork to \u201cB-\u201c from \u201cB\u201d.\n\nBoth \u201cCCC+\u201d and \u201cB-\u201c are junk bond ratings reserved for corporate borrowers judged to be higher risk to lenders.\n\nWeWork is in discussions with banks as well as its largest investor SoftBank Corp (9434.T) about potential alternative funding, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.\n\nFitch said it could revisit the rating if WeWork was \u201cable to negotiate a firmly committed financing plan and demonstrate successful implementation of any turnaround plan.\u201d\n\nWeWork\u2019s 7.875% junk bond was last trading at about 84 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess, a significant discount to face value, which indicated investor concerns about repayment or doubts about the company securing alternative financing.\n\nWeWork\u2019s new co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, who replaced ousted founder and chief executive Adam Neumann last week, have talked about the need to return to WeWork\u2019s core business of renting out trendy office space to freelancers and enterprises. That would pull the company back from the fringe activities Neumann had forayed into, such as education.\n\nGiven that, Fitch expects WeWork \u201cwill face material restructuring cash charges as it reduces its workforce, which had reached over 12,500 in the second quarter.\u201d\n\nWeWork had under $2.5 billion in unrestricted cash at the end of June and is due to receive $1.7 billion from SoftBank in 2020, according to Fitch, which estimated that would provide for four-to-eight quarters of funding, without taking into account any potential restructuring costs.", "description": "Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Tuesday downgraded WeWork's credit rating by two notches to \"CCC+\", putting the Softbank-backed office-sharing firm deep into junk territory a day after it abandoned an initial public offering.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436059929&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF91008", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
