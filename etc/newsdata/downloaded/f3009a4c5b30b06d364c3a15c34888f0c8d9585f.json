Read More\n\nAfter teasing and posting information about the OnePlus 7T over the past week, OnePlus officially unveiled the phone via a live-streamed event on Thursday.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T continues the company's tradition of making a smartphone that's packed full of features, at a price that's appealing to the masses.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T is the first new phone to run Android 10 out of the box. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ processor, and it has a 6.55-inch AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and gameplay. There's a small waterdrop cutout at the top, making room for the 16MP front-facing camera.\n\nOnePlus has rearranged the camera array on the OnePlus 7T, placing then horizontally on the back inside a circle. There are three cameras: A 48MP main, 12MP telephoto, and a 16MP ultra-wide-angle. There's also a new macro mode for taking photos up to 2.5cm away from the subject -- something most smartphones struggle with without external lenses and accessories built specifically for macro shots.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T uses OnePlus' Warp Charge 30T fast-charging tech to reportedly charge the OnePlus 7T from empty to 70% battery in 30 minutes.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T will cost $599 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of memory. It's available in frosted silver and glacier blue. You can order the 7T Oct. 18 at OnePlus.com. T-Mobile will also carry the OnePlus 7T but hasn't announced pricing yet.", "description": "The OnePlus 7T has all the makings of another solid phone from OnePlus.", "authors": ["Jason Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/26/7abb7a07-f7b2-4f43-a104-9f3281f0bf24/thumbnail/770x578/62cc0e643729e074d8c34a6e8b164ba0/oneplus-7t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
