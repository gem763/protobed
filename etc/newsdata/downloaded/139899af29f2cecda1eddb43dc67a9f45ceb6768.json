Jared Goff passed for a career-low 78 yards, and the Rams (3-3) managed just 157 net yards while the Niners (5-0) leaped well ahead of the two-time defending division champions in the NFC West standings.\n\nLos Angeles scored a touchdown on its opening drive, but was shut out thereafter. For a team that averaged 32.9 points and 421 yards per game last season, everything about it was a shocker.\n\n\u201cWas it a humbling day for us? Absolutely,\u201d McVay said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to learn from. We\u2019re not going to let it demoralize us. They did a nice job. We didn\u2019t do enough collectively.\u201d\n\nThe league is no longer dazzled by the Rams, who have lost three straight games for the first time in McVay\u2019s tenure. Todd Gurley\u2019s absence with a bruised thigh was a setback, but hardly a decisive factor in this comprehensively poor effort.\n\nLos Angeles produced a measly 3.1 yards per play against the Niners - and McVay\u2019s offense only managed to run 50 plays while controlling the ball for just over 21 minutes, going 0-for-9 on third down and 0-for-4 on fourth down.\n\nWhen Goff hit Gerald Everett for a 12-yard gain with 3:16 to play, it was the Rams\u2019 longest passing play of the day.\n\n\u201cTeams have made adjustments to our offense, and we\u2019ve just got to be better and make some adjustments as well,\u201d said receiver Robert Woods, who was held without a catch.\n\nNobody could blame the defense for the Rams\u2019 rough performance in this division game. Los Angeles held the Niners to two touchdowns, and one came on a short field created by rookie running back Darrell Henderson\u2019s fumble.\n\nThe roster that remained remarkably injury-free for two seasons is missing several key contributors - none bigger than Gurley, who couldn\u2019t go after getting hurt 10 days ago. Malcolm Brown and Henderson provided solid moments in the running game, but they aren\u2019t pass-catching threats on Gurley\u2019s level.\n\nThe Rams also lost left guard Joe Noteboom to a right knee injury early in the game. Backup Jamil Demby appeared to perform creditably, but it\u2019s clear the Rams\u2019 line isn\u2019t remotely as effective as it was last season, when it was one of the NFL\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re in that little hole of trying to figure out how to overcome those (injuries),\u201d left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something really, honestly, this team hasn\u2019t done in the last couple of years. We haven\u2019t had that. We\u2019ve stayed really healthy, so it\u2019s a new experience, and guys are going to have to continue to fight and keep our heads down and find ways to overcome it.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco defensive coordinator Robert Saleh even illuminated the depth of the Rams\u2019 struggles when he declined to use a front with six defenders at the line of scrimmage and one linebacker focused on taking away Los Angeles\u2019 running game.\n\n\u201cWe felt good going into this game about our ability to stop the run with our front, just our front, without having to do anything like that 6-1 that other teams have been giving them,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cIt was good by them, the way they came out on that first drive, but the guys did a really good job adjusting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Los Angeles Rams dazzled the NFL with inventive, exciting offensive football during their first two seasons under coach Sean McVay.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/49ers_rams_football_59193_c0-110-3523-2165_s1200x700.jpg?577678f95f21c94c9e18ba7ee20a53bbced8782c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
