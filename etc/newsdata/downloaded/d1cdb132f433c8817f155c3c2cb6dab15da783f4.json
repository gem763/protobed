Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTrump urges GOP to fight for him Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Romney earns rants and raves for secret Twitter name MORE (R-Utah) on whether he was apprised of Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria, Jeffrey said \"that specific decision, I was not [told] in advance.\"\n\nHis defense: Jeffrey defended the Trump administration to the several senators stunned that he wasn't consulted by arguing former Presidents George W. Bush and Obama made decisions without him in Iraq where he served as a charge d'affaires and ambassador.\n\n\"In my current job, I feel that my views, through Secretary Pompeo have been brought repeatedly and frequently and, I think in many cases, effectively,\" he said.\n\nAsked later by Sen.

Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump has had a rough October Pelosi, Schumer hit 'flailing' Trump over 'sham ceasefire' deal Romney slams ceasefire deal, calls Trump's Syria move 'a bloodstain' in US history MORE (D-Conn.) said.\n\nTiming: Jeffrey was testifying at the first of three hearings scheduled this week on Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and Turkey's subsequent military offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump's decision has been widely criticized in Congress as leaving the Kurds to be slaughtered by Turkey. Ankara considers the Kurds terrorists connected to a Turkish Kurdish insurgency, but the United States relied on the Kurds to be the ground force in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTuesday's hearing was happening as a five-day ceasefire negotiated by Vice President Pence with Erdo\u011fan was expiring, and as Erdo\u011fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThese 3 women are defining the race to unseat Trump The Russo-Chinese alliance emerges Russia's snub of Geneva Convention protocol sets dangerous precedent MORE reached a deal for Turkey and Russia to jointly control territory near Syria's border with Turkey.\n\nTrump has defended his decision as fulfilling a campaign promise to end \"endless wars,\" despite the fact that other U.S. officials have said the troops will stay elsewhere in the region. But lawmakers have said the withdrawal gave the green light for Turkey to invade.\n\n'Not inevitable': On Tuesday, Jeffery said Turkey's offensive was \"not inevitable.\"\n\nHe pushed back on senators' characterization that Trump got \"rolled\" by Erdo\u011fan and that the withdrawal led to Turkey's invasion.\n\nRomney asked Jeffrey if he was wrong to think that \"Erdo\u011fan basically said, 'We're coming in, get out of the way,' and America blinked.\"\n\n\"It isn't that we got out of the way because we were not militarily in the way,\" Jeffrey replied, adding later that Erdo\u011fan's offensive was \"absolutely\" unrelated to the withdrawal.\n\nUnconvinced: Jeffrey's argument was that Trump's initial withdrawal just involved a couple dozen troops at two outposts that were only tasked with observing whether there was cross-border fire, and that the subsequent withdrawal of the rest of the 1,000 U.S. troops in northeast Syria was a \"prudent\" defensive step after Turkey expanded its offensive.\n\nRomney was unconvinced.\n\n\"Our president told President Erdo\u011fan that we would be pulling out our troops, we did so and they attacked within a matter of hours,\" he said. \"And you say those are unrelated, but it would seem to me there was a relationship.\"\n\nPressed later by Murphy whether U.S. forces were a deterrent to Turkey, Jeffrey said \"absolutely not\"\n\n\"I think our soldiers on the ground were led to believe something fundamentally different,\" Murphy shot back, \"so query as to how our soldiers who carried out the mission felt that they were betraying the Kurds if ultimately part of the reason for being there wasn't to protect them against the very nation on their border that was seeking to destroy them.\"\n\nEsper was on the call: Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperTrump urges GOP to fight for him Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Trump says Israel, Jordan asked US to leave troops in Syria MORE on Tuesday said he was a part of the phone call between Trump and Erdo\u011fan.\n\n\"I listened in to the phone call, of course,\" Esper told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\n\nEsper, who took over as Trump's defense secretary in late July, said his main focus since becoming Defense chief has been working with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar to try to establish Erdo\u011fan's desired \"safe zone\" between southern Turkey and Kurdish forces known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nAccording to Esper, the process \"was going well,\" saying they had gotten the SDF to agree to back up from the \"safe zone\" and had created a joint operations base in southern Turkey with Turkish forces.\n\n\"I guess at some point the Turks decided it's not moving fast enough, it's not comprehensive enough, whatever the case may be,\" Esper said.\n\n\"We saw pressure building, despite our efforts,\" he added.\n\nAnd McConnell introduces resolution: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump urges GOP to fight for him Senate Dems signal they'll support domestic spending package Trump's top picks for Homeland Security chief are ineligible for job: reports MORE (R-Ky.) and other top Republicans on Tuesday introduced a resolution warning the Trump administration against withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nThe measure, according to McConnell, is backed by Republican Sens.

The resolution calls on President Trump to halt the pullback of U.S. forces and warns that a \"precipitous withdrawal\" would \"create vacuums.\" It also urges Trump to rescind his invitation for the Turkish president to visit the White House next month and opposes Turkey's military action.\n\n\"The Senate needs to speak up. We cannot effectively support our partners on the ground without a military presence,\" McConnell said.\n\nIMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BOMBSHELL TESTIMONY: A top diplomat to Ukraine on Tuesday told House investigators that he believed the Trump administration withheld aid to Ukraine in an effort to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch politically motivated investigations, according to multiple sources familiar with his testimony.\n\nOne source told The Hill that William Taylor said the U.S ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told him that security aid to Ukraine could have been held up in part because of a push for Ukraine to publicly announce probes into the 2016 presidential election as well as one of Trump's top 2020 political opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE.\n\n\"It's clear he thought there was\" a quid pro quo, another source echoed.\n\nMost damning testimony yet: Most Democrats emerging Tuesday from Taylor's closed-door testimony in the Capitol basement were tight-lipped on details but effusive on a central point: the ambassador, they said, was delivering the most damning testimony yet in the Democrats' impeachment investigation into President Trump.\n\n\"Without question the most powerful testimony we've heard,\" said Rep. Stephen Lynch Stephen Francis LynchBiden endorsed by former Connecticut senator, 51 Massachusetts leaders Democrats want Mulvaney to testify in Trump impeachment probe Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Pence says Turkey agrees to ceasefire | Senators vow to move forward with Turkey sanctions | Mulvaney walks back comments tying Ukraine aid to 2016 probe MORE (D-Mass.), who sits on the Oversight Committee.\n\n\"This testimony is a sea change. I think it could accelerate matters,\" Lynch continued. \"This will, I think, answer more questions than it raises.\"\n\nAbout Taylor: Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d'affaires of Ukraine, was among the State Department veterans who had raised red flags about the White House campaign, led by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Diplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Pelosi releases 'fact sheet' saying Trump has 'betrayed his oath of office' MORE, to pressure Zelensky for political favors. The Democrats' impeachment inquiry is now focused squarely on that episode, fueled by allegations from a government whistleblower that Trump had dangled almost $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky failed to open the investigations Trump sought.\n\nIn text message conversations with several other diplomats, including Sondland, Taylor last month had warned against the \"crazy\" strategy of withholding U.S. aid \"for help with a political campaign.\" At one point he threatened to quit the State Department in protest.\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotel magnate and Trump donor with no previous diplomatic experience, pushed back, saying Taylor was \"incorrect\" in surmising Trump's intentions.\n\n\"The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind,\" Sondland wrote.\n\nA call back?: Sondland had testified last week before the three House committees leading the Democrats' impeachment inquiry: Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs. But based on Taylor's testimony Tuesday, some Democrats are already suggesting Sondland will be called back to explain apparent discrepancies.\n\n\"I walk away with the impression Mr. Sondland will have some explaining to do,\" said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi Subramanian (Raja) Raja KrishnamoorthiDiplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Here's what to watch this week on impeachment Sondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy MORE (D-Ill.), a member of the Intelligence Committee.\n\nLynch described Taylor as a \"meticulous\" note-taker who had kept detailed records of his involvement in the months-long effort by Trump and some of his closest allies to pressure Ukrainian leaders to find dirt on Trump's political rivals.\n\n\"He indicated that he kept extensive notes on all of this,\" Lynch said.\n\nFilling gaps: Rep.

That review is taking place alongside Esper's effort.\n\nThe contract was previously expected to be awarded this summer, but prior to that, Republican lawmakers issued a series of dueling letters over the contract, some urging the Pentagon to award it quickly and others pressing for it to be stalled amid the allegations of bias.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will hold a press conference in advance of two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers at 6 a.m. at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.
