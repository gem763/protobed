Once, they were a feature on restaurant menus. Today, they are more often seen at the end of a lead.\n\nThe shift is part of a broader trend across emerging markets, as pet ownership becomes something of a status symbol among aspiring consumers.\n\nThe more people own cats and dogs, the more they spend on looking after them, to the benefit of Dechra Pharmaceuticals, which makes and sells drugs for pets and other animals.\n\nDrugs business: The more people own cats and dogs, the more they spend on looking after them\n\nMidas originally recommended the stock in 2008, when it was \u00a33.97. We recommended it again in 2015, by which time the price had surged to \u00a39.85. Last Friday, the shares closed at \u00a328.90, having almost tripled in the past four years alone.\n\nLooking ahead, long-standing chief executive Ian Page is optimistic and recent figures suggest he has good reason to be.\n\nAnnual results to June 30, released earlier this month, showed a 17.5 per cent increase in revenues to \u00a3482 million, a 27 per cent rise in underlying profits to \u00a3127 million and a 24 per cent hike in the dividend to 31.6p.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance is all the more impressive, as many peers have struggled recently, and Dechra itself has had to cope with increasingly stringent regulation and potential issues around a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThe group\u2019s resilience derives largely from a simple but effective strategy: listening to what vets need and creating products that satisfy those needs, particularly in specialist areas.\n\nDechra\u2019s best-selling drug, for example, is Vetoryl, used to treat dogs with Cushing\u2019s disease, a hormonal disorder.\n\nInitially, Dechra operated only in the UK. Today, it sells to vets around the world.\n\nJust over 70 per cent of sales relate to pets, but the group generates strong growth from farm animal and horse products too. Dechra manufactures half the drugs that it sells and buys the rest from third-party producers.\n\nOver time, Page would like to make more drugs in-house and the company has a strong pipeline, including a diabetes treatment for cats and dogs that can be injected weekly instead of daily \u2013 a clear bonus for pets and their owners.\n\nGrowth is also likely to come from more geographic expansion and well-chosen acquisitions, as Page has bought several businesses over the years and successfully integrated them into the business. Brokers forecast a continued increase in sales, profits and dividends next year and beyond.\n\nMIDAS VERDICT Dechra has come a long way since chief executive Ian Page took the helm in 2001, enjoying 17 years of consistent, double-digit earnings growth. Investors who bought in 2008 \u2013 and later in 2015 \u2013 have done well and may choose to bank some profits. But most analysts believe the stock could hit \u00a333 in the next year or two so shareholders should retain most of their stock.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The more people own cats and dogs, the more they spend on looking after them, to the benefit of Dechra Pharmaceuticals, which makes and sells drugs for pets and other animals.", "authors": ["Joanne Hart For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
