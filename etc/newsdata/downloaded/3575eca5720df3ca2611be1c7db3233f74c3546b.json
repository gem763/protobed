As he delivered his populist gospel to large crowds of camouflage-clad high schoolers, liberal arts college students, and trade union members across Iowa last week, a problematic narrative was hardening around him: His campaign is in disarray and Elizabeth Warren has eclipsed him as the progressive standard-bearer of the primary. He\u2019s sunk to third place nationally, behind Warren and Joe Biden, and some polls of early nomination states show him barely clinging to double digits. He\u2019s shaken up his staffs in Iowa and New Hampshire. He\u2019s lost the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a left-wing group that backed him in 2016, to Warren\u2026\n\nBut party operatives, and even some Sanders allies, aren\u2019t convinced that the swing through Iowa was strategic. \u201cBernie has no idea how to right the ship and neither does anybody around him,\u201d a Democratic activist with knowledge of the campaign says. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. They know things aren\u2019t going well and they\u2019re grasping at ideas.\u201d\n\nAs Sanders has stagnated and Warren has soared, even some of the Vermont senator\u2019s supporters are expressing alarm. Something is off, they say privately, adding to the chorus of people in establishment political circles saying the same thing. Maybe he should explain how he\u2019s different from Warren \u2014 he has deliberately avoided any hint of criticism of her \u2014 or commit to out-organizing her in the early nominating states. Or perhaps he needs to make nice with the media and hire more seasoned pros. Or what about going all-in on Iowa?", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
