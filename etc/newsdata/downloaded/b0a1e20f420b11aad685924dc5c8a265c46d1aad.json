(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIceland\u2019s first lady is pulling back the curtain on what she calls an \u201cincredibly weird job\u201d that\u2019s characterized by public appearances and preconceptions of being her husband\u2019s accessory.\n\nCanadian-born Eliza Reid penned an opinion piece for The New York Times, in which she got real about the undefined role of first lady that she acquired when her husband, Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson, was elected as Iceland\u2019s president in 2016. But even beyond what she takes on as the spouse of a head of state, Reid seems to grapple most with the public\u2019s perception of the job. The first lady even referenced an Instagram posted by European Council President Donald Tusk, which referred to a group of other women in her position \u2014 including Melania Trump \u2014 as \u201cThe light side of the Force.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the spouse of a head of state, the Instagram made me cringe,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cIt is regrettable to see independent, intelligent women reduced to props who exist to support their husbands\u2019 political agendas \u2014 to see them celebrated first and foremost for their sartorial decisions or, as Mr. Tusk\u2019s post implied, their demure and gentle demeanors.\u201d\n\nReid went on to question when we might see an end of the notion that wives of heads of states \u201ctraipse\u201d around to sample wines while their male counterparts take care of \u201cSerious Business.\u201d She also acknowledged that she may be unwittingly contributing to those ideas on the occasion that she travels or makes appearances with her husband.\n\n\u201cI still resent the occasions when my presence is assumed rather than requested,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am not my husband\u2019s handbag, to be snatched as he runs out the door and displayed silently by his side during public appearances.\u201d\n\nStill, as a feminist in a privileged position, Reid is determined to use her voice to encourage others to re-examine the preconceived ideas associated with her role.\n\n\u201cI am not unaware of the irony that I am in the privileged position of being able to help shape debate surrounding gender equality because of something my husband has achieved,\u201d she said. \u201cI am extremely proud of my husband and his achievements \u2014 but no one wants to be judged as her partner\u2019s accessory.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Eliza Reid penned an opinion piece for The New York Times, in which she got real about the undefined role of first lady that she acquired when her husband, Gu\u00f0ni Th.
