Here's the One Technical Level to Watch", "language": "en", "text": "During Thursday night's Mad Money program Jim Cramer favored Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK) noting that it is one of the few drug stocks that investors can bank on right now. Let's check out the charts and indicators to see if technical analysts can bank on it.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of MRK, below, we can see that prices are trading between the weakening 50-day moving average line and the still bullish 200-day line. We can see two tests of the 200-day line noting that buyers did push prices back up. Prices have \"leveled off\" the past four months with the $80-$78 area acting as support.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has also turned flat and suggests that buyers and sellers of MRK are generally in balance. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line in bearish territory.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of MRK, below, we can see a more positive-looking setup with price action and indicators. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows aggressive buying from the end of 2017 and it is just short of making a new high for the move up. The MACD oscillator has been above the zero line since June of 2018 so the trend is strongly up but the indicator recently turned lower for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MRK, below, we can see a possible downside price target of $72 being project but a rally to $87.32 will refresh the uptrend.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The longer-term picture of MRK is positive while the short-term chart suggests we take things slow. Traders could go long MRK on strength above $87.32 using a reasonable stop loss order below.", "description": "Buying Merck?
