When asked for his perspective on new asset classes, particularly Bitcoin, he gave an arch response:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so interesting. they\u2019re taking on the FED, one of the most powerful banks ever created. And they\u2019re messing into their territory. That\u2019s like me taking on McDonald\u2019s. So I think they\u2019re gonna step on them. I think it\u2019s a very exciting time.\u201d\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s perspective as an investor was resolute from a personal standpoint, yet he broadly encouraged investors to follow their personal instincts and gut:\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m a technosaurus rex. I can barely use a cellphone. So I\u2019d best stay out of cryptocurrencies. So if you\u2019re a young person and you like crypto, it might be your place. Again, everything is \u2018just do what you love.\u2019 I love businesses, I love gold [...] I love using debt as money \u2014 because in 1971 the dollar became debt \u2014 and I love paying no taxes legally.\u201d\n\nWhile Kiyosaki is a critic of corporate debt-driven finance, he advocates for an opportunistic and deft approach to the systemic volatility it generates, as manifested in major boom and bust cycles. He told Bloomberg his predicted that the next downturn will be sparked by a crisis in the pensions sector between 2022 and 2025.\n\nSleepwalking into crisis\n\nEarlier this week, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King said the world was \u201csleepwalking\u201d into a financial crisis even worse than that of 2008.\n\nAs part of a newly-revitalized quantitative easing tack, the Fed has injected $210 billion into the economy since mid-September of this year. King warned that:\n\n\u201cBy sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis.\u201d\n\nGold advocates like Kiyosaki and proponents of Bitcoin\u2019s digital scarcity alike remain staunch critics of central banks\u2019 interventionist policies.", "description": "Robert Kiyosaki \u2014 author of the 32 million-copy bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad \u2014 has taken a coy stance on Bitcoin\u2019s David and Goliath-like battle with the Fed", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNjI1MDRmYmY4YTUwNDY4NjRiNjIwZmI2ZWY5NTYwYzMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
