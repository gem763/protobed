This laurel hasn't come easy for the city, people have worked hard for it.\n\nTake for instance the initiative by the Indore Municipal Corporation and Indore Municipal Commissioner, Asheesh Singh. They are working on converting a garbage landfill site into a city forest with a proper plan for waste management.\n\nAsheesh Singh- Twitter/Representational Image- Unsplash\n\nA few days ago, they managed to clear over 13 lakh tonnes of garbage in just six months in Indore. The garbage is now being used to generate both fuel and manure, according to the plan.\n\nWhat an achievement of team Indore!!\n\nBefore and after photos of Indore\u2019s garbage dumpsite. We toiled day and night for 6 months and reclaimed 100 acres of land worth 300+ crores. #IndoreRahegaNo1 @CMMadhyaPradesh @MoHUA_India @Secretary_MoHUA @SwachhBharatGov @PMOIndia @swarup58 pic.twitter.com/3Wg5zhagsT \u2014 Asheesh Singh (@AsheeshSg) December 24, 2018\n\nDon't Miss 3.4 K SHARES 706 SHARES 234 SHARES\n\nAccording to PTI, Indore aims to become a \u2018zero landfill\u2019 and \u2018garbage free\u2019 city with eco-friendly disposal of garbage with the use of modern technology that includes a plant for conversion of plastic waste into burning fuel.\n\nAsheesh Singh told Indiatimes, \u201cIt all started with segregating the waste into wet and dry garbage- done by robotic machines. The dry garbage is then sold to the junk dealer and we also convert the plastic into fuel. The polythenes were also sent to cement plants and were used in road construction, and the rubble from the waste was used for making new building materials.\u201d\n\nPlant To Generate Burning Fuel/ANI\n\n\u201cAfter cleaning up, we thought how do we clear the 13 lakh tonnes of garbage from the landfills? To clear this garbage with machinery and resources we need 5 years and Rs 65 crore but it is not possible as the urban local body does not have that much money.\"\n\n\"First, we were thinking of making a golf course there but we changed our plan and now we are making a city forest. We have reclaimed 100-acre land in which we\u2019ll use 10-acre land for a garden and 90 acres land for the city forest,\u201d he said.\n\nThis idea of converting a grimy landfill into a beautiful city forest is brilliant, and if all the cities can follow suit, we'll soon be able to rid India of garbage and make it cleaner.", "description": "According to the latest ranking of 2018 by Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, they announced Indore as the cleanest cities in India for a second time.
