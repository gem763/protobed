REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/File Photo\n\nThe two countries have been locked in trade disputes for months and were expected to announce a limited deal during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s trip to the United States last month.\n\nBut no deal was sealed and an Indian government source said negotiators were trying to tie loose ends related to some farm products and generic drugs.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to reach an abridged version of a deal that is reciprocal in value terms even though volumes may be small,\u201d the source said.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi referred questions on trade to the United States Trade Representative.\n\nThe USTR did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking comments.\n\nThe deal under discussion includes lowering some tariffs on U.S. farm produce while giving Indian pharmaceuticals faster approvals to enter the U.S. market.\n\nIndia dominates the world\u2019s generic drugs market and the United States is among its top importers.\n\nRoss is expected to meet his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal on Thursday.\n\nDespite close strategic ties, U.S.-India trade relations have been fraught. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about India\u2019s high tariff rates, including a 50% tariff on Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) motorcycles.\n\nThe United States has also taken issue with India\u2019s new investment rules on e-commerce that limit how companies like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Walmart-backed Flipkart can do business in a rapidly growing online market set to touch $200 billion by 2027.\n\nOn Monday, India blocked a request from the United States at the World Trade Organization for setting up a panel to rule on India\u2019s decision to impose additional duties on certain U.S. products, a WTO official said in Geneva.\n\nIn June, the United States ended duty-free access for about $5.7 billion worth of Indian exports under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, of which India was the largest beneficiary. New Delhi responded with higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, including almonds, apples and walnuts.\n\n\u201cThe United States will not permit its businesses, farmers, and workers to be targeted in this WTO-inconsistent way,\u201d according to a statement by the U.S. in Geneva, seen by Reuters.", "description": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be holding talks with Indian leaders this week and three sources in government and industry in New Delhi said there were renewed expectations of a trade deal on farm goods and pharmaceuticals.", "authors": ["Neha Dasgupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435913723&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902Z8", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
