Have spent nearly 2 hours getting through to your support line whilst@on holiday in Italy, ruined my Sunday night.\n\n\"\u00a3910 bill and thought I'd done something wrong, burst into tears! Really not happy Vodafone.\"\n\nVodafone said: \"We are very sorry that some customers could not use their phones yesterday, when roaming abroad. This was due to a technical error, which we have now fixed.\n\n\"Some customers are receiving billing messages in error; we are working through these as an urgent priority and are removing any errors from customer accounts. Customers will not be charged and do not need to worry about contacting us as we are proactively checking accounts.\"\n\nIn August, a similar issue affected Three Ireland. The mobile operator had to apologise after a system upgrade error added bogus roaming fees to customers' bills and suspended their services.\n\nAre you a Vodafone customer who's received one of these roaming bills?
