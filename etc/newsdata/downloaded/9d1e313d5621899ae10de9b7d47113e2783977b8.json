Under the current system someone's assets - including the family home - is depleted down to \u00a323,250 if they need to go into a care home. If you need care in your own home, your assets must be depleted to a level set by your local council, which cannot be lower than \u00a323,250, but your home is excluded from this means test. The Tories' plan to revamp this in the last election was to deplete an individual's assets - including their home - down to a \u00a3100,000 floor, no matter whether they need care in their own home or in a residential home. This proved politically toxic and was swiftly dropped. The party then mooted a cap on bills, promised another consultation on social care and postponed further discussion until the summer of 2018. The promised green paper, setting out the Government's plans and putting them up for public discussion, is still awaited.\n\n'The practical, financial and emotional costs of caring for relatives both young and old are forcing many people in mid-life to make increasingly difficult decisions about balancing their commitments,' says Lindsey Rix, managing director at Aviva.\n\n'Mid-life is the fastest growing age demographic in the UK workforce, so we can expect these pressures to grow.'\n\nSteven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, says next week's Queen's Speech is an opportunity for the Government to commit to long overdue action on social care funding with a bill on the topic.\n\n'All major parties now agree there is a pressing need to tackle the growing problems of putting social care funding on a stable and sustainable basis.\n\n'Our ageing population deserves clarity on what the state will pay for and what individuals will have to fund themselves, based on their wealth.\n\n'For many, the key assurance they want is that under new rules they won\u2019t have to sell the family home to pay for social care.\n\n'There is also a need to commit to central Government funding to remove the current postcode lottery, and a cap on the overall amount anyone will have to pay themselves, allowing people to plan ahead and protect inheritance aspirations.\n\n'Some measures and funding commitments might feature in a future Budget but the Queen\u2019s Speech could pave the way for any primary legislation around more structural reforms.'", "description": "The equivalent of 2.6million over-45s could leave work due to caring pressures, as concern mounts about a burgeoning funding crisis and people fear being overwhelmed by bills.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
