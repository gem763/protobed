His resting place had long been controversial, with campaigners saying it glorified the legacy of a brutal despot.\n\nOn Thursday, 22 relatives of Franco visited the Valley of the Fallen for the exhumation. In the basilica drilled into the mountain where the dictator was buried, a 1.5-ton granite slab covering the tomb was removed and Franco\u2019s coffin was lifted out and transferred via hearse to a helicopter.\n\nSome of those present shouted \u201cLong live Spain! Long live Franco!\u201d as the coffin emerged from the basilica.\n\nMedia access to the site was tight and a canopy was hung over the tomb to prevent drones from photographing the exhumation.\n\nFranco's resting place had long been controversial, with campaigners saying it glorified the legacy of a brutal despot.\n\nJustice Minister Dolores Delgado and Francis Franco, one of the dictator\u2019s grandchildren, accompanied the remains on their journey to Mingorrubio cemetery, north of Madrid, where Franco\u2019s widow is buried. His remains were then reburied and a Catholic Mass held.\n\n\u201cHaving the dictator there in that mausoleum was an affront,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez after the exhumation and reburial.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, when the Valley [of the Fallen] opens its doors again, those who go there will find a different place.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez pledged to exhume Franco on taking office in June 2018, arguing that the Valley of the Fallen, which Franco had built between 1940 and 1959 using imprisoned political opponents, was an inappropriate site for a dictator\u2019s resting place.\n\nA massive stone cross, 150 meters high, towers above the site, which offers sweeping views of the Guadarrama mountains and surrounding valleys. Franco\u2019s tomb was located behind the altar at the far end of the basilica, next to that of another icon of the far right, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, who founded the Falange party.\n\nFranco was one of the leaders of a military uprising against Spain\u2019s elected Republican government which triggered the 1936-1939 civil war. He took control of the country after leading the right-wing Nationalists to victory in the conflict. Although he ensured Spain was neutral in World War II, Franco was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths as he waged reprisals against Republicans.\n\nActivists say more than 100,000 victims of Franco still lie in unmarked graves, the second-highest number in the world after Cambodia, according to Amnesty International.\n\nAfter his death in 1975, Spain made the transition to democracy and the issue of historical memory was mostly kept out of the political arena. A 2007 Historical Memory Law sought to remove symbols of Franco and his regime from public places, but the Valley of the Fallen remained untouched until now.\n\nA group of far-right supporters of Franco gathered outside Mingorrubio cemetery as the exhumation was taking place, to demonstrate against the process.\n\n\u201cThis is cowardice and it\u2019s shameful,\u201d said Roberto S\u00e1nchez, a Franco supporter who was at the cemetery. \u201cIt makes no sense at all. It\u2019s an absurd attitude, even for communists.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving the dictator there in that mausoleum was an affront.\" \u2014 acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n\nThe government was keen to deliver on the exhumation plan before the November 10 general election.\n\nHowever, delays and legal challenges plagued the exhumation almost right up until the last moment. The Franco family objected to the idea and sought to block it before the supreme court.\n\nThe family said that if the exhumation was allowed to go ahead, the reburial should be in a crypt beneath Almudena cathedral in central Madrid, where Franco\u2019s daughter is buried. That raised concerns that the cathedral would become a pilgrimage site for extremists.\n\nHowever, the supreme court quashed the Franco family\u2019s complaints last month, and approved the government\u2019s choice of reburial site.\n\nAnother obstacle was the long-standing refusal to cooperate of Santiago Cantera, the prior of the Benedictine community that manages the basilica at the Valley of the Fallen. Cantera, who was an electoral candidate for the far-right Falange in the 1990s, eventually complied and blessed Franco\u2019s coffin as it was lifted from the tomb.", "description": "\u2018Having the dictator there in that mausoleum was an affront,\u2019 says Pedro S\u00e1nchez.", "authors": ["Guy Hedgecoe", "Diego Torres"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177949642-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
