The All Blacks are fixed on ending the tournament on a high by defeating Wales at Tokyo Stadium in Friday\u2019s play-off\n\nAfter a thorough review of the 19-7 reverse to England \u2013 the All Blacks\u2019 first loss in the tournament since 2007 \u2013 attention turned to Wales whose head coach Warren Gatland is returning to New Zealand to coach the Chiefs.\n\nWarning signs ignored as All Blacks team selection template falls short | Matt McIlraith Read more\n\n\u201cThe review was not a pleasant experience,\u201d said the New Zealand assistant coach, Ian Foster, who indicated he would talk about whether he would put his name forward to succeed Steve Hansen as head coach after the tournament. \u201cWe did not play as well as we wanted to on a big occasion.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to the team going forward to make sure we grasp what happened and why it did. It is not just what you see but also what you feel. The match against Wales gives us a chance to redeem ourselves and show we are a better team than we looked last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt is a really important game for us as a group. It is not easy when you are knocked out of the tournament and go straight home, as happened in 2007. You take the disappointment with you through the summer so we are really pleased we have this match which gives us the chance to get back on the horse.\u201d\n\nIt will be New Zealand\u2019s fourth playoff. They beat Scotland in 1991 and France in 2003 but lost to South Africa in 1999. They will be looking to extend their winning run against Wales which stretches back to 1953 and it will give Foster the opportunity to catch up with Gatland, a Waikato teammate in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt will be good to see him back in New Zealand,\u201d said Foster. \u201cWales will be in the same state as us after a tight loss in a tough semi-final. We will pick the team we feel is best equipped to win the match after seeing how players are feeling. The only one struggling with injury is Ardie Savea.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks and Steve Hansen share their pain after Rugby World Cup exit Read more\n\nFoster said one reason why New Zealand struggled to find a response to England\u2019s early onslaught was that the two teams did not face each other very often: it was only the second Test between the sides since 2014 and the other was last November at Twickenham.\n\n\u201cI am not offering it as an excuse because England were in exactly the same position,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThey had targeted the game as a big one for them and they are a team of quality. Every time you learn a bit more about them and the things they feel are important. We knew it would be a mammoth game and one we would be in danger of losing if we did not play as we needed to. We would like to play them more because it is a great rivalry.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand will not be spending the week sulking after their semi-final defeat to England ended their quest for a third successive World Cup", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b086de0acd24f4bf96731857a2e6c9613d86d1/0_154_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c2d24b74a4d665bd1aa4bd5154b73cf1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
