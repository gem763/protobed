REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d which Waititi wrote, directed and in which he plays a ridiculous Hitler, combines dark, absurdist humor with a serious plea for tolerance as an antidote to hate.\n\nThe movie opens in U.S. theaters on Friday after winning the top award in September at the Toronto film festival, which has often been the proving ground for Oscar glory.\n\nIt tells of a 10-year-old German boy (Jojo) toward the end of World War Two who is a Nazi fanatic and whose imaginary friend is Hitler. Filled with anti-Semitic ideas, Jocko\u2019s world is turned upside down when he finds his mother has hidden a young Jewish girl in the attic of their home.\n\n\u201cI was really taken by the idea of children witnessing grown-ups doing terrible things,\u201d said Waititi, whose mother is Jewish and whose father is Maori.\n\n\u201cWe need to educate our kids about tolerance and continue to remind ourselves that there\u2019s no place in this world for hate.\u201d\n\nWaititi, whose work ranges from the New Zealand TV musical parody \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d to superhero movie \u201cThor: Ragnorak,\u201d said he wanted the film to overturn any notion that stories about the Nazi era have had their day, especially given the worldwide rise of white nationalism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really crazy that at the end of World War Two, if you were a Nazi, you went to jail. Now it\u2019s like, if you\u2019re a Nazi, feel free to go to the town square and have a rally,\u201d he said.\n\nMovie critics have called \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d both bold and divisive, despite a history of Hitler spoofs dating back to Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Great Dictator\u201d in 1940 and the 1967 Mel Brooks film \u201cThe Producers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been prepared that for some people it\u2019s still too soon to be mixing humor with this subject matter. There are one or two people who won\u2019t see the film because they\u2019ve had family members who\u2019ve gone through the camps. And that\u2019s totally fine.\u201dBut it\u2019s so obvious what this is. You\u2019d have to be dumb to misconstrue the message of this movie,\u201d Waititi said.\n\nWaititi said a 2018 survey commissioned by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany showed that 41% of Americans and 66% of U.S. millennials questioned could not say what Auschwitz was.\n\n\u201cThe fact that number is so high is staggering and shocking and simply not good enough. We are forgetting. So no, we should not stop having this conversation and making these films and talking about it.\n\n\u201cIf I have to make a film with an imaginary Hitler and a few jokes, then so be it,\u201d he said.", "description": "New Zealand movie director Taika Waititi says he likes a challenge and his satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazi culture may be his riskiest and most successful yet.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442010594&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1K0-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
