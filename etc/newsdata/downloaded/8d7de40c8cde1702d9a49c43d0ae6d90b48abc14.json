The fury that consumes him when he steps between the ropes has come to define him, legitimately, when most assumed he had adopted the persona merely adopted it due to his legendary father's ferocious reputation.\n\nWildly unrealistic expectations weighed heavy three and a half years ago after turning over following just 22 amateur bouts, but the progress has been undeniably swift. While also frantically polishing his technique, The Destroyer\u2019s appeal has come through his raw style. Benn has shunned pressure to conform and is instead revelling in who he is.\n\n\u201cI thought I had to live up to the reputation (of my father),\u201d Benn tells The Independent. \u201cBut now I have realised it's who I am.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Instead of reinventing himself in the shadows, Benn slammed his foot on the accelerator, rushing to 15-0 and building a loyal following.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

But I'm only 23, think of the amount of entertainment I've given with such limited amateur background.\n\n\u201cDon't judge me by the fighter I am now. Compare me to the fighter I was four years ago, I'd have knocked that version of myself out in a round.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of a WBA trinket, should he blitz Steve Jamoye on Saturday on the undercard of Josh Taylor vs Regis Prograis, will only serve to intensify the spotlight.\n\nBenn is now acutely aware of the perils that come with that, having been left \u201cdown in the dumps for quite a while\u201d by the cruel world of social media.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that's changed (since turning professional to now) is not letting what people say about me affect me because it doesn't anymore,\u201d Benn maintains. \u201cI didn't understand that at first. You have to have thick skin.\n\n\u201cI can say I was down in the dumps for quite a while, listening to what people said made me doubt myself. But why am I letting somebody come into my living room and slap me in the face? That's what social media is, it's allowing people in your front room to disrespect you. I'm not even bothered anymore.\u201d\n\nA world title may never come, but many could learn from Benn and the splash he has made so far in maximising each opportunity that has fallen his way. Many initially scoffed at a potential match-up against the dazzling Josh Kelly, yet the pair continue to gravitate towards one another, with a collision perhaps occurring in 2020. It promises to be a bumpy ride in the meantime, making the latest version of Benn a potential show-stealer at The O2 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cLet's see where we end up,\u201d Benn ponders, clearly enjoying the ride. \u201cAll I know is Britain's in for one hell of a treat.\u201d", "description": "The storm is coming but for now Conor Benn remains at peace now just hours away from his 16th professional fight.
