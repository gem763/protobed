An eighth student was struck by an errant bullet fired by a private security guard.\n\nThe case against McKinney is on a slower track, as defense attorneys seek to have the case moved to juvenile court.\n\nMcKinney, who was born female, told police he was in the process of transitioning to male and during the shooting had targeted a classmate who had insulted him over being transgender, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nMcKinney said he had planned the shooting for weeks and wanted other students to \u201cexperience bad things (and) to suffer from trauma like he has had to in his life,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nMcKinney, who is also being held without bond, is due back in court next month.", "description": "One of two teenagers accused of opening fire at a Colorado charter school in May, killing one classmate and wounding seven others in a cocaine-fueled rampage, was ordered on Wednesday to stand trial on murder and attempted murder charges.", "authors": ["Keith Coffman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
