New Orleans officials are trying to determine the authenticity of the video. Submitted Video, Lafayette Daily Advertiser\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2013 A video posted on social media claiming to show structural problems inside the Hard Rock Hotel construction site two days before its deadly collapse has become part of the investigation into the tragedy, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nThe video, posted Tuesday by a contractor, caught the attention of investigators looking into the collapse that authorities say killed three people, including one person unaccounted for who is now believed to be dead.\n\nInvestigators said they will determine the video's authenticity and whether it shows structural problems prior to the collapse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019re well aware of it. It\u2019s provided to everybody and that will certainly be part of our investigation and our evaluation,\u201d New Orleans Fire Chief Tim McConnell said.\n\nA structural engineer who reviewed the video said he does not believe it reveals definitive evidence of what caused the collapse. The video shows thin, white, temporary beams called post shores stretching from concrete floor to ceiling and bending.\n\n\u201cIt looks like (the post shores) were standing pretty far apart but there may be nothing wrong with that. I still think an outside thing happened to cause the collapse,\u201d said structural engineer Walter Zehner, who once consulted on the project before it became a planned Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nA planned Hard Rock Hotel undergoing construction in New Orleans collapsed Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019.

But no one \u2013 including site contractor Citadel Builders \u2013 has been able to independently verify the site in the video is the now-collapsed hotel.\n\nConcrete contractor Randy Gaspard, who works on commercial projects and has not worked on the Hard Rock site, said he received the video from site workers who showed it to him while at lunch. He shared it on his personal Facebook page Tuesday with the caption, \u201cDays prior to Hard Rock Collapse, Citadel well aware of a problem, profits over safety, sad!\u201d not knowing it would quickly spread across social media.\n\nIn the video, a voice speaking in Spanish can be heard pointing out \u201cbig spaces without any beams.\u201d\n\nGaspard declined to identify the person who recorded the video. He said he was not offering an opinion on the video, just sharing the concerns the worker had.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re looking at is the bottom of one of the concrete pours, the deck holding the concrete above,\u201d Gaspard said. \u201cIt has either an insufficient amount of steel support under it or an insufficient amount of steel support in the concrete.\n\n\"What happened is all the decks deflected (meaning bent). There\u2019s a failure somewhere in there. What the failure is I can\u2019t say,\" Gaspard said. \"I wasn\u2019t part of the process. What he\u2019s pointing out is simply the decks have deflected beyond what would be acceptable.\n\n\"The guys were on the job, they thought something was wrong. I\u2019m not making an opinion on it, I\u2019m just explaining what the guys were complaining about right there.\"\n\nSix to eight concrete levels of the Hard Rock Hotel construction site collapsed Saturday morning, two days after Gaspard said the video was shot. On Wednesday, authorities said a third worker once thought to be alive is now considered dead.\n\nCLOSE Multiple injuries were reported following the partial collapse of the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the morning of Oct. 12, 2019. Carl Cole via Storyful, Lafayette Daily Advertiser\n\nCity officials are still working to stabilize a 300-foot crane that threatens to fall onto surrounding buildings.\n\nThe site is being managed by Citadel Builders, which has been a target of outrage online.\n\nWhen asked if he could confirm if the video showed the Hard Rock site, Citadel spokesman Brian Trascher said, \"I\u2019m not saying it is or it isn\u2019t from the site. What we do know is it\u2019s unverified.\"\n\nIn addition to working as a structural engineer on projects, Zehner often is called to serve as a trial witness to testify about problems that occur at construction sites.\n\n'Logically, it doesn't make sense': Engineer weighs in on Hard Rock Hotel collapse\n\n'Mind boggling': Witness describes Hard Rock hotel construction collapse\n\nAfter watching the video posted by Gaspard, Zehner said, \"If I had designed it it wouldn\u2019t have looked like that,\" in reference to the beams. But Zehner also said he saw no evidence in the video that the fate of the hotel construction rested on a few thin post shores.\n\n\"Those were temporary anyway. They\u2019re not part of the structure,\" Zehner said. \"There was deflection in the post shores, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s what caused the building to collapse, not in the least.\"\n\nConstruction on the site was behind schedule, which is why the workers were there on a Saturday, Zehner said. But he has worked with Citadel in the past and said, \"Never have I seen them cut corners or anything like that.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s still too many mysteries out there,\" Zehner said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/16/hard-rock-hotel-new-orleans-video-shows-flaws-contractor-claims/4005543002/", "description": "A contractor posted a video arguing it showed structural problems inside the Hard Rock Hotel construction site two days before its deadly collapse.", "authors": ["Andrew J.
