Only 12 Republican senators objected to the move in a Senate floor vote in March, with most of the GOP conference sticking with the president.\n\nSen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), one of those who voted in support of the declaration, announced early Wednesday that the Trump administration was diverting $30 million in funds from an Army base in her state to construction of the wall \u2015 even though she previously received assurances from an acting secretary of defense that her state would be spared.\n\nThe Arizona Republican, who is looking at a tough reelection fight next year, downplayed the move in her statement, saying the ground transportation project at Fort Huachuca was already facing delay due to \u201cunforeseen environmental issues\u201d at the construction site. Those issues are expected to continue until next year, her office said.\n\nTop Arizona Democrats, however, criticized McSally in the wake of the announcement.\n\nFormer astronaut Mark Kelly, who is running to be the Democrats\u2019 Senate nominee next year, accused McSally of failing \u201cher most basic responsibility to put Arizona first.\u201d He added that the senator \u201ctold Arizonans she had protected funding for Arizona military bases, and the fact is that she didn\u2019t keep her word.\u201d\n\nOther Republican senators whose states are impacted by Trump\u2019s diversion of military construction funds to build the wall include Thom Tillis of North Carolina ($80 million), Mitch McConnell of Kentucky ($62 million), John Cornyn of Texas ($48 million), Lindsey Graham of South Carolina ($11 million) and Cory Gardner of Colorado ($8 million).\n\nAll of the above senators are also up for reelection in 2020, and they all similarly voted in support of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration in March.\n\nThe Defense Department on Tuesday approved a total of $3.6 billion in military construction funds to build 175 miles of border wall with Mexico. Officials said 127 military construction projects \u2015 at home and around the world \u2015 will be impacted. A complete list can be found here.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was among the first lawmakers on Tuesday to say his state will be affected by the funding cuts \u2015 in his case, money diverted from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Schumer called the Trump administration\u2019s move a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to the troops and accused the president of \u201ctrying to usurp Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse.\u201d\n\nSens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, said in a joint statement that four military projects in their state will lose $72 million in funding to Trump\u2019s border wall. These include a cyber facility at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, a Navy ship maintenance center in Portsmouth, and projects replacing hazardous materials warehouses in Norfolk and Portsmouth.\n\n\u201cThe well-being of American troops is the core responsibility of every commander in the military, yet the Commander-in-Chief is shirking that duty so he can advance his own political agenda,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nDefense Department officials have suggested that the construction of the affected military projects need not be delayed if Congress \u201cbackfills\u201d and approves their funding again in the near future. But Democrats in the House and Senate have vowed not to do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not voting to appropriate the same money to the same project twice because what they are doing is illegal and I\u2019m not an idiot,\u201d tweeted Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.\n\nTrump\u2019s emergency declaration is also facing a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union, which has pledged to \u201cblock Trump\u2019s latest effort to raid military funds for his xenophobic wall.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSupreme Court Says Trump Can Use Defense Funds For Border Wall\n\nTrump Offers Pardons To Aides Who Will Fast-Track Wall Before Election Day: Report\n\nPentagon Begins Plan To Fund Border Wall By Delaying Military Projects\n\nLove HuffPost?
