Zarah Fairn via submission (triangle choke) \u2013 Round 1, 3:57\n\nUpdated records: Anderson (9-4 MMA, 2-2 UFC), Fairn (6-3 MMA, 0-1 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Anderson won with a submission for the first time since 2014.\n\nAnderson on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t control everything that happened in my last win, but for myself I haven\u2019t felt like I\u2019ve had a definitive win since 2017. This is amazing for me to have a clean-cut finish, especially from a position a lot of people thought I wasn\u2019t good at. I\u2019ve worked so hard and am excited to show who I am. I\u2019m more than just a striker.\u201d\n\nAnderson on living up to her potential\n\n\u201cI feel amazing. I know I haven\u2019t fought to my potential in my last couple fights. I wanted to show who I am. I\u2019m a well-rounded fighter and it\u2019s amazing to come home to Australia. I just wanted to show what I\u2019m capable of. I feel like I was able to showcase that today. I needed to prove to myself that I\u2019m one of the best in the world. I can\u2019t wait for what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nAnderson on what she wants next\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for (featherweight and bantamweight champion) Amanda (Nunes) as a martial artist. I don\u2019t really care who I fight. I would love that fight. I think I\u2019m one of the best featherweights in the world, and I think my skills match up great with Amanda. It\u2019s just who the UFC wants. I know she\u2019s kind of caught up right now, and she usually has a long time in between fights. The UFC knows every time they come to me with a name and a date, I always sign on the line. If Amanda is next, perfect. I love that fight. And I think that I match up really well with her, and I give her a lot of problems that she hasn\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Anderson, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Megan Anderson def.
