The incident took place moments before the Chicago Cubs announced their manager, Joe Maddon, would not return to the team next season.\n\nAD\n\nApologies #Cubs fans on falling behind w/today's news. The photographer we were working w/in STL suffered a heart attack & stroke in the dugout prior to Maddon's announcement. He is now in stable condition in the cardiac recovery room, but please keep him in your prayers. \u2014 Kelly Crull (@Kelly_Crull) September 29, 2019\n\nThe victim, who is 64, had reportedly suffered a heart attack and stroke, according to the Post-Dispatch. He was taken to a hospital and listed in \u201ccritical but stable condition.\u201d The Cardinals did not return a request for comment from The Washington Post late Sunday, but medical staff and security at the stadium commended Goold for his efforts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo many people are afraid of doing CPR. But, because of (Goold\u2019s) actions, he was the first link in that chain of survival,\u201d Washington University Professor David Tan, who was the stadium doctor Sunday at Busch Stadium, told the Post-Dispatch. \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous. It was the early CPR by Derrick Goold that probably saved his life. Derrick wasn\u2019t afraid. He didn\u2019t hesitate. And he did it.\u201d\n\nGoold, who served as president of the Baseball Writer\u2019s Association in 2016, responded to reports about the incident in a single tweet, however, writing that he \u201cOnly tried to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThanks, friend. Only tried to do what's right, as you and so many of my friends would do as well. \u2014 Derrick S. Goold (@dgoold) September 29, 2019\n\nHis wife, Erika Ebsworth-Goold, elaborated a bit more while praising her husband, whom she called a \u201cdogged, intrepid reporter and an incredible writer.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore importantly, [Derrick Goold] is also a damn good person, who jumps in to help when and where he is needed,\u201d Ebsworth-Goold wrote on Twitter. \u201cHoping the gentleman he assisted today makes a full and quick recovery.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even after his heroics, Goold\u2019s work wasn\u2019t finished. He still managed to file a story Sunday detailing how the Cardinals had nearly squandered their current position at the top of the National League standings.\n\nRead more on baseball from The Post:\n\nCubs, Joe Maddon have perhaps the nicest baseball breakup ever\n\nAnalysis: Charting the wildest season in Nationals\u2019 history\n\nA year into a rebuild, the Orioles have been shaken up and (they hope) straightened out\n\nRangers intentionally let a pop-up drop to help pitcher reach 200 strikeouts\n\nCubs, Joe Maddon have perhaps the nicest baseball breakup ever\n\nAD", "description": "The 64-year-old victim had reportedly suffered a heart attack and stroke, according to the Post-Dispatch.
