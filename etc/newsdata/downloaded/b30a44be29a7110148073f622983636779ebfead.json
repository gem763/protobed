In a decision announced by the Alaska School Activities Association (ASAA) on Tuesday, officials determined that the 17-year-old would have the points from her win reinstated.\n\nThe decision came just hours after the Anchorage School District announced its own investigation into the issue, which also declared Willis had been treated wrongfully.\n\n\"Our swimmer was targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body,\" the district's investigation stated.\n\nWillis' disqualification sparked controversy as soon as it happened. One referee attending the meet said she froze in disbelief when the official made their decision, immediately telling them \"this is going to blow up.\"\n\nLangford, who coached Willis and her sisters when they were younger, said she's never seen a swimmer intentionally adjust their suit to make it more revealing, adding that she believed the high schooler was being unfairly targeted.\n\n\"It comes down in my opinion to the race thing,\" Langford told the Anchorage Daily News. \"It was so targeted. It was so intentional and so individual. She\u2019s one of three girls on [her team] who look like her.\"\n\nLangford was also quick to note that Willis was wearing suit assigned by her team and that none of her other teammates were disqualified.\n\nIn its ruling on the issue, the ASAA issued a reminder to referees that it should not assume swimmers are modifying their outfits on purpose.\n\n\"ASAA believes students are not intentionally rolling up their swimsuits in this manner,\" the ruling said, adding that officials are asked to \"assume school uniforms are legal and will remain so.\"", "description": "The high school swimmer who was disqualified over a controversial \"uniform violation\"\u00a0has had her victory reinstated.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_TWfpNj0uHya4Inm_UpTNg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/670x439+0+22/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/32d84b40-d4d1-11e9-b39f-618dffd5967a", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
