She often performs free concerts for children and, at the height of her fame three decades ago, volunteered at a homeless program in Harlem, where most of the people thought she was a student from nearby Columbia University.\n\nShe got to know Lennon\u2019s widow, Yoko Ono, when they worked on the anti-fracking movement in upstate New York.\n\nMerchant, 55, records and performs sporadically now and, aside from guiding her teenage daughter through high school and into college, said her activism takes up most of her time.\n\n\u201cThese projects, for a good reason, they suck your life blood,\u201d she said. \u201cI began to see these projects as much more important than making another Natalie Merchant record.\u201d\n\nJoan Osborne, Rachael Yamagata and Sam Amidon are among the other artists who will perform at the annual Lennon tribute, now in its 39th year. The show will take place at the Peter Jay Sharp Theatre at Symphony Space.\n\nMerchant, who calls \u201cImagine\u201d one of the most powerful pieces of music ever recorded, is already rehearsing some Lennon songs with her accompanist for the tribute.\n\n\u201cThe thing that we want to do is not faithfully perform the songs as John recorded them, to give stylistic alterations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be fun. We don\u2019t want to feel like we\u2019re a John Lennon karaoke group.\u201d\n\nAnd what are some of her favorite Lennon songs? What might she be performing?\n\n\u201cI think that would spoil the surprise, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 At this stage of her life, Natalie Merchant is more proud of getting an honor named for John Lennon because of what it says about her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/8bc4c2_music-lennon-merchant-35441-natalie-merchant-dec-2018-file-photo-shows-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
