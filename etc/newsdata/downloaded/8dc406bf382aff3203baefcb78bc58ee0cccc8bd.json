The price is steep even by the expensive standard of national party conventions: In 2016, a $200,000 donation included five hotel rooms at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nBut Milwaukee was never chosen as the convention site because it was a Washington party favorite. Done right, the Midwestern convention will help Democrats\u2019 image on a national stage . Past conventions have boosted local parties in the host region, and Wisconsin will be one of 2020\u2019s most important battleground states.\n\nSolmonese has been on an extensive closed-door tour of Washington and Milwaukee to discuss the event and win over skeptics. Last week, representatives from roughly half of all state party delegations visited Milwaukee to begin making plans with their hotels for the convention.\n\n\u201cMost people find Milwaukee to be an inspired and compelling decision,\u201d Solmonese said in an interview. He added: \u201cThere no doubt are going to be, as there are with every convention, additional logistical and operational challenges. We\u2019ll meet them and we\u2019ll make sure there is a seamlessness to this convention that people will expect.\u201d\n\nThe DNC has not released information on its fundraising goals for the event, which needs $70 million overall. The DNC is on \u201cpace to raise what we need to raise\u201d for the convention and is meeting its other targets, Solmonese said.\n\nAsked what the DNC would do if the Democratic nominee asked for corporate donations to be returned, Solmonese said the DNC has to get the convention \"appropriately funded and get it paid for well in advance,\u201d which means accepting corporate PAC donations.\n\nThe DNC doesn\u2019t plan to return any corporate money that is donated to the convention regardless of the nominee, convention CEO Joe Solmonese told POLITICO. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t know and try to, nor can I ever suggest that we ever try to, bend this towards any one candidate\u2019s philosophy,\u201d Solmonese said.\n\nSolmonese and Sam Cornale, the DNC\u2019s deputy chief executive, held briefings recently at six prominent lobbying firms, during which they update d lobbyists on convention planning and told t hem how their corporate clients can obtain packages with convention access in exchange for donations to the DNC . They discussed the possibility the Democratic nominee might call on the DNC to reject corporate cash during a briefing at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, according to a lobbyist present.\n\nDavid Jones, a longtime Democratic fundraiser who attended a briefing last week at his employer, Capitol Counsel, said the DNC seemed \"to be way ahead of the curve\u201d in its planning.\n\nBut other Washington operatives said they hadn\u2019t donated to the convention yet because the DNC has been too vague and too slow to explain the convention perks of a donation .\n\n\u201cN o. 1 , Milwaukee is not as big a city as Philadelphia, and two, the process has been slow. It\u2019s been hard to figure out what we would get for our investment,\u201d said one operative employed by an organization that has contributed to DNC convention s in the past but has not yet given money this cycle.\n\n\u201cGiving to the [DNC] doesn\u2019t do you any good,\u201d said a lobbyist who was briefed by the DNC on convention plans but has not encouraged his clients to donate.\n\nWhile Democrats are locked in a slow-moving primary, the convention planners want to encourage donors to give early: Donors must contribute in 2019 and 2020 in order to meet the requirements for getting convention packages, according to the fundraising summary, and contributors who give their 2020 contribution before March 31 will be given \u201cpreferred booking\u201d for the event.\n\nThe most expensive \u2014 \u201cKilborn Avenue Package \u201d \u2014 for instance, includes early access to booking two hotel rooms in the DNC\u2019s block of rooms, VIP convention credentials , box seats, 10 tickets to convention events and other perks. The cost: $300,000.\n\nUnion delegations \u2014 historically among the conventions biggest funders \u2014 face another dilemma when it comes to staying in Milwaukee. While labor unions usually stay in unionized hotels when they travel, there are only four union hotels in Milwaukee. One of those four hotels, Knickerbocker on the Lake, is a boutique hotel with only 60 rooms.\n\nDemocrats picked The Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee to host their 2020 national convention. | Carrie Antlfinger/AP Photo\n\nOne draft of the convention agreement makes clear how critical labor funding will be to the event: In the draft, labor unions were expected to donate close to $10 million of the $70 million fundraising goal, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The final agreement is not public.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to always stay in a unionized hotel,\u201d AFL-CIO spokesman Gonzalo Salvador said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the politics of unionization has complicated convention planning. Democrats\u2019 choice of Charlotte , N.C., to host their 2012 convention prompted fury from unions upset about North Carolina\u2019s \"right-to-work \" laws and unionization rates , which are among the lowest in the country.\n\nUnions toned down their participation in Charlotte, sending skeleton staff and skipping out on sponsoring parties and lunches for members. The Laborers' International Union of North America did not contribute any money after donating $1.5 million to the convention in 2008.\n\nWith space in Milwaukee at a premium, the DNC announced in August that 26 state delegations will stay in Northern Illinois during the convention, with some hotel rooms located near O\u2019Hare International Airport \u2014 a 90-minute drive without traffic.\n\nSteve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist at Subject Matter, which hosted one of the briefings last week, said he wasn\u2019t concerned by the lack of hotel rooms in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cOther than New York or Chicago, every other place you go, that\u2019s a question,\u201d he said.\n\nOne group that will be housed close to the convention site in Milwaukee, however, is the Republican National Committee. The RNC scouted dozens of hotels near all three finalist cities for the Democratic convention and secured a block of hotel rooms 20 minutes from the convention site before Milwaukee was announced as the host, RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens said. Ahrens declined to say where the GOP hub will be.\n\nGilberto Hinojosa, chair man of the Texas Democratic Party, said he\u2019s eagerly awaiting announcements about space in the arena at the nominating convention. But Hinojosa said the DNC has been in frequent communication with him and other state party officials about the convention, and he was not miffed to find out his delegation would be commuting at least an hour each day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure our delegates get some margaritas on the way up or back \u2014 or both \u2014 if it\u2019s legal,\u201d Hinojosa said.\n\nIan Kullgren contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/7f/4dbbb02442ef8e8cf3fc9abbf98e/1928-milwaukee-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
