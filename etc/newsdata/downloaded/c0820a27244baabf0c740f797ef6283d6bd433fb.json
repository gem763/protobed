We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leap to place this fully-loaded Fish & Chips Burger from Christian \u201cDJ BBQ\u201d Stevenson\u2019s new cookbook The Burger Book in that esteemed category either. Stuffed with freshly fried white fish, homemade \u201cchips\u201d, mushy peas and a from-scratch tartar sauce, it\u2019s a perfect ode to the British pub favourite that you can keep enjoying even when BBQ season feels eons away.\n\nFish & Chips Burger\n\nBy Christian \u201cDJ BBQ\u201d Stevenson\n\nBack in 2003, I used to host a radio show called the Rock Copter, for Total Rock. The station was above a pub in south London. Across the road was the best fish and chips restaurant in London, run by these twin brothers. They spent their lives buying rundown fish and chip joints, rebuilding them, turning them around and flipping them for a nice profit so that they could go off travelling. When the money ran out, they would return to London and find another chippy.\n\nThese dudes taught me how to make the perfect fish and chips \u2014 it\u2019s all about the temperature of the oil. If it\u2019s not hot enough, you\u2019ll just boil the food and it won\u2019t crisp up properly. No one wants soggy chips (apart from my 11-year-old son. Weird kid). Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t want to finish the meal and would get a doggy bag for the next day \u2014 and that\u2019s when this burger was born. Let\u2019s do this!\n\nIngredients\n\n3 or 4 baking potatoes (you\u2019ll only need 2 for the burgers but make extra to nibble on the side)\n\nVegetable oil, for deep-fat frying (at least 2 litres)\n\n4 portions of white fish fillet (cod/ haddock/coley/plaice all work well but my fave is haddock \u2013 make each portion a bit bigger than your bun)\n\nMalt vinegar\n\n4 soft white buns\n\nBatter:\n\n1 \u2154 cup self-raising (self-rising) flour, plus extra for dusting\n\n1 \u00bc cups beer\n\nMushy Peas:\n\n1 295 mL can marrowfat peas\n\n2 tbsp butter\n\nTartare Sauce:\n\nScant \u00bd cup mayonnaise\n\n1 gherkin (pickle), finely chopped\n\n1 tbsp capers, finely chopped\n\n\u00bd tsp English mustard\n\n1 tbsp cider vinegar\n\n1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley\n\nPreparation\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get those chips rocking. The best chips come from baked potatoes. It\u2019s pretty much like doing a twice-cooked chip! Make them the day before, as the potatoes need to cool completely before deep-frying.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/gas mark 4. Bake your potatoes for 45\u201360 minutes. Pull them out and let them cool. When you\u2019re ready to fry, cut the potatoes into chip-like wedges.\n\nBatter batter, hey BATTER! Batter up! Whisk the flour, beer and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl until smooth. Or as smooth as you can \u2013 don\u2019t worry if there are a couple of lumps.\n\nEmpty your tin of peas into a small saucepan. Add the butter and stir over a low heat on the hob (or indirect heat on the outdoor grill) for 10 minutes until mushy. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nMix all your tartare sauce ingredients together in a bowl and set aside, ready for the build.\n\nNow for the interesting part! Pour the oil into a large deep saucepan (or you can use a deep-fat fryer) \u2013 it needs to be about half-filled.\n\nSet it over a high heat and get that oil hot. Once the temperature reaches 350\u00b0F, you are good to fry.\n\nChuck some flour on a plate or chopping board and press your fish in it until it is lightly coated with flour. Now dip the fish into the batter so that it\u2019s completely covered. Pull it out and let the excess batter drip off, then carefully slip the battered fish into the hot oil.\n\nYield: Makes 4 burgers\n\nExcerpted from The Burger Book: Banging Burgers, Sides and Sauces to Cook Indoors and Out by DJ BBQ.
