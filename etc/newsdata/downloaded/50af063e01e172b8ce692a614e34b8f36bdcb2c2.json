Now the August play-off for the fourth-placed team in the top flight is likely to return.\n\nLars-Christer Olsson, the president of the European Leagues, said: \u201cI think some of the big leagues would be fine if they are all treated in the same way. If you are giving four positions to the Premier League and taking one away from the Bundesliga then you have a problem.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe big leagues are prepared to participate in this discussion for something new if they are treated the same.\u201d\n\nThis could also the historical co-efficient favouring top nations - which will see Chelsea bank \u00a327.9m this season \u2013 paid instead as \u201csolidarity payments\u201d to smaller nations.\n\n\u201cIt should be replaced by something else reflecting the current situation,\u201d Olsson added.\n\nThe changes are a reaction to proposals by the European Club Association which wants to see promotion and relegation in an expanded European league from 2024. This model guarantees European football for some clubs but is accused by Olsson of being a \u201cclosed shop\u201d.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBut Juventus president Andrea Agnelli told the Leaders in Sport Conference at Twickenham: \u201cWe will now have to tackle a shift in consumer behaviour. We\u2019re looking at generation Z, the new digital natives who are turning into adulthood.\n\n\"We should seriously start to think that the competitors of of the game today are not other sports, clubs next door or in the next countries but League of Legends, esports or Fortnite. I think those are going to be the ones who are going to be our competitors going forward.\n\n\u201cWe will find a way to agree to find a system that allows everybody to grow from within without being left aside because of a birth defect, because of where they were born.\u201d", "description": "The Premier League \u2013 along with Spain, Germany and Italy - has had four automatic places in Europe's top club competition since last season", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539341.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C1-LILLE-CHELSEA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
