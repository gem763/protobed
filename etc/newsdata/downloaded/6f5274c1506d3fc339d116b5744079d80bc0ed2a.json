Silva posted a follow-up tweet, saying: \u201cCan\u2019t even joke with a friend these days\u2026 You guys\u2026\u201d\n\nAnti-discriminatory body Kick It Out has called on the FA to take action, referring to the contents of the post as a racist stereotype.\n\nBoth Mendy and the character on the packet of chocolates are black. Conguitos are chocolate-covered nuts made in Spain.\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola has strongly defended Silva on two occasions this week, saying Friday that it was a \u201csimple joke\u201d between Silva and Mendy, who are close friends and also played together at Monaco, and that people would be \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to think the tweet had any racist undertones.\n\n\u201cIf someone is affected or feels bad for that tweet or any comment, it can happen,\u201d Guardiola said at a pre-match news conference that was dominated by questions about Silva. \u201cBut again I say to the people, the people who judge Bernardo don\u2019t know him.\n\n\u201cBernardo is an exceptional person, exceptional. He likes to be involved in different situations. Like I said, make a focus on other (racism) issues, not on Bernardo. Bernardo is absolutely not guilty because his intention was just a joke. It\u2019s a cartoon and related to the face, it\u2019s quite similar. Probably the same happened a thousand million times with white people, it\u2019s the same. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d\n\nOn the relationship between Mendy and Silva, Guardiola said: \u201cBenjamin is like a brother and Bernardo to Benji is like the same, so that is what I see every single day in the training session.\u201d\n\nGuardiola added that \u201cmaybe Bernardo is going to take a lesson and it is not going to happen again.\u201d\n\nBoth Mendy and Silva have played since the tweet in question was posted, in a 3-0 win over Preston in the English League Cup on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has written a letter to the English Football Association, expressing regret for any unintentional offense caused by a tweet he posted which compared teammate Benjamin Mendy to the character on a packet of Conguitos chocolates.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/britain_soccer_premier_league_80611_c0-280-3120-2099_s1770x1032.jpg?e0b23e5713d20284c02cee13dfa9d9361b84d8eb", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
