He takes playful pictures of people, animals, and objects overlapping in amusing ways. They look Photoshopped, or at least staged, but aren't. Buscta\u00f3 takes hundreds of attempts, and sometimes years, to snap the perfect shot. The results are like a good joke. As soon as you understand what's going on, you get butterflies.\n\nBuscat\u00f3 got his first serious camera in 2010, and almost immediately quit his nine-to-five to take photos full-time. He regularly spends seven hours a day walking the streets, and snaps his shutter 400 times in a regular session. These numbers are doubled when he\u2019s traveling to New York or India, or any other place that isn't home.\n\nHis process is based on his childhood playing with his brother and sister in a countryside village on Ibiza. \u201cOrdinary objects and simple ideas kept us busy for hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I do now is not so different from that, except that I do it on my own and with a camera in my hands. But I still get the same feeling of play, fooling around with the ordinary things I find.\u201d\n\nThese photos are fun by necessity. They require a disciplined practice of not being bored by people and places Buscat\u00f3 has seen a million times. \u201cOver-familiarity with our surroundings can blind us, so trying to keep fresh eyes and an open mind always helps,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a lesson anyone trapped in a place, job, or situation they find boring can learn from.\n\nThe secret is a combination of patience and recognizing that he\u2019s in the right place at the right time. \u201cSometimes photos just build up,\u201d he said. \u201cA simple element or person catches my attention, and I start to photograph it; then another element shows up, and I find a way to connect them. Other times everything happens so quick that it's just a matter of reaction.\u201d\n\nBuscat\u00f3 sells his photos on his website and is a member of the art collective Burn My Eye. He also makes money giving street photography intensives that can last up to 12 straight hours. Below, he\u2019s shared some of his favorite photos with us, along with the stories behind how he captured a couple of them.\n\n\"This one is a sequence of birds taken in Leicester Square, London. The photo shows painted birds, an imaginary one and a real one. I took this on July 2016, but I had already tried something similar in the same spot a year earlier. In 2015, I took some shots there trying to add a real pigeon (they were flying around) to the painted birds sequence. I more or less succeeded, but I found the result quite boring, so I just left and forgot about it. A year later, I was on another photo trip in London, and after four days in the city, I noticed the same fence with the painted birds, but didn't pay much attention to it. Some hours later I passed by and saw a detail that changed everything: There was a hole in the fabric that in my eyes looked like another bird. That's when I got obsessed and spent my last two days there, trying to get something. I tried many different things, and after several hundreds of failed attempts, I got that photo.\"\n\n\"This is a strange case. I found this photo while looking for an address on Google Street View.\"\n\n\"This one taken in Barcelona is a geometrical connection between some yellow lines in the road and a cane that a man is holding. They kind of create an arrow that on the right side comes out of another man's ear. I first noticed the yellow cane and started to photograph it. I followed the man holding it for some meters until he stopped at a crossing. That's when I saw the yellow lines, so I rose my camera to see if it was possible to connect them, and when I was doing that, the man on the right showed up and completed the photo on that side. I was lucky with some details like the clothes of both men being the same color, or the hand gesture of the man in the left, that balanced the frame in that corner.\"\n\nSee more of Pau Buscat\u00f3's work on his website.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nSend Beckett Mufson your favorite photographer\u2019s website on Twitter.", "description": "The street photographer Pau Buscat\u00f3\u200b spends seven hours a day searching for the funny moments that only happen when people are crammed together.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5acfca389746b8000ab68eaa/social_lede/1523888196512-crazyphotosplit1o2p4mrwqsf.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9995718032435904xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-04-13"}
