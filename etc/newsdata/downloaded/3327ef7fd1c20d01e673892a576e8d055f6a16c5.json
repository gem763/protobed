Phillip/AP Photo\n\nCentral to the Biden campaign\u2019s theory is the belief that, after the Feb. 29 primary in South Carolina, the now-sprawling Democratic field would be narrowed to just two candidates. And one of them \u2014 Biden \u2014 would be far better positioned to amass delegates on a primary date that offers a windfall of roughly 1,300.\n\nBy contrast, in the four early-state contests only 155 delegates are up for grabs.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, this will likely be a two-person race coming out of South Carolina, and whomever emerges from Super Tuesday with a significant delegate lead will be extremely difficult to catch,\u201d a senior Biden official said.\n\nUnder Democratic delegate selection rules, some congressional districts are allocated more delegates than others. For months, the campaign has zeroed in on the most delegate-rich congressional districts in Super Tuesday states like Texas, North Carolina, California and Alabama and attempted to assemble slates of supporters specific to those districts.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s majority-minority 1st Congressional District is one of them. In that district \u2014 where eight delegates are on the line, rather than the four or five that most other districts offer \u2014 Biden was recently endorsed by Congressman G.K. Butterfield.\n\nOver the next two weeks, Biden\u2019s campaign will expand on those efforts by building out a formal Super Tuesday apparatus, adding to its dedicated staffing in the Philadelphia headquarters and hiring state directors in some of the biggest and most delegate-rich states. Biden has traveled to nine Super Tuesday states in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe endorsement slates we\u2019ve rolled out are proof of the time and energy we\u2019ve put into these states to date,\u201d said Biden deputy campaign manager of states, Pete Kavanaugh. \u201cNo one has been able to release remotely close to what we have.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to detail the resources it\u2019s committing to Super Tuesday. Nor would they acknowledge that their strategy is geared toward Warren, who has surpassed Sen. Bernie Sanders in some recent national and state polls.\n\nBut they repeatedly stressed that Biden\u2019s advantage is with a \u201cbroad, diverse\u201d coalition of voters. Implicit is the idea that the South could be tough terrain for Warren and her liberal brand of politics.\n\nWhile the Massachusetts senator is broadening her base of support \u2014 including with African Americans \u2014 Biden still enjoys wide leads over her in South Carolina and Texas polls. According to the most recent Quinnipiac national poll, Biden had a 40%-19% lead among African-Americans.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, roughly 40% of all delegates will be at stake.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we believe Biden would surpass the 15 percent delegate threshold [to be awarded delegates] in nearly every congressional district across the country and in districts where only one or two candidates meet the threshold, Biden is the common denominator,\u201d said another Biden adviser.\n\nEarly-state success is central to Warren\u2019s strategy \u2014 she just announced a $10 million TV ad buy in the four early states. But she\u2019s also laying groundwork in Super Tuesday states, including hiring a state director in California, the biggest state voting March 3.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,\u201d Roger Lau, Warren\u2019s campaign manager, said in a recent public memo.\n\nWarren\u2019s camp contends that her decision to forgo high-dollar fundraisers and donor call-time means she has a greater ability to hold town halls and meet people face to face. The Massachusetts senator has visited 10 of the 14 states voting March 3 and senior staffers have had hundreds of conversations with activists and grassroots supporters in all Super Tuesday states, according to the campaign.\n\n\u201cEvery single day we organize across the country, and we will have an organized presence in every state and territory that holds a nominating contest,\u201d said Warren campaign spokesman Chris Hayden. \u201cWe're laying the groundwork to have a large movement of grassroots supporters that will own a piece of this campaign and be in the fight with us. This is a contest where every voice and vote matters and we will look to earn as many of those votes as we can when contests begin in February and end in June.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/0c/e81f17124c72a1e9e54ba6dc8758/20191002-joe-biden-speaks-ap-773.jpg"}
