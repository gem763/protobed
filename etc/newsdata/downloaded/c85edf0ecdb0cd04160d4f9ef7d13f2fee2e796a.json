REUTERS/Grant Lee Neuenburg/File Photo\n\nMAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique will continue to negotiate debt restructuring with creditors, despite a court ruling that a government-guaranteed $850 million Eurobond issued by the state fishing company Ematum SA in 2013 was illegal, the finance minister said on Wednesday.\n\nFinance Minister Adriano Maleiane told a business conference in Maputo that the debt restructuring talks were not in violation of the June ruling by Mozambique\u2019s top court.\n\nThe $850 million Eurobond was dubbed the \u201ctuna bond\u201d as it was supposed to finance a tuna fishing fleet and had been presented to investors as funding for fishing infrastructure, although much of the cash was later designated for maritime security and reallocated to the defence budget.\n\nIn 2016, Mozambican officials agreed to swap the tuna bond\u2019s outstanding $697 million for a sovereign Eurobond.\n\n\u201cThe government respects the deliberations of our institutions,\u201d Maleiane said. \u201cThe decision of the Constitutional Council is a decision that cannot be overturned. It has to be respected and we are respecting it.\u201d\n\nMaleiane said that the restructuring was meant to only repay lenders who acted in good faith.\n\n\u201cThe government cannot tell bona fide creditors that \u2018I will not pay back.\u2019 I can\u2019t tell the creditors that I am awaiting the payment of the money taken by those who contracted the loans,\u201d Maleiane said.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General Office has the task of pursuing the $850 million on those who acted in bad faith,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Monday the government said creditors holding 99.5% of Mozambique\u2019s $726.5 million Eurobond support its debt restructuring proposal, paving the way for an overhaul of part of its heavy debt burden.", "description": "Mozambique will continue to negotiate debt restructuring with creditors, despite a court ruling that a government-guaranteed $850 million Eurobond issued by the state fishing company Ematum SA in 2013 was illegal, the finance minister said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428762662&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1I3-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
