In December 1999 he launched Danger, creator of the Hiptop, a proto-smartphone, which was later bought by Microsoft. Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, moving to the firm. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google, before leaving on 30 October 2014 to start an incubator for hardware startups. Rubin and his wife, Rie, also own and operate Voyageur du Temps, a bakery in Los Altos, CA.\n\nThe idea would be to rely on voice commands and AI to autonomously complete tasks for its users instead of always trying to capture and hold their attention.\n\n'You can be off enjoying your life, having that dinner, without touching your phone, and you can trust your phone to do things on your behalf,' Rubin said in 2018.\n\nThe few photos and brief video of 'Project Gem' released so far focus on the unusual form factor more than the interface.\n\nThe images show a slick, metallic case made from colorshift material, which dramatically alters the hue of the phone depending on the angle you're viewing it on.\n\nThe screen can accommodate up to four apps as small stackable blocks, which appear to be operable both as small widgets and as expanded fullscreen interfaces.\n\nThe images show, Uber, a Calendar app, a Weather feed, and a Maps app, a music player, and a watch face, which can be combined in combinations of four.\n\nEssential's 'Project Gem' phone is made with colorshift material that alters the hue of the case depending on what angle it's seen from.\n\nEssential's first product, the Essential Phone, was released in 2017 for $699, and which featured a powerful camera.\n\nThe Essential Phone received generally positive reviews but was discontinued at the end of last year.\n\nThe company claimed it had sold out of its initial stock and rather than manufacture more it wanted to focus on future products.\n\nThe company is also working on a voice-controlled home assistant, called Essential Home.\n\nRubin was a controversial figure before he left Google, where it was reported he had a string of mistresses kept in what was described as 'an ownership relationship' and allegedly paid for by funds diverted from Google.", "description": "Android creator Andy Rubin is trying to change the landscape of the smartphone industry yet again with 'Project Gem,' an elongated new device meant to be usable at a glance.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19498560-0-image-a-8_1570635463491.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
