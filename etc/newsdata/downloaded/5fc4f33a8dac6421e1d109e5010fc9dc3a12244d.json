REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE rose 0.3%, with homebuilder Barratt (BDEV.L) jumping nearly 6% to top the gainers. The country's big banks Lloyds (LLOY.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Barclays (BARC.L) added more than 5%.\n\nThe mid-cap index .FTMC climbed 1.2% to a near one-year high, tracking gains in the local currency.\n\nA surge in the pound was triggered by a media report that Northern Ireland\u2019s largest political party had agreed to accept some European Union rules after Brexit.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was \u201cthe rough shape of a deal to be done\u201d over Brexit, as he prepared to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker next week in a renewed push to reach an agreement.\n\n\u201cSterling\u2019s breakout coincides with a breakout of optimism, albeit slight, that a thaw in the impasse between Brussels and London may be beginning,\u201d City Index analyst Ken Odeluga said.\n\nGains for the pound prompted a sell-off in exporter stocks including Diageo (DGE.L) and British American Tobacco (BATS.L), keeping a lid on FTSE 100\u2019s gains for the day.\n\nAn index of housebuilders .FTNMX3720, which are vulnerable to a hit to house prices in event of a disruptive no-dealcBrexit, rose 0.7% to its highest since late July.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange (LSE.L) gained 3.6% after it rejected a $39 billion takeover offer from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK) . The Asian bourse responded by saying it would continue engaging with LSE shareholders regarding the bid.\n\nThe FTSE 100 took home its third straight week of gains as hopes for more stimulus and signs of improvement in global trade relations have helped the index recover after suffering its biggest monthly fall this year in August.\n\nAdding fuel to the rally, Credit Suisse turned bullish on UK stocks, especially those with international exposure, as the chances of the country crashing out of the European Union fall and some equities look cheap compared with foreign counterparts.\n\nBroadcaster ITV (ITV.L) rose 5% after Liberum called SDN, its digital multiplex operator, a \u201chidden gem\u201d that could fetch up to 750 million pounds to 1 billion pounds if sold.\n\nWhile housebuilders were powering gains for the midcap index, gold miner Centamin (CEY.L) plunged 7% after downbeat production forecast.", "description": "UK stocks ended Friday on a high note as optimism that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided spurred a rally in stocks with domestic exposure, overpowering losses in blue-chip exporter stocks that were hit by a stronger sterling.", "authors": ["Yadarisa Shabong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429353901&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0IE", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
