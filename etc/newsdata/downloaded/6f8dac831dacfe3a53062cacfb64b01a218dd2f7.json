It was this trust, built up over more than three decades of cooperation, that led NRA leadership to give AMc the rope it ultimately used to hang the brand by \u201cstray[ing] from the Second Amendment to themes which some NRA leaders found distasteful and racist,\u201d according to the NRA\u2019s complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the NRA\u2019s attorneys are to be believed, AMc squandered both the organization\u2019s brand capital and much of its financial capital in the space of little more than two years.\n\nIn 2016, AMc executives convinced their NRA counterparts that digital-content production was the wave of the future, prompting CEO Wayne LaPierre to dramatically expand NRA News, which had focused almost exclusively on Second Amendment commentary, into NRATV, a digital-streaming platform featuring commentary on a wide variety of cultural and political issues. Later, over the course of 13 private meetings and phone calls, AMc\u2019s C-suite defended its pivot into digital media \u2014 which had clearly been an \u201cabject failure,\u201d according to the NRA \u2014 by citing misleading web-traffic metrics and inflated ad-revenue numbers.\n\nThe complaint reads:\n\nIn these closed-door meetings (which Ackerman insisted upon, ostensibly for reasons of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d),12 with Mr. LaPierre and sometimes others from the NRA leadership in attendance, Defendant Montgomery and others made purposely inflated sponsorship and viewership claims now known to be false in order to induce the NRA to continue investing millions upon millions in NRATV and, by extension, AMc. In each of the thirteen meetings listed in the above chart, Defendants led the NRA to believe that NRATV\u2019s viewership numbered in the millions and that Defendants were generating many millions of dollars in value for the NRA. They did so not with facts or evidence but through a carefully coordinated scheme to present misleading, out-of-context, and conjured-up statistics for the consumption of the NRA leadership.\n\nAMc, in its quest to justify NRATV\u2019s cannibalization of much of the NRA\u2019s overall advertising budget, chose to conceal the number of \u201cunique\u201d engagements with NRATV\u2019s content, depriving NRA executives of a key metric that is heavily relied upon to price advertisements and determine the overall value of a digital-media property. The advertising agency also allegedly inflated the importance of \u201clive\u201d content to the NRA brand\u2019s revenue structure because it is the most expensive type of content to produce, and therefore justified the project\u2019s budget, which ballooned from $12 million in 2016 to more than $20 million in its final year of operation, 2018.\n\nIn an effort to bolster traffic numbers its leaders knew were insufficient, AMc increasingly came to rely on content that NRA executives found \u201cdistasteful and racist,\u201d according to the complaint. By way of example, the complaint cites one segment in which NRATV host Dana Loesch \u2014 who, like all NRATV employees, technically worked for AMc \u2014 addresses the audience as an image of the children\u2019s television character Thomas the Tank Engine appears on the screen wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttempts by the NRA to \u2018rein in\u2019 AMc and its messaging were met with responses from AMc that ranged from evasive to hostile,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMc\u2019s attorneys filed a counterclaim on Monday in which they argue that NRA executives, including LaPierre, actively approved much of the NRATV content they now claim to despise \u2014 and even encouraged more inflammatory rhetoric.\n\n\u201cIn the span of two short years, the NRA, with LaPierre leading the charge, has destroyed or attempted to destroy what was built over decades. In doing so, it has caused massive personnel disruptions, enormous expenses, loss of economic opportunity, loss of profits and reputational harm that may be irreparable, or at least will take enormous time and effort to repair,\u201d reads the counterclaim, first reported by Vox.\n\nAMc\u2019s attorneys go on to argue that the allegations advanced in the NRA\u2019s claim are implausible given LaPierre\u2019s \u201cparanoid\u201d nature, which led him to require that he \u201csign off on every performance metric\u201d as well as NRATV\u2019s \u201cculture war\u201d editorial direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about AMC\u2019s response to the NRA\u2019s court filing, William A. Brewer III, the partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors who is counsel to the NRA in the case, argued that AMc is seeking to dodge the most serious allegation \u2014 that key performance metrics were withheld to conceal the enterprise\u2019s failure \u2014 by focusing on LaPierre\u2019s alleged character defects.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, the Ackerman filing is another hate-filled rant \u2013 fraught with false and misleading information,\u201d Brewer said in a statement to National Review.\n\nOnce again, Ackerman refuses to account for the claims and allegations against the agency \u2013 and instead opts to smear the NRA and its most senior officials. The agency clings to a desperate strategy, doubling down on its reputational attack against the senior leaders of its former client who determined to hold the agency accountable for its intentional wrongdoing. The NRA is eager to bring all the facts to light.\n\nAMc\u2019s focus on LaPierre is understandable given the less-than-flattering details about his tenure as CEO that have emerged since the legal battle began. Shortly before resigning as NRA president in April, Oliver North sent a letter to the group\u2019s board alleging that LaPierre spent more than $200,000 in NRA funds on clothing. LaPierre claimed in response that North\u2019s letter and his various other claims of impropriety amounted to a blackmail campaign, carried out on AMc\u2019s behalf, in order to force his departure and preserve AMc\u2019s lucrative relationship with the NRA.\n\nIn addition to its court battle with AMc, the NRA is fighting to retain its tax-exempt status in an ongoing lawsuit filed by the state of New York.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s amended complaint seeks $40 million in damages from AMc and demands that the ad agency stop using the NRA logo in its promotional materials.
