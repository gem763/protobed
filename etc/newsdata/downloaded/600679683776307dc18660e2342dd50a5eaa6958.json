At least 87 of the paratroopers were reportedly blown away from their drop zone and toward a large cluster of trees.\n\nBy early Thursday afternoon, officials said all 87 soldiers had been rescued and 18 needed medical attention, including one who underwent surgery for a broken back.\n\n\u201cWe had a few jumpers remaining that were so high in the trees that they required significant recovery support. Thankfully, a majority of the paratroopers were uninjured from their tree landings,\u201d Lt. Col. Matt Myer, commander of the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, said in a statement posted on Facebook. \u201cThe 18 paratroopers that required care will all recover. One soldier received a successful surgery for a broken back, and is expected to recover well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I have said before, service as a paratrooper requires a level of toughness that most do not understand,\u201d he continued. \u201cDespite the difficulty of this training jump, the battalion performed well and will recover well to continue our training mission.\u201d\n\nWednesday night\u2019s jump was part of a much larger training exercise known as Arctic Anvil. The exercise included more than 900 paratroopers and a heavy equipment drop.\n\nIt also represented the \u201clargest exercise that Camp Shelby has hosted in conjunction with an active-duty brigade combat team,\u201d Col. Bobby Ginn, Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center post commander said in a statement this week announcing the kickoff of the exercise.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
