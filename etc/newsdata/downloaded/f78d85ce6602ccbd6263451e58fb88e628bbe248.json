The app displays hotspots on a map of the city that is continuously updated as users report incidents, hence allowing protesters to avoid police.\n\nThe headline of the People\u2019s Daily commentary carried by its official microblog on Wednesday said: \u201cProtecting rioters \u2013 Has Apple thought clearly about this?\u201d\n\nIt went on to say: \u201cAllowing the \u2018poisonous\u2019 app to flourish is a betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\nSilver defends NBA employees' right to free speech as China cancels broadcasts Read more\n\nThe HKmap.live is reportedly the most downloaded app under the travel category in the iOS App Store for Hong Kong.\n\nWithout specifically naming the app, the People\u2019s Daily commentary said it allowed \u201cHong Kong rioters to openly commit crime while openly escaping arrests\u201d. It said Apple\u2019s approval of the app made it an \u201caccomplice\u201d in the protests because it \u201cblatantly protects and endorses the rioters\u201d. It questioned what the company\u2019s intentions were.\n\nIt also criticised Apple for allowing Glory to Hong Kong \u2013 an unofficial anthem frequently sung by protesters during the ongoing anti-government movement \u2013 to be available for download in the Apple music store.\n\nIn what appears to be a threat to its access to the vast market in China, the commentary said Apple\u2019s \u201cmixing of political, commercial and illegal activities\u201d is \u201cunwise\u201d and \u201cimprudent\u201d and would only \u201cdraw more turbulence\u201d for the company.\n\nApple is the latest foreign company to get into trouble with China over the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, now in their 18th week.\n\nHong Kong professional gamer banned from tournament over pro-democracy comments Read more\n\nApart from NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet showing support for protesters, Tiffany & Co has removed a tweet of an advertisement showing a model covering one eye, believed to be a deliberate gesture of solidarity with injured demonstrators. The company said the image was actually created in May, before the protests started.\n\nApple has not immediately responded to a request for a comment.", "description": "State media says \u2018poisonous\u2019 app made Apple an accomplice in the Hong Kong protests", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44d3d1246a91a0321518985b49e8582414452dc3/0_168_3991_2395/master/3991.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98edaeebd94be7670e66cad06a9ffd16", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
