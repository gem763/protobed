Tech blog 9to5Google recently got their hands on the device and it's a very interesting piece of kit. Here are the details.\n\nAs you can see from the photo above, the Pixelbook Go boasts a distinctive \"ribbed\" rear chassis that will come in a similar shade to the coral Pixel 4. The front lid, meanwhile, sports a more traditional smooth finish.\n\n\"Weird, but also good\" is how 9to5Google described the look and feel of the device. (Whether the 'good' outweighs the 'weird' will obviously come down to individual taste.)\n\nThe Pixelbook Go will reportedly come with a 13.3-inch touchscreen display. It will have a 16:9 aspect ratio and be capable of 4K video playback - but only if you plump for a higher-end version. This model will also sport an Intel i7 CPU with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, making it a solid workhorse for computing on the go.\n\nConnectivity includes two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack and an inbuilt webcam. You can find out more about the device in the video below.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go is expected to be officially unveiled during Google's big Pixel event on October 15. Pricing and Australian availability is not currently known.\n\n[Via 9to5Google]", "description": "Google is finally releasing a new Pixel laptop, dubbed the Pixelbook Go.
