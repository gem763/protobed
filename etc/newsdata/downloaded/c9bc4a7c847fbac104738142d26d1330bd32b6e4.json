But The New York Times reported Monday that U.S. intelligence officials now think Trump\u2019s stance has actually allowed Kim to \u201ctest missiles with greater range and maneuverability that could overwhelm American defenses in the region.\u201d\n\nThe development sparked anger on Twitter, where MSNBC political analyst Rick Tyler said it was \u201chard to know who deserves more credit: Kim for successfully completing tests of a rapidly-deployable solid-fuel rockets that threaten the region including American bases or POTUS for allowing it to happen.\u201d\n\nJoe Scarborough, the host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d tweeted it was \u201cshocking how easily Donald Trump got played by the most tyrannical communist leader in the world.\u201d\n\nHard to know who deserves more credit: Kim for successfully completing tests of a rapidly-deployable solid-fuel rockets that threaten the region including American bases or @potus \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069 for allowing it to happen. https://t.co/JMjimTvlde via \u2066@nytimes\u2069 \u2014 Rick Tyler (@rickwtyler) September 2, 2019\n\nIt is shocking how easily Donald Trump got played by the most tyrannical communist leader in the world. And just as stunning that Republicans across America have sat back and happily watched it happen.\n\nThe party of Reagan?\n\nNot even close. https://t.co/3Eu60IsgG2 \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) September 3, 2019\n\nBrilliant @SenateGOP @LindseyGrahamSC - Kim played Trump to buy more time for NK\u2019s development of better weapons that can now reach American bases and our allies. \u2014 Suzanne Lindbergh (@suzannebuzz) September 3, 2019\n\nTrump's desperation to maintain the fiction of 'friendship' with Kim Jong Un is becoming embarrassing now. I presume the point is to maintain the illusion of a foreign policy 'win' for the election. Kim is pretty clearly using that need to pressure Trump. https://t.co/5SeSsJydAO \u2014 Robert E Kelly (@Robert_E_Kelly) September 3, 2019\n\nN. Korean dictator #KimJongUn greases #Trump like a fry pan-makes an omelet of U-S defense policy. All things possible when the commander in chief in the #WhiteHouse isn't in command of strategic thinking. https://t.co/oqqdd2t5oM @nytimes \u2014 Charles Adler (@charlesadler) September 3, 2019\n\nThis is the most underestimated Trump story of this year. Kim has ridden Trump like a pony. #likeapony https://t.co/riuGGKRjud \u2014 JB Poersch (@jbpoersch) September 3, 2019\n\nTrump, of course, can\u2019t admit he\u2019s been played, so the beat will go on with Trump defending Kim again and again, even after Kim probably bombs a country. https://t.co/Dv1E7HwYZ2 \u2014 Robert Swartwood (@RobertSwartwood) September 3, 2019\n\nHow are we not freaking out?!
