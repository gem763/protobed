She beat Stefanie Voegele in straight sets in her opening match on Tuesday at the indoor tournament.\n\n\u201cI just want to continue to use these matches to improve. My dad told me he saw improvements even since the U.S. Open,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s all about matches for me, and getting more matches under my belt, as much as possible. I feel fresh and eager to do well.\u201d\n\nGauff had her major breakthrough at Wimbledon this year where she reached the fourth round, but had never won a tour-level match indoors before this week.\n\nTop-seeded Kiki Bertens advanced to the second round by beating Masaki Doi of Japan 6-4, 7-5, while No. 8 Ekaterina Alexandrova defeated Kristyna Pliskova 3-6, 6-0, 6-1.\n\nBertens next faces Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium and would play Gauff in the quarterfinals if she advances.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coco Gauff reached her first WTA quarterfinal when Kateryna Kozlova retired during the third set of their second-round match at the Upper Austria Ladies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
