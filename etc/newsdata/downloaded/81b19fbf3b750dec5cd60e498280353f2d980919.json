World powers said they needed to see definitive proof that the drones were launched from Iranian soil.\n\nMr. Trump did send a warning shot Tehran\u2019s way by saying the U.S. military is well-prepared to respond to the Saturday blitz on crucial Saudi oil assets, which tilted the Middle East further toward chaos.\n\n\u201cThat was a very large attack, and it could be met with an attack many, many times larger very easily by our country. But we\u2019re going to find out who definitively did it first,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a White House meeting with Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war.\u201d\n\nThe aerial attack hit the Saudis\u2019 main crude oil processing facility and forced the country to temporarily halt production of roughly 5.7 million barrels per day, or more than 5% of the world\u2019s crude output, sending oil prices soaring more than 10% Monday.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said in Turkey that the drone strikes were a \u201clegitimate defense and counterattack\u201d by the Houthis given what he called Saudi-led aggression.\n\n\u201cThis problem has its root in invading Yemen,\u201d said Mr. Rouhani, who was meeting in Ankara with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Saudi-led coalition is \u201cbombing Yemen on a daily basis,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.\n\nMr. Trump said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top officials will travel soon to Saudi Arabia as officials figure out whether Tehran was responsible. Mr. Trump made his first foreign trip as president to Riyadh and has boosted Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as his key Arab ally to contain regional rival Iran.\n\nSome administration aides, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, directly accused Iran of carrying out the attacks, but Mr. Trump war more circumspect in two sessions with White House reporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly looking that way, at this moment,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201cSoon, as we find out definitively, we\u2019ll let you know, but it does look that way.\u201d\n\nSatellite imagery\n\nU.S. officials have said that satellite imagery shows almost 20 points of impact consistent with the attack having come from the north \u2014 the direction of Iran or Iraq \u2014 rather than from Yemen on Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border. Iraqi officials, who talked with Mr. Pompeo this weekend, said they were assured the attacks did not emanate from inside their country, although pro-Iranian militias are a powerful force in the country.\n\nNBC News reported Monday that three unidentified U.S. officials said the drones originated in Iran and that at least one \u201ckey ally\u201d in the region was told of the intelligence conclusions.\n\nAlso Monday, the Saudis said Iranian weapons were used in the attacks. The Houthis, who have been supported by Iran diplomatically and militarily, have carried out drone attacks on Saudi targets, though the strike Saturday was far more sophisticated and destructive than any previous sortie.\n\n\u201cI think you won\u2019t be surprised to see who did it,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nIn the meantime, the oil markets were struggling to gauge the size of the disruption to production in one of the world\u2019s critical oil producers.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude prices gained nearly 20% in the first moments of trading Monday before settling down to over 10% higher as trading continued. A barrel of Brent traded up $6.45 to $66.67.\n\nThat spike represented the biggest percentage value jump in Brent crude since the run-up to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition expelled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces from Kuwait.\n\nU.S. benchmark West Texas crude climbed about 10%. Prices for U.S. gasoline and heating oil also rose.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said he welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to mitigate the impact if needed.\n\nSome Democrats, meanwhile, criticized Mr. Trump for a tweet over the weekend in which he said he was waiting for guidance from the Saudi government on how to proceed.\n\n\u201cTrump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters. Having our country act as Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitch is not \u2018America First,\u2019\u201d tweeted Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nMr. Trump said he didn\u2019t promise to protect the Saudis or make other guarantees. He also said the kingdom will have to accept the bulk of responsibility for any retaliation.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this, if we decide to do something,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be very much involved, and that includes payment. And they understand that fully.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said U.S. armed forces could play a key role.\n\n\u201cIran should not underestimate the United States\u2019 resolve. Any attack against U.S. forces deployed abroad must be met with an overwhelming response. No targets are off the table,\u201d said Sen. James E. Risch, Idaho Republican.\n\nMixed messages\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper walked a fine line in his statement, which accused Iran of trying to \u201cundermine\u201d the international order and pledged support for the Saudi military without directly accusing Tehran of carrying out the drone strike.\n\nThe statement was a sign of the administration\u2019s struggles with coordinating a single message and determining exactly what happened. The difficulty was heightened last week by the ouster of National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, a noted hawk on Iran.\n\nEarlier Monday, Mr. Perry told reporters in Austria that the U.S. \u201cwholeheartedly condemns Iran\u2019s attack on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and we call on other nations to do the same. \u2026 It is unacceptable, and they must be held responsible.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo likewise pointed to Iran. Soon after the attacks, he tweeted: \u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a top aide to Vice President Mike Pence said Mr. Trump\u2019s widely cited tweet this weekend that the U.S. military was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond to the Saudi attack should not be taken literally.\n\nThe president\u2019s language is \u201ca reflection\u201d that his administration is advancing policies that protect the U.S. \u201cfrom these sorts of oil shots,\u201d Marc Short told reporters at the White House on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI think that \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 is a broad term that talks about the realities that\u201d the U.S. is \u201csafer and more secure domestically from energy independence,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year has been marked by rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, including seized oil tankers, fights over airspace and Iran\u2019s downing of an American drone that nearly sparked a U.S. military strike in response.\n\n\u201cRemember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their \u2018airspace\u2019 when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. \u201cNow they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nEven so, Mr. Trump muddied the picture Monday by insisting he was still open to dialogue with Mr. Rouhani, even as he talks tough and applies \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran.\n\nThe U.S. is reapplying crippling economic sanctions after Mr. Trump last year withdrew from the international 2015 nuclear pact with Iran, and Iranian officials Monday said flatly that a rumored meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York next week was off the table as long as the sanctions remain in place.\n\nMr. Trump, however, said diplomacy is \u201cnever exhausted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they want to make a deal,\u201d he said of Iran, whose economy has suffered mightily from the U.S. pressure campaign. \u201cAt some point, it will work out.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
