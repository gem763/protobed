Farmer Wants a Wife was previously on Nine, publisher of The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\"Look at something like Big Brother and it's a global phenomenon, it's one of the last mega brands. That show alone will change the demographic profile of our network overnight,\" Mr Warburton siad.\n\n\"I think there's some power in those brands and there's power in reinventing some of our tentpoles.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew dramas for next year will also include RDFS, starring Justine Clarke, Rob Collins and Stephen Peacock, which is based around the personal lives of workers in the Royal Flying Doctor Service, as well as Between Two Worlds, from A Place to Call Home creator, Bevan Lee.\n\nMany of Seven's new shows have been commissioned from outside production studios, something it had done much less of in recent years as it focused on its own Seven Studios business. Seven's new line up includes shows from Fremantle, Endemol Shine, Screentime and Eureka.\n\n\"The execution of our content-led growth strategy means Seven is delivering 52 weeks of premium content backed by a 30 per cent increase in investment into our tentpole programs and franchises,\" Mr Warburton said.\n\n\"Combined with our unmatched sport and news offerings, we will deliver exponential impact for Seven\u2019s partners in 2020.\"\n\nIt's been a busy week for Seven. On Friday, the network announced a merger with Prime and the sale of its Western Australia radio business to Southern Cross Austereo for $28 million. On Monday, it finalised the $40 million sale of Pacific Magazines to Bauer Media.\n\nThe sales and all-scrip offer for Prime, which carries little debt and is forecast to make up to $25 million in EBITDA this financial year, will allow Seven to pay down its significant debt and improve its leverage ratio.", "description": "Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton is shaking up the network's prime time offering in a push to provide more quality content.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2697%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_101%2C$y_57/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/154ae47084c34d5dc5c4bd2f87c0f07596d79879", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
