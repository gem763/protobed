But Decker was not about to take his rejection lying down, and authorities say that the man began threatening the farms. At one point, police say Decker placed homemade metal spikes in driveways to damage tires on farm vehicles.\n\nSome of the farm employees reported finding damaged tires from the spike devices.\n\nIn one message, Decker allegedly threatened to beat one of the farmer\u2019s wives unless he was given access to the animals.\n\nDecker was arrested on October 3 after police searched his home. The search turned up a homemade .22 -caliber gun, arrows with explosives attached to them, and more of the improvised metal spike devices.\n\nProsecutors suggested that Decker should be held in jail due to \u201ca pattern of unlawful conduct that presents a danger to the community.\u201d\n\nThe suspect is being held without bail, and will appear in court next in November.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "A New Jersey man has been arrested and charged with threatening several farmers who told him he could not have sex with their animals.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/richard-decker-animal-sex-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
