It is alleged that the sisters refused to put their luggage in the overhead bin for the Brisbane-bound flight, according to The Courier Mail.\n\nThe Veronicas were allegedly escorted off the flight after a fight broke out between the \u2018Untouched\u2019 sisters and cabin crew. If you\u2019ve ever caught a flight, you\u2019d know that you legally need to comply with cabin crew\u2019s instructions at all times. This is usually for safety reasons, but if you\u2019re being argumentative, you\u2019re likely going to get booted off your flight.\n\nAccording to a passenger on the flight, the pair were \u201cbeing obstructive and not following instructions\u201d before the Feds were apparently called. The passenger, who wanted to be known as Greg, told The Courier Mail that fellow travellers and staff were growing impatient with the pair.\n\n\u201cThey were just in a belligerent, \u2018I-refuse-to-do-what-I\u2019m-told-because-I\u2019m-important\u2019 load of rubbish,\u201d Greg said.\n\nGreg, who humble-bragged that he was flying business class (I am jealous of Greg), claimed that the cabin crew were openly discussing their options, and whether they were going to remove the sisters from the flight.\n\nAnother passenger snapped a photo of what looks to be the sisters being escorted out by the Feds.\n\nAccording to Greg\u2019s allegations on Facebook, the sisters filmed the ordeal and were rude to staff and the Australian Federal Police before being labelled a \u201csecurity risk\u201d and removed from the flight.\n\n\u201cThey got marched out, and one of (the sisters) was filming the whole thing,\u201d Greg said.\n\nThe Veronicas haven\u2019t released an official statement, but they did comment on a fellow passenger\u2019s Instagram post, trying to explain the \u201ccrazy\u201d situation. Honestly, it looks like a big ol\u2019 misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cWe actually already had our bag up in the overhead. The female flight attendant wanted Lisa\u2019s bag spun around. Lisa asked the attendant if she could help assist her, because she couldn\u2019t reach it (we\u2019re only 5\u201d1). The attendant said it was against company policy. And a lovely man behind us helped instead,\u201d Jess said on the shared account. \u201cThen right before take off, the flight attendant bought over the manger and pointed us out. He proceeded to lecture us about company policy.\u201d\n\nThe sisters claimed that it was all a big misunderstanding and the girls were just confused about what was actually happening, which is why they started filming.\n\n\u201cWe were so confused as to why asking for their names resulted in us being removed by 3 federal police,\u201d they said on Instagram. \u201cSuch an upsetting and embarrassing experience. We still can\u2019t believe this happened, and that the flight was delayed for so long when we had no idea what was happening.\u201d\n\nQantas has released a statement confirming that two people on flight QF516 were removed from the flight. QF516 was a Sydney-Brisbane flight that was scheduled to leave at 10am on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAfter boarding, two passengers refused to follow crew instructions and were offloaded,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe flight eventually departed after a 40-minute delay, and the sisters were allegedly able to fly to Brisbane on a later flight on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are still in shock and so upset,\u201d the pair said.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Sony Music for comment and will update you with their response.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1154929044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
