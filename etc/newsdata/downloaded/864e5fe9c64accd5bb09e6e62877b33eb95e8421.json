That obviously didn't happen but the streaming data, released by StreamElements, is showing another interesting aspect to the battle over game streaming.\n\nThe Q3 State of the Stream Report, prepared by StreamElements, shows Twitch's hourly viewership has actually increased by three per cent since the year's second quarter. Twitch's views still take up about 75 per cent of the market when compared to Mixer, YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming.\n\nImage: StreamElements\n\nNinja's announcement came at the start of August, which saw Mixer nab a small spike in hours viewed but by September, it was down again. That month was rough on all streaming sites with them all down apart from Facebook Gaming, a strange unicorn in the mix with a 41 per cent spike.\n\nOf course, these numbers don't tell you the full story. That small spike on Mixer could have been a coincidence, but the report suggests while Ninja was likely responsible for the mini bump, it's the increase to the platform's awareness, a less tangible impact, that was most valuable.\n\nThe report also pointed out Fornite's slow decline from the streaming behemoth it's been over the past few years.\n\nImage: StreamElements\n\nStreaming hours don't necessarily translate to overall players, or playing hours, but it shows other games, such as Minecraft and World of Warcraft, experienced growth of more than 100 per cent between the quarters while others, like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto V, faced declines of more than 20 per cent.\n\nThe numbers are nothing majorly surprising. Games naturally wane in popularity, like PUBG before Fortnite, but it's definitely interesting to see it reflected in stats. Now it's time to wait and see who the next unicorn in gaming will be.", "description": "When Ninja announced he was leaving Twitch for Microsoft's Mixer, everyone waited with bated breath to see if Twitch would crumble into oblivion with the loss of one of its biggest stars.
