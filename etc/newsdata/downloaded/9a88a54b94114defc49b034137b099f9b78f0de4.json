Citizens of the former British protectorate have enjoyed special privileges and rights not afforded to mainland Chinese citizens since the United Kingdom returned sovereignty over the region to China on July 1, 1997.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s decision last week to accommodate the Chinese government by taking down HKMaps is deeply concerning,\u201d the authors of the letter wrote. \u201cWe urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nApple has long positioned itself as a defender of human rights (including privacy and free speech)\u2026 in the United States. Abroad, the company\u2019s record is not quite as spotless, especially when it comes to pressure from China, which is one of the company\u2019s largest markets outside of the U.S.\n\nBack in 2017, Apple capitulated to a request from the Chinese government that it remove all virtual private networking apps from the App Store. Those applications allowed Chinese users to circumvent the \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d of China, which limits access to information to only that which is approved by the Chinese government and its censors.\n\nOver 1,100 applications have been taken down by Apple at the request of the Chinese government, according to the organization GreatFire (whose data was cited in the Congressional letter). They include VPNs, and applications made for oppressed communities inside China\u2019s borders (like Uighurs and Tibetans).\n\nApple isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s come under fire from the Chinese government as part of their overall response to the unrest in Hong Kong. The National Basketball Association and the gaming company Blizzard have had their own run-ins resulting in self-censorship as a result of various public positions from employees or individuals affiliated with the sports franchises or gaming communities these companies represent.\n\nHowever, Apple is the largest of these companies, and therefore the biggest target. The company\u2019s stance indicates a willingness to accede to pressure in markets that it considers strategically important no matter how it positions itself at home.\n\nThe question is what will happen should regulators in the U.S. stop writing letters and start making legislative demands of their own.", "description": "In a rare instance of bipartisanship overcoming the rancorous discord that\u2019s been the hallmark of the U.S. Congress, senators and sepresentatives issued a scathing rebuke to Apple for its decision to take down an app at the request of the Chinese government.
