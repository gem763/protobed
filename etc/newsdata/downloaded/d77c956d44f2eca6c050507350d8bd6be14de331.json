They were instrumental in shaping public understanding of the Constitution before it was ratified in 1788, and they are still regularly cited today by courts and scholars seeking to understand the meaning of the Constitution\u2019s text.\n\nThe 10th essay in the series of 85, commonly referred to as Federalist 10, may be the best known. Despite its age, Federalist 10 remains relevant today. In fact, its lessons are especially important in this time of heightened political partisanship where social media gives the loudest opinions a power and prominence that is disproportionate, at times, to the number of people who hold them.\n\nIn Federalist 10, James Madison discussed the problems that factions pose to a republic. Factions, he explained, are groups \u201cunited and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\u201d Factions are a problem when they obtain political power because they put their interests above the common good.\n\nMadison acknowledged that \u201cthe public good is often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.\u201d In plainer terms, a faction that comprises a majority of the people may trample the rights of minorities in pursuit of its specific priorities.\n\nWhat is Madison\u2019s remedy to this problem? A properly structured republican form of government. Specifically, one in which representatives calm the passions of factions and behave like long-term stewards of the health of the country. Madison explained that representatives should \u201crefine\u201d public opinion because their \u201cwisdom may best discern the true interest of their country,\u201d and their \u201cpatriotism and love of justice, will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations.\u201d\n\nMost people probably don\u2019t think of Congress today as a bastion of wisdom, reason and justice, or that most of its members are genuine statesmen, putting the interest of the country over their own.\n\nThe problem today is that many representatives have allowed themselves to be captured by factions, and they seem more interested in advancing those factions\u2019 agendas \u2014 most likely because they believe it is in their personal interests to do so \u2014 than working towards the good of the entire nation.\n\nBut unlike the factions Madison describes in Federalist 10, today\u2019s factions are not tyrannical majorities but tyrannical minorities who shout with voices louder than their numbers would suggest. Still, they wield political power and frequently use that power to advance what is often a narrow, self-centered crusade.\n\nWorse, they are regularly assisted by politicians eager to create division by engaging in identity politics, threatening the independence of the judiciary, and proposing unconstitutional policies in order to pander to particular interest groups.\n\nIs it naive to ask what happened to Madison\u2019s wise and just representatives? Perhaps a little. There has always been bitter \u2014 let\u2019s be charitable and say passionate \u2014 partisanship throughout our history. But ideals provide us a target to strive for.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, representatives have historically (with notable exceptions) agreed that, like the Marquess of Queensberry rules, the Constitution sets certain rules of engagement.\n\nBut the modern moment is unique in that our constitutional form of government is itself under attack. The Constitution\u2019s constraints are often seen as a barrier to factions\u2019 policy aims rather than the bulwark against tyranny that they are.\n\nMadison called on representatives to \u201crefine and enlarge\u201d the views of their constituents so that \u201cthe public voice \u2026 will be more consonant with the public good.\u201d We wish more of today\u2019s politicians would do so.\n\nUltimately, we have no quick fix to restore Congress to Madison\u2019s ideal, only the following admonition: Our republican form of government requires self-restraint and representatives who will, above all else, remember that they are not mere advocates for the loudest or wealthiest of their constituents, but rather, stewards of a great but delicate constitutional experiment.\n\n\u2022 GianCarlo Canaparo is a legal fellow, and Kaitlynn Samalis-Aldrich is a researcher, in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies (heritage.org).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
