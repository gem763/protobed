Also known as Yankee Swap, Pollyanna, Secret Santa, and a dozen other names, the goal is to entertain guests and gift receivers, rather than actually get valuable gifts. Upon arrival, everyone places their wrapped gifts in the middle, and each guests pulls a number. Going in order, someone picks a gift. After the first person, each additional guest can either steal someone else\u2019s gift, or choose to unwrap another item from the middle. In the end, even if you don\u2019t end up with what you want, it\u2019s a a low-pressure gift exchange that is entertaining for everyone.\n\nBut the quest to find a perfect white elephant gift that will appeal to everyone at the exchange (or, at least, the majority) can be a challenge, and adding a budget can make it even more difficult. From the tech-obsessed folks to the weird-food fans, weird-food fans to the kids at heart, we found the best white elephant gifts \u2014 all under $25 \u2014 that you\u2019re family or friends would love to unwrap at your holiday party...or even to steal for themselves.
