GM had been awaiting a response to its latest offer made Monday, which a person familiar with the matter said included $9 billion of total investment in U.S. plants, about $2 billion more than the carmaker vowed to make in mid-September.\n\nAnalysts say the strike has cost GM more than $1 billion of lost profit. The automaker\u2019s senior executives appealed to rank-and-file employees late this week, portraying UAW leadership as dragging their feet in responding to its proposals.\n\n\u201cWe object to having bargaining placed on hold,\u201d Scott Sandefur, GM\u2019s vice president of North American labor relations, wrote to Dittes late Thursday in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. \u201cAs we have urged repeatedly, we should engage in bargaining over all issues around-the-clock to get an agreement.\u201d\n\nThe public war of words escalated midday Friday, with the UAW issuing an open letter accusing GM of stalling negotiations to \u201cstarve UAW-GM workers off the picket lines\u201d and protect its own interests. The union said its negotiators remain committed to bargaining day-and-night to find an agreement.\n\n\u201cThese delaying tactics have human costs. Families are suffering, from Detroit to Texas to New York,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis strike has been and continues to be about securing the American workers\u2019 future.\u201d\n\nShowing Frustration\n\nThe UAW\u2019s walkout has halted production at 34 U.S. plants and disrupted output at factories in Mexico and Canada. While GM publicly released details of its first formal offer to the union on Sept. 15 -- the day the UAW called the strike -- the company had until this week kept a lid on public criticism of union leaders, who themselves are dealing with a credibility crisis.\n\nGM was upping the pressure on UAW brass Friday in a bid to clinch an agreement before the strike enters a fifth week.\n\n\u201cGM is frustrated with the pace of negotiations,\u201d said Art Schwartz, a former GM labor negotiator who\u2019s now a consultant in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cThey gave the union a comprehensive offer on Monday, and it\u2019s Friday and they haven\u2019t had a response yet. If I had members out on strike, I would be responding within hours.\u201d\n\nGM shares rose 2.6% on Friday, paring their decline since the strike began to 8.5%. While credit-rating companies initially warned of risk to the automaker if the walkout lasted more than a couple weeks, they\u2019ve been reluctant to downgrade.\n\n\u201cGM has adequate liquidity to contend with a strike of this duration,\u201d Bruce Clark, lead U.S. auto analyst for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, wrote in a report Friday. The carmaker would start to forgo significant earnings if the walkout extends into late November, he said.\n\nEarlier Friday, GM released a broad outline of the offer made at the beginning of the week, saying it would boost wages and lump-sum payments while also preserving health care benefits. Gerald Johnson, GM\u2019s executive vice president of manufacturing, wrote to employees the automaker was prepared to enhance profit-sharing, including by lifting the cap on how much is paid out based on the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nUAW members also would receive bigger ratification bonuses than in 2015, when each worker was paid an $8,000 signing bonus. And the offer gives temporary workers a clear path to permanent status, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThe strike has been hard on you, your families, our communities, the company, our suppliers and dealers,\u201d Johnson wrote to employees. \u201cWe have advised the Union that it\u2019s critical that we get back to producing quality vehicles for our customers.\u201d\n\nSecurity Concern\n\nThe investment offer from GM was aimed at sewing up one of the union\u2019s major remaining concerns -- that underused plants could end up being idled or closed during the life of the agreement. UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in two letters this week that the union wanted the company to offer more job security.\n\nGM\u2019s initial formal offer made in mid-September included plans to build electric trucks at a plant in Detroit, which is scheduled to run out of work in January, and to construct a battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where the company has idled a compact car plant. Those two investments remain parts of GM\u2019s plans, the person said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The United Auto Workers made a counter proposal to General Motors Co. late Friday that would end a nearly month-long strike if the automaker agrees, capping a tumultuous day in which the union and company traded barbs and blame.UAW Vice President Terry Dittes offered no specifics on the", "authors": ["David Welch", "Keith Naughton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
