The operation resulted in the seizure of 1,000 phones that the FBI said were being used to facilitate murders and drug smuggling.\n\nThe documents seen by CBC News say the FBI investigation discovered in 2018 that a person was sending emails to Vincent Ramos, the CEO of Phantom Secure Communications, offering to provide valuable information.\n\nThe documents allege that person was Ortis.\n\n\"You don't know me. I have information that I am confident you will find very valuable,\" one email contained in the documents said.\n\nA subsequent email promised to provide \"intel about your associates and individuals using their network internationally.\"\n\nCharges under the Security of Information Act\n\nOver his career, Ortis had some of the highest access to classified and allied information within the RCMP. Sources familiar with his work said he would have had knowledge of code words and operations.\n\nOrtis was charged under a section of the Security of Information Act that applies to individuals \"permanently bound to secrecy\" as a condition of their work.\n\nOne of the charges stems from 2015, while the others span a year, going back to September of 2018.\n\nOrtis made a brief court appearance last Friday. He remains in custody with a bail hearing set for this Friday.", "description": "The cache of classified intelligence material an RCMP official was allegedly preparing to share with a foreign entity or terrorist organization is so vital to Canada's national security\u00a0that the country's intelligence agencies say its misuse strikes at the heart of Canada's sovereignty and security, documents seen by CBC News reveal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283250.1568687117!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cameron-ortis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
