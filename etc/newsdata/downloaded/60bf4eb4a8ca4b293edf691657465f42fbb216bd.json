Photo: Gabriella Demczuk/Getty Images\n\nWe now have more information on how the New York Times published a messy excerpt of Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly\u2019s The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, with a very messy accompanying tweet.\n\nTo recap what was messy about it all: Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book contains powerful new information, including a newly public allegation of sexual misconduct that echoes those against Kavanaugh by Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, and details about how this story and statements from other witnesses were not thoroughly investigated by the FBI.\n\nHowever, the excerpt in the Times was framed as a long feature about Ramirez and Yale rather than as a news story; it did not name the person, Tracy Harmon Joyce, to whom Kavanaugh also once exposed himself according to fellow Yale classmate Max Stier; and it did not say that Harmon Joyce will not discuss Stier\u2019s account, and that her friends say she does not remember it.\n\nThose critical of Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination were upset that this packaging both diminished the potency of the information in the article, as well as gave ammunition to conservatives, who accused the Times of engaging in partisan smearing. Their ire was only stoked by the accompanying Times tweet of the story, which began, bizarrely, \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun \u2026 \u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s what we learned from a Times Q&A with editor James Dao, published yesterday in response to the backlash: Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book excerpt was subject to \u201cthe same review process as outside writers,\u201d who decide what section excerpts should run in. He said it is \u201cnot unusual\u201d for those that appear in the Sunday Review, part of the Opinion section, to break news. The story was framed around Ramirez and Yale because the book \u201cexplores in a nuanced way the social and cultural forces that shaped Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d And as for the tweet, the Times \u201cprocess for writing and editing social media copy\u201d was not followed properly.\n\nDao didn\u2019t address removing Harmon Joyce\u2019s name and the fact that she doesn\u2019t back up Stier\u2019s story. But authors Pogrebin and Kelly confirmed that it was indeed taken out of their draft in an appearance last night on MSNBC. Pogrebin offered an explanation that was pragmatic rather than nefarious: \u201cI think what happened actually was that we had her name and, you know, the Times doesn\u2019t usually include the name of the victim,\u201d she said. \u201cSo think in this case the editors felt it was better to remove it, and in removing her name they removed the other reference to the fact that she didn\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\nOutside news outlets have also reported on what went down. Vanity Fair wrote that sources say \u201cKelly and Pogrebin initially pitched their scoop to the news side, but the top editors ultimately felt that there wasn\u2019t enough juice to warrant a story there, let alone a big page-one treatment.\u201d Politico claims that Pogrebin wrote the offensive tweet herself.\n\nRegardless of what happened, we can be sure that this isn\u2019t the end of the fallout: Representative Ayanna Pressley is reportedly introducing an impeachment resolution against Brett Kavanaugh today.\n\nStay in touch.
