They also cited its potential for disinformation campaigns and possible censorship of \u201cmaterials deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d (Bloomberg)\n\nTalking point: This is the second official complaint against ByteDance, the platform\u2019s parent company, on national security grounds in the U.S. Last week, Republican Senator Marco Rubio accused the company of censoring material in line with CCP directives, a claim ByteDance has denied in the past. The senators also join a growing international chorus of regulators who\u2019ve challenged TikTok\u2019s presence in their home markets on a variety of other fronts. Indian regulators have argued that the platform promotes pornography and political discord; Indonesian officials have made similar arguments, and brief bans have occured in both countries. Meanwhile, a third-party data firm said TikTok had a four per cent decline in global user downloads in the third quarter\u2014the first drop since its launch two years ago.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
