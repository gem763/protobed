And even as he claimed a significant national security victory on Sunday, the outcome of the raid did little to quell doubts about the wisdom of his push to reduce the United States military presence in Syria at a time when terrorist threats continue to develop in the region\u2026\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s approach to the region has never been consistent, but he has struck consistent themes. The first is that the United States does not need to keep forces in the region to reach out and kill its enemies. The high price of occupation, rebuilding and vacuum-filling, he suggests, can be paid by allies, or by Russians, Turks and even the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad\u2026\n\nBut the story of Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise is more complex. He was living in territory that was essentially ungoverned space, dominated by two different Qaeda groups \u2014 Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s rivals \u2014 and now an emerging territory for ISIS fighters on the run.
