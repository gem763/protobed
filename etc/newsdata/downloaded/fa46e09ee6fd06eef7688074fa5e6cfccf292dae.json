However, while the British economy also contracted in the second quarter, by 0.2 per cent, it is expected to have returned to growth in the third quarter, staving off recession.\n\nThe performance of the British economy since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 has made a mockery of claims by Remainers that a Leave vote would tip the UK into recession and lead to as many as 820,000 job losses.\n\nComposite PMI readings from September (IHS Markit) pointed to a significant recession risk\n\nInstead, employment has risen by 946,000 since the vote, and unemployment is below 4 per cent at levels not seen since the 1970s.\n\nBut with cracks emerging in the global economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned of a 'synchronised slowdown' around the world, underlining that countries face deeper problems than Brexit.\n\nThe IMF has cut its global growth forecast for this year to 3 per cent down from 3.6 per cent last year and the weakest since the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nDespite warnings over the impact of Brexit, Britain is expected to grow faster than Germany, France and Italy in 2019 and 2020.\n\nFormer IMF boss Christine Lagarde, who is taking over as head of the European Central Bank, said Brexit would cause damage across Europe.\n\n'Everybody will be a little less well-off as result,' she said.", "description": "In a major setback for Chancellor Angela Merkel and the wider eurozone, the Bundesbank said the German economy contracted again in the third quarter of the year.", "authors": ["Hugo Duncan For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
