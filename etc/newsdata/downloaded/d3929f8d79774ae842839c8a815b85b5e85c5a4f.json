The president announced Saturday the White House would find a new location for the summit following criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\"It would have been the best G-7 ever,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Emoluments Clause prohibits elected federal officials from receiving gifts or contributions from foreign governments.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the presidency has cost him billions of dollars.\n\nDemocrats have long alleged that Trump has used the presidency to bolster his business empire, citing frequent stays by administration officials and foreign representatives at Trump branded properties.\n\nA lawsuit filed by congressional Democrats alleging Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause is working its way through the court system.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW\n\nThe Brookings Institution hosts an event entitled \"How millennials think differently about climate change and national debt: Lessons for policymakers,\" 9 a.m.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing entitled \"The End of Affordable Housing?

Shelby and I said should be done.\"\n\nThe takeaway: This bodes well for Republicans, who have teed up two packages of spending bills for the floor this week.\n\nThe second package that Republicans want to move this week would include defense spending.\n\nBut Schumer indicated on Monday that there were several appropriations bills, including defense, that Democrats would not support.\n\nWarren unveils education plan quadrupling federal funding for public schools: Sen.

Neal has not yet requested Trump's state tax returns, and has been more focused on trying to obtain the president's federal tax returns. The Democrats' filing states that the Ways and Means Committee hasn't yet decided whether or not it will request Trump's state tax returns.\n\nThe Hill's Naomi Jagoda has the latest in the court fight.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to consider a bill on Wednesday that would impose a tax on the nicotine used in vaping, Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) announced Monday.\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Monday and welcome back to On The Money.
