But the reality on the ground tells a different story.\n\nWithout electricity the marquee of the Orinda Theatre is dark as the sun begins to set in Orinda, Calif.. (Jose Carlos Fajardo/East Bay Times via AP)\n\nDemocrats like to point to California\u2019s thriving economy \u2014 now the fifth largest in the world, when ranked as an independent country \u2014 as evidence that progressive policies can achieve prosperity. But the reality on the ground tells a different story.\n\nYes, California finally has a balanced budget \u2014 if you ignore the billions in outstanding pension obligations. But its fiscal health is largely in the hands of tech billionaires willing to accept a burdensome tax and regulatory climate in exchange for the state\u2019s weather and natural wonders. Meanwhile, housing continues to be unattainable for most, small-business owners are increasingly frustrated with Sacramento mandates, more legal residents are fleeing than arriving and parts of San Francisco have become dangerous cesspools of homelessness, panhandling and drug use.\n\nBut it gets worse. California officials now can\u2019t keep the lights on.\n\nIn recent days, the state\u2019s largest power company \u2014 Pacific Gas &Electric \u2014 has intentionally cut electricity to almost 800,000 customers, mostly in the northern part of the state, to limit the potential for wildfires. The move comes after the company sought bankruptcy protection in January as it faced more than $30 billion in liability related for wildfires, including a blaze last year that killed at least 100 people.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom lashed out at PG&E last week, blaming \u201cgreed and mismanagement\u201d for the blackouts. Never mind that state regulators approved the lights-out tactic earlier this year. The governor also conveniently neglected to mention the culpability of progressive public policy.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal noted last week that the utility has long \u201cskimped on safety upgrades and repairs while pumping billions into green energy and electric-car subsidies to please its overlords in Sacramento. Credit Suisse has estimated that long-term contracts with renewable developers cost the utility $2.2 billion annually more than current market power rates.\u201d\n\nFormer California Assemblyman Chuck Devore echoed the idea that political decisions \u2014 many designed to kowtow to the environmental lobby \u2014 have triggered and exacerbated the current problem.\n\n\u201cWildfires in recent years have grown more deadly because timber harvesting and brush clearing were greatly curtailed due to myriad environmental restrictions,\u201d he wrote last week for The Federalist. \u201cIn the meantime, crucial infrastructure investment targeted at improving the reliability and safety of power lines has taken the backseat to the state\u2019s demands for a huge increase in renewable energy.\u201d\n\nCalifornians are understandably frustrated and angry. \u201cI would consider leaving the state if this keeps going on,\u201d one longtime resident told the Journal.\n\nAn old joke asks the last person to flee California to please switch off the lights. Turns out that might be unnecessary.", "description": "Democrats like to point to California\u2019s thriving economy as evidence that progressive policies can achieve prosperity.
