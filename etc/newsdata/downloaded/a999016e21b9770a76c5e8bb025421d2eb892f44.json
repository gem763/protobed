It's what he does.\n\nThe eccentric rapper shot this video, with his lawyer watching and listening, and adamantly denies doing anything illegal with women. He could have stopped there but, instead, he bragged about his sexual exploits.\n\nAs Riff puts it ... \"Never once have I ever had to drag a girl to the car, never once have I ever had to drag a girl to a hotel, up flights of steps, to have sex with a dead starfish in my room.\"\n\nThe rapper's Australia and New Zealand tour was canceled 2 weeks ago after he was accused of drugging and raping a Melbourne woman at one of his shows in 2013. Another woman then came forward and accused him of sexual misconduct when she was a minor in 2015.\n\nRiff started to tell us he's just like his heroes -- Hugh Hefner and Dan Bilzerian -- and that's when his lawyer cut him off, and simplified their defense ... denying the allegations and labeling them defamatory.", "description": "Riff Raff's going all out to defend himself against recent sexual misconduct allegations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/dd/16by9/2018/06/14/dd129a9ff23a5d7d847c8fefd6522678_xl.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-06-15"}
