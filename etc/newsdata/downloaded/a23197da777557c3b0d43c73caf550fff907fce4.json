So we thought we\u2019d share what we did yesterday,\" Pink wrote alongside a picture of the singer dyeing her 8-year-old daughter Willow's hair blue.\n\nWillow definitely has the support of her parents when it comes to her creative style.\n\nHer dad and Pink's husband, Carey Hart, shared a photo of his daughter getting her hair cut with one side of her head completely shaved while the rest of her blonde locks fall across one cheek.\n\n\"Loving my punk rock daughter,\" Hart wrote.\n\n\"Remember everyone, fly your own flag.
