Illustration: Intelligencer. Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn September 23, the United Nations will open its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, will sweep through thousands of cities across the globe. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer will be publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates and Naomi Klein to Rhiana Gunn-Wright and William Nordhaus, interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful themselves.)\n\nThis week, the iconic leftist intellectual Naomi Klein released her latest collection of essays, On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal. Klein was not always so focused on climate change, but three of her past four books have addressed it, beginning with 2014\u2019s This Changes Everything, about as succinct a description of the totality of the threat and challenge posed by climate change as you can imagine. I spoke with Klein in August about the suddenly imminent right-wing responses to the crisis of warming, the new political momentum on climate and the inadequacy of left-wing organizing infrastructure to channel it, and whether we have to give up on consumption and growth to give ourselves a meaningful chance of averting disaster.\n\nIn the introduction to your new book, you talk a bit about the prospect of ecofascism, which has been discussed a lot in recent weeks. But you also write about \u201cclimate barbarism,\u201d something short of true fascism that is nevertheless defined by real brutality in response to climate change. Is that here already?\n\nI think climate is bringing out barbarism. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s creating it, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the only factor. But I think there\u2019s a subconscious understanding, even among climate-change deniers, that we are entering an era of scarcity.\n\nHow does that play out?\n\nBarbaric ideas have always served a purpose, and they never went away, because we\u2019ve never truly confronted them or had any true historical record. And so they ebb and flow depending on how much they are needed to justify barbarism. They were needed in the \u201980s, to a lesser degree, to justify a tax on the social safety net \u2014 you had to have a way of vilifying black people and welfare communities in order to justify the savage tax. White supremacy was born of a need to justify slavery, not the other way around. So I find myself more and more impatient with these ideas that the climate solutions we should be proposing are the ones that pacify the right and that reassure a world based on a hierarchy of human lives and domination.\n\nWhat solutions do you mean?\n\nWe know people who have a hierarchical worldview are more prone than any other group to deny climate change. All the social science shows this. And then you have all of these so-called climate-policy experts who say therefore we should be talking about a revenue-neutral carbon tax, nuclear power, and geoengineering because that is not threatening to the people who hold that worldview.\n\nThe problem is that people who hold that worldview are also okay with kids dying in the desert and drowning in the Mediterranean, and unless we actually confront just how toxic that worldview is, all of this is going to get worse. That\u2019s where I think we\u2019re at, and I think at the moment we are seeing an intensification of the climate crisis, an acceleration, everything happening faster than most of the models predicted, as you well know. And we\u2019re seeing a surge in unmasked white supremacy, and we\u2019re also seeing a powerful counterresponse in the form of the Sunrise Movement and the new climate strikers, Extinction Rebellion.\n\nWhen I look at the very present tense, that\u2019s the most new thing to me. When I think about all the other forces that are conspiring against action, they\u2019re villainous, but they\u2019re also familiar. They\u2019ve been villainous for a while, but a year or two ago, I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve thought the mass public protests we\u2019re seeing on climate were even possible\n\nBut I also wouldn\u2019t have necessarily predicted Jair Bolsonaro. I think the extent to which, in country after country, we\u2019re seeing the worst people in the world being elevated to the most powerful positions is pretty startling. Boris Johnson \u2014 these are people that are ready to just burn it down, and I think [we need to] understand what is behind that, and I don\u2019t think we really have understood what the commonalities are between the Trumps and the Bolsanaros and the Dutertes and the Modis. Another factor is just what\u2019s happening to our mental focus and our ability to have institutions, progressive institutions, that are capable of meeting this moment. That\u2019s what preoccupies me the most, to tell you the truth.\n\nHow do you see that landscape?\n\nI\u2019m really concerned about the social-movement infrastructure on the left side of the spectrum. I think it is actually in worse shape than it has been in a long time. You\u2019ve got some powerful presidential campaigns, but that\u2019s not the same as actually having powerful institutions. We\u2019re spending way too much time trading on fear as opposed to organizing strategically and organizing a majority of people who feel that way into a force that can actually defeat the really truly evil forces we\u2019re up against and come up with a plan for how to get out of this.\n\nWhat about the Green New Deal?\n\nI think the Green New Deal is an incredibly hopeful development, but what we don\u2019t have is the institutional capacity to flush out what that means. The original idea was for there to be a subcommittee that would be a resource, that we would be spending this year consulting, bringing together the movement and scientists and local leaders, pooling this huge band of expertise out there of people who have been trying this at the local level \u2014 all kinds of lessons learned and figuring out how to do this with transparency.\n\nInstead, that was nixed. AOC is trying to do this off the side of her desk with some pretty huge committees that she has to kick ass on, and Sunrise is building a youth movement. They\u2019re building a youth army, which is great, but I meet people all the time who are like, \u201cI want to be part of the Green New Deal,\u201d and they don\u2019t know how to do it. They don\u2019t see where their entry point is because there actually isn\u2019t an infrastructure saying, \u201cOkay, you guys are going to do this, we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re going to figure out what this means to teachers, and you guys are going to figure out what it means to steelworkers,\u201d and come up with an actual plan that is akin to what produced the original New Deal.\n\nBut one thing that\u2019s important to remember is that in the period that produced the New Deal and some of the most important legislation, a lot of the organizing happened after FDR was elected and there were a lot of wildcat strikes without unionization, and the institutions were built on the fly. So I take some comfort in that, in reading that history, because I feel like I thought it was different. I thought they were all organized and then they got the New Deal, and I\u2019m realizing that actually a lot of the organizing happened parallel to it, which makes me feel a little bit better.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m so impressed with its rhetorical power \u2014 the joining of the social-justice imperative and the climate imperative. I find that for people in the center-left and center-right who are complaining about it, saying this is joining these two missions together in an uncomfortable Frankenstein or whatever, I\u2019m always saying to them that the social-justice stuff is the really popular stuff.\n\nI know, right?\n\nIt does seem to me to really quite beautifully stitch together both the challenges and the solutions in a way that is also, when you take it seriously, liberatingly optimistic in the sense that basically everything you might not like about the world is going to be made worse by climate change, but everything you value about the world could be made better by taking action on climate change.\n\nI know. It changes everything. I\u2019ve been trying to make this argument.\n\nWhat a title. But while it is the case that climate change promises to change everything and that there has been a lot of movement over the past year politically, it\u2019s also the case that things have changed very little to this point when it comes to actual policy and emissions.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that taking climate change seriously decimates the entire neoliberal project because you can\u2019t have a laissez-faire attitude, where it\u2019s having your emissions in 11 years; you actually need to regulate your way out of it. And yeah, you can have a few market mechanisms in place, but the market is not going to do it for you. You need massive investments in the public sphere, and it\u2019s actually kind of a pain in the butt that we sold off so much of the public sphere.\n\nBut it is a bigger challenge to the left. We\u2019ve largely been having battles over the redistribution of the spoils of extractivism \u2014 whether we\u2019re going to share them equitably. But whether we can continue to have economic growth and economic extraction is not something the left has really reckoned with.\n\nWhat do you think about that? Do you think we should diminish our expectations for growth in adjusting to a climate future?\n\nI think we need a very different economy. The centrality of consumption in our economy absolutely has to change. There are areas of our economy that can grow, but they\u2019re not going to be the ones that are all about consumption until we have to think about a different kind of economy and a different measure of happiness and well-being. There are areas where we\u2019re going to have to contract, and I think we\u2019re pretty much still in the stage where we\u2019re talking about all the things we\u2019re going to add but not the things we\u2019re going to subtract.\n\nI understand the political arguments for that, but there\u2019s no question that there are risks. There are ways you can do a Green New Deal that would increase emissions \u2014 you\u2019re talking about huge infrastructure investments we need to make, but we have an economy built on fossil fuel, so to make huge infrastructure investments, you\u2019re going to burn a lot of fossil fuels.\n\nPouring some cement.\n\nBut I think the significance of the Green New Deal is that it moves the discussion to how we are going to change our economy. We have to have a conversation about a different kind of economy and economy-wide transformation, not a single policy silver bullet.\n\nAnd from there, I think we will refine and improve. I think there has to be a built-in carbon audit so that this is rolled out in a way where we keep ourselves honest and we admit that there\u2019s a real risk, a Green New Deal carbon bubble, and that we are going to make sure we don\u2019t do that by auditing how much carbon we\u2019re burning as we\u2019re going and handing that over to the leading emissions-reduction experts and course-correcting as we go.\n\nI think the lessons of history on this are that we don\u2019t need to have figured everything out before we start. I think we need to get the scale of the transformation right and the conversation right, that we are talking about changing how we live; we\u2019re talking about changing our economy.\n\nWhich to me is so powerful because the world is going to be changed. The question is, Do you want it to change in this way that is going to be really ugly, or in this way that is maybe not perfect but quite a bit more hospitable?\n\nThis is part of why I think we need to also have an honest conversation about how threatening climate change is to the cult of centrism and incremental reformism. A lot of journalists built their identity around being the guy who splits the difference, doesn\u2019t get too excited; that\u2019s how you define your seriousness, right? But it is profoundly unserious at this point to define change in that way, because it means you haven\u2019t reckoned at all with the science, which says our future is radical. The present is pretty radical too. The idea that there is some sort of gradual, incremental, let\u2019s-split-the-difference pathway to respond to this crisis is silly at this point. We may have personal preferences for that, but that doesn\u2019t turn it into a reality just because we want it.\n\nMy own general perspective on this is that just about everything seems to be moving in the right direction except time, which is moving in the wrong direction.\n\nYou mean in terms of polling?\n\nYeah, political engagement. More people are more concerned \u2014 75 percent or more believe climate change is happening. A majority of Republicans want \u201caggressive American action\u201d to combat it, whatever that means.\n\nSo are you more optimistic than when you wrote the book because you\u2019ve been out there talking to people?\n\nI turned in a manuscript last September when really none of the mobilization we\u2019ve seen had started. I hadn\u2019t heard of Greta Thunberg at that point; she had barely started her climate-striking. Extinction Rebellion hadn\u2019t begun. I hadn\u2019t heard of Sunrise. And renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper \u2014 there\u2019s that to be excited about too. But when I think about really taking seriously the U.N. timeline and the idea that we have to have emissions by 2030, I don\u2019t see any way that\u2019s possible. Do you?\n\nGlobally?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It is a moon shot, but I do think there\u2019s a scenario where there could be a candidate who makes it the center of their campaign, which I don\u2019t think anyone really has. You have a lot of candidates who endorse the Green New Deal, but I think if we had a presidential candidate who both made the Green New Deal the centerpiece of their campaign and was truly up for the fight of their lives in terms of taking on the corporate interests that would be really against it \u2014 and you had sectoral organizing that was ready in 2021 with both plans for what the Green New Deal should mean and the different sectors organized enough to put pressure on the administration. The original New Deal rolled out in nine years, and it did a hell of a lot. They planted more than 2 billion trees. That\u2019s one of the things we have to do.\n\nDid you see that Ethiopia planted 350 million in one day last week?\n\nI didn\u2019t see that. I do think there would be a catalyzing effect for the U.S. to decisively lead. It would change the game a lot in a lot of different countries. I think our chances are slim, but I also think anything big we do is significant. I don\u2019t see this as either we do it all or we should all just give up and drink ourselves to death. I think it all matters because every quarter-degree is hundreds of millions of lives, if not more.\n\nAnd the centrality of marrying climate action to building a more humane society is all the more important if we don\u2019t do it. In the sense that if we become a society that actually doesn\u2019t let people drown in the ocean and die in the desert and we actually do our damnedest to save lives and believe that people have a right to health care by right of being alive and open up our borders in the face of a massive humanitarian crisis \u2014 if we become a society governed by those types of values that are based on valuing and cherishing human life, that will serve us very well if it turns out we were pretty far off the mark in emissions reduction. The rockier the future is, the more important it is that we become a decent society, which we\u2019re not right now.\n\nYou mentioned the New Deal as a historical analogy. But you also write in the book about how basically historical analogy is now actually inadequate and that what we\u2019re dealing with is a challenge of a different scale.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily a challenge of a different scale, in the sense that the speed of the transformation of the economy during the Second World War was pretty much on the scale that we\u2019re talking about. But it\u2019s a different quality, right? I\u2019ve never really been comfortable with military analogies because I actually think we need to make peace with the planet and not militarize our approach to it. I think we have a military approach to the natural world, that it\u2019s all been about containing it. So the idea that we\u2019re going to wage war on climate change \u2014 I think we need a different way of living on this planet, and that it\u2019s a lot less militaristic.\n\nBut we do have precedents for an incredibly rapid change. That\u2019s why I think there\u2019s never going to be an exact historical analogy, but there are things to learn from all of them. It\u2019s interesting how much public transit people used during the Second World War. It\u2019s interesting that people planted vegetable gardens, and it\u2019s important to remember that during the Great Depression they were also dealing with an ecological crisis with the dust bowl. But I think the main reason to talk about historical analogies is that the greatest baggage we carry from the earlier periods is the feeling of futility and the feeling that we can\u2019t do anything because we\u2019re all so selfish anyway.\n\nOr that only the private sector can deal with anything.\n\nBut humans are capable of being many things. We\u2019ve all grown up in an era when we\u2019re told all we know how to do is shop and all we know how to do is gratify ourselves.\n\nPeople often ask me, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d I think really what they mean is \u201cWhat can I buy\u201d?\n\nWelcome to my world. Now I\u2019m getting us into No Logo.\n\nMy brother is an economist, and he\u2019s been doing a lot of research about the Second World War parallels. What he says is they didn\u2019t know they were going to win \u2014 what if we lose? But the idea that you don\u2019t start something unless you have a guarantee that you\u2019re going to win is a modern argument.\n\nAnd modern American.\n\nIt\u2019s the definition of defeatism.\n\nWe call it the Second World War, but it left a lot of countries out. I think that\u2019s another way in which this is an imperfect analogy. This is such a truly global phenomenon that it requires not just every country but, in a certain way, every person to be participating in the solution. How do you think about that? You mentioned earlier that you think an American president who is quite aggressive won\u2019t really change the game. When I hear conservatives saying, \u201cWhat does it matter what we do? China is still going to do what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d I understand why that\u2019s a morally grotesque position and an evacuation of our obligations that we have because of our own carbon history and our position in the world. But there\u2019s also a part of me that\u2019s scared by the same problem they\u2019re pointing to, which is just how to organize genuine global action in a moment when the fabric of global cooperation is being pulled apart.\n\nFirst of all, I think those are different issues, right? \u201cWhat about China?\u201d has been the excuse all along, and the fact is that China is doing more than the U.S. in terms of renewables.\n\nAlthough I think they\u2019ve approved six times as many new coal plants thus far in 2019 than they did in 2018.\n\nUntil we are in any way living up to our responsibilities, we don\u2019t have any moral standing to push anybody else. If we are, then we do. And I was glad to see that Elizabeth Warren has a link for trade policy on the climate. I think we have to [have one]. We have leaders we don\u2019t use. One of the interesting things about what happens after Trump \u2014 if there is an after Trump \u2014 is that he has detonated a whole lot of neoliberal shackles around what you can and can\u2019t do on trade.\n\nSo at the geopolitical level, how do we organize a path forward?\n\nOne of the things I\u2019m struck by is that there are fewer spaces for international strategizing and a sense of cross-border organizing than was the case even ten years ago \u2014 but certainly 20 years ago, when you had the World Social Forum in Brazil where there were tens of thousands of people coming together to [see] what can South Africa learn from Brazil. What would it look like to have a global movement that was calling for a different model of trade? We really need that type of international organizing, and we don\u2019t have it right now. The person who is doing most of it is Steve Bannon, and that\u2019s a terrible thing to be quoted saying but it is true and that has to change.\n\nThe geopolitical problem scares me more than anything else.\n\nI find what\u2019s happening in Brazil to be scarier than pretty much anything else. It\u2019s also worse thinking about what is happening in Puerto Rico, what is happening right now in Hong Kong. We talk about resistance here, but what is happening in Hong Kong is resistance.\n\nWhat do you think will happen there?\n\nI\u2019m terrified of what\u2019s going to happen there. But it does show that it\u2019s a reminder of how quickly things can change and that change can be contagious. And what happened in Puerto Rico too, right? I wish it had been amplified more here in the rest of the U.S., because it shows that it\u2019s pretty unpredictable when people have just had enough.\n\nWhy do you think there\u2019s more ready energy for protest in places like Puerto Rico and Hong Kong?\n\nIt\u2019s really unpredictable. I\u2019ve been around enough years now to have been witness to a few of these effervescent moments, right? And they always come as a surprise. And the tragedy is when they come before we are ready with our alternatives and our ideas. During Occupy, people were like, the whole point is to have no demands, and it\u2019s like, no, we have demands, we have plans, we have ideas, and a new generation of people who are taking the plunge into politics. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be in a situation like that if there were an uprising like the kind we just saw in Puerto Rico, like the kind we\u2019re seeing in Hong Kong. I don\u2019t think the U.S. is outside of history, where that couldn\u2019t happen. I think it could. I think so many people are just absolutely horrified and terrified. And if there were one of those tipping points, I think we\u2019d be in a much better situation because of all kinds of plans and demands. So we\u2019ll see.\n\nDo you see the climate strike that\u2019s planned for September 20 as a possible event like that?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s going to be big, but I think these moments we\u2019re talking about are rarely planned.\n\nSo all you can do is get ready for that weird moment, that effervescent moment. I don\u2019t think you can plan what the moment is going to be, but you can plan how not to blow the moment. We\u2019ve blown a few moments, and I would say we\u2019re in a better position not to blow the moment than at any point in my lifetime.\n\nI think you\u2019ve talked about how your real awakening on climate was Katrina. Yet a quarter of all the emissions ever produced in the history of humanity have come about since then.\n\nWe\u2019re definitely accelerating.\n\nThat was not long ago. An 18-year-old has been alive for a third of all emissions, and I\u2019ve been alive for 55 percent. That\u2019s really fast.\n\nThat\u2019s really fast. When I published This Changes Everything, from the environmental movement, people were saying climate change was hard enough \u2014 did you have to make it capitalism, did you have to have those in there? A lot of people are more excited about capitalism than they are about climate change. And if everything was going great with capitalism except for climate change, we really would be lucky, but that is not the world we live in.\n\nI think a lot of this honestly is going to get resolved only if we have a different kind of governance. I hate to say it \u2014\n\nYou don\u2019t hate to say it! You want a new kind of governance.\n\nI think people still don\u2019t like to hear the idea that government has to lead, that there have to be regulations. People are like, \u201cWell, what can I do?\u201d I can tell you I used to smoke a lot of cigarettes, and I stopped smoking not when somebody told me it was bad for me; I always knew it was bad for me. I stopped smoking when I couldn\u2019t smoke in restaurants and bars and I was outside in subzero weather freezing like an idiot to have a cigarette. And there are going to be things we\u2019re told we can\u2019t do in order to have a habitable planet or some semblance thereof.", "description": "The leftist intellectual Naomi Klein, author of On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal and This Changes Everything, talks the new political momentum on climate and whether we have to give up on consumption and growth to avert disaster.", "authors": ["David Wallace-Wells"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/17/17-climate-naomi-klein.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
