People were shocked. I wasn\u2019t shocked. But I deal with them, and I know them and I like them. And I hope we can do something.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s says it\u2019s important for him to take on China, even if his trade war has rattled Wall Street and retailers.\n\nDuring the Group of 7 summit last month, he expressed regret over how he\u2019d handle the trade war with China, only for the White House to walk it back, saying Mr. Trump only \u201cregrets not raising the tariffs higher.\u201d\n\nNearly three weeks later, he\u2019s offering a brief respite from higher levies in response to China\u2019s own gesture of good will.\n\nXinhua, a state-run media outlet in China, said Beijing\u2019s decision reflected \u201cthe Chinese\u2019s consistent calmness and rationality in dealing with economic and trade frictions, as well as for enterprises and the public.
