The program\u2019s supporters say this, its critics say that, so we\u2019ll quote both sides of it and leave it to you, the public, to decide who is right.\n\nThis approach has the obvious virtue of seeming fair, as a judge is fair in letting the prosecution and defense each make its case. It has a less obvious but very important advantage for news organizations, that of sparing reporters the burden of having to say, \u201cActually, we think this particular side is right.\u201d By definition, most reporters most of the time are covering subjects in which we\u2019re not expert. Is the latest prime-rate move by the Fed a good idea? Or a bad one? I personally couldn\u2019t tell you.
