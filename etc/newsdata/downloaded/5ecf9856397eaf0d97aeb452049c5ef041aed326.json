That's one female inventor for every seven male ones.\n\nAnd although the proportion among patent applications is increasing, at the current rate it won't reach gender parity until 2070.\n\nSo, why are there so few women in the world of inventing?\n\nResearchers attribute the gap to a lack of women working in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). According to Penny Gilbert, partner at intellectual property law firm Powell & Gilbert, it's simply a pipeline issue.\n\n\"If we want to see more women filing patents, then we need to see more women taking up Stem subjects at university and going on to careers in research,\" she says.\n\nCurrently only about a quarter of the UK workforce in Stem industries is female and fewer girls and women study these subjects at secondary school and university, despite efforts to diagnose and solve this imbalance.\n\nTwo-thirds of teams still all-male\n\nPatents are granted to the owner of an invention, allowing the creator and subsequent owners to prevent others from using their invention. In order to qualify as an \"invention\" patent, the filing must contain a new, useful idea - that would not be obvious to a skilled person in that field.\n\nThey can be filed individually, or by teams of inventors.\n\nThe gender disparity among inventors grows even starker when you take into account most female inventorship takes the form of a lone female on a male-dominated team.\n\nMore than two-thirds of all patents come from all-male teams or individual male inventors - and just 6% from individual female inventors.\n\nAll-female teams are nearly non-existent, making up just 0.3% of applications, according to the IPO.\n\nEven when they apply for patents, women may be less likely to receive them, according to a study of US patent applications, by Yale University researchers. They found applicants with an obviously female name were less likely to have their patent approved.\n\nAnd of course, not everyone involved in an invention is credited with a patent.\n\nAll in all, female scientists are less than half as likely to obtain a patent for their research, according to a previous World Intellectual Property Organisation study, suggesting women may be less likely than men to think about commercialising their inventions.\n\nBiotech the most gender equal\n\nIn 1991, Ann Tsukamoto developed a way to isolate stem cells. Her innovation led to great advancements in understanding the blood systems of cancer patients and could lead to a cure for the disease.\n\nDr Tsukamoto, who is currently conducting further research into stem cell growth, is also the co-patentee on more than seven other inventions.\n\nImage copyright Hannah Eachus\n\nBiotechnology, the use of living organisms to produce useful products such as medicine and food, is the sector with the highest proportion of female inventors. Some 53% of biotechnology-related patents have at least one female inventor.\n\nIn second place, 52% of pharmaceutical-related patents have at least one female inventor.\n\nElectrical engineering was at the bottom of the list, with fewer than one in 10 applications having at least one female inventor.\n\nParity by 2070\n\nThe proportion of women inventors has doubled in the past 20 years, according to the IPO, from just 6.8% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2017, the latest year for which full data is available.\n\nDuring the same period, the proportion of applications naming at least one woman among the inventors rose from 12% to 21%.\n\nMs Gilbert says stereotypes around women's educational and career choices need to be tackled - by encouraging women to choose Stem areas, introducing mentoring schemes, and celebrating female role models.\n\n\"We should applaud the fact that some of the greatest scientists and inventors throughout history have been women - from Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin to Grace Hopper, inventor of computer programming, and Stephanie Kwolek, the inventor of Kevlar,\" she says.\n\n\"We should tell their stories.\"\n\nRussia tops the list\n\nAlthough female inventorship in the UK has increased, from 8% in 1998 to 11% in 2017, other countries are well ahead.\n\nWith 17% of patent applications including at least one woman over the past 20 years, Russia had the highest proportion of female inventors, out of the 10 countries with the most patent applications, followed by France.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, in Japan and South Korea fewer than one in 20 patent applications included a female inventor during the time period.\n\nHow was the data collected?\n\nThe gender of inventors is usually not included in patent applications, so the IPO inferred gender based on inventors' first names, using data from the European Patent Office Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT).\n\nInventors' names were matched to a gender using birth data from the UK's Office for National Statistics and the US Social Security Administration, which lists the names of all babies born, and the number of male and female entries, as well as by crawling Facebook profiles to create a larger list of names and their likely gender.\n\nOnly names for which at least 95% of entries were male or female were included, so gender-neutral names such as \"Robin\" have been excluded.\n\nA total of 75% of inventors' names were matched to a gender, although this success rate varies country by country. The name lists used were biased towards Western names, so the UK has the highest \"success rate\", while countries in East Asia, including South Korea and China, have a lower rate.\n\nWhat is 100 Women?\n\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories.\n\nFind us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and use #100Women.", "description": "Women inventors account for just under 13% of patent applications globally, according to a study.", "authors": ["Clara Guibourg", "Nassos Stylianou", "Data Journalists", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6709/production/_97477362_gracehopper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
