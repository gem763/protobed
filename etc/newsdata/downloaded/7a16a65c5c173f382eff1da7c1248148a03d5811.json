But to this day, terrorist organizations are still using Afghanistan as a base.\n\nCBS News was given a rare opportunity to accompany an elite U.S.-trained Afghan commando unit as it tracked down ISIS fighters in Kabul. Eighteen years after 9/11, Afghan special forces are a part of America's strategy to stop it from happening again. This time, a hunt for suspected ISIS targets in the capital.\n\nCBS News joined an armored convoy into one of Kabul's most dangerous neighborhoods. After waiting for the signal to move, CBS News went down a group of alleyways overlooked by empty buildings. A soldier with night vision scanned the horizon while others climbed walls, looking for threats.\n\nCharlie D'Agata with Afghan special forces in Kabul, Afghanistan.

They're U.S. and NATO trained, but they're outnumbered by enemies that have multiplied, despite America's military presence.\n\nInside, the unit found their target: A suspected ISIS commander.
