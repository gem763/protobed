Photo: New Line Cinema\n\nThe comedy-podcast universe is ever expanding, not unlike the universe universe. We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller, a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each one has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the exceptional, the noteworthy. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists and especially enthusiastic people will pick their favorites. We hope to have your ears permanently plugged with the best in aural comedy.\n\nBad Romance Podcast - Drop Dead Fred\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough few months for fans of the \u201990s movie Drop Dead Fred. First, in what was probably their most divisive episode, the hosts of How Did This Get Made? drew a line in the sand, declaring you need to either be Team Fred or Team Sanity. And just when I thought tempers had cooled and it was safe to once again admit that I was firmly on the side of this being not only a good, but dare I say very good movie, hosts of the Bad Romance Podcast, Jourdain Searles and Bronwyn Isaac, are taking Fred to task. But this time, there\u2019s no one around to stick up for the admittedly batshit-crazy things that happen in the movie. They\u2019re asking the big questions like, \u201cWhy are there two British characters?,\u201d \u201cWhy does Phoebe Cates\u2019s character dress like a child?,\u201d \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t every character have lines as good as Carrie Fisher\u2019s character?,\u201d and most troubling of all, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sexual tension between Fred, an imaginary man, and the woman who imagined him?\u201d At first glance, a movie about a grown woman and her childhood imaginary friend may seem like an odd choice for a podcast that examines romantic comedies. But as Searles and Isaac break down all the troubling relationships between the main character and the men (both real and imagined) in her life, it makes sense. They make it harder and harder to defend the movie\u2019s choices. So if you\u2019re a fan of the movie and want to hold onto that fandom, you probably shouldn\u2019t rewatch it. But you probably should listen to this episode. \u2014Leigh Cesiro\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nAlison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend - Liana Finck Is Tired of Interruptions\n\nComedy from a different angle is in store this week when host Alison Rosen welcomes cartoonist and author Liana Finck to the termite-ridden Pod Cabin. Finck is widely known from her popular Instagram account, but her cartoons are seen regularly in the pages of the New Yorker, her latest book (Excuse Me: Complaints, Cartoons, and Notes to Self), and several graphic novels. Her humor quickly emerges in this interview and her sly wit is incisive, keenly honed, and often self-deprecating. (\u201cI had two friends in school but they both kind of expired, and for years were just kind of like the shells of friends around each other.\u201d) Even when it comes to talking about her art, her unexpected response to the question \u201cWhen did you start drawing?\u201d is quietly hilarious: \u201cWhen I was a baby, but I wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d Rosen spends various parts of the interview trying to get her guest to cop to how smart and talented she is, pointing out how Finck won a Fulbright Scholarship in college, but even that turns into a how-to lesson on gaming the system in order to increase your odds about being picked for the honor. They cover a lot of ground \u2014 Judaism, boyfriends, sharing tables at caf\u00e9s with strangers, and even what kinds of pens and paper Finck favors when sketching her toons. (A Kuretake brush pen and Bright White printer paper, if you\u2019re taking notes \u2026) Oh, and she\u2019s sick of being interrupted when she\u2019s working on her art when she\u2019s out in public. Her story about how she broke into the \u201cold boys\u201d network of cartoonists at the New Yorker is pretty inspiring, as is the amazing amount of panels she needs to turn out each issue just to get a few (or, sometimes, just one) considered for the next issue. \u2014Marc Hershon\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nIconography - David Lynch (w/ Lorelei Ramirez)\n\nAyo Edebiri and Olivia Craighead have covered icons from Stephen Sondheim to Ina Garten, but none have had an entire style of film named after them. David Lynch, a man who \u201clooks like he went to war, but didn\u2019t,\u201d is the subject of this week\u2019s Iconography featuring Lorelei Ramirez (Adult Swim). Like Lynch, Ramirez is drawn to the darkness in her subject matter, creating art to appease her own unique taste rather than for the mainstream. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be an Iconography without the silliest bits, like wondering if Twin Peaks\u2019 \u201cminer face\u201d is okay if they\u2019re done by a \u201cperson of coal.\u201d At the 23-minute mark, one of the hosts (who shall remain unnamed) cancels herself with the wrong answer to a hypothetical about the \u201cgaping gap\u201d in relationship ages. It\u2019s safe to say this is the only discussion of David Lynch\u2019s filmography that will make key points like \u201cEraserhead is kind of acid-cum adjacent.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, those who aren\u2019t a fan of Lynch\u2019s out-there filmmaking are represented as well, in a hilarious rendition of \u201cPeople\u2019s Court\u201d that features a confused Mulholland Drive movie review from People magazine. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nA Funny Feeling - Aunt Angel with Maureen Bharoocha\n\nComedians and self-professed \u201cparanormal enthusiasts\u201d Marcy Jarreau and Betsy Sodaro\u2019s A Funny Feeling podcast is the perfect pairing of scary and silly, and this week\u2019s episode is a standout. Joined by writer and director Maureen Bharoocha (Jimmy Kimmel Live), things kick off quickly when Bharoocha explains in graphic detail the extremely morbid death of an aunt she was named after but never met. The hosts\u2019 responses are both sincere and spirited as they react to what they\u2019ve just heard with complete honesty. She goes on to share that in the aftermath, her aunt, who died at age six, visited the family numerous times during her afterlife. Examples include her grandmother feeling a hand on her shoulder comforting her while she cried, and the aunt\u2019s childhood portrait appearing out of thin air one year on her death anniversary. It\u2019s some spooky shit, to be sure, but the hosts are quick to make it hilarious when they question the logistics of a ghost\u2019s antics, like: How did she figure out how to print a picture of herself to leave on the doorstep? Oscillating between humorous and horrifying, A Funny Feeling is a great podcast to settle into the rest of the spooky season with. \u2014Becca James\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nScattered - Soy Andres, a Tus Pies & The Camp\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since Chris Garcia\u2019s heartbreaking Death, Sex & Money episode was first released. Scattered\u2019s double-episode debut proves the wait was well worth it. Episode one, \u201cSoy Andres, a Tus Pies,\u201d mostly a rehash of the original episode, catches subscribers up on the podcast\u2019s true star \u2014 Chris Garcia\u2019s late father, Andres. With tighter writing and editing, the legend of Andres achieves a newfound level of gravitas. Garcia makes listeners feel like they\u2019re in a time machine by incorporating sound bytes from his father in some of his darkest times. He also establishes his mother more clearly than any sitcom could: She loves Pitbull, Paul Blart: Mall Cop, and \u201cMotherfockers\u201d (Meet the Fockers). Like any good pilot, there\u2019s a brand-new interview at the end that will hook subscribers new and old. In the second episode, Garcia begins some of the detective work set up in the pilot. He shines a light on the lost period when his father was held in one of Fidel Castro\u2019s labor camps. Garcia somehow manages to keep the tone light enough to chuckle at, but dark enough to pay attention to. His family\u2019s story could not be more relevant today, and represents a welcome addition to WNYC\u2019s slate of programming. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nOther Podcasts We\u2019re Listening To:\n\nYou Up with Nikki Glaser - Off Air (Special Edition)\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nWho?
