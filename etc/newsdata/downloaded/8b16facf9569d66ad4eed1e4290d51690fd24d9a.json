I speak as a former intolerant zealot, who grew out of it.\n\nI know the fierce joy which comes from despising others, only too well. And I fear it.\n\nSo, off we go into the cold and dark, while the red-clad propaganda mummers simper and gesticulate. Protesters are pictured at a 'grief march' in London last week\n\nWill sane people have to glue themselves to aircraft and bridges to get anyone to listen? And if they do, will they be indulged by our politicised, biased police, as the Warmists are?\n\nPerhaps the most dispiriting version of it is to be seen in the painted, beatific faces of the red-robed mime-artists who are to be found on so many of the demonstrations demanding that this country commits economic suicide.\n\nWho can tell what is going on behind those self-satisfied, ethereal expressions? But they give these marches a strong whiff of the Age of Inquisitions, which I once thought we had escaped.\n\nI won\u2019t try to argue here on the rightness or wrongness of the Warmists\u2019 theory about the causes of climate change.\n\nI know from long, multiple experience that they respond to reasonable doubt with fury and defamatory cries of \u2018denier\u2019.\n\nThanks to the political and media class\u2019s dim acceptance of shouted propaganda, and their rejection of reason, we are already damaging ourselves. Police are pictured holding a protester during a demonstration in London earlier this week\n\nI spend much of my life in debate, and will take on any rational opponent. But there are some causes you can\u2019t reason with, and this is one of them.\n\nThey prefer fury to logic. This is always the sign of someone who is not sure of his own case, and hates to hear his inner doubts spoken.\n\nI have yet to get one of them to respond to this simple point. We recently closed and demolished Didcot \u2018A\u2019 coal-fired power station, an efficient, reasonably modern plant with a generating capacity of about 1.44 gigawatts.\n\nWhy? Why not at least mothball it? But no such caution is allowed in the great cause of cutting CO2 emissions.\n\nLook at the facts: an enormous 259 gigawatts (180 Didcots) of new coal-fired capacity are under development in China. That\u2019s on top of the 993 gigawatts of coal-burning capacity China already possesses (690 Didcots).\n\nPerhaps the most dispiriting version of it is to be seen in the painted, beatific faces of the red-robed mime-artists who are to be found on so many of the demonstrations demanding that this country commits economic suicide\n\nThe UK\u2019s whole electrical generation capacity, in all forms of power, is 85 gigawatts (59 Didcots). If we gave up using electricity entirely, it would make no difference at all to the impact of Chinese coal burning on the atmosphere.\n\nNone. Not any. Zero. If we completely abolish all our fossil-fuel generation, including gas, it would likewise not matter in the slightest \u2013 except to us, our economy and our standard of living.\n\nChina\u2019s planned increase, yes, increase, in coal power is three times the size of our whole electricity-generation industry \u2013 wind, nuclear gas, and all. India is also increasing coal generation and last March reached a coal capacity of 200 gigawatts (139 Didcots).\n\nI have said it before. I\u2019ll keep saying it. Thanks to the political and media class\u2019s dim acceptance of shouted propaganda, and their rejection of reason, we are already damaging ourselves.\n\nWind generation only functions thanks to huge hidden subsidies, paid for by the poor, and is vulnerable to power cuts unless it is backed up by fossil fuel or nuclear generation.\n\nWe are like a thirsty man refusing to drink from a tap because of a water shortage, while his local water company leaves hundreds of leaks unrepaired, allowing thousands of gallons to drain away each hour.\n\nThis is a futile, self-harming gesture. And these demonstrators, ignorant and engorged with self-righteous rage, demand more futility.\n\nWill sane people have to glue themselves to aircraft and bridges to get anyone to listen? And if they do, will they be indulged by our politicised, biased police, as the Warmists are?\n\nSo, off we go into the cold and dark, while the red-clad propaganda mummers simper and gesticulate.\n\nHate speech is no crime \u2013 so long as you\u2019re a vicious Lefty\n\nWhat would you think would happen to a man who posted on Twitter the following words: \u2018I dearly wish a reactivated IRA would successfully blow up that scumbag Johnson and his evil cabinet\u2019?\n\nGiven what happened in Brighton on October 12, 1984, is this not especially revolting?\n\nLest we forget, the IRA, by planting a bomb in the Grand Hotel, murdered Sir Anthony Berry, Eric Taylor, Lady (Jeanne) Shattock, Lady (Muriel) Maclean and Roberta Wakeham.\n\nMany others were severely injured, including Lord (Norman) Tebbit and his wife Margaret. Not funny.\n\nBecause it was a single incident, nothing was done except \u2018words of advice\u2019. So there you are. You can call for the IRA to blow up the Cabinet, and nothing will happen to you [File photo]\n\nSurely the police, who relentlessly patrol Twitter for signs of political incorrectness, failures to respect the transgender community and so forth, would react with speed and strength?\n\nWell, more than a month after the offending tweet was posted on August 20, they did visit the author, a Mr Mark Powell who tweets under the name \u2018Markhayo\u2019.\n\nBut there was no heavy-footed dawn raid, of the type so often favoured by the modern police.\n\nNor was his house suddenly flooded by officers going through his bedroom, as happened to Field Marshal Lord Bramall after a mad fantasist accused him of child abuse.\n\nNo, he got a wimpy letter from a police person saying, with almost unbelievable feebleness, and a clear signal that he was in no danger of prosecution: \u2018I apologise for the unsolicited nature of this letter, and do not wish to cause you any undue alarm; however, I do need to discuss some sensitive issues that may concern you. I would like to stress that this letter has not been sent as part of any criminal proceedings, nor are you in any trouble whatsoever.\u2019\n\nIt sought to arrange a \u2018convenient time to meet\u2019.\n\nMr Powell displayed this letter on Twitter, saying the police had been \u2018very civil\u2019. But he hadn\u2019t been. He boasted that he\u2019d sworn at the officers, and refused to withdraw his words.\n\nHe later apologised for the swearing in an email to the officers, but repeated that \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be sorry to see this Cabinet of traitors blown up by a rejuvenated IRA\u2019. He then posted that email on Twitter.\n\nOne of those who had reported the outburst, a Tory councillor from Aylesbury called Gary Powell (emphatically no relation), got in touch with me after getting nowhere with Scotland Yard.\n\nHe\u2019d been told by a \u2018staff officer\u2019 to Commissioner Cressida Dick that the National Digital Exploitation Service and the National Counter Terrorism Security Office had deemed the tweet to be an offence.\n\nBut because it was a single incident, nothing was done except \u2018words of advice\u2019. So there you are. You can call for the IRA to blow up the Cabinet, and nothing will happen to you.\n\nAlison Saunders, then Director of Public Prosecutions, announced in August 2017 a tough new policy for people who incited hatred on Twitter.\n\nSaunders said: \u2018Left unchallenged, even low-level offending can subsequently fuel the kind of dangerous hostility that has been plastered across our media in recent days. That is why countering it is a priority for the CPS.\u2019 Obviously not in all cases.\n\nSomeone should tell Norman Tebbit, who knows in great detail what it is like to be blown up by the IRA. He might have some \u2018words of advice\u2019 for Dame Cressida.\n\nIf you want to comment on Peter Hitchens click here", "description": "PETER HITCHENS: Soon we will be sitting in an impoverished, dark country, with a trashed economy, incessant power cuts and dismal standard of living, caused by their dogma.", "authors": ["Peter Hitchens For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/00/19640066-0-image-a-41_1570924739494.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
