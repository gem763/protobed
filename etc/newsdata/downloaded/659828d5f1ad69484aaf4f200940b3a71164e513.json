You have expressed your regret.\n\n\"You have given apologies. I have no hesitation at all in saying you are genuinely remorseful.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\"It was a serious sexual attack and had to be dealt with by way of a custodial sentence.\n\n\"This is the most serious form of sexual attack.\n\n\"The range available to the judge within the sentencing guidelines was a custodial sentence of between four and seven years and a starting point of five years in prison.\n\n\"She told you to stop. You wouldn't.\n\n\"She was badly hurt and it went on for a long time and she suffered the consequences of that physically for one week and, emotionally and psychologically, she still suffers.\"\n\nThe judge said there were other mitigating factors, including Wyatt-Davies' previous good character.\n\nThe victim, who cannot be named, said in a statement that she awoke to find Wyatt-Davies having sex with her without her consent.\n\nShe said: \"I asked him to stop. He would not.\"\n\nGiles Nelson, prosecuting, said the victim told police she had asked Wyatt-Davies to stop three times but he \"didn't at any stage stop\".\n\nHe said: \"She was scared and in a state of shock. The really forceful attack lasted four minutes.\n\n\"An empty packet of Viagra was later found discarded in a kitchen bin.\n\n\"She described the pain as unbearable, described it as like childbirth pain.\"\n\nWyatt-Davies later apologised to the victim and admitted the rape as soon as he was arrested.\n\nAsked why he had done it he said: \"I just wanted it.\"\n\nHe also told the victim: \"I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you. I've messed up big time.\"\n\nWyatt-Davies told police he had drunk a bottle of wine before the attack. Afterwards he told them he thought: \"What have I done?\"\n\nIn a victim personal statement, the victim said she had suffered with extreme anxiety and no longer liked leaving the house.\n\nShe also said she felt \"worried and paranoid\" after the attack, referring to herself as feeling \"desperately unhappy\".", "description": "Paul Wyatt-Davies, 34, took Viagra pills before attacking the woman as she slept", "authors": ["Jack Evans", "James Connell", "Image", "Swns", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584005.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_VIAGRA_RAPIST_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
