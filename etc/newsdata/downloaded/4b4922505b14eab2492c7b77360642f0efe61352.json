Many of them required the cooperation of Meghan\u2019s estranged father, Thomas Markle, who helped the newspaper produce numerous articles including staged paparazzi photos.\n\nIn February the Guardian broke the news that Meghan was considering legal action against the MoS after it published a handwritten note she had sent her father, in which she begged him to stop talking to the media. He had passed the note on to the newspaper\u2019s US west coast correspondent, Caroline Graham. Substantial extracts then appeared on the front page as a \u201cworld exclusive\u201d.\n\nWhy is Meghan using copyright law to sue the newspaper?\n\nMeghan is not suing the MoS for publishing defamatory or inaccurate information. No one has claimed the letter is fake \u2013 although Prince Harry does claim the newspaper selectively edited its content, a suggestion the MoS denies.\n\nInstead, Meghan is suing for breach of copyright, infringement of her privacy, and breaches of the Data Protection Act \u2013 an act beefed up last year as part of the GDPR changes.\n\nThe copyright aspect of the case is based on the principle that the author of a letter retains ownership of its content, regardless of who possesses the piece of paper.\n\n\u201cA letter is a copyright work as it is a literary work,\u201d Alex Newman, national head of intellectual property law at Irwin Mitchell solicitors, said this year. \u201cAs soon as you create a copyright work you will own the copyright until it expires automatically. This gives you the right to prevent anyone else copying, or issuing to the public, the whole or a substantial part of your copyrighted work.\u201d\n\n'Put simply, it is bullying': Prince Harry's full statement on the media Read more\n\nJudges have been increasingly willing to find against the media in privacy cases. Meghan\u2019s lawyers are likely to argue that there was no legitimate public interest in publishing the letter. If the MoS loses the case it could have wider implications for all journalists who want to report on leaked private documents.\n\nWhat is unusual about this case?\n\nMeghan has broken with protocol by employing the libel lawyers Schillings, a company which delights in its reputation as an attack dog that works aggressively on behalf of its clients against journalists.\n\nThe couple have been willing to break with royal convention, hiring external PRs and refusing to agree to tabloids sharing pictures of their child. They say they will use private funds to bring the proceedings, which were announced at the end of the couple\u2019s overseas trip to South Africa, overshadowing their other announcements.\n\nWhat are the potential ramifications of this decision?\n\nThe MoS has the same owner as its sister titles, the Daily Mail, and MailOnline, but has a separate editorial team. In common with all print newspapers its circulation is falling but its stories reach a huge audience. It is clear from Harry\u2019s statement that the real target is less a print newspaper than the dozens of websites which rewrite its stories and amplify them around the world.\n\nStarting legal proceedings against the MoS regarding a single article is also a warning to its MailOnline, which publishes dozens of stories about Meghan every month.\n\nWhat does this say about the couple\u2019s approach to the media?\n\nMeghan\u2019s announcement about the legal action was accompanied by a lengthy, passionate, statement from Harry expressing his anger at her treatment by the media.\n\nWhen his mother, Princess Diana, was the subject of intense media interest during the 1980s and 1990s there were limited ways for the royals to react against the tabloid newspapers, which sold millions of copies a day and set the national agenda. The Daily Mail pledged in the aftermath of her death to never again use paparazzi pictures.\n\nNow, social media and a broader collapse of trust in newspapers means Meghan and Harry can use the same tactics used by politicians to rally their supporters against critical media outlets. However, while readers publicly say they can be disgusted with stories about the couple, articles about them often dominate the most-read sections of news websites \u2013 giving tabloids a strong incentive to keep writing about Meghan.", "description": "Action comes after newspaper has published numerous embarrassing stories about her", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1b9a48b1a7aecbbbf225fdb5c18bab984acaeca/0_80_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a16b7a244dad6a4f1246512000ff7937"}
