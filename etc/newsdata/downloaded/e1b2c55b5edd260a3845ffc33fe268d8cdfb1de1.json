Peru\u2019s interior minister ruled out any truth to the rumours and warned against \u201cxenophobic\u201d practices.\n\nPeru was once one of the most welcoming countries for Venezuelan migrants, granting them temporary residency so they could work and access public services. But as the number of Venezuelans in Peru has climbed to more than 850,000, fanning concerns about crime, jobs and social services, Peru cut the residency program short and toughened entry requirements.\n\nEarlier this month, the government said that a new visa requirement for Venezuelans that it imposed in June had led to a 90% drop in legal entries and that authorities would beef up security to prevent illegal crossings.\n\nPeru, Chile and Ecuador now require visas and hard-to-get passports from Venezuelan nationals. Colombia, home to the largest Venezuelan population outside Venezuela, continues to allow them to enter without visas.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s economic collapse and political crisis under President Nicolas Maduro has unleashed the biggest migratory crisis in recent Latin American history.\n\nThe Venezuelan diaspora could double to 8 million by the end of 2020, the Organization of American States (OAS) said in June.\n\nMany Venezuelans in recent waves of migrants are trying to join family members.", "description": "Peru deported 150 Venezuelans for entering the country illegally as authorities sought to enforce stricter policies for migrants from the crisis-stricken nation, Peru's immigration office said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
