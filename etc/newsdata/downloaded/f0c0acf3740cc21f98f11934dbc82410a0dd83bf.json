Recent federal and California rule makings have threatened to end this balanced approach creating uncertainty for consumers. Facing this problem, we had an obligation to intervene,\" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of Global Automakers and a spokesperson for the coalition, on a call with reporters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe filing supports the Trump administration in a lawsuit brought by California and 22 other states in September, challenging the federal government's authority to revoke a pollution waiver that allowed the state to set more stringent tailpipe emissions standards than established federally. California argues it has the right under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe automotive coalition argued that while it supports California and the other states' desire for emissions standards to increase \"year over year,\" it supported the Trump administration in a desire to keep one national emissions standard -- which it argued California was moving to end.\n\n\"Historically the industry has taken the position that federal government is the sole purview of fuel economy,\" said Bozzella of Global Automakers, which lobbies for companies including Nissan, Hyundai and Kia.\n\n\"In 2010 we agreed, all the parties, federal agencies, the state of California, we agreed on one national program. California stepped away from that national program. There were no negotiations between California and the federal government that resolved that split,\" Bozzella said, placing the onus on the western state.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHappy Monday!

Walden is the 20th Republican to say he will forgo reelection to the House in 2020, compared with just seven Democrats.\n\nWalden is also the fifth Republican in a top committee post to announce retirement plans this year. He joins Rep. Mac Thornberry William (Mac) McClellan ThornberryTop Trump administration officials hail al-Baghdadi raid but stress need for resolve in fighting ISIS Top GOP rep 'a little uncomfortable' with Trump language describing ISIS leader's death Thornberry: Al-Baghdadi's death 'does not mean ISIS is defeated' MORE (Texas) from the Armed Services Committee, Rep.

He also previously owned and operated multiple radio stations.\n\nThe Oregon Republican easily won his reelection in 2018. The district is expected to stay in GOP hands.\n\nRead more about Walden here.\n\nLET'S GO TO THE MALL: The National Park Service (NPS) is withdrawing a proposal that would have charged protestors for the security costs associated with demonstrating on the National Mall.\n\nThe controversial proposal spurred 140,000 public comments, with many concerned it would impede First Amendment rights.\n\nSecuring a permit to use the National Mall already requires groups to cover the costs of providing toilets, on-site medical tents and other amenities.\n\n\"There are already a lot of preexisting fees that organizers get asked to pay. Add in something like a security fee, and there's just no way most people or organizations would be able to afford it,\" Samantha Miller, an organizer with DC Action Lab, a company that helps organize protests, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe park service did not give a reason for withdrawing the proposal, but it did explain the rationale for introducing it.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES:\n\nOver the weekend: California Gov. Gavin Newsom Gavin Christopher NewsomCalifornia governor declares statewide emergency over fires The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by Nareit \u2014 State of the states: Political fights heat up Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg would support delaying Libra | More attorneys general join Facebook probe | Defense chief recuses from 'war cloud' contract | Senate GOP blocks two election security bills | FTC brings case against 'stalking' app developer MORE (D) on Sunday declared a statewide emergency amid widespread fires in combination with high winds in the state.\n\n\"I have declared a statewide emergency. We're deploying every resource available as we continue to respond to these fires and unprecedented high-winds,\" Newsom tweeted. \"If you live in an affected area, please stay safe, alert, and heed all warnings from local officials.\"\n\nThe declaration comes as 30,000 acres in Sonoma County thus far have been burned by the Kincade Fire, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people. In the southern part of the state, the Tick Fire has similarly prompted tens of thousands of evacuations, Newsom said in a statement.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe fire may have been spurred by the utility: A California utility reportedly told state regulators Monday its power lines may have caused two wildfires spreading in San Francisco Bay Area, according to The Associated Press.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) told the California Public Utilities Commission that a worker who responded to a fire around 4:45 p.m. on Sunday was told that firefighters believed a power and a communication line may have been the cause, according to AP.\n\nA worker went to another fire around an hour after and saw a fallen pole and transformer, according to AP.\n\nThe fires described in the PG&E reports match the ones that destroyed a tennis club and forced residents in Lafayette, a town about 22 miles east of San Francisco, to evacuate, according to AP.\n\nContra Costa Fire Department told the worker they were looking at the transformer as a potential ignition source, AP reports, citing what a company official wrote.\n\nPG&E has cut power to about 2.35 million people across 38 counties.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThis is a climate change reality: Former California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) is warning that the wildfires ravaging his state could be \"only the beginning\" without drastic action on climate change.\n\n\"I said it was the new normal a few years ago,'' Brown told Politico. \"This is serious ... but this is only the beginning. This is only a taste of the horror and the terror that will occur in decades.''\n\n\"And it will occur in various spots: in America, in Africa, in Canada,'' Brown added. \"It's unpredictable, other than the fact that it will get worse in present trajectory. Washington, under [President] Trump, is doing very little -- and even the Congress has been unable to mobilize under Washington.''\n\nRep.

But just look around: it's already starting,\" she added, linking to footage of wildfires in Vallejo, Calif. \"We have 10 years to cut carbon emissions in half. If we don't, scenes like this can get much worse.\"\n\nClick here to read more on Brown and AOC's comments.\n\nAN ASBESTOS FIGHT IN THE OPINION PAGES: EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Interior sees rise in revenue from drilling on public lands | Officials propose easing pesticide rule for farms | Trump prepares to formally leave Paris climate deal Trump administration rule to shrink exclusion boundaries near pesticide applications Overnight Energy: EPA chief touts benefits of deregulation for environment | Trump officials weaken fish protections Interior chief once lobbied against | USDA watchdog to probe handling of climate reports MORE is defending the agency's latest actions on asbestos.\n\n\"Before our rule, asbestos products that were no longer on the market could come back without any agency review, without any agency restrictions and without any opportunity for the agency to prohibit that use.

This time asbestos' friend is the Environmental Protection Agency,\" the two wrote.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW:\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee will presumably be tearing into Trump's plan to roll back fuel economy standards in a hearing they're calling \"Trump's Wrong Turn on Clean Cars.\"\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard and Trump's backfiring efforts to win over Iowa corn farmers.\n\nLater that day, House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife will hold a hearing on plastic pollution.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\nSmall U.S. oil and gas companies get cold shoulder from large banks, Reuters reports.\n\nClimate bill that caused Oregon Capitol walkout could return, Bloomberg Environment reports.\n\nNew Jersey targets pollution in poorer areas with 6 lawsuits, the Associated Press reports.\n\nTrump's new Tongass rule doesn't mean more logging, E&E News reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Monday and the weekend...\n\nPark Service scraps plan to charge protesters for security costs\n\nCalifornia utility says its power lines may have caused 2 wildfires\n\nSchwarzenegger evacuates due to California wildfire\n\nOregon GOP Rep.
