These days, Chandler, who recently completed a stint working at Farm Forward (tagline: \u201cUntil no animals suffer on factory farms\u201d), is a passionate activist for reducing meat consumption and eating healthier.\n\n\u201cI pre-gamed by getting a $4 container of broccoli rabe in Koreatown this morning,\u201d she warned me.\n\nHere are three things I learned.\n\nFirst, the Impossible Whopper is delicious. \u201cThis tastes so good, I think there\u2019s been a mistake,\u201d I told Sarah as we dug in.\n\nBased on a Frankenstein-like fusion of soy protein and yeast (the Beyond Burger is based on pea protein), the Impossible Whopper was indistinguishable from a regular hamburger. Beyond and Impossible use clever tricks to make the burgers \u201cbleed\u201d like regular meat. Probably the thin patty helped, plus all the trimmings and condiments being exactly the same as regular Burger King. I was fooled.\n\nSecond, in terms of global warming, the plant-substitute meats really could make a difference. Almost 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal agriculture, and large-scale cattle production is among the most intensive. It\u2019s a triple hit, often involving deforestation in developing countries (such as Brazil) and pesticide use, intensive water use, and transportation in industrialized ones. It\u2019s been estimated that a pound of beef produces the amount of carbon dioxide equal to 31 miles of driving a car.\n\nAnd then there are the farts.\n\nCows\u2019 digestive systems excrete methane (mostly through belching, actually), and methane is 23 times as potent as carbon dioxide when it comes to global warming. While most methane pollution actually comes from oil and gas, cattle farming is still a major contributor: a single cow releases 30-50 gallons of methane every day.\n\nThe key point is that the Impossible Burger, and its chief competitor, Beyond Meat, are meant for everybody, not just environmentalists who want to save the world.\n\nThat\u2019s a crucial distinction. Even if every virtuous environmentalist stopped eating meat, that wouldn\u2019t make a dent in global warming. There just aren\u2019t enough do-gooders out there. (It\u2019s been estimated that 16 percent of U.S. consumers avoid animal products for environmental reasons.)\n\nFast food, though, is a powerful aggregator.\n\nOn any given day, more than one in three Americans eats fast food. That\u2019s 84.8 million adults. Even if only half of them are eating burgers, that\u2019s nearly 10 million pounds of beef every single day.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, most of that is industrially farmed. While small-scale cattle farming can actually be carbon negative (cows eat grass that sucks carbon dioxide out of the air), large-scale farming is fossil-fuel intensive, both in farming methods and transportation.\n\n\u201c Every fast-food burger you eat is basically welfare. \u201d\n\nIn sum, Beyond\u2019s own study found that a Beyond Burger generates 90 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than a regular one, and Impossible\u2019s found an 89 percent reduction. Independent assessments are more conservative, but still estimate that a plant-based burger has about half the carbon footprint of a regular burger.\n\nAnd with the market for meat substitutes expected to hit $2.5 billion by 2023, according to Euromonitor estimates, that\u2019s a lot of cows, and cow emissions, saved.\n\nSo, will it work?\n\nThat\u2019s the third thing I learned, and the news isn\u2019t great.\n\nWhile the Impossible Whopper passed our taste test with flying colors, it fails on cost and health.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s expensive. A regular Whopper costs $4.19. An Impossible Whopper theoretically costs $5.59, but at the franchise we visited, it was $6.50. There\u2019s no data on how many customers that deters, but I can\u2019t imagine many will be motivated to pay 50 percent more for their lunch.\n\nOf course, regular Big Macs and Whoppers are so cheap in large part because of government corn subsidies. (Cows normally eat grasses, but in the topsy-turvy world of American farm policy, corn ends up being cheaper). Every fast-food burger you eat is basically welfare.\n\nBut until that changes, it\u2019s hard to see a pricier Whopper competing seriously.\n\nMeanwhile, the health benefits of plant-based burgers are, at best, unclear.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Impossible products are heavily processed, beginning with genetically modified soybeans and continuing with an intensive process that likely removes a lot of the nutrients along the way. Do those costs outweigh the health benefits of reducing one\u2019s meat intake?\n\nIt may depend on quantity. \u201cWhat is healthy and not healthy is really complicated,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cEating lots of fried things and processed things all the time is not healthy, but eating them sparingly, as a treat, is fine.\u201d\n\nChandler said that the comparison between a regular Whopper and an Impossible one may simply be a wash. \u201cIf I were sitting with someone, and they asked \u2018how do I make one change in my life to eat healthier?\u2019 The thing that I would want for them is for them to get into better habits about meal planning and making food from scratch.\u201d\n\nBut how many people will do that? Probably not many. The whole point of the Impossible Whopper is to get large numbers of people to make a meaningful impact on climate change without working too hard.\n\nIf health won\u2019t motivate people, what about global warming?\n\nChandler was skeptical.\n\n\u201cWhat I know from my experience as a food educator,\u201d she said, \u201cis that health motivates people significantly more than climate change. It\u2019s very difficult to imagine that you\u2019re both the perpetrator of and solution to a big problem. It\u2019s too distant and people get overwhelmed and decide not to deal with it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, those who are already committed to fighting climate change are unlikely to pop into a Burger King anytime soon. Already there\u2019s been a backlash against corporate giants using plant-based offerings as a kind of \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of people say they don\u2019t want to give money to Burger King because they\u2019re part of the problem,\u201d Chandler told me.\n\nSo, yes, plant-based meats could play a significant role in fighting global warming if enough people make the switch. But it\u2019s not pure enough for ultra-environmentalists, not healthy enough for the health-conscious, and not cheap enough for the price-sensitive.\n\nAll that being said, Sarah remained upbeat.\n\n\u201cIf someone eats fast food four days a week and now they\u2019re going to have this, even just once a month, and they like it,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of land, that\u2019s a lot of cows, that\u2019s a lot of people, and I\u2019m very happy about it.\u201d", "description": "Meat consumption is a huge driver of global warming, from deforestation to cow farts.
