(AP) - Gregg Williams is fired up about the guys on his defense whose job is to make quarterbacks downright uncomfortable.\n\nSo, all that talk the past few months about the perceived lack of an elite pass rusher on the New York Jets? The ever-confident defensive coordinator insists that you - and anyone else around the NFL taking his squad lightly - can take the disrespect elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people here that people are going to be shocked about by the time the season\u2019s over,\u201d Williams said Friday. \u201c(We have) a lot better people here than everybody keeps crediting. You haven\u2019t heard me say one thing about needs in that area.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard me say one thing. I\u2019m not worried about that area.\u201d\n\nIt might not exactly be the second coming of the \u201cNew York Sack Exchange\u201d with Joe Klecko, Mark Gastineau, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam routinely planting QBs into the turf in the 1980s. But, Williams thinks he has enough talented players to give teams big-time fits on a regular basis.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been the case in recent seasons, though. The Jets have ranked in the top 10 in the NFL in total sacks just twice in the last 10 years: sixth with 45 in 2014, Rex Ryan\u2019s last year as coach; and eighth with 40 in 2010, Ryan\u2019s second season.\n\nNew York also hasn\u2019t had a player with double-digit sacks since Muhammad Wilkerson had 12 in 2015.\n\nBig things are expected, though, from the likes of defensive end Henry Anderson and outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins, who each set career highs by tying for the team lead last season with seven sacks. Outside linebackers Frankie Luvu, Harvey Langi and Tarell Basham are lesser-known players who appear ready to make an impact, particularly with Brandon Copeland - who had five sacks last season - suspended for the first four games for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers.\n\nThere\u2019s also defensive lineman Leonard Williams, who had five sacks last season but hasn\u2019t fully lived up to the lofty expectations of being the No. 6 overall pick in 2015t. He has just 17 sacks in his first four NFL seasons and enters a contract year with an uncertain future with the franchise.\n\n\u201cI mean, every year you want to play your best year,\u201d Leonard Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the other years before I was like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t a big year, so let me chill.\u2019 Every year, you expect to have a big year that year. I\u2019ve never tried to take a back seat or the backburner or anything like that. I\u2019m looking at this year the same way.\u201d\n\nWhile the sack numbers might not be there, Williams has affected games in ways that don\u2019t necessarily show up on the regular stats sheets. He has led the Jets in quarterback hits in each of his NFL season. Williams\u2018 85 hits since 2015 are tied for the fifth-most among AFC players in that span, according to Radar360.\n\nDefensive lineman Quinnen Williams, the No. 3 overall pick in April, also will be counted on by the Jets to play a big role as a rookie.\n\n\u201cHe has not been slowed down by anything intellectually,\u201d Gregg Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sharp young man and I don\u2019t worry about him at all.\u201d\n\nThe defensive coordinator has required that all of his players know how to play at least two positions on the field. Some, such as Langi, have shown they can play at three spots on the defense.\n\nThat gives Gregg Williams lots of flexibility, and allows players to rotate in and out of the lineup while keeping them fresh - and opposing offenses off balance.\n\n\u201cOur guys here enjoy the aggressive style and not only schematically, that\u2019s just one thing, but the technique within the schemes,\u201d Gregg Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a reactionary defense, we\u2019re an attacking (defense). Whether it be just 1-on-1 or 11-on-11, whatever. Those are the things we want our guys to do. We want them to play hard and fast and keep on playing and when we say faster - tougher, harder for longer than everybody we play against.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done a great job of adapting to that here.\u201d\n\nNOTES: WR Robby Anderson (calf), CB Trumaine Johnson (hamstring) and WR/PR Braxton Berrios (hamstring) were all listed as questionable for the opener against Buffalo, but coach Adam Gase expects all to play. \u2026 Gregg Williams on players saying they enjoy his coaching style: \u201cI say what I mean, I mean what I say. You don\u2019t like fake, phony people. I\u2019m not fake and phony. They understand that I came to grips many years ago that I got a place on Earth to mentor young men, especially young men who don\u2019t get things correctly and convince them to take ownership and do it. We\u2019re in this together. It\u2019s not me versus them, it\u2019s us, at all times. It\u2019s \u2018we\u2019 at all times.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gregg Williams is fired up about the guys on his defense whose job is to make quarterbacks downright uncomfortable.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/jets_pass_rush_football_74436_c0-95-2265-1415_s1770x1032.jpg?23f70df03a622091f4566668e56e18dcdfe6e137", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
