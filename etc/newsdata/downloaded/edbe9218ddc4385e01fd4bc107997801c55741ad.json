The highlight of it was a call to corporations to shift their focus from shareholder primacy to a wider stakeholder primacy.\n\nThe list of stakeholders, according to the association, should include customers, workers, suppliers, communities and shareholders.\n\nThe association, in its own way, is asking for a more mindful version of capitalism. This comes in the backdrop of a sharp criticism by some US politicians of the conduct and motives of US corporations in the run up to next year\u2019s presidential elections in the US.\n\nRegardless of what catalyzed the call for change, it is, at the least, an acknowledgement of reality.\n\nShareholder primacy is a simplistic approach.\n\nIt has two things to recommend its case. One, the fewer people to please, the easier it is to operate. Two, under some circumstances profits can be viewed as a reasonable proxy for social benefits of business operations.\n\nThis approach, however, was never going to work. Business decisions may have negative spillovers on society. From a shareholder\u2019s point of view, a negative spillover is good because the cost is not borne by a corporation. It is transferred to society.\n\nSociety and governments are not going to tolerate this for long.\n\nSeparately, a narrow focus on shareholders comes with its own set of problems. Shareholders are not homogeneous. Therefore, shareholder primacy, in practice, does not have the clarity it does in theory.\n\nThe call to be mindful of a larger of stakeholders is not going to make life easier for managements. Stakeholders have conflicting interests. Trying to please all of them at the same time is impossible. Managements will once again have to confront trade-offs.\n\nYet, the call for being mindful of a wider bunch of stakeholders is a change for the better. Not because it will make decision making easier or less controversial. It is better because it acknowledges the political and economic reality in which business decision making is located.", "description": "The Business Roundtable, an association of some of the leading chief executives of US corporations, recently put out a\u00a0 new statement of purpose.
