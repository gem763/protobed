He was brought up in a phone call July 25 between President Trump and the Ukrainian president. (Sergei Chuzavkov/AP)\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s polarized political universe, there was a \u201cvery good\u201d former Ukraine prosecutor on one side and \u201cvery bad\u201d people on the other.\n\nBut, as is often the case, it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nThe former prosecutor in question appears to be Viktor Shokin, 66, who became Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership.\n\nAt the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors such as United States, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAmong the companies Shokin said was in his sights: Ukrainian natural gas company named Burisma Holdings. A year earlier, then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had joined the Burisma board and was also at a law firm retained by Burisma\u2019s owner, former Ukrainian government official Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nShokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine\u2019s shadows.\n\nBy the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.\n\n[The Trump-Zelensky rough transcript, annotated]\n\n\u201cI heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair,\u201d Trump told Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a July 25 call, according to a rough transcript released Wednesday by the White House. \u201cA lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed that Joe Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Shokin because he was investigating Burisma.\n\nBut the investigation had already been set aside when Biden acted. Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nShokin was named prosecutor general in February 2015, one year after Viktor Yanukovych, the country\u2019s president at the time, fled the country for Russia following street protests and violent clashes in the capital, Kiev.\n\nWestern officials hoped Shokin would aggressively prosecute the extensive corruption \u2014 reportedly totaling in the tens of billions of dollars \u2014 that authorities uncovered among Yanukovych and his associates.\n\nPublic opinion swiftly turned against Shokin, however. He was seen as insufficiently pursuing, and in some instances hindering, cases against the Yanukovych-era officials.\n\nAmong these was an investigation into Zlochevsky, Yanukovych\u2019s minister for ecology and natural resources.\n\nIn 2014, authorities in Britain froze $23 million linked to Zlochevsky as part of a case against him for alleged money laundering. Shokin\u2019s predecessor, Vitaly Yarema, failed to provide documents requested by British officials, and the money was released in the beginning of 2015.\n\nIn September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt gave a speech in which he criticized Shokin for his failure to actively combat corruption.\n\nCalls for Shokin\u2019s dismissal grew through 2015. However, they were resisted by then-President Petro Poroshenko, who had appointed Shokin and with whom he shared a close relationship.\n\nTo pressure Poroshenko to dismiss Shokin, the Obama administration threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees.\n\nIn March 2016, Shokin was dismissed.\n\nRead more:\n\nCracks emerge in GOP amid details in White House transcript\n\nAnalysis: Key takeaways from the rough transcript call with Ukraine\u2019s leader\n\nThe official readout from the Trump-Zelensky call\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president brought up a prosecutor who resigned in 2016 after failing to battle corruption.", "authors": ["David L.
