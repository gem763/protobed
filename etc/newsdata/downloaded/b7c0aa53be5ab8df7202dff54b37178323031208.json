Last week, a State Department official disputed the contention in a complaint filed under federal whistleblower laws by a Central Intelligence Agency officer that another top State Department official, counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, listened in on the call.\n\nHouse Democrats have opened a their inquiry focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, and lawmakers are focusing on the whistleblower complaint and a record of the call released by the administration.\n\nMr. Pompeo said last week that he hadn\u2019t yet read the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in its entirety, but said that to his knowledge, actions by State Department officials had been \u201centirely appropriate and consistent\u201d with administration efforts to improve relations with Ukraine. In those comments, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting, he didn\u2019t mention his own participation in the call, but said the complaint was filed by \u201csomeone who had secondhand knowledge.\u201d\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nSeveral days earlier, Mr. Pompeo said that he opposed releasing the record of the Trump-Zelensky call. He told Fox News Sunday in a Sept. 22 interview that he would defer to the White House on whether to do so.\n\n\u201cThose are private conversations between world leaders, and it\u2019s not often that those are released,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cAnd when they\u2019re [released], it\u2019s done when the White House deems it appropriate.\u201d Mr. Pompeo dismissed a question about details of the call, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in the world.\u201d\n\nThree House committees on Friday subpoenaed Mr. Pompeo for documents related to the inquiry; the secretary has until Oct. 4 to produce them.\n\nRep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) of the intelligence committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) of the House Oversight Committee warned Mr. Pompeo that failing to comply with the subpoena would be taken as evidence of obstruction of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe committees plan to depose former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker; Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent; Mr. Brechbuhl; and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.\n\nMr. Volker resigned his post last week. A representative for Mr. Sondland said Monday that he planned to cooperate with the congressional inquiry.\n\nHouse committees on Monday also subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, for documents related to his efforts to pressure Ukraine to undertake an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, the president\u2019s political rival. The panels are seeking documents related to his communications with Trump administration officials about his efforts in Ukraine, as well as any other documents related to that effort.\n\nMr. Giuliani has given mixed messages on whether he would testify before a House committee. Speaking on ABC News on Sunday, he said he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) but then said \u201cI will consider it.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would hold a trial in the Senate if the House approved articles of impeachment for Mr. Trump, addressing doubts he may circumvent Senate procedures.\n\n\u201cI would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said Monday on CNBC. He added: \u201cHow long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time Mr. McConnell has directly addressed the topic since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said the House would begin an impeachment inquiry focused on allegations Mr. Trump sought to use the powers of his office to push Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, his Democratic rival, and that White House officials acted to conceal evidence of the president\u2019s actions.\n\nThe allegations, based on the complaint filed by the CIA officer and backed by the record of the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, have reverberated internationally.\n\nMr. Zelensky said Monday that his administration wouldn\u2019t release a transcript of the July phone call with Mr. Trump, while also saying he is open to investigating any alleged violation of Ukrainian law.\n\nAlso Monday, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated the Kremlin\u2019s position that no phone-call records should be released without mutual consent. The comments came as Democrats demand to know how the White House used a national-security computer server, where records of Mr. Trump\u2019s calls with leaders from Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2014as well as Ukraine\u2014are said to have been stored.\n\nAt the White House on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out about a whistleblower.\u201d He did not expand on that, and the White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a question about the comment.\n\nMr. Trump has said he deserved to confront the whistleblower and anyone who provided him information and has suggested they are spies who committed treasonous acts. House Democrats are eager to hear testimony from the whistleblower\u2014though in a way that will protect his identity.\n\nShortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s comment, Andrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer who represents the whistleblower wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-led Senate is considered unlikely to convict Mr. Trump in any impeachment trial. Removing the president requires approval by two-thirds of the 100-member Senate. Some Senate Republicans have voiced concern over the allegations outlined in a whistleblower complaint made public last week, but none has voiced support for impeachment.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers may want the chance to exonerate the president should the House approve articles of impeachment.\n\nSenate procedures bar the leader from simply ignoring an impeachment vote in the House, based on guidance contained in a 1986 memo from then-Senate parliamentarian Robert Dove.\n\nIn the case of President Clinton, the House passed articles of impeachment, and he was acquitted in the Senate. President Nixon resigned before a full vote in the House on articles of impeachment.\n\nMr. McConnell could move to dismiss articles of impeachment under Senate precedents, as then-Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) attempted to when Mr. Clinton, who had been impeached by the House, went on trial in the Senate. The dismissal measure failed on a vote of 56-44.\n\nMr. McConnell also could refer the question of impeachment to a special committee. That is how the impeachment of former President Andrew Johnson was handled, but that occurred before the Senate had rules for handling impeachment. As a result, the parliamentarian wrote, the Senate would need to suspend its rules for impeachment to avoid going to the question of trying someone who had been impeached.\n\nThe revelations of the contents of the July phone call between Messrs. Trump and Zelensky thrust the Ukrainian leader into the middle of a partisan fight in the U.S., one of Ukraine\u2019s most important backers financially and politically.\n\nThe call record showed that Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to \u201clook into\u201d political rival Joe Biden and his son and said he would direct Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to contact Mr. Zelensky to help him in a possible investigation.\n\nMr. Zelensky, explaining his reasons for keeping Ukrainian records of the call private, said: \u201cThere are certain nuances and things that it would seem incorrect to publish.\u201d Mr. Zelensky spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a military event.\n\nAsked whether Ukraine would open an investigation into the Bidens, Mr. Zelensky said Ukraine would be open to investigate any violations of law. A Ukrainian official earlier this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe are open, we are ready to investigate, but this has nothing to do with me,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cOur independent law enforcement agencies are ready to investigate any case that violates the law.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe can\u2019t be ordered to do anything. We are an independent country.\u201d\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin didn\u2019t believe contents of conversations between Messers. Putin and Trump should be made public without the consent of both parties.\n\nMr. Peskov told reporters that if \u201cthere are signals from the U.S., we will discuss it,\u201d but he underscored that \u201cin general, diplomatic practice, of course, does not provide for such publications.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry haven\u2019t been shy about voicing their displeasure over diplomatic exchanges, such as the one between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, being made public, and have sought to pre-empt any possible request that Mr. Putin\u2019s discussions with Mr. Trump be exposed.\n\nMr. Peskov said that inquiry under way in the U.S. is \u201can internal matter.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andrey Yermak, who spoke to Mr. Giuliani soon after the July call, said that Ukraine doesn\u2019t want to get involved in domestic U.S. politics.\n\nMr. Yermak said the Ukrainian administration was preparing for another Zelensky-Trump meeting\u2014this time in an official visit to Washington\u2014without providing more details.\n\nWrite to Courtney McBride at courtney.mcbride@wsj.com", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a senior State Department official said.
