The caller told dispatchers he'd tried to get his friends to get off the bus with him but Maccarone wouldn't let them.\n\n\"The bus driver, Catherine, she was drunk, because she passed three red lights and she got on the side road by the 76. And there's still kids on there,\" the child told the dispatcher. \"She's like wobbling and her eyes, you can tell, she was drunk,\"\n\nUsing the boy's description, police officers found Maccarone, 48, just before 4 p.m. on Sept. 12 and \"smelled an obvious odor of intoxicants\" coming from the driver according to a Facebook post from the Longview Police Department.\n\nPolice said she had just completed two afternoon bus routes, but there were no children on the bus at the time of the arrest.\n\n27 died in a bus crash 30 years ago: Survivors still trying to cope with horrific memories\n\nUp to 90 children may have been on the bus that day with Maccarone, who has been a bus driver for one year, Rick Parrish, Longview Public School district's communications coordinator, told ABC News.\n\nMaccarone has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation that is expected to be completed early next week, according to a statement from Longview Public Schools. Superintendent Dan Zorn said a transportation representative from the state's Department of Education will review the district's bus operations and may offer additional safety recommendation.\n\n\u201cTo help ensure this situation never happens again we implemented an improved process for screening drivers prior to driving their routes each day,\" said Zorn in a statement. \"The safety and security of our students and staff is a top priority.\u201d\n\nMaccarone was booked into Cowlitz County Jail for driving under the influence and reckless endangerment.
