Nearby beaches had not a surfer in sight, only towering dashing waves.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, closing in from the Pacific, is expected to bring up to 80 centimeters (30 inches) of rain in the Tokyo area, including Chiba to the north that had suffered power outages from a typhoon that hit last month, and some buildings remained partly repaired.\n\nRugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events have been canceled. Flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier this week, including urging people to stay indoors.\n\nSome residents taped up their apartment windows in case they shattered. TV talks shows showed footage of household items like a slipper bashing through glass when hurled by winds as powerful as the approaching typhoon.\n\nThe typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and a half-million houses flooded.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet held a disaster management meeting Friday. He said 17,000 police and military troops were ready for rescue operations.", "description": "Tokyo and surrounding areas braced for a powerful typhoon forecast as the worst in six decades, with streets and trains stations unusually quiet Saturday as rain poured over the city.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212776916-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
