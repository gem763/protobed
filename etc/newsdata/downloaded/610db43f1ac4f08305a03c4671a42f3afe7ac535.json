Television screens showed the Cubs losing again, moving the Brewers to the verge of another postseason berth.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d one Brewer yelled as the Pirates piled it on against Chicago.\n\nAlready, it was quite a party. The real one was now only one more win away.\n\nRyan Braun added to his impressive total of homers at Great American Ball Park, and the Brewers moved one win away from clinching a wild-card berth Tuesday night, beating the Cincinnati Reds 4-2 for their fifth straight victory.\n\n\u201cTo do it here tomorrow would be incredible,\u201d said Brent Suter (4-0 ), who attended Ken Griffey Jr.\u2019s high school in Cincinnati. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for it.\u201d\n\nJust like last season, when Milwaukee put on a late rush to take the NL Central title, the Brewers have closed in on a playoff spot with a September flourish. They\u2019ve won 16 of 18, positioning themselves for one of the NL wild cards along with Washington.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve recognized what\u2019s at stake,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cI think the common theme in both cases is we were chasing something, and that\u2019s lent some urgency to everything we\u2019ve done. And I think our players have responded really well to that sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nA win at Great American on Wednesday night or losses by the Cubs and Mets would give Milwaukee a second straight playoff appearance. The Brewers trail the Cardinals in the NL Central.\n\nWith 2018 National League MVP Christian Yelich sidelined by a broken right kneecap, the Brewers have turned to their deep bullpen and different combinations of hitting stars each night. Milwaukee has the best record in the majors in September at 18-4.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen glimpses of it being there, but it all started to fall into place for us,\u201d said Adrian Houser, who worked the first four innings.\n\nBraun connected for his 21st homer off Sonny Gray (11-8), making the final start of his All-Star season. Braun\u2019s 27 homers at Great American his most in any road ballpark, and his 44 career against Cincinnati are his highest total against any team.\n\nBraun has been a solid contributor lately, going 9 for 21 in his last seven games. He also singled off Gray, who went five innings and fanned six to top 200 strikeouts for the first time in his career.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI know we lost, and I hate to lose, but it\u2019s a good feeling. It\u2019s been quite a ride this year. I\u2019m overwhelmed with emotion.\u201d\n\nYasmani Grandal\u2019s double tied it at 2 in the third, and Keston Hiura put the Brewers ahead to stay with a sacrifice fly.\n\nHouser gave up a broken-bat RBI double by Aristides Aquino and a run-scoring single by Tucker Barnhart in the first inning. The Reds lead the majors with 128 runs and 125 RBIs in the first inning.\n\nSuter allowed three hits in three innings. Josh Hader allowed a pair of hits in the ninth before fanning Kyle Farmer on a slider for his 36th save in 42 chances.\n\nAND THIS ONE BELONGS \u2026\n\nMarty Brennaman began his last series after 46 years broadcasting Reds games. He hasn\u2019t decided what to say in his final sign-off Thursday, but said it will be \u201cthe hardest day of my life.\u201d\n\nSENSATIONAL SUTER\n\nThe left-hander matched his season high with three innings. He has allowed only six hits and no runs in his last 15 innings, becoming an integral part of the Brewers\u2019 September surge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than we could have ever thought. He\u2019s doing his thing, and he keeps doing it and he\u2019s doing it very well.\u201d\n\nSHADES OF GRAY\n\nGray and Luis Castillo are the first duo of Reds pitchers to reach 200 strikeouts in a season. Gray has allowed six or fewer hits in his last 33 starts, a major league record.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBrewers: RH Brandon Woodruff won\u2019t pitch in Cincinnati, Counsell said. Woodruff returned from an oblique injury on Sept. 17 and had made a pair of two-inning appearances as the Brewers ease him back.\n\nReds: INF Freddy Galvis was still sick from a virus that has affected a half-dozen Reds in the last few days.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: Jordan Lyles (11-8) is 6-1 with a 2.35 ERA in 10 starts with Milwaukee, which got him from Pittsburgh on July 29.\n\nReds: Tyler Mahle (2-11) hasn\u2019t won since May 31, but has been a victim of a blown save in two of his last four starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The clubhouse rocked with music played by a DJ.
