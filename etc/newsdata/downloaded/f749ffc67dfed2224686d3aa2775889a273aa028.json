You\u2019re going to war, they\u2019re hugging and kissing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even look at the opposition. You\u2019re going into battle against them. The game hasn\u2019t changed that much. The players have changed!\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\n\u201cChat to them after the game. Or don\u2019t even chat to them after the game.\u201d\n\nBut Firmino has played down the pre-match pleasantries, telling ESPN Brazil: \"I don\u2019t want to create controversy with anyone.\n\n\u201cI find it quite normal before the game to greet each other, ask how they are doing. That\u2019s all. Nothing more than that.\n\n\u201cBut on the pitch, they aren\u2019t friends, each one defends his club to the best of his ability. Then the rivalry increases on the pitch.\u201d\n\nThe spoils were shared on an afternoon of VAR controversy at the Theatre of Dreams, with Adam Lallana's late strike cancelling out Marcus Rashford's first-half opener.", "description": "The Liverpool striker insisted embracing players on the opposition before the match is \"normal\"", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Sky Sports"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20676792.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Roberto-Firmino-defends-hugs-and-kisses-after-Roy-Keanes-Man-Utd-Liverpool-rant.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
