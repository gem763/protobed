Kennedy International Airport in New York City around 10:30 a.m., the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York confirmed.\n\nCorreia surrendered after returning to the U.S., a law enforcement official said. The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said investigators had been in touch with Corriea\u2019s representatives while the 44-year-old Florida resident was out of the country and had arranged for the surrender.\n\nDavid Correia More\n\nHe is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, said Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. The other defendants, Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, as well as Andrey Kukushkin, a California resident, are expected to appear for initial hearings in the same courthouse on Thursday.\n\nCorreia, a 44-year-old Florida resident, was the only one of four co-defendants who was not arrested Oct. 10, when federal prosecutors announced the charges.\n\nCorreia is the only one of the co-defendants who was born in the United States, the indictment shows. Parnas and Kukushkin are U.S. citizens who were born in Ukraine, and Fruman is a U.S. citizen who was born in Belarus, the indictment said.\n\nThe co-defendants are accused of illegally funneling thousands of dollars in foreign money to U.S. election candidates and committees in an effort to buy influence.\n\nParnas and Fruman helped Rudy Giuliani meet a Ukrainian prosecutor as the president's personal lawyer pushed for an investigation into Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Both of the men are among prospective witnesses House Democrats want to question in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nPart attorney, part investigator: How Rudy Giuliani's many roles for Trump could play out in impeachment inquiry\n\nScheme focused on cannabis licenses, Trump PAC\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Parnas, Fruman, Correia and Kukushkin schemed with an unidentified foreign national who is a Russian citizen to get retail marijuana licenses in U.S. states, including Nevada.\n\nIn or around September and October 2018, prosecutors allege, Correia drafted a table of prospective political donations. The table allegedly described a multistate licensing strategy that would funnel $1 million to $2 million in contributions to federal and state political committees.\n\nThe plan allegedly included a funding schedule of two $500,000 transfers. The foreign national arranged for the funds to be wired on or around Sept. 18, 2018, and Oct. 16, 2018, from overseas accounts to a U.S. corporate bank account controlled by Fruman and another individual,\u201d the indictment charges.\n\nThe alleged conspirators are accused of taking steps to hide the foreign national\u2019s involvement and role in the funding. In Kukushkin's words, hiding the foreign national's role was necessary because of \"his Russian roots and current political paranoia about it,\" the indictment says.\n\nParnas and Fruman, who live in Florida and have family and business ties to Ukraine, have become political players in recent years.\n\nIn May 2018, Parnas posted pictures on Facebook of himself and Fruman with Trump in the White House and with the president's son Donald Jr. in California. That was the same month their company, Global Energy Producers, was credited with giving $325,000 to the committee that supports Trump's reelection, America First Action SuperPac.\n\nProsecutors allege Parnas and Fruman created that company and \u201cintentionally caused certain large contributions to be reported in the name of GEP instead of their own names,\u201d the indictment says.\n\nAmong their beneficiaries, according to court documents, was a U.S. congressman who received $5,400 last year from the pair who also pledged to raise $20,000 for the lawmaker as they sought to enlist him in an effort to remove Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.", "description": "David Correia and three other men, including two Giuliani associates, are charged with conspiring to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns.", "authors": ["Kevin Mccoy", "Kevin Johnson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bwjqh9ZpUnYOmkzUo8BsEQ--~B/aD0xNTY7dz0xNjU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a37d612057832b03239e6847ff356f65", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
