Yet calling his actions \u201ca breach of national security,\u201d Pelosi formally declared an inquiry that could result in his removal from office.\n\nPelosi, who has been under growing pressure from House Democrats since the Russia probe to press ahead with impeachment, finally relented on Tuesday. In a speech that repeatedly referenced the founding of the Constitution, the speaker declared that \u201cnobody is above the law.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks as she participates in question and answer session with Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, as part of the Atlantic Festival, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019 in Washington.

In response to Pelosi\u2019s speech Trump declared that the inquiry was yet another \u201cwitch hunt\u201d perpetrated by Democrats seeking his ouster.\n\nSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nAccording to counts from The New York Times, 176 Representatives in the House support an impeachment inquiry, with 74 still undecided or against moving forward with an inquiry. Meanwhile, 185 still have yet to decide.\n\n\n\n\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
