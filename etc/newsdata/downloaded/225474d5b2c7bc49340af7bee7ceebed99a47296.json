Investors know that we are not going to get a proper deal, but are still looking for some bit of good news to digest,\" said Jason Browne, president at Alexis Investment Partners LLC in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nStock markets have been rankled by weak economic indicators showing a contraction in U.S. manufacturing and a bleak reading on business activity, bolstering bets of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve to combat a slowdown.\n\nData on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September, while underlying inflation retreated.\n\nApple Inc rose 1.2%, lifting the technology sector by 0.6%, after Longbow Research upgraded the company's stock to \"buy\", citing higher iPhone 11 demand.\n\nApple suppliers Skyworks Solutions Inc and Qorvo Inc gained 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively, after Cowen and Co upgraded its rating on both the companies, expecting them to benefit from higher iPhone demand.\n\nAt 12:43 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 135.10 points, or 0.51%, at 26,481.11, the S&P 500 was up 17.75 points, or 0.61%, at 2,937.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 41.08 points, or 0.52%, at 7,944.83.\n\nAmong other stocks, Delta Air Lines Inc fell 2.8%, the most on the S&P 500, after the carrier forecast disappointing current-quarter profit.\n\nCisco Systems Inc dropped 2%, after a report that Goldman Sachs downgraded the network gear maker's shares to \"neutral\".\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.80-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded five new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 91 new lows.
