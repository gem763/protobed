(Pictures: NBC)\n\nRemember the episode of Friends where Chandler discovers Monica has a secret closet full of junk? (It\u2019s in episode 14 of season eight and is literally called The One With The Secret Closet if you want to go back and refresh your memory).\n\nWell, one fan has noticed it wasn\u2019t always the mess it became later on in the hit show\u2019s run.\n\nIn episode 13 of season one (entitled The One with the Boobies), there\u2019s a very brief scene of Monica in a towel and shower cap, but the secret closet in question is wide open for the world to see.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not actually the mess it\u2019s made out to be in season eight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one fan of the show took to Reddit to share their hypothesis: \u2018My theory has always been that she didn\u2019t get super compulsive and obsessed with cleaning until after her failed relationships and dealing with the loss of her jobs and whatnot.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think it got to the tipping point after Richard and she just started piling things in there to deal and pretending that everything is fine [be]cause the rest of the apartment is spotless. Just throwing my ideas out there,\u2019 they added.\n\nAnother fan responded: \u2018This has ALWAYS bugged me. It looks fairly neat there, does it just accumulate over time and get progressively more in the s**t.\u2019\n\nMonica frantically cleaning (Picture: NBC)\n\nThen one fan added their personal story: \u2018That\u2019s actually a pretty good theory, and one that I can personally relate to.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always been compulsive and obsessed with organization to a degree but I and some of my friends/family noticed that it got a lot worse during my senior year of high school which was right after someone I cared about had betrayed me in a pretty awful way,\u2019 they added.\n\nIn episode two of season one, Monica can be seen frantically cleaning her apartment in anticipation of the arrival of her parents, so it looks like she\u2019s always had her cleaning habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooks like we may never know what the truth is, but breakups certainly can be pretty life-changing.\n\nWant to know some more Friends secrets?
