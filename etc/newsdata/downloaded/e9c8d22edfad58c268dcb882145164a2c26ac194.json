Teams that have won the first two games in the 2-3-2 format have won 21 of 24 times.\n\nThe Cardinals have scored only one run in 18 innings.\n\nIn Game 1, Anibal Sanchez carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning in a 2-0 victory Friday.\n\nIn 2013, Sanchez and Scherzer, as members of the Detroit Tigers, held the Boston Red Sox hitless in the first two games of the ALCS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice going back up 2-0 in the series, but those guys are really good over there,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez told reporters. \u201cThe series is far from over. We got a day off tomorrow, we\u2019re going to spend the night, get a good rest and work out tomorrow for a little while, and then get back at it the next day.\n\n\u201cWe got [Stephen Strasburg] on the mound, so hopefully he comes out and gives us what he can. And hopefully he does what Sanchie and Scherzer did the last two games. But we still got a long way to go.\u201d\n\nStrasbue will be opposed by Jack Flaherty.\n\n\u201cThis team\u2019s got a lot of personality and a lot of grit to it,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cAnd we got, really, 25 guys, no matter who it is, when their number gets called, they\u2019re going to lay it all on the line for each other. It\u2019s such a treat to be in the clubhouse like this and \u2026 to know that that\u2019s the type of baseball we\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nAfter walking Kolten Wong in the first inning, Scherzer retired 16 consecutive batters until he walked Dexter Fowler in the sixth inning.\n\nHis no-hit bid was broken up by Paul Goldschmidt with a line-drive single to open the seventh. He left the game after striking out 11 and walking two.\n\nSean Doolittle relieved Scherzer and ended the inning with a strikeout and a double play.\n\n\u201cHe was dynamite,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI mean, his stuff was good, his changeup was really good today, utilized it well. Fastball was good. He was locating his fastball early in the count, so he was good.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals took a 1-0 lead on a third-inning homer by Michael A. Taylor.\n\nCardinals starter Adam Wainwright also was strong, working 7 1/3 inning with 11 strikeouts.\n\nHe allowed Adam Eaton\u2019s two-run double with one out in the eighth. Andrew Miller finished the inning by retiring two batters.\n\nThe Cardinals ended a 22-inning drought without a run in the eighth. Paul DeJong singled with two outs and pinch-hitter Jose Martinez doubled over the head of center fielder Michael Taylor. But Dexter Fowler flew out to right field to end the inning.\n\nIn all the Cardinals had three hits.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 The Washington Nationals took a 2-0 lead in the National League Championship Series with back-to-back sterling performers by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
