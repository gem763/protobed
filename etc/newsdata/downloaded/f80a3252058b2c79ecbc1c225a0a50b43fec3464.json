It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgements.\n\n\"But, in this instance, I don't think Naga's words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made.\n\n\"There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear.\n\n\"She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.\"\n\nWhat was said\n\nThe controversy started on July 17 when Munchetty and her co-anchor Dan Walker discussed Trump's tweet and Munchetty's experience as a woman of color.\n\nMunchetty said: \"Every time I have been told, as a woman of color, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism. Now I'm not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.\"\n\nShe added that she imagined \"lots of people\" in the United Kingdom would be feeling \"absolutely furious ... that a man in that position feels it's okay to skirt the lines with using language like that.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit said it was \"entirely legitimate\" for Munchetty to discuss \"her own experience of racism and the racist context\" for remarks similar to those made by Trump.\n\nBut the body partially upheld a viewer complaint against Munchetty because she \"went on to comment critically on the possible motive for, and potential consequences of, the president's words.\"\n\n\"Judgments of that kind are for the audience to make, and the exchange fell short of due impartiality in that respect,\" it concluded.\n\nTrump has denied his attacks on the four US Congresswomen were racist.\n\nThe backlash\n\nThe outrage was swift, with journalists at the BBC and its competitors calling out the network for the reprimand \u2014 and for seemingly ignoring her white co-anchor's part in the conversation.\n\n\"You've got a hell of job to do with non-white members of staff and indeed lots of members of the public who are outraged,\" BBC radio anchor Nick Robinson told Jordan during a BBC interview broadcast Friday.\n\nJordan said that many people were misinterpreting the decision, saying it was \"perfectly acceptable\" for Munchetty to describe the phrases used by Trump as \"clearly racist.\"\n\nThe problem arose when Munchetty appeared to assign \"motivations\" for why Trump wrote the tweet.\n\n\"In the politics of the present, where we are into politics of name calling and insult ... I think it's probably unwise for the BBC to get ourselves into a position where we're calling out people for being liars or being racist,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"What is really important is that we look at the things that people say, that we analyze them, that we describe them objectively and as analytically as we can and we call them out for what they are at the time,\" he explained.\n\n\"So if someone has told a lie we expose it for a lie,\" he added. \"If someone has made a racist remark, we make sure that people are aware that that language is inherently racist.\"", "description": "The BBC has reversed its decision to reprimand anchor Naga Munchetty over her comments about President Donald Trump's racist language.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190930163639-naga-munchetty-bafta-awards-0509-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
