We\u2019re aware they\u2019ve all made efforts to improve. We are saying these efforts have been insufficient. They have to do better,\u201d Ms. Dillon said on Twitter where she shared the letters. \u201cThis week it\u2019s us, but every candidate is at risk of disinformation campaigns.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything we can do to be helpful in preventing the spread of this kind of information against us, or any of our opponents, please let us know what we can do,\u201d she wrote in the letters. \u201cBecause the future of our democracy depends on you getting this right.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Facebook, Twitter and Google did not immediately return messages requesting comment.\n\nDanny Sullivan, Google\u2019s public liaison for its search division, previously denied the company did anything to intentional promote the rumors and said that the story trended because of user interest.\n\nFederal investigators have assessed that Russian internet users spread disinformation on social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential race in tandem with a state-sponsored effort to interfere in the U.S. electoral process, and companies across Silicon Valley has subsequently attempted to rein in abuse on their platforms ahead of 2020.\n\nA former Democratic congressman for Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke is among 10 presidential candidates set to participate in the next and third primary debate scheduled for September 12.
