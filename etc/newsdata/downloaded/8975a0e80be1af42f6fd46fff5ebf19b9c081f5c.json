Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter, has said the\n\ncrippling attack on its oil sites was \"unquestionably sponsored\"\n\nby bitter regional rival Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump said\n\nthere were many options short of war with Iran and added that he\n\nhad ordered the U.S. Treasury to \"substantially increase\n\nsanctions\" on Tehran. \"Prices may have found equilibrium for now,\" said Michael\n\nMcCarthy, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. Quick\n\nrecovery in Saudi oil production would confirm disruption could\n\nbe temporary, he said.\n\nMeanwhile oil analytics firm Kayrros estimated Saudi Arabia\n\nlost about 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil output after\n\ncrude oil inventories plunged nearly 10 million barrels as of\n\nSept. 16 compared with pre-attack levels.\n\nStill, the head of the International Energy Agency said on\n\nWednesday it does not see a need to release emergency oil stocks\n\nas markets are well supplied. While tensions in the Middle East remained elevated, the\n\nWhite House's response on Wednesday to Saudi producing evidence\n\nthat it said implicated Iran in the attacks pointed to a more\n\nmeasured approach in handling the region's issues, said McCarthy\n\nat CMC Markets.\n\nSeparately, weekly data from the Energy Information\n\nAdministration on U.S. oil inventories provided a mixed\n\nsnapshot.\n\nCrude oil stockpiles at the world's largest oil producer\n\nrose by 1.1 million barrels last week against analysts'\n\nexpectations for a drop of 2.5 million barrels.\n\nHowever, stocks in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for\n\nbenchmark futures, fell to the lowest since October 2018.\n\nEIA/S", "description": "CORRECTED-Oil prices settle after turbulent week as Saudi Arabia reassures on output", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
