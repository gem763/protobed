The SpaceX boss tweeted an image showing the first two parts of what will soon be the \u2018test hopper,\u2019 shown above\n\nWHAT IS ELON MUSK'S 'BFR'? The BFR (Big F***ing Rocket), now known as Starship, will complete all missions and is smaller than the ones Musk announced in 2016. The SpaceX CEO said the rocket would take its first trip to the red planet in 2022, carrying only cargo, followed by a manned mission in 2024 and claimed other SpaceX's products would be 'cannibalised' to pay for it. The rocket would be partially reusable and capable of flight directly from Earth to Mars. Once built, Musk believes the rocket could be used for travel on Earth - saying that passengers would be able to get anywhere in under an hour.\n\nPictured, Elon Musk speaks during an unveiling event for the Boring Co last year\n\nTickets on Elon Musk\u2019s spaceship to Mars will cost around $200,000 per person.\n\nSpaceX shared new details about the 387ft rocket in September, saying it hopes to begin unmanned launch tests of the spacecraft in late 2019.\n\nIn the future, Starship will be able to carry out lunar missions as well as long-distance flights to Mars and beyond.\n\nThe firm hopes to stage an uncrewed flight to Mars in 2022, then a manned flight in 2024.\n\nIn between those missions, SpaceX has planned for a private mission with a passenger on board in 2023.\n\n'We would like to put large cargo on the surface of the moon by 2022,' SpaceX chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell said recently.\n\n'And we have our eyes on the prize to send people to Mars in 2024.'", "description": "New pictures released this week show construction underway on the test vehicle of the SpaceX ship that could one day bring humans tourists to Mars.
