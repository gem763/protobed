All this character did (so he claims) was have consensual extramarital affairs with underlings at his Today-like program. That used to be allowed. Didn\u2019t everyone know what he was up to? Nevertheless, he finds himself fired in the middle of the night, hours before he\u2019s meant to go on the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am as innocent as any straight, middle-aged man there is,\u201d says Carell\u2019s character, Mitch, in the new one-hour drama The Morning Show. \u201cThe only problem is, that seems to be illegal these days. This is McCarthyism.\u201d\n\nHis producer (Mark Duplass) chimes in, \u201cWe\u2019re being too fast to judge men in the court of public opinion. I agree with you. The whole MeToo movement is probably an overcorrection for centuries of bad behavior that more enlightened men like you and me had nothing to do with.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not enough for Carell\u2019s character: \u201cAt first they came for the rapists and I did not speak up because I am not a rapist. And then they came for the powerful men, and you did not speak out because you are not a powerful man. But what are you going to do when they come for the ordinary, everyday run-of-the-mill creep like you, Chip?\u201d Whether you find that outrageous or merely common sense, this is smart, bold writing.\n\nThe Morning Show, of which I\u2019ve seen the first three episodes, is the big-bucks centerpiece of Apple\u2019s attempt to become the new HBO. Its streaming service, Apple TV+, debuts on November 1 with a (small) slate of original series and films. Apple has said its goal is quality, not quantity, and as it is sitting on a mountain of money (more than $200 billion), it is free to go to extreme lengths to deliver: The budget for the first two seasons of this show is reportedly a preposterous $300 million. There are no dragons or zombie battles; this is a show about people talking. Its leads, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, are said to be pocketing $1 million each per episode. Still, the show isn\u2019t costing you much, if anything; Apple is making an entire year of the service available free to recent buyers of its products. Otherwise it\u2019s $5 a month.\n\nThat\u2019s why critics shouldn\u2019t review the budget of anything: The question is really whether The Morning Show is worth your time. It is: It\u2019s an engaging, reflective look at complicated characters, at least in the first three hours that I\u2019ve seen. Carell\u2019s is the most intriguing of the three principals but there\u2019s also a great hook to Aniston\u2019s anchor Alex. What if Savannah Guthrie really liked Matt Lauer and was devastated when he got fired? What if she also didn\u2019t think his sexual past was disqualifying? Aniston has even more likability in the bank than Carell does, but she plainly doesn\u2019t want to be cutely sardonic anymore (though it\u2019s what she\u2019s best at). So her character is a control-freak/bitch-queen who rages at people in her limo one minute then poses as America\u2019s morning princess on the red carpet 30 seconds later.\n\nWitherspoon, as a feisty field reporter (people keep calling her \u201cconservative,\u201d but none of the writers can bear to give her anything actually conservative to say, and she sounds like the Sierra Club when she talks about coal), has the least interesting role: \u201cBradley Jackson,\u201d who is known for once dropping two F-bombs on live TV and is therefore known as \u201cTwo F***s Jackson,\u201d a sobriquet the show\u2019s writers find funnier than it is. Bradley is more or less a theft of Holly Hunter\u2019s character from Broadcast News: tiny, working-class, with a chip on her shoulder and a bossy determination to keep the news real. She wears leather motorcycle jackets to show us she\u2019s not like the pampered princess Aniston plays. A more intriguing figure is the charming, duplicitous head of the network played by Billy Crudup with an Almost Famous smile and a secret plan to rid himself of Alex (who is getting a bit old for TV). \u201cWatching a beloved woman\u2019s breakdown is timeless American entertainment,\u201d he says, a twinkle in his eye. Crudup is perfect in this role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex and Mitch were broadcast partners for 15 years and even had a brief affair, which Mitch calls \u201ca thing\u201d but which she derides as \u201ctwo times you got on top of me.\u201d In the wake of his departure, she realizes her hand is both stronger and weaker than it used to be amid contract renegotiations, but she has a scheme to turn the tables on her bosses. In the third episode, both she and Bradley deliver I-am-woman-hear-me-roar speeches, which fall flat; a show like this needs to immerse us in the details of its world instead of lapsing into women\u2019s-magazine clich\u00e9s about how tough it is for a woman on the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting bogged down in pandering (the show\u2019s intended audience is obviously upscale middle-aged women) is one potential trap; another is Advanced Sorkin Syndrome \u2014 excruciatingly cute dialogue that sounds endlessly massaged by a writer smirking at his own cleverness. So far the show\u2019s most unbearably Sorkiny moment arrives when a young P.A. mimics Veruca Salt while crawling onto the lap of the middle-aged weatherman twice her age. Less of that would be welcome.\n\nWith its lush locations \u2014 black-tie parties, apartments the size of airport terminals \u2014 The Morning Show could also turn into a soapy fantasyland. Its cast and its characters are such strong assets, though, that I have hopes that it\u2019ll continue to be interesting. Perhaps it will live up to its premise, which is Broadcast News with less idealism and more ruthlessness.", "description": "Apple's venture into television features an intriguing series set at a morning-news show, starring Steve Carrell, Jennifer Aniston, and Reese Witherspoon.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Matthew Continetti", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Rich Lowry", "Ben Shapiro", "Dan Mclaughlin", "Kevin D.
