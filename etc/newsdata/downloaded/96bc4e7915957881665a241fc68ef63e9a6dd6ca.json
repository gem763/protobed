Me! In the Dadbod flesh! In fact, before the contest, I\u2019ll be speaking on campus, to actual humans in an actual auditorium, in a school event, delivering a lecture entitled \u201cWisconsin Must Beat Michigan To Save All of Humankind.\u201d\n\nThis is a thing that is actually happening\u2014I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019m really committing to the bit. By now you know there is no joke I will not happily drive straight into the turf.\n\n\u201c I majored in ambivalence and minored in beer. \u201d\n\nMy bag is packed. I\u2019ve got my Wisconsin jacket, my Wisconsin track top, two Wisconsin ball caps and at least five Wisconsin T-shirts of various styles. In the past couple of years, I have spent at least several hundred dollars accumulating this nonsense, and because of this, I will not be able to afford birthday presents this year for either one of my children. It\u2019s fine: My children are young and easily fooled. I\u2019ll just pull a few back issues of the Journal out of the recycling bin and tell them I got them \u201cfancy art paper.\u201d\n\nThis sort of rah-rah, unbridled, wear-it-on-my-sleeve enthusiasm is jarring for me. Until recently, I wasn\u2019t exactly the school spirit type. I didn\u2019t have spirit for much of anything. I was a scoffer, a cynic, a crank, an indifferent bump on a log. I rolled my eyes at any display of passion. I would have never worn a Wisconsin T-shirt when I actually lived in, you know, Wisconsin. I\u2019m not bragging about this; it was kind of pathetic. I majored in ambivalence and minored in beer.\n\nDo you how many Wisconsin football games I went to when I went to school at Wisconsin? Zero! Come on, people. Do you really think I got up that early? (We also didn\u2019t win much back then.)\n\nBut getting older does funny things to you. You start eating earlier and talking to strangers on airplanes. You develop strong opinions about comfortable shoes and read spiffy magazine articles about Nantucket. You also begin to feel sentimental for things you never felt sentimental for before\u2014like a university where you spent four years barely paying attention and which you now rabidly defend against all comers, especially ones you work with who attended Michigan.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a part of getting older. We throw ourselves out into the world, try to connect to real things, and invariably, an aging heart returns to places where we felt connected and warm.\n\nI can barely remember the name of a single class I took in Madison\u2014sorry, Wisconsin!\u2014but my closest friends from school are still close friends now. The whole experience feels more meaningful the further I get away from it. I know a lot of you have similar emotions. Even\u2014fine\u2014Wolverines.\n\nThat\u2019s nostalgia, of course, and it\u2019s a powerful substance. It\u2019s how libraries\u2014and football stadiums\u2014get built with alumni names on the front door. It\u2019s why 25th reunions are better attended than 10th reunions.\n\nIt\u2019s why I\u2019ll be screaming and drinking beer at 11 a.m. on a Saturday in Madison, Wis. Not like I needed motivation. Michigan\u2019s in town, and the fate of the planet is on the line.", "description": "A once-ambivalent student feels the passion for his alma mater.", "authors": ["Jason Gay", "Jason.Gay Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FA325_JASONG_SOC_20190919110905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
