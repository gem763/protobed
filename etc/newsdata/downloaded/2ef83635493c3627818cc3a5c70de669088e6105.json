Two students in her cohort are accused of saying she had a \u201cweird Asian name\u201d and joking that she was bipolar.\n\nThe students are also being accused of saying Sanjeevi only made it into the psychology programme because she was \u201cgiven a handout\u201d as an international student from Malaysia, the report said.\n\nOne of the students allegedly also spread rumors that Sanjeevi was \u201cmentally unstable\u201d because she was worried about being deported after Donald Trump was elected as the President of the US in 2016, it added.\n\nCounseling center dismissed her concerns\n\nAccording to The Salt Lake Tribune, Sanjeevi reported the bullying to at least five faculty members over the course of several months, in addition to a member of the school\u2019s counseling center, student conduct office, and the affirmative action department.\n\nHowever, the psychologist from the counseling center dismissed Sanjeevi\u2019s concerns, while students allegedly called her names after finding out that she had made a report, the report added.\n\nFelt that she did not matter\n\nAccording to American news website The Daily Beast, Sanjeevi reportedly told a friend that she was \u201coverwhelmed by the department\u2019s apparent apathy\u201d days before she killed herself.\n\nIn a note left behind, Sanjeevi reportedly said that when the department dismissed her bullying report, they \u201cprovided a final confirmation that I did, in fact, not matter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWatching the department not only choose to not enact consequences, but to give an award to the sick person who bullied me, was the last nail in my coffin. My heart was broken,\u201d she was quoted by The Daily Beast as saying.\n\nA USU spokesperson, Amanda DeRito, disputed the lawsuit claims and was quoted by Utah-based news website The Salt Lake Tribune as saying: \u201cWe believe Utah State took all appropriate action[s] to address interpersonal issues between students in the department.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the lawsuit is seeking unspecified financial damages for Sanjeevi\u2019s family, who lives in Malaysia.\n\nIf you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts or is in emotional distress, you may contact the following:\n\nSingapore:\n\nSamaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444\n\nMalaysia:\n\nBefrienders Malaysia: 603-79568145.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The bullying allegedly started during Jerusha Sanjeevi, first school semester in 2016, and it reportedly got even worse after that..
