He was a bright and charismatic young man with a smile that would have made a model jealous. He was college-educated with a degree in nutrition and an interest in advancing his studies.\n\nHe didn\u2019t box because he had to; he boxed because he loved it. It\u2019s what he wanted to do more than anything else.\n\nOn Saturday in a fight in Chicago against 2016 Olympian Charles Conwell, 27-year-old Day suffered serious brain injuries and was taken to a local hospital. On Wednesday, he died as a result of traumatic brain injury.\n\nPatrick Day, shown here at an October 2018 press conference, died Wednesday as a result of injuries suffered from a knockout vs. Charles Conwell (not pictured) on Saturday.

Day\u2019s family lived across the street from Higgins\u2019 and Higgins still remembers the day when Day\u2019s family brought infant Patrick home from the hospital.\n\n\u201cOur families are family,\u201d Higgins wrote in a text message to Yahoo Sports. \u201cHe was not just my boxer, but my son.\u201d\n\nWe grieve because we\u2019ll never see that brilliant smile of his again, and never get to hear him tell a joke.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Day is one of the lucky ones in that he died doing what he most wanted to do and he was surrounded by the people he loved the most when he died. Many young people die in war in a distant land fighting for who knows what cause.\n\nThere\u2019s a famous quote that says, \u201cSomebody should tell us right at the start of our lives that we are dying. Then we might live life to the limit, every minute of every day. Do it, I say! Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows.\u201d\n\nDay, tragically, has run out of tomorrows.\n\nDay knew, like every person who pulls those gloves over their hands and bounds up those steps and into a ring, the horrible possibility that might await him. Every one of them does.\n\nFew of them talk about it because, well, would you? But they know. They all know. They just sort of play the odds. There are very few deaths and a lot of fights and the odds of you being the one are infinitesimal.\n\nPatrick Day is taken out of the ring on a stretcher after being knocked out by Charles Conwell in the 10th round at Wintrust Arena on Oct. 12, 2019 in Chicago. (Dylan Buell/Getty Images)\n\nFormer world champion Jessie Vargas, who is carving out a terrific second career as a boxing analyst, said fighters understand what they\u2019re getting into but they love the challenge the sport presents.\n\n\u201cAs fighters, we don\u2019t think of those risks, plain and simple,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe know they\u2019re there. We just try to minimize it the best way we can. We try to have the best defense possible. We try to stay smart and coherent during the fight. Listen, though, I\u2019m going to be honest: This is a difficult thing for a fighter to talk about. It\u2019s hard to find even one fighter who wants to speak about this. We know we are at risk. We know the sacrifices we\u2019re making. It\u2019s common sense, and I think the fans are realizing it now, as well.\n\n\u201cBut the minute we are inside that ring, the only thing that is on our minds is winning. Even if you\u2019re down on points, if you\u2019re behind on cards, you\u2019re still looking for a way to win. At the end of the day, you\u2019re doing this for your family and your people and the fans who are tuning in. We also do it out of pride. All of that has something to do with it. You hear the cheers and you hear the people chanting your name and as fighters, when that happens, it\u2019s inspiring and you\u2019ll see us step it up a notch. We understand what could happen, but we choose not to think of that because you can\u2019t perform that way. We instead take this risk because we want to do this for our families and we want to hear that crowd go crazy and get that big win.\u201d\n\nOrganizers have a solemn duty to the fighters, to provide the best pre-fight medical care possible and screen fighters for injuries they may have suffered in sparring that they bring into the ring with them. Those small bleeds on the brain they get in sparring are ticking time bombs that could go off at any time.\n\nThe fighters are owed education on the dangers of cutting too much weight and failing to rehydrate properly. They\u2019re owed the best referees who will protect them and stop a fight no matter how the crowd may react.\n\nBut sometimes, no matter our best efforts, these things happen in a sport like boxing. Everything can be done correctly and a bad outcome still ensues.\n\nThe best way to honor Day, and Maxim Dadashev and Hugo Santillan and Boris Stanchov, fighters who died in 2019 as a result of injuries suffered in the ring, is for everyone involved to do his or her best to improve the sport and minimize the risks.\n\nDay, sadly, has been silenced forever, but if his death can help save other boxers in future from a similar fate, we can at least take solace knowing he did not die in vain.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Day was a bright and charismatic young man with a smile that would have made a model jealous.
