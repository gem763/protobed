It only allowed for abortions to be performed if the pregnancy posed a \"serious\" risk to a woman's health. It does not make exceptions for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama and Planned Parenthood Federation of Alabama joined the lawsuit challenging the law. It was set to go into effect next month.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Protests across US after abortion laws enforced Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Last month, a federal judge blocked another \"heartbeat\" bill in Georgia.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
