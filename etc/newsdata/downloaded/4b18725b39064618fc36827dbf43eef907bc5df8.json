Investigations in his case are continuing and could last until March next year.\n\nYang Hengjun: Scott Morrison says China's spy claims 'absolutely untrue' Read more\n\nStrict conditions inside the detention centre\n\nYang, a former Chinese government diplomat-turned-\u201cdemocracy pedlar\u201d who ran a popular and influential blog, has not been allowed access to a lawyer, and has not been permitted to speak with his family. He has received no letters, but has been given two Xi Jinping books.\n\nChinese officials have cited national security concerns for denying him access to his legal team for more than seven months.\n\nEmbassy officials have passed a bible and family photographs to detention centre authorities but it\u2019s unknown if these have been passed to Yang.\n\nHe is allowed to shower once a week, and has access to a small enclosure outside his cell \u2013 with access to fresh air and natural light \u2013 for one hour, twice a day.\n\nHe is able to drink water when he needs it, and can purchase additional food, including fruit, biscuits, and chocolate.\n\nHe shares his cell with two other prisoners. The lights are on in the cell at all times.\n\nYang is taken from his cell once a week for interrogation, for up to four hours at a time. His hands and feet are shackled with heavy chains during questioning.\n\nInvestigators from the ministry of state security have reportedly told him he is shackled because of the seriousness of the crimes he is alleged to have committed. He has been told he potentially faces the death penalty.\n\nThe current investigative phase of his case, which began when he was formally charged on 23 August, could last up to seven months, until March of next year.\n\nDefence hindered by lack of access\n\nYang\u2019s Beijing lawyer Mo Shaoping told the Guardian he and his colleagues had not been able to see Yang, nor received any updates from authorities since his formal arrest in August.\n\nMo said they have applied five or six times to meet Yang but were refused because the case involves state secrets and their applications must be approved by China\u2019s state security organ.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing now is still asking for meeting him. If the lawyers cannot meet him, we cannot understand the case. You have to meet him before you can do the defence work,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Australia, Yang\u2019s former doctoral supervisor Dr Feng Chongyi said there appeared to be no evidence Yang has ever been engaged in espionage, and that the charges against him were politically motivated.\n\n\u201cHe continues to protest his innocence. This is important, after many months in detention he insists he is innocent and believes he can clear his name. But his future is still very unclear.\u201d\n\nFeng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, said Yang had not previously been restrained in manacles during interrogations.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned that his hands and feet are being shackled during interrogations, as though he is a convicted criminal awaiting execution.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian understands none of Yang, his legal team, or the Australian embassy have been told the specific charges against him, or presented with any evidence of his alleged offending.\n\nThe Criminal Law of the PRC details punishment for \u201ccrimes of endangering national security\u201d.\n\nCollusion with foreign states to harm China\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty or security attracts a prison term of at least 10 years.\n\n\u201cState organ personnel\u201d, such as diplomats, who defect and endanger national security can be jailed for between five and 10 years.\n\nBut crimes that endanger national security, that have caused \u201cparticularly serious harm to the country and the people\u201d, and where \u201cthe circumstances are particularly vile\u201d, can attract the death penalty.\n\nYang was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the US. A novelist under the nom de plume Wei Shi, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade.\n\nYang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention.\n\nHe was initially held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a type of secret detention of up to six months in which authorities can deny a suspect access to lawyers and to family, and restrict external communication. In July Yang was moved to a Beijing detention centre in the lead-up to being charged. He is allowed one half-hour consular visit a month.\n\nYang Hengjun: Australia presses for writer's release as China warns against interference Read more\n\n\u2018Serious concerns\u2019 for Yang\u2019s welfare\n\nAustralia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has previously discussed Yang\u2019s case with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.\n\n\u201cWe have serious concerns for Dr Yang\u2019s welfare, and about the conditions under which he is being held. We have expressed these in clear terms to the Chinese authorities,\u201d Payne said last month.\n\n\u201cIt is important, and we expect, that basic standards of justice and procedural fairness are met. I respectfully reiterate my previous requests that if Dr Yang is being held for his political beliefs, he should be released.\u201d\n\nPointedly, Payne insisted Yang had to be treated in accordance with international human rights law, \u201cwith special attention to those provisions that prohibit torture and inhumane treatment, guard against arbitrary detention and that protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, last month said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with the law and that the Australian citizen was in good health.\n\nGeng also warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d in the case.\n\n\u201cChina deplores the Australian statement on this case \u2026 the Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not ... interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom detention, Yang has pleaded for Australian help.\n\n\u201cPlease help me go home as soon as possible,\u201d he said in a message relayed through a consular official.", "description": "Sources describe concerning treatment akin to \u2018a convicted criminal awaiting execution\u2019", "authors": ["Ben Doherty", "Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78c36d006fef59185b36f65c94e33774af20c6f/304_360_842_505/master/842.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45eccf4b3e56ab0c7c0f3f712b871be6", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
