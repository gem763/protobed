(Rob Schumacher/USA Today)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nRussian hackers who attacked the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, didn\u2019t want to get caught. So they cloaked their attacks with a web of false signals and misdirection designed to send investigators looking at China, North Korea and other potential suspects.\n\nThe ruse almost worked, too. It took careful sleuthing by numerous cybersecurity researchers to peel away the \u201cfalse flags\u201d to reveal Russia was behind the attack that disrupted the Olympics' Internet and broadcast systems and shut down ticket printing.\n\nThat\u2019s the upshot of Wired reporter Andy Greenberg\u2019s mammoth investigation into the \u201cOlympic Destroyer\u201d cyberattack, which offers a fascinating inside look at the cat-and-mouse game between increasingly sophisticated Russian hackers and the researchers and U.S. officials seeking to hold them to account. And it's a prime example of how hackers could use false flags to mislead the public about their attacks and sow distrust in intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions.\n\nThe story, which is adapted from Greenberg\u2019s forthcoming book Sandworm, reads like a police procedural in which researchers wade through reams of contradictory evidence until they finally hit on the crucial clues. Their conclusion that it was a Russian job backed up the same attribution from U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThis case deals a major blow to Russian claims that it\u2019s nearly impossible to attribute who is really behind an attack in the shadowy world of cyberspace. But it also offers a warning at how other false flags could be successful -- and let nation-states hack their enemies with impunity.\n\nIt's clear in this example how sophisticated adversary such as Russia can use its intelligence capability and understanding of other countries' cultures to plant just enough seeds to cast doubt, just like it did in the 2016 election.\n\nFor example, Kremlin hackers who breached the Democratic National Committee pretended to be a lone Romanian hacker dubbed Guccifer 2.0 \u2014 a far shoddier cover than in Olympic Destroyer, but it contributed to distrust in U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 attribution to Russia.\n\nAnd three years later, conspiracy theorists -- and President Trump -- continue to question whether the Kremlin is to blame.\n\n\u201cAs the 2020 election approaches, Olympic Destroyer shows that Russia has only advanced its deception techniques \u2014 graduating from flimsy cover stories to the most sophisticated planted digital fingerprints ever seen,\u201d Andy writes. \u201cAnd if they can fool even a few researchers or reporters, they can sow even more of the public confusion that misled the American electorate in 2016.\"\n\nThe attack on the Olympics was unique for how extensively Russian hackers seeded their malicious software with elements that appeared to come from North Korea, China and Russia itself. The clues were so contradictory, in fact, that they seemed designed to make attribution seem impossible rather than to pin the case on one particular nation.\n\n\u201cIt \u2026 sent a message to the security community: You can be misled,\u201d Craig Williams, a researcher at Cisco, told Andy.\n\nAll three nations have a prolific history of hacking adversaries, and North Korea and Russia both had clear motives. For Pyongyang, the attack would be an opportunity to poke its capitalist neighbor and Korean War adversary. For Moscow, it would be revenge against the International Olympic Committee for barring Russian athletes from competing under their country\u2019s flag after a humiliating doping investigation.\n\nOne big break in the case came when a researcher with Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab found a piece of malicious software that looked North Korean but was wrongly constructed \u2014 suggesting a deliberate attempt to fake a North Korean attack and undermining the case against a key suspect.\n\nThe case cracked wide open, though, when a researcher with the U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye found similarities between the Olympics attack and a series of 2017 Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine \u2014 a frequent Russian target.\n\nFalse flags could have devastating consequences \u2014 especially if, say, if the victim retaliates against the wrong country.\n\n\u201cIf you can't imagine this with [the] U.S. and Russia, imagine it with India and Pakistan, or China and Taiwan,\u201d Jason Healey, a top White House cybersecurity official during the George W. Bush administration, told Andy.\n\nA false flag like that could provoke \u201ca much stronger response than even its authors intended, in a way that leaves the world looking very different afterwards,\u201d he warned.\n\nIndeed, there are already signs false flag operations are increasing. Just this morning, U.S. and British intelligence officials alerted about a Russian hacking group that hijacked Iranian infrastructure to cloak its identity and compromised organizations in at least 20 different countries over the past 18 months.\n\nThe group, which cybersecurity firms call Turla among other names, was most active in the Middle East but also targeted organizations in Britain and elsewhere, Reuters\u2019s Jack Stubbs reports.\n\n\u201cWe want to send a clear message that even when cyber actors seek to mask their identity, our capabilities will ultimately identify them,\u201d Paul Chichester, a senior official with Britain\u2019s top spy agency GCHQ said in the alert.\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg News)\n\nPINGED: Thousands of Chinese-made surveillance cameras that could be a conduit for Beijing spying are still being used at U.S. military and government sites, despite an August congressional ban, Asa Fitch at the Wall Street Journal reports. The ban did not require government agencies and military bases to remove already-purchased devices from the Chinese companies Hikvision and Dahua, but not doing so creates ongoing national security risks, experts say.\n\nOne big problem is cost. The bill that banned Hikvision and Dahua from government systems \u2014 along with the Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE \u2014 didn\u2019t include funding for replacements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that agencies aren\u2019t concerned about the risk, or that they\u2019re unwilling to take actions,\u201d Jeanette Manfra, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s assistant director for cybersecurity, told the Journal. \u201cIt often just comes down to, they\u2019ve got to balance all these different needs.\u201d\n\nAnother problem is government officials who aren\u2019t convinced the technology poses a threat, one former high-ranking government IT official told Asa.\n\n\u201cThere are a significant number of people who are in denial,\u201d the former official said. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe the problem is that big a deal, and [believe it] can be managed and mitigated in other ways.\u201d\n\nA Defense Department spokeswoman told the Journal that the Defense Department was taking measures \u201cto ensure the security of the supply chain and inspect equipment for vulnerabilities,\u201d Asa writes.\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton speaks in New York. (Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nPATCHED: A State Department investigation concluded that 38 individuals violated security protocols in sending emails to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's private email server, potentially making those emails more vulnerable to hacking by U.S. adversaries, my colleague Greg Miller reports. The report also concluded, however, that none of the officials intentionally mishandled classified information.\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Clinton for using the private email server during the 2016 election but his admnistration has had similar cybersecurity lapses. Diplomats involved in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, allegedly used private phones and texting apps to trade messages about their efforts, according to evidence released by leaders of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nClinton\u2019s email setup \u201cadded an increased degree of risk of compromise\u201d since a private server \u201clacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks,\u201d the report concluded. The State Department investigation found 91 violations by \u201cculpable\u201d individuals and another 497 violations where no specific individual was found at fault. None of the violations included material that had been marked classified.\n\nPWNED: Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney continued to backpedal yesterday after initially suggesting a link between Ukrainian security aid and Trump urging Ukraine's president to investigate his political rivals.\n\nMulvaney told reporters on Thursday that Trump withheld the aid in part to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals -- including a conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee server is being hidden there. But he later released a statement backtracking on the shocking revelation. Then on Fox News Sunday, he said, \u201cI never said there was a quid pro quo, \u2019cause there isn\u2019t,\u201d and insisted that the administration only took concerns over corruption and aid from other countries into consideration when deciding the future of Ukrainian aid.\n\nMulvaney's comments will likely be the subject of continued scrutiny by Democrats, who have heard from current and former officials during the House impeachment probe that the administration did push Ukraine to investigate allegations of a Democratic Party server being hidden in the country, my colleague Karoun Demirjian reports.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif.
