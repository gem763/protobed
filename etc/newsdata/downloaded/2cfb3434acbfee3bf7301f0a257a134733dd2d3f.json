He may even have committed treason.", "language": "en", "text": "Let\u2019s say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?\n\nWe did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.\n\nOf course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon\u2019s involvement in Watergate \u2014 the scandal that drove him from office in 1974, as impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.\n\nBecause of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president (or the 16th worst, depending on how you look at it) in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for \u201cInternational Relations.\u201d But in terms of \u201cMoral Authority\u201d he\u2019s near the bottom, ranked 42nd. Lying to the American people and covering up a Constitution-shredding crime will do that to a guy.\n\nHow will historians rate Trump?\n\nPresident Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above. Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how \u201cthe rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\" he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.\n\nEntitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint in which he proposed cuts. Funny, Trump likes to run his mouth on Twitter and at his rallies, but this is something he hasn\u2019t blabbed to his wide-eyed, believe-whatever-he-says base.\n\nStrengthen workplace safety? \u201cWe want to protect our workers,\u201d Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so. Overall, \"they've done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them. And that's unfortunate,\" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said last month on Fox News Sunday.\n\nTrump vs. Nixon is no contest\n\nAnd cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later. Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut \u2014 to the wild applause of his base \u2014 what he\u2019s not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink. They applaud and then go home, apparently oblivious to the 85 (and counting) rules he has rolled back. Air pollution, water pollution, toxic substances, on and on and on.\n\nPresident Donald Trump with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in 2017. More\n\nThere's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nIt was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we\u2019ve since learned \u2014 based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post \u2014 that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.\n\nAid and comfort equals treason", "description": "The Russians attacked us.
