But It Is Not True.", "language": "en", "text": "Viral rumors that Joe Biden abused his power as vice president to protect his son\u2019s business interests in Ukraine in 2016, which spread last week from the pro-Trump media ecosystem to the New York Times, are \u201cabsolute nonsense,\u201d according to Ukraine\u2019s leading anti-corruption activist. That evaluation is backed by foreign correspondents in Kiev and a former official with knowledge of Biden\u2019s outreach to Ukraine after President Viktor Yanukovych was deposed in a popular uprising in 2014. In an interview with The Intercept, Daria Kaleniuk, an American-educated lawyer who founded Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center, expressed frustration that two recent front-page stories in the New York Times, on how the conspiracy theory is being used to attack Biden, failed to properly debunk the false accusation. According to Kaleniuk, and a former anti-corruption prosecutor, there is simply no truth to the rumor now spreading like wildfire across the internet.\n\nThe accusation is that Biden blackmailed Ukraine\u2019s new leaders into firing the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to derail an investigation he was leading into a Ukrainian gas company that the vice president\u2019s son, Hunter, was paid to advise. The truth, Kaleniuk said, is that Shokin was forced from office at Biden\u2019s urging because he had failed to conduct thorough investigations of corruption, and had stifled efforts to investigate embezzlement and misconduct by public officials following the 2014 uprising. Properly debunking this particular conspiracy theory is easier said than done, though, since it is set in Ukraine, a country with byzantine political intrigue at the best of times, and these are not the best of times. The rivalries between political factions in Kiev are so intense that even the country\u2019s new anti-corruption agencies are at each other\u2019s throats. There is no question that Biden did, during a visit to Kiev in late 2015, threaten to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was dismissed. But the vice president, who was leading the Obama administration\u2019s effort to fight corruption in Ukraine, did the country a favor by hastening Shokin\u2019s departure, Kaleniuk said, since he had failed to properly investigate corrupt officials.\n\n\u201cShokin was fired because he attacked the reformers within the prosecutor general\u2019s office,\u201d Kaleniuk said, \u201creformers who tried to investigate corrupt prosecutors.\u201d As Andrew Kramer explained in the New York Times when Shokin was finally dismissed in 2016, Biden had acted as the point man for a coordinated international effort: The United States and other Western nations had for months called for the ousting of Mr. Shokin, who was widely criticized for turning a blind eye to corrupt practices and for defending the interests of a venal and entrenched elite. He was one of several political figures in Kiev whom reformers and Western diplomats saw as a worrying indicator of a return to past corrupt practices, two years after a revolution that was supposed to put a stop to self-dealing by those in power. As the problems festered, Kiev drew increasingly sharp criticism from Western diplomats and leaders. In a visit in December, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said corruption was eating Ukraine \u201clike a cancer.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which props up Ukraine financially, said last month that progress was so slow in fighting corruption that \u201cit\u2019s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue.\u201d To illustrate what he called \u201crot in the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Kramer cited a notorious example, known in Ukraine as the case of the \u201cdiamond prosecutors,\u201d in which \u201ctroves of diamonds, cash and other valuables were found in the homes of two of Mr. Shokin\u2019s subordinates, suggesting that they had been taking bribes. But the case became bogged down, with no reasons given.\u201d Among the most prominent cases of official corruption Shokin had failed to pursue was against Yanukovych\u2019s environment and natural resources minister, Mykola Zlochevsky, who had oversight of all Ukrainian energy firms, including the largest independent gas company, Burisma, which he secretly controlled through shell companies in Cyprus. After Zlochevsky was forced from office along with Yanukovych in 2014, his gas company appointed Hunter Biden to its board. \u201cShokin was fired,\u201d Kaleniuk observed, \u201cbecause he failed to do investigations of corruption and economic crimes of President Yanukovych and his close associates, including Zlochevsky, and basically it was the big demand within society in Ukraine, including our organization and many other organizations, to get rid of this guy.\u201d By getting Shokin removed, Biden in fact made it more rather than less likely that the oligarch who employed his son would be subject to prosecution for corruption. As the former Reuters correspondent Oliver Bullough explains in his book \u201cMoneyland,\u201d just weeks before Hunter Biden joined the Burisma board in May 2014, ostensibly \u201cto strengthen corporate governance,\u201d Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office had frozen $23 million of Zlochevsky\u2019s assets in a money laundering investigation. (Zlochevsky and Burisma have denied all allegations of corruption.) At the time, Bullough writes, \u201cThe White House insisted that the position was private matter for Hunter Biden unrelated to his father\u2019s job, but that is not how anyone I spoke to in Ukraine interpreted it. Hunter Biden is an undistinguished corporate lawyer with no previous Ukraine experience. Why then would a Ukrainian tycoon hire him?\u201d Indeed, hiring the vice president\u2019s son might have seemed to Zlochevsky like a way to protect his business from scrutiny by international investigators. But the facts show that the Obama-Biden administration strenuously opposed the decision by Ukrainian prosecutors to let Zlochevsky off the hook. Vitaliy Kasko, a former deputy prosecutor who resigned in 2016 and accused Shokin\u2019s office of being a \u201chotbed of corruption,\u201d told Bullough that he had tried and failed to get his colleagues in the prosecutor general\u2019s office to offer proper assistance to the British inquiry in 2014. But the British investigation was eventually stymied because Ukrainian prosecutors failed to provide a court with evidence that the $23 million \u2014 the proceeds from the sale of an oil storage facility Zlochevsky owned via a shell company in the British Virgin Islands \u2014 were related to criminal abuse of office by the former natural resources minister. New reporting from Bloomberg News this week revealed that the 2014 case against Zlochevsky \u201cwas assigned to Shokin, then a deputy prosecutor. But Shokin and others weren\u2019t pursuing it, according to the internal reports from the Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s office reviewed by Bloomberg.\u201d In December 2014, U.S. officials threatened Ukrainian prosecutors that there would be consequences if they failed to assist the British investigation, according to the documents obtained by Bloomberg. Instead, the Ukrainian prosecutors provided a letter to Zlochevsky\u2019s lawyer stating that they knew of no evidence that the former minister had been involved in embezzlement. The British investigation collapsed soon after that and the funds were unfrozen and quickly moved to Cyprus. Kasko, the former deputy prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no truth to the accusation that Biden or anyone in the Obama administration had tried to block the investigation of Zlochevsky. \u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\u201d Kasko said. \u201cIt was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\u201d On her center\u2019s website, Kaleniuk has been working to debunk a series of conspiratorial stories about supposed \u201cUkrainian collusion\u201d in the 2016 election which have recently been embraced and promoted by President Donald Trump, his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his son, Donald Trump Jr. But Kaleniuk was stunned and annoyed by a New York Times report published last week that focused on how the politics of the accusation against Biden might play. The report failed, in her view, to make it clear that the innuendo was false. \u201cWhat I\u2019m pissed off about,\u201d Kaleniuk said, \u201cis that Shokin, who was totally corrupt, who undermined the reform of prosecution, and reformers, and who didn\u2019t want to investigate Zlochevsky, now appears in the New York Times as the hero who wanted to investigate Zlochevsky and Burisma and who suffered because Joe Biden demanded to dismiss him because of his willingness to investigate Burisma \u2014 which is absolute nonsense.\u201d Compounding her frustration, Kaleniuk said, is that she was interviewed for the Times story, but it focused more on the potential harm the anti-Biden conspiracy theory could inflict on his presidential candidacy than on making clear that Shokin was fired because of his failure to properly investigate suspected corruption, including by Zlochevsky. Kaleniuk\u2019s fear \u2014 that the Times report would be taken as confirmation that Biden had acted improperly \u2014 seemed to be realized by a viral tweet promoting the story from Ken Vogel, the Washington correspondent who wrote it, which claimed that \u201cThe BIDENS are entangled in a Ukrainian corruption scandal.\u201d\n\nNEW: The BIDENS are entangled in a Ukrainian corruption scandal:@JoeBiden pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor seen as corrupt.\n\nBUT the prosecutor had opened a case into a company that was paying HUNTER BIDEN.\n\nThe Bidens say they never discussed it. https://t.co/tblUPYPJMG \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) May 2, 2019\n\nKaleniuk was also distressed that the Times report, and Vogel\u2019s tweet promoting it, failed to clearly debunk the false claim that the prosecutor Joe Biden got fired \u201chad opened a case into a company that was paying HUNTER BIDEN.\u201d In fact, Kasko and Kaleniuk noted, Shokin had undermined efforts to investigate the company and its owner. After he was appointed prosecutor general in 2015, Kaleniuk said, Shokin\u2019s office did formally open another investigation into Zlochevsky, but that was done at the request of the country\u2019s parliament, not the chief prosecutor. A review of court documents by Kaleniuk suggested that the only investigative step taken by Shokin\u2019s office in that case was to transfer the files to another agency. During Shokin\u2019s tenure, American diplomats in Kiev publicly complained about the prosecutor\u2019s failure to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s employer, Zlochevsky, calling in evidence that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office (known as the PGO) was in dire need of reform. \u201cWe have learned that there have been times that the PGO not only did not support investigations into corruption, but rather undermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases,\u201d U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt said in a speech to the Odesa Financial Forum on September 24, 2015. \u201cFor example, in the case of former Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky, the U.K. authorities had seized $23 million in illicit assets that belonged to the Ukrainian people. Officials at the PGO\u2019s office were asked by the U.K to send documents supporting the seizure. Instead they sent letters to Zlochevsky\u2019s attorneys attesting that there was no case against him. As a result the money was freed by the U.K. court and shortly thereafter the money was moved to Cyprus.\u201d Pyatt added that the prosecutors \u201cresponsible for subverting the case by authorizing those letters should \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 be summarily terminated.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s presence on the board of a Ukrainian company suspected of corruption first became a political issue three months later, in December 2015, when his father visited Kiev and threatened to withhold financial aid unless the prosecutor general was fired for blocking corruption investigations. As James Risen reported in the Times that month, the vice president\u2019s spokesperson insisted that the younger Biden\u2019s business in Ukraine would have no influence over his father\u2019s determination to push for more vigorous enforcement of anti-corruption laws. (Risen is now The Intercept\u2019s senior national security correspondent.)\n\nFolks, we're home from Ukraine. This was a good trip. Here are my parting thoughts. https://t.co/DwaayXWIbuhttps://t.co/h8CBK9dXir \u2014 VP Biden (Archived) (@VP44) December 9, 2015\n\nAlthough there is no evidence that Joe Biden did anything to shield Burisma from scrutiny, the fact that he failed to dissuade his son from helping to launder the reputation of a Ukrainian company widely suspected of corruption is hardly praiseworthy. The former vice president says that he simply never discussed his son\u2019s business interests in Ukraine, but maybe he should have. The bad news, for Biden, is that the false nature of the allegation about his role in Ukraine won\u2019t stop Trump and his supporters from treating it like a major scandal, hoping to tarnish the Democrat currently leading the race to face him in the 2020 election. And since the setting for the supposed scandal is a part of the world few Americans have much knowledge of, it could be as hard to refute in the minds of voters as the attack on John Kerry\u2019s Vietnam War record launched by the Swift Boat Veterans in 2004, or the weapons-grade innuendo about Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in Benghazi generated by House Republicans. As Dan Pfeiffer, a former communications director for President Barack Obama, explained on a recent episode of \u201cPod Save America\u201d flooding the internet with baseless conspiracy theories can, unfortunately, be good politics. \u201cThis is how Trump won,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cWhich is: feed conspiracy theories to the base and just throw so much shit around that the folks in the middle say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s all confusing, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s right, I don\u2019t have really any way of finding out \u2014 certainly the media isn\u2019t capable of telling me \u2014 so I\u2019m going to default to my natural expectations which is, both sides are corrupt liars.'\u201d \u201cAnd when the public thinks that both sides are corrupt liars,\u201d Pfeiffer added, \u201cthat inures to the advantage of the corrupt liar in the race.\u201d Pfeiffer also criticized Vogel for laying out the conspiracy theory at length before noting that there was no evidence to support it.\n\nI read all the way to the 19th paragraph (after a graphic that looked something on a wall in The Wire\"), where you buried this nugget: \"No evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general\u2019s dismissal.\" https://t.co/ROzTLNZlxq \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) May 2, 2019\n\nA New York Times spokesperson, Ar\u00ed Isaacman Bevacqua, defended Vogel\u2019s focus on how the conspiracy theory, and a new investigation in Ukraine, could impact the 2020 election. \u201cOur reporting on the current story began last fall, well before the issue surfaced again elsewhere, and became timely now for two reasons: the recent reopening of an investigation in Ukraine touching on Hunter Biden and the owner of Burisma, and the start of former Vice President Biden\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d Bevacqua said in a statement. \u201cThe role of Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House in drawing attention to the intersection of the Bidens and the situation in Ukraine was clear to us in the latter stages of reporting, and we highlighted that fact for readers in the story (and the headline). Our reporting unearthed new facts about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s contacts with the Ukrainian prosecutors and the steps he took to keep President Trump apprised \u2014 developments that the story explicitly noted raised questions \u2018about whether Mr. Trump is endorsing an effort to push a foreign government to proceed with a case that could hurt a political opponent at home.'\u201d In an interview with the Times last week, Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, boasted about pressing Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, to open a new investigation into Burisma, the firm that Hunter Biden was a board member of from May 2014 until last month. Lutsenko had previously closed the probe of Burisma after getting the company to admit to a relatively minor underpayment of taxes. But in late March, his office filed a new notice of suspicion related to the firm, according to the Times. On Friday, the Times published a second front-page story on the anti-Biden conspiracy theory, reporting that Giuliani \u201cplans to travel to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in the coming days and wants to meet with the nation\u2019s president-elect to urge him to pursue inquiries\u201d into the gas company that employed Hunter Biden and allegations that an independent anti-corruption bureau there \u201cmeddled\u201d in the U.S. election in the summer of 2016 by releasing evidence of secret payments toPaul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign chair at the time. Giuliani shrugged off the suggestion that there might be something wrong with encouraging a foreign government to investigate the American president\u2019s political rivals. \u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election, we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d Giuliani told the Times. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t foreign policy,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m asking them to do an investigation that they\u2019re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I\u2019m going to give them reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d The fact that a Times reporter described Biden as \u201centangled in a Ukrainian corruption scandal\u201d has been treated as confirmation by Trump\u2019s supporters and the far-right media outlets that work to boost him that the allegation is true.\n\nhttps://t.co/FNVj16Hf10 via ?@nytimes?. Biden conflicts are too apparent to be ignored and should be investigated quickly and expeditiously. But the more important question is how deep and how high did the alleged Ukraine conspiracy go? \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) May 2, 2019\n\nBefore it reached the Times, the frenzied speculation about Biden, and the supposed meddling in the 2016 election by anti-corruption prosecutors in Ukraine, was regularly featured on a network of far-right websites that work to boost Trump and undermine Democrats. Among the first outlets to promote the idea of the Ukrainians as the real meddlers was Sputnik, a Russian state-owned news agency. That theme, and related conspiracy theories about Ukraine and Democrats, were then featured in a series of opinion columns by John Solomon, a columnist for The Hill in Washington. Solomon\u2019s stories, based on interviews with disgruntled, far-right Ukrainian officials who had previously been featured in Sputnik, have been enthusiastically embraced by the conspiracy theorist-in-chief.\n\n\u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u201d @seanhannity @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019\n\nThe Biden conspiracy theory has also been heavily promoted by the Epoch Times \u2014 which is owned by members of the Chinese Falun Gong spiritual movement and is virulently pro-Trump. As Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s former chief of staff in the White House, noted, records of political spending online show that the Epoch Times has even paid to spread the conspiracy theory more widely on Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile in Kiev, something of a feedback loop has developed in which Ukrainian officials who have been criticized by Obama-era diplomats are now supported by Trump loyalists. Take the case of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, who has served administrations of both parties but was appointed to this post by Obama. Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, complained in an interview with The Hill that Yovanovitch had improperly handed him a list of people he should not prosecute for corruption. The allegation sounds scandalous, until you discover that the Ukrainians the U.S. ambassador was trying to protect were anti-corruption activists who received grants for their nonprofit work from the American government and were then baselessly accused of corruption for accepting the money. Yovanovitch recently demanded the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was wiretapped by a rival anti-corruption agency and caught on tape advising suspects in a corruption probe on how not to get caught. \u201cNobody who has been recorded coaching suspects on how to avoid corruption charges can be trusted to prosecute those very same cases,\u201d Yovanovitch said in March. \u201cThose responsible for corruption should be investigated, prosecuted, and if guilty, go to jail. And in order for that to happen, all of the elements of the anti-corruption architecture must be in place and must be working effectively.\u201d The disgraced prosecutor Yovanovitch criticized, Nazar Kholodnytsky, was then cited as a source in articles attacking her as a deep-state plotter on far-right American websites, leading Donald Trump Jr. to call for her ouster.\n\nWe need more ?@RichardGrenell\u2019s and less of these jokers as ambassadors.\n\n\n\nCalls Grow To Remove Obama's U.S. Ambassador To Ukraine https://t.co/0jgzp1ZqmU \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019\n\nThis month, the Trump administration decided to suddenly recall Yovanovitch from her post. Update: May 12, 2019, 10:00 a.m.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, announced in a rambling Fox News interview Friday night that he was canceling his trip to Ukraine after people close to the incoming president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told reporters in Kiev that his new administration was not interested in being used to further the anti-Biden conspiracy theory. \u201cThis is definitely not our war,\u201d a source close to Zelensky told the Washington Post. \u201cWe have to stay away from this as much as possible.\u201d One Zelensky supporter who spoke to reporters, Serhiy Leshchenko, is a former investigative journalist and reformist member of parliament member who helped publicize the off-the-books payments made to Paul Manafort in 2016. Leshchenko said in a statement on Saturday that Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was appointed by the outgoing president, Petro Poroshenko, was feeding pro-Trump conspiracy theories to Giuliani and The Hill about Biden as part of an effort to get White House support for his campaign to keep his job in the new government. \u201cLutsenko is trying to manipulate the Biden/Burisma narrative so that Americans will help him cling to power because he is a disgrace and has nowhere else to go after his boss Poroshenko lost the election,\u201d Leshchenko wrote on Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s why Lutsenko now claims he has evidence of wrongdoing that implicates Biden, but if this is true, why has he sat on it for YEARS? Why didn\u2019t he do anything about it after he was appointed as Prosecutor General? And why couldn\u2019t he give this information to his successor?\u201d \u201cWhat really happened in the Burisma case,\u201d the lawmaker added, \u201cwas that Lutsenko himself stopped the investigation! And not long after that the corrupt Yanukovych crony Zlochevsky went into business with Poroshenko and his corrupt cronies.\u201d Andrew Kramer, the Moscow-based Times foreign correspondent who first revealed the secret payments to Manafort in Ukraine that forced him to resign from the Trump campaign in 2016, pointed out on Twitter that Giuliani, in his Fox News interview, also incorrectly identified Serhiy Leshchenko as the source who made that information public. The secret payments were first published online by the independent National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani, in an interview with Fox, falsely suggested that Leshchenko, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, was the source of so-called Black Ledger accounts showing Paul Manafort's payments in Ukraine.
