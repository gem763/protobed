When I captained him in Test cricket, he would run through a brick wall for you. But there\u2019s also a slight element of \u2018safe pair of hands\u2019 about the decision to go with him ahead of Gary Kirsten.\n\nI hear that Kirsten didn\u2019t interview that well, but his job isn\u2019t to give the ECB a good interview, it\u2019s to coach the England cricket team. And his record with India and South Africa brooks no argument.\n\nJoe Root (R) and Chris Silverwood look on during an England training session last month\n\nI\u2019m also not bothered about the fact Silverwood is English. England\u2019s two best coaches have been Duncan Fletcher and Andy Flower \u2014 a pair of Zimbabweans.\n\nThe ECB is a multi-million pound business and you want the best man in charge, regardless of nationality.\n\nBut once Ashley Giles had decided to go with one coach and not split the roles, that was always likely to work in Silverwood\u2019s favour.\n\nI don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t have split the coaching role, as they have done with the captains, but Giles is scarred from his time in charge of the white-ball sides while Flower was Test coach. Giles felt like he was on the undercard and wanted to avoid a repeat scenario.\n\nThe time the team now spend away from home was also in Silverwood\u2019s favour. As Trevor Bayliss discovered, if you\u2019re an overseas coach in charge of England, you\u2019re away from home the entire year \u2014 not just during the winter months. Silverwood won\u2019t have that problem.\n\nSilverwood and Root need to hammer out what they want from the England team\n\nClearly, though, there\u2019s plenty more to the guy than the fact he\u2019s English.\n\nEveryone I talk to about him says how passionate he is about the game. And his record so far is impressive. He took an underachieving Essex side to promotion in 2016, then won the Championship with them the following season for the first time in 25 years.\n\nI also like the work he\u2019s done with England\u2019s fast bowlers. Stuart Broad was all over David Warner during the Ashes. Silverwood has to take a lot of credit for that, especially with a guy like Broad, who likes to be in charge.\n\nOne of the biggest issues he\u2019ll face is with the Test team\u2019s top order and the style of cricket he wants the side to play. The white-ball sides don\u2019t need many tweaks, but Silverwood just needs to give Joe Root\u2019s Test side a push in the right direction.\n\nOne of the biggest issues Silverwood will face is with the Test team\u2019s top order\n\nI remember when Duncan Fletcher took over in 1999, I sat down with him and we hammered out what we wanted from the England team.\n\nSilverwood has to do that with Root, who can sometimes sound a bit wishy-washy about how his team should play. His indecision about whether to bat at No 3 or No 4 also needs resolving, once and for all. In general, though, the emphasis has to be on making sure the top order bat long and show an \u2018over my dead body\u2019 attitude. Players should be picked accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s great that the pair of them get on. As we saw with Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores, nothing breeds dressing-room disharmony like a lack of respect between captain and coach. But Silverwood also needs to be tough with Root.\n\nI was a bit surprised, given the top order\u2019s recent struggles, that they didn\u2019t go with a batting technician, like Graham Ford or Kirsten. That was one of the things Fletcher was so good at. How will Silverwood go about dealing with Jonny Bairstow\u2019s technical issues that lead to him getting bowled so often?\n\nHe'll also need to deal with the technical issues that see Jonny Bairstow bowled so often\n\nWith that in mind, he needs to push Graham Thorpe, the batting coach, and others further down the chain to make sure they\u2019re coming up with players who have sound techniques.\n\nToo often in recent years, England have recalled a batsman, only to discover his technique hasn\u2019t improved.\n\nBut there\u2019s no doubting Silverwood\u2019s passion, character or work ethic. He knows the county game inside out, so he\u2019ll have opinions about the next generation of batsmen, the likes of Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley. And he will give it his absolute all.\n\nIt\u2019s one hell of a job, but Chris Silverwood deserves a decent crack of the whip.", "description": "NASSER HUSSAIN: \nThere's a slight element of 'safe pair of hands' about England's decision to go with Chris Silverwood ahead of Gary Kirsten as new head coach.", "authors": ["Nasser Hussain For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/19410510-0-image-a-6_1570475797972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
