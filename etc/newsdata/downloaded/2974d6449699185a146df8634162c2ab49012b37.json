Over a third (37 per cent) said they were somewhat satisfied.\n\nThe most-used operator, Polar - which is run by BP Chargemaster - was rated as the joint fifth best network.\n\nBest public charger networks 1. Tesla Supercharger: 94/100 2. InstaVolt: 86/100 3. Pod Point: 79/100 4. NewMotion: 77/100 =5. Polar (BP Chargemaster): 73/100 =5. Shell Recharge: 73/100 7. ChargePlace Scotland: 72/100 =8. Engenie: 70/100 =8. GMEV (Greater Manchester): 70/100 10. GeniePoint: 69/100\n\nBP Chargemaster's Polar network is the most-used across the whole of the UK. It rated as the joint fifth best provider by users\n\nCommenting on the survey, Dr Ben Lane from Zap-Map said: 'EV drivers are very clear as to what makes for a good charging experience with \u2018reliability\u2019 being the number one priority.\n\n'EV users need to be able to access the whole of the UK network with confidence that the installed chargers will be working and available as advertised.'\n\nHe added: 'EV drivers are increasingly savvy about the different levels of service offered by each of the UK\u2019s charging networks and will change their driving routes to use those which offer the best service.\n\n'This suggests that the market is becoming highly competitive, with EV users happy to pay for quality, but avoiding networks which fail to provide a good charging experience.'\n\nAs for Ecotricity, which has around 680 connectors located at service stations on major roads and motorways in the UK, it failed to make it into Zap-Map's top 10.\n\nThis isn't at all surprising, given that many users have complained about the reliability of its chargers and increasing fees to access them.\n\nIt was announced last week that the government is set to inject a \u00a370million investment into the public rapid charging network in the next five years, more than doubling the current availability.\n\nSome 3,000 new super-quick chargers will be installed in the UK on top of the 2,000 already in place, with most expected to be located at motorway services.", "description": "Some 1,600 plug-in car users were asked to give a satisfaction score out of 100 for the 26 network operators available across the country.
