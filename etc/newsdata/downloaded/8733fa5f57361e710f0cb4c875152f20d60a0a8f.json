A new lawsuit that could open the door for president trump's closest aides to testify. ABC's Kyra Phillips is on capitol hill with the details. Good morning, Kyra. Reporter: Good morning, Eva. We're talking about Charles kupperman. President trump's former deputy national security adviser. He filed a lawsuit yesterday asking a federal judge to determine whether he must testify in this impeachment inquiry. Now, this is a huge deal, Eva, because it could open the door for other key witnesses who worked in the white house to testify including those who worked very closely with the president. Key witnesses like trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. His potential testimony could give Democrats major ammunition here in this impeachment probe. And, Kyra, another development, a federal judge rejecting claims that the impeachment inquiry isn't legal. Exactly. This was a clear victory to Democrats. If the ruling stands, they will no doubt use this information to bolster their impeachment inquiry against president trump. The federal district judge berle Howell ordered the justice department to actually hand over secret grand jury testimony from the Mueller investigation to congress. These documents could reveal previously hidden details to lawmakers about trump's actions during the 2016 election and become another part of this impeachment push, Eva. Kyra, you mentioned how Democrats continue to gather testimony for their impeachment investigation. Tell us more about today's closed door deposition with yet another state department official. Reporter: That's right. Here's what we know. His name is Philip reeker and he's the acting assistant secretary of European and eurasian affairs. He will be the ninth official to interview with the three congressional committees leading the impeachment inquiry. He was actually communicating with key officials who were either part of the efforts of trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to have Ukraine launch investigations that would favor him politically and were swept up in that effort so reeker also was communicating with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and his top aides and may be able to shed some more light on what the secretary of state actually new here. All right, still a lot of questions, Kyra Phillips for us on capitol hill this morning. Thank you, Kyra.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Trump's former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to determine whether he must testify in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191026_phillips_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
