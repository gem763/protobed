They replace Apple\u2019s existing phones, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max.\n\nThe company is keeping the XR around and will now charge $599 for the handset.\n\nThe biggest upgrade to the new iPhones comes in the form of their new cameras, including a second lens on the iPhone 11 that allows users to zoom out giving them a great field of view.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max now get three camera lenses, which allow users to zoom in on subjects, take standard wide-angle images, and ultra-wide angle photos.\n\nThree sizes\n\nLike Apple\u2019s last generation of iPhones, the new devices come in three sizes. There\u2019s the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, the 6.1-inch iPhone 11, and the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max. The 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max both come with Apple\u2019s OLED Super Retina XDR Display, while the iPhone 11 gets an LCD panel.\n\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 10: Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the new iPhone 11 as he delivers the keynote address during a special event on September 10, 2019.

That also helps with battery life, since if the screen is showing something black, the phone can turn off those pixels. That\u2019s not the case with LCD screens.\n\nAll new cameras\n\nThe biggest change you\u2019ll notice to the new iPhone lineup is around back. The iPhone 11 now comes equipped with two camera lenses, a standard wide-angle lens and an ultra-wide lens that lets you capture more content in one shot. You do this with a 1x optical zoom out.\n\nApple says its camera also uses a new HDR feature that improves colors in your images. The company has also added stereoscopic depth for the entry-level iPhone, something that wasn\u2019t available on the iPhone XR, since it lacked a second camera lens.\n\nThe iPhone 11\u2019s new Night Mode significantly lightens images to make subjects far more visible in low-light situations. The company does this with a slew of software tricks. This may give Google\u2019s excellent Night Sight a run for its money as the best low-light camera mode available for a smartphone.\n\nCEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 11 Pro at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019.

That third lens will allow you to capture images of things like landscapes or large group photos without having to either back up too far from your subjects or taking a panorama image.\n\nSamsung currently offers an ultra-wide angle lens on its Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note10 devices. Other smartphone makers have been pushing the lens limit for some time now. Nokia\u2019s PureView phone, for example, has a whopping five cameras on its rear.\n\nThe iPhone11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s three cameras sit in a new square enclosure that makes the cameras far more prominent than ever before. The iPhone 11 has the same square enclosure on its back panel, though that holds the phone\u2019s two cameras and flash.", "description": "Apple has unveiled its latest iPhones, the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uq3JgRDPoof69nGtbBamwQ--~B/aD03MDM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/20334fc0-d3f6-11e9-8dbb-76506d165419", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
