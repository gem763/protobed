What\u2019s going on wit chu?\"'\n\nThe High Fidelity star didn't specify in the interview who stood in her way when it came to auditioning or what role they held in the process.\n\nShut out: 'In [The Dark Knight Rises], they told me that I couldn\u2019t get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren\u2019t \"going urban,\"' she explained\n\nStanding up for herself: 'It was like, \"What does that have to do with anything?\" I have to play the role like, \"Yo, what\u2019s up, Batman? What\u2019s going on wit chu?\"'; a still from X-Men: First Class\n\nThough they only used the term 'urban' when preventing her from auditioning, the term is often used as a euphemism for race.\n\nThough she benefited from her famous name and celebrity parents Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet, she was far from a household name during The Dark Knight Rises casting period.\n\nShe was previously featured in a small roles in 2007's The Brave One with Jodie Foster and had appeared in other minor roles, but her breakout performance in X-Men: First Class (2011) was still ahead of her.\n\nDeja vu: Halle Berry starred in her own Catwoman spinoff movie opposite Sharon Stone in 2004\n\nSince then, Zo\u00eb has gone on to play one of the leads on HBO's acclaimed Big Little Lies and was featured in the Harry Potter spin-off series Fantastic Beasts, among other high-profile gigs.\n\nThough she admitted in the 2015 interview that her celebrity parents have helped her secure an agent and get a foot in the door, she dismissed the idea that her parentage was a deciding factor in her biggest films.\n\n'I\u2019m hyper-aware that people are judging me based on who my parents are,' she admitted, though she attributed her role in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) to her talent alone.\n\n'You book jobs like Mad Max because of you and not because of your dad.

That year she starred with Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies for HBO as the spacey, depressed yoga instructor wife of Reese's ex.\n\nShe was also in the sequel with Meryl Streep.\n\nIn 2018 she talked fame with Elle: 'If I don't have [the next] job lined up, I get nervous,' she said. 'It's irrational, maybe. But also good. When I was in high school, if a girl didn't like me, the first thing she'd say was, 'You think you're so cool because of your parents.' That carries into later life, like, 'Oh, you just got this part because your parents are this and that,' she added.\n\n'It's important to acknowledge that I got in the door easier because of them. Some kids work their whole lives and they can't even get an agent to call them back. That part was handed to me. People are always going to think that maybe you are who you are because of your family. So it's my responsibility to work harder.'\n\nZo\u00eb married actor Karl Glusman, 31, in June at the home of her rocker father Lenny, 55, in Paris.\n\nKarl and Zo\u00eb have been in a relationship since 2016 and got engaged in February 2018.\n\nFamous family: Zo\u00eb is the daughter of actress Lisa Bonet, 51, and rocker Lenny Kravitz, 55, shown in August in Newark, New Jersey at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards", "description": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz will play Catwoman in The Batman, but in 2015 she claimed that she wasn't allowed to audition for a role in The Dark Knight Rises because she was too 'urban.'", "authors": ["Brian Marks For Dailymail.Com", "Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19719388-0-image-a-74_1571103378042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
