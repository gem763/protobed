Had Liverpool's defenders been anywhere near as resolute then Jurgen Klopp's team would not have come so close to catastrophe in their favourite competition.\n\nThis was Liverpool's hundredth home game in the European Cup and it was another belter. It has become the norm in recent times. Nevertheless, some serious issues underpinned what happened here.\n\nIn conceding a three-goal lead to their Austrian opponents, Liverpool were in trouble with half an hour to go. Having lost their first group game in Naples, this was one the European champions really had to win.\n\nSadio Mane and Roberto Firmino embraces team-mate Mohamed Salah after he settled a seven-goal thriller at Anfield\n\nSalah restores Liverpool's lead as he thumps from home inside the area after Roberto Firmino's glancing header\n\nErling Haaland taps into an empty net to complete a remarkable comeback from the Austrian side under the lights at Anfield\n\nThe young striker celebrates in front of the jubilant away end on a captivating European night at Anfield\n\nLiverpool goalkeeper Adrian is left helpless as Takumi Minamino's volley finds the bottom corner to make it 3-2\n\nHwang Hee-chan gets one back for the visitors as his powerful strike proves too much for Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian\n\nSalah sees his low effort trickle underneath Salzburg goalkeeper Cican Stankovic for Liverpool's third of the night\n\nSalah grins as he celebrates opening his Champions League account for the season with team-mate Firmino\n\nAndy Robertson doubles Liverpool's lead as he diverts Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross into the back of the net\n\nRobertson is joined in celebration by Jordan Henderson and Alexander-Arnold after scoring just his second Liverpool goal\n\nSadio Mane slides the ball over RB Salzburg goalkeeper Stankovic to put Liverpool ahead in the ninth minute\n\nMane puts his hands to his lips after breaking the deadlock against his old club at Anfield on Wednesday night\n\nFirmino climbs over his team-mate Mane as they celebrate taking an early lead in the Group E European clash\n\nMATCH FACTS, PLAYER RATINGS AND GROUP E TABLE LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Adrian 6; Alexander-Arnold 6, Gomez 6, Van Dijk 5.5, Robertson 8; Henderson 6 (Milner 61 6), Fabinho 6.5, Wijnaldum 6 (Origi 64 6); Salah 7.5 (Keita 90), Firmino 7, Mane 7.5 Subs not used: Lovren, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Kelleher Goalscorers: Mane 9, Robertson 25, Salah 36, 69 Booked: Fabinho Manager: Jurgen Klopp 7 RED BULL SALZBURG (4-2-2) : Stankovic 6 ; Kristensen 5.5, Onguene 6, Wober 6, Ulmer 5.5; Minamino 7.5, Mewpu 7, Junuzovic 6.5 (Ashimeru 78), Szobosziai 6.5 (Okugawa 71, 6); Daka 6 (Haaland 56, 7), Hwang 7.5 Subs not used: Koita, Ramalho, Philipp Kohn, Farkas Goalscorers: Hwang 39, Minamino 56, Haaland 60 Manager: Jesse Marsch 7 Referee: Andreas Ekberg 7\n\nUltimately they were saved by their own ability to conjure goals at will. The manner in which Liverpool responded to the threat of calamity reflected well on them and once Mohamed Salah crashed his team back in to the lead with 20 minutes left they were never in trouble again.\n\nHowever, the way Salzburg undressed Liverpool during a spell of attacking football either side of half-time will concern Klopp. It may seem a strange thing to say about a team that has won all seven of its Premier League games but some of Liverpool's defensive work has not been as secure as their manager would like this term.\n\nHere, Liverpool were made to look very ordinary by some clever, dextrous football from Salzburg that briefly embarrassed them. Not only did Hwang Hee-chan, Takumi Minamino and substitute Erling Braut Haaland score in the 40th, 56th and 61st minutes to turn this game upside down, Salzburg created other chances in this period too.\n\nVirgil van Dijk probably had his worst half an hour as a Liverpool player while, defensively at least, Trent Alexander-Arnold was also troubled. When Haaland \u2013 son of the former Manchester City player Alf-Inge \u2013 scored the equaliser, Klopp stood on the touchline and grinned the way you do when you don't want anyone to know how utterly bemused you really feel.\n\nAs a spectacle, it was brilliant. Salzburg had been three down after 35 minutes and seemingly heading home with a hiding to reflect on. Yet here they were, passing and moving through the red ranks of the Premier League leaders to prove to the rest of Europe that the form that has given them a plus-31 goal difference after only eight games of the Austrian league does indeed travel.\n\nSalzburg's Takumi Minamino fights for possession with Liverpool midfielder Fabinho in the early stages of the game\n\nRed Bull Salzburg's Dominik Szoboszlai gets a grip of Liverpool captain Henderson in the midfield battle\n\nSalah lets fly with a fierce left-footed strike but sees his effort rattle the advertising hoardings behind the goal\n\nLiverpool striker Firmino is crowded out by RB Salzburg players as he attempts to get the hosts on the front foot\n\nBacked by an increasingly fanatical following, Salzburg ran hot on adrenaline during that purple patch at the start of the second half. Had they scored next after drawing level, nobody would really have been surprised.\n\nEarlier, they had struggled. Liverpool have a big Premier League game at home to Leicester on Saturday, but they began with their minds on the job and eased through the gears in to what appeared to be a comfortable lead.\n\nSalzburg's defending at this stage was no better than Liverpool's was a little later. Both Liverpool full-backs were allowed to advance at will and Salzburg suffered terribly as a consequence. It was so easy for Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson for a while that we wondered whether Salzburg had even scouted their opposition properly.\n\nLiverpool scored their first in the ninth minute as Mane and Roberto Firmino played a one-two for the former to score against his old club. Just over 15 minutes later, Robertson began a superb flowing move in his own half and after Jordan Henderson and Salah funnelled the ball out to Alexander-Arnold, the Scot arrived at speed to convert the low cross gleefully from six yards.\n\nIt was easy for Liverpool at this point, too easy. Salzburg did threaten on the break \u2013 Minamino was particularly dangerous \u2013 but were so defensively lax that nobody was surprised when goalkeeper Cican Stankovic pushed a Firmino header tamely in to the path of Salah for the third goal nine minutes before the interval.\n\nLiverpool defender Joe Gomez shields the ball from Salzburg's Patson Daka during an entertaining first period at Anfield\n\nMane challenges for the ball with Salzburg's Maximilian Woeber as he looks to clear the ball upfield for the visitors\n\nAdam Lallana gets across Liverpool captain Henderson as he has an altercation with Salzburg's Maximilian Wober\n\nBy now Stankovic and his defenders wore the haunted, fearful look typical of so many that come to Anfield and get rolled over. Briefly the scoreboard in the corner by the Kop mistakenly flashed 3-3 but nobody had any reason to suspect that was at all portentous.\n\nHow quickly a goal can change a game, though. When Hwang left Van Dijk on the seat of his pants to score beautifully in the 40th minute, Salzburg sniffed opportunity and when Minamino crashed in a volley at the far post in the 56th minute, Liverpool suddenly looked in need of smelling salts.\n\nAt this stage both teams were swapping chances at will but that was never likely to benefit Liverpool.\n\nAn open, fractured game suited Salzburg rather than the team in the lead. Liverpool needed to slow the game down and stem the bleeding but they could not, Haaland scoring at the far post after Van Dijk and Fabinho left the job of closing down Minamino to each other as he crossed unchallenged to a player who has scored so prolifically in Austrian football this season.\n\nThe scores were now level and it seemed scarcely believable. Ultimately Salah rescued Liverpool and his confident finish as he ran on to Firmino's cushioned header means that what happened here will now be looked upon as some kind of curiosity.\n\nIt could have been altogether more significant, though. Good teams cannot afford to make a habit of winning too many games in this way.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN AT ANFIELD: This was Liverpool's hundredth home game in the European Cup and it was another belter.
