By the time he does, we already know as much. Laura has told us all about the intense pain, and agonising surgical procedures she has endured for years, thanks to the swellings, ulcers and related problems in her uterus. She has also spent most of her life plagued by allergies: \u201cAs a child I was always in the hospital \u2013 asthma, allergic to more and more things, wheezing, coughing, itching, always a bellyache for some reason or another. My test results were always borderlining something dangerous.\u201d\n\nThere is no cure for endometriosis. As that none-too-gentle surgeon says: \u201cWe know what happens but we don\u2019t know the causes; we can\u2019t stop it. Too much surgery makes it worse, the medications regulate it only partially and have bad side effects, but if we don\u2019t treat it, you\u2019ll get worse every month.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s Laura\u2019s fate. \u201cI was an endless receptacle for pain,\u201d she says \u2013 and Please Read This Leaflet Carefully duly details that pain, surgery to alleviate the agony, then more pain, worry about pain, visits to the doctor, and pain again \u2026\n\nNot the Booker: Skin by Liam Brown review \u2013 dystopian fun that veers into silliness Read more\n\nMany books about illness have definite end points: cure or death. A chronic disease is different. For Havelin\u2019s narrator, it\u2019s always ongoing and ever present, even if there are peaks and troughs. But we get a sense of the way the illness has progressed as Havelin moves backwards through Laura\u2019s life. We start in New York, where she often struggles to navigate daily tasks. On bad days, even commuting to work and shopping can push her to the verge of total exhaustion. Touching her baby\u2019s skin can bring her out in a rash. Then we see her as she first moved to the city, followed by her decision to leave her native Norway after long periods of illness - and so on, into her teenage years where she is already all too familiar with physical debilitation, but also training to be a figure skater.\n\nBy the time we get to this end point we realise both how far Laura has come, and how much of her destiny has been dictated by illness. She notes with bitterness the people who prescribe that we should all \u201ctake complete responsibility\u201d for our lives, \u201cas if the external forces don\u2019t matter at all\u201d. For Laura, there\u2019s no escaping such forces. And her kind of \u201chopelessly under-researched female misery\u201d is not uncommon \u2013 and almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be so under-researched if men had to endure it themselves. Out of the necessary solipsism of illness emerges an empathetic picture of the way endometriosis has blighted millions of lives. It\u2019s been estimated that up to one in 10 women will suffer from it during their reproductive years. That\u2019s about 146 million people right now \u2013 although it\u2019s still depressingly difficult to know precise numbers, because the disease is so often misdiagnosed, dismissed and misunderstood.\n\nHavelin was diagnosed with endometriosis a decade after she started suffering. She speaks from angry and agonising experience and that\u2019s reflected in the passion and urgency of her narrative. There\u2019s no questioning her sincerity or the significance of her demand for understanding. But whether or not that makes for quality literature is a more complicated question. Havelin has talent, for sure. Alongside the vivid descriptions of physical pain, there are some lovely passages showing what it means to be able to enjoy your body. A description of Laura\u2019s return to ice skating leaps and twirls from the page, the required physical prowess serving as a counterpoint to her illness. But I also found the inclusion of a series of extracts from a real book about the sport (Skate: 100 years of Figure Skating by Steve Milton) crude and unnecessary.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to read the book, you\u2019re also going to have to get used to this kind of thing: \u201cMy life is limited. I can\u2019t take long, time-consuming detours any more. I have to go straight there. I have to burn it all to the ground or I won\u2019t survive this. The destruction has been so complete that it closes all windows to the past, until there\u2019s nothing left but a big burnt scar on the ground and smoke tearing through my lungs, my hands black with soot.\u201d It\u2019s a lament and a harangue \u2013 but because there are only so many ways of saying \u201cit hurts\u201d, it can also be repetitive.\n\nBy the end, that didn\u2019t feel like a problem so much as a source of power. Part of the book\u2019s message is the importance of hearing stories like Laura\u2019s \u2013 and Havelin\u2019s \u2013 when many won\u2019t listen. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to me that no one wants to hear about it,\u201d Laura notes. \u201cBut I will never finish needing to tell how much it hurt, how much it hurts, how bad it is.\u201d Havelin dares you to turn away \u2013 but that\u2019s impossible.\n\nOur next book is: The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas by Daniel James.
