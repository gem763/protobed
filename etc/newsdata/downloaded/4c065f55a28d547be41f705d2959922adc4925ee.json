(PHOTOS: Relay Majulah)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 They come from all walks of life, some of them with their personal stories of triumph over adversity. And these 200 runners are taking on the challenge of completing a running relay across 2,000 kilometres in Singapore in 200 hours \u2013 in time to make it for Mediacorp\u2019s President\u2019s Star Charity event on 10 November.\n\nCalled Relay Majulah, this special relay \u2013 inaugurated to commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial year \u2013 seeks to raise $1 million for the 67 charity organisations backed by the President\u2019s Challenge fundraising series.\n\nFrom 2 November, the runners will run back and forth between the Singapore Sports Hub and Safra Yishun to rack up 2,000km by 10 November \u2013 at an average speed of 10km per hour \u2013 in order for the final relay participant, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, to run into the President\u2019s Star Charity show at the Mediacorp campus to hand the relay baton to President Halimah Yacob.\n\nIt is an ambitious project with enormous physical \u2013 and logistical \u2013 challenges, but the organisers and participants are tackling each of their obstacles with equally immense conviction that the grounds-up initiative is a worthwhile undertaking.\n\nOrdinary people in grounds-up initiative\n\nThe participants are gathered via word of mouth earlier this year, with the Relay Majulah organisers hoping to get a diverse and inclusive group with people from all walks of life.\n\nThere are well-known Singaporeans in the mix, such as former national footballers Nazri Nasir and Aleksandar Duric, Mediacorp presenters Glenda Chong and Jeffrey Low, as well as Members of Parliament Teo Ser Luck and Lim Wee Kiak.\n\nThe majority are ordinary people who are either passionate about running, or eager to spread a little kindness to the society. Some have disabilities, some are coping with illnesses, and some have recovered from accidents; all want to do their part in raising $5,000 each for Relay Majulah.\n\nFor Kuo Si Min, 29, the data analyst/epidemiologist is fortunate to still be able to run regularly, after a serious accident in 2010 left her with a fractured skull and pelvis.\n\n\u201cI was jogging at night and I was knocked down by a bus while crossing a road,\u201d she told Yahoo News Singapore in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThe injuries were so serious that I was bedridden for three months, and I lost part of my skull, which had to be formed back with titanium implants.\u201d\n\nDoctors gave her only about a 30 per cent chance of survival, yet Kuo managed to pull through after nearly a year of recovery and rehabilitation. An avid athlete who had taken part in sports like dragonboating in her school days, she even went against the doctors\u2019 advice to resume running, eventually recovering well enough take part in half-marathons.\n\nDoctors gave Kuo Si Min a 30 per cent chance of survival after a bus crashed into her, but she recovered well enough to take part in half-marathons.

You don\u2019t know what might happen at any time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was quite lucky to have support from my friends and family, as well access to resources that helped me recover. Others don\u2019t have the same benefit and, compared to myself, their struggles are much greater. So if we can do a bit to help them by doing something that we like, then why not?\u201d\n\nCancer fails to stop fundraising efforts\n\nWhile Kuo\u2019s harrowing life experience is in the past, hotel manager Raymond Howe\u2019s battle with cancer resumed in 2016, after the 56-year-old conquered his first brush with the illness 17 years ago.\n\n\u201cI was initially diagnosed with malignant skin cancer, which spread to my brain and left lung,\u201d he told Yahoo News Singapore. \u201cIt was a really depressing period as I found it hard to cope with the effects of chemotherapy. I was very ambitious in my career then, and it all came crashing down.\u201d\n\nHe even pondered suicide, but was eventually inspired by the autobiography of the now-disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong, who overcame testicular cancer and set up the Livestrong Foundation to support people affected by cancer.\n\nStory continues", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 They come from all walks of life, and these 200 runners trying to complete a relay across 2,000 kilometres in Singapore in 200 hours \u2013 in time to make it for Mediacorp\u2019s President\u2019s Star Charity event on 10 November.", "authors": ["Chia Han Keong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.qDfCx2MZQgzQDVarThxXQ--~B/aD0xMTgzO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ddfa6490-f628-11e9-bdcf-6f6aa00abf70", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
