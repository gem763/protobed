They will stop at nothing until he is removed from office.\n\nThese aren\u2019t journalists, they\u2019re political operatives.\n\nNow, they\u2019re even trying to criminalize the president\u2019s attempt to get to the bottom of the Russian collusion hoax.\n\nThe New York Times ran a front-page story on Monday breathlessly reporting \u201canother instance of the president using American diplomacy for potential personal gain\u201d \u2014 which turned out to be nothing but cooperation between the Department of Justice and the Australian government related to a long-standing DOJ investigation.\n\nThe hypocrisy is laughable. The story is a shining example of how journalists contort stories in order to hew to the Democrats\u2019 party line.\n\nAs everyone actually following the story knows, the origins of the collusion stories in 2016 are downright suspicious. They read like a movie script, complete with spy games, shady characters, and government intelligence operatives from around the world.\n\nAlexander Downer, an Australian politician, played a major role in getting the Trump-Russia collusion narrative going. Trump didn\u2019t make up these suspicions, they came from the sworn testimony of people at the center of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe question is not whether Downer was involved, but why.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller made a point to ignore Downer\u2019s involvement with anti-Trump \u201cdossier\u201d author and British spy Christopher Steele, even though Mueller's mandate was to report on foreign interference in our elections. That\u2019s why Attorney General William Barr initiated an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened, fulfilling a promise he made to Congress during his confirmation hearing.\n\nEvery responsible and informed person should support the DOJ investigation. Some things just don\u2019t add up in the official narrative of Russian interference, and the public deserves to know the truth. Yet journalists write off every question and allegation involving the origin of the baseless collusion allegations as \u201ccounternarrative marbled with conspiracy,\u201d designed by Trump to advance his own interests.\n\nYou\u2019d have to have spent the past three years living under a rock to believe there are no legitimate questions to be asked about the events leading up to the Mueller probe.\n\nWhile the biased reporters at the New York Times may think they\u2019ve dropped a bombshell with their latest reporting, they haven\u2019t actually written anything new. Trump himself very publicly tasked Barr with investigating the role of the Australian, Italian, British, and Ukrainian governments in the origins of the collusion allegations months ago. That investigation would obviously involve, if not require, cooperating with those governments.\n\nThe media largely ignored or dismissed Barr\u2019s investigative assignment from Trump because it didn\u2019t fit their narrative. That doesn\u2019t mean it was some nefarious secret, though.\n\nNow that Democrats have concocted the Ukraine \u201cscandal,\u201d their media allies are retooling the story of Barr\u2019s investigation and presenting it as evidence of a corrupt bargain between the president and a foreign leader. The Australia story\u2019s clear purpose is to substantiate the baseless accusations that Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky involved a quid pro quo deal.\n\nThe media enthusiasm for the non-existent quid pro quo is matched only by their determination to ignore the likelihood that there was a very real one involving the Democratic front-runner. Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter was taking money from a Ukrainian energy company while his vice president dad was influencing Obama administration policy on Ukraine.\n\nBiden vehemently denies having any knowledge of his son\u2019s business dealings, but there are photos of the two Bidens golfing with company executives just months after Hunter was named to the board.\n\nWe're supposed to believe Hunter Biden got on the board on his own merits, and not because his dad was vice president? The media hardly spent any time investigating that. Instead, they're going down another rabbit hole just to smear Trump.\n\nDemocrats have one goal: to take down Trump. Unfortunately, they can rely on compliant media reporters and editors to put an anti-Trump spin on any story that seems like it might help do it.\n\nJenna Ellis Rives (@JennaEllisRives) is a member of the Trump 2020 Advisory Board.
