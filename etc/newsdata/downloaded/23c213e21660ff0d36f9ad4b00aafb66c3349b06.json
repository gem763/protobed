Yet it seems to me that nothing could be further from the truth. The poets of the last 100 years have been motivated by an urgent desire to communicate new ideas, and to recover ancient wisdom lost in the hubbub of modernity. As old orthodoxies faded, they found ways to make sense of the noise of time, transforming it into a new and unexpected music. Here are five landmark poems, including one from this year, that tell us something about their age.\n\nSiegfried Sassoon, \u2018Everyone Sang\u2019 (1919)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Art Archive/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThough the term was not coined until the 1960s, first world war poet Siegfried Sassoon always felt able to \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d, lambasting incompetent generals and corrupt politicians as well as an ignorant public back home, sometimes at great risk to himself. Yet he also produced the first great peace poem of the age, tempering powerful satire with tenderness and a sense of gratitude for community. \u201cEveryone Sang\u201d begins abruptly, as a flash mob does, with an impromptu choir\u2019s improbable synchronicity: \u201cEveryone suddenly burst out singing.\u201d This is an arresting moment, and we might be tempted to charge Sassoon with allowing himself a personal epiphany here, but there is no Romantic ego at the centre of this experience; instead, the speaker is \u201cfilled with such delight / As prisoned birds must find in freedom, / Winging wildly across the white / Orchards and dark-green fields, on \u2013 on \u2013 and out of sight.\u201d The image Sassoon chooses to convey that sudden sense of freedom is, like the singing, a communal one: not a single bird that rises, symbolically, into a blue sky, but an entire flock that flies as real birds would. As they do so, \u201ceveryone\u201d sings. But who is this everyone? A group of soldiers celebrating the announcement of the Armistice? An entire village back home, or even England itself, raising its voice in hope, now that the \u201chorror of years\u201d is drifting away? In one sense, it does not matter; in another it is all these things, as we come to see that community, like peace, cannot be constructed, or imposed, but can only emerge spontaneously from the dailiness of life: \u2018Everyone\u2019s voice was suddenly lifted; / And beauty came like the setting sun.\u2019 That dailiness is what we mean by peace \u2013 and now that the horrors are over, Sassoon creates a lasting reminder of how much that peace depends on mutual understanding.\n\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca, \u2018Farewell\u2019 (1924)\n\nIn Spain, the humanist poem \u2013 in which death is freely accepted as a part of the natural cycle \u2013 not only added to a great philosophical tradition, it also helped to undermine the tentacular influence of the Catholic church, an institution that, before the 1930s Republic, did so much to maintain the power of the feudal landowners and suppress working people. When Lorca writes \u201cIf I die / leave the balcony open\u2026\u201d he is affirming the here and now, the everyday, against the church\u2019s myth of heaven. He continues: \u201cThe boy is eating oranges / (From my balcony I see him) / The reaper is cutting the wheat / (From my balcony I hear him)\u201d before ending, with a simple finality, on a repetition of the first two lines.\n\n\u201cFarewell\u201d (\u201cDespedida\u201d in Spanish) is not a work that demands much analysis. True, we note the passing reference to the reaper (a reference too playful to seem grim), but the main point, revealed both in the content and in the economy of form is that, while sidestepping morbidity or self-abnegation, the poem conveys a tranquil awareness that, in the larger scheme of things, the continuing adventure of life itself transcends any one individual, even as it celebrates, by implication, that individual\u2019s most commonplace and fleeting sensations.\n\nMarianne Moore, \u2018The Steeple-Jack\u2019 (1932)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe real scientific discoveries of the last century (uncertainty, incompleteness, fuzzy logic) presented us with a freedom that, for some, was unwelcome, even unnerving. That the world \u201cout there\u201d was not fixed (and that it was mostly not \u201cout there\u201d at all) left too much to Coleridge\u2019s \u201cshaping spirit of Imagination\u201d; we had wanted certainty, order, progress. For Marianne Moore, however, the need to shape and give order to raw and uncertain data is an occasion, not only of one of modernism\u2019s most formally inventive poems, but of a new philosophical perspective: \u201cYou can see a twenty-five- / pound lobster; and fish nets arranged / to dry. The / whirlwind fife-and-drum of the storm bends the salt / marsh grass, disturbs stars in the sky and the / star on the steeple; it is a privilege to see so / much confusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Steeple-Jack\u201d begins with a panoramic view of a New England whaling town much as D\u00fcrer might have painted it, before sliding into more uncertain, Van Gogh territory, where a storm on the land can \u201cdisturb\u201d the stars in the sky, just as it disturbs the human-made star on the steeple. Yet, because of this very uncertainty, our sense of the power, and necessity, of the poetic imagination, which creates order from confusion moment by moment, is elegantly heightened \u2013 and in the process, Moore sketches out the basis for a fully ecocritical science of belonging.\n\nWH Auden, \u2018In Memory of WB Yeats\u2019 (1939)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jane Bown\n\nThe great lesson of Franco\u2019s victory in Spain was that poetry and art, no matter how truthful or how fine, could play no more than an ancillary role in the struggle for justice. Though it is actually an elegy, this witty and compassionate poem is best known for a brief passage, in which Auden famously claims that poetry \u201cmakes nothing happen\u201d, a remark so contentious, and so often taken out of context, that it tends to obscure the poem itself. This is unfortunate, for it is one of Auden\u2019s finest poems, and his argument concerning poetry\u2019s political effectiveness is more complex than many have assumed. To understand it fully, however, we have to examine the relevant passage closely: \u201cFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives / In the valley of its making where executives / Would never want to tamper, flows on south / From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs, / Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth.\u201d\n\nMaking things happen was never poetry\u2019s job (that would be to confuse art with propaganda); instead, each poem exists on its own terms, not just as words on a page, but as a modus vivendi, \u201ca way of happening\u201d. As such, poetry disdains to engage with the executives, taking its own wild course, reframing old questions in new ways, redrawing the maps the better to reflect the terrain, qualifying reductive logic with intuited subtleties and, most of all, insisting on quality in a cloddishly quantified world. Poetry makes nothing happen, but, used correctly, it changes everything by refocusing our attention.\n\nJoy Harjo, \u2018How to Write a Poem in a Time of War\u2019 (2019)\n\n\u201cI have forgotten my name in the language I was born to,\u201d says the Mvskoke Native American poet Joy Harjo, who writes in English because, having been educated in the tongue of those who exterminated her forebears, she has no choice. As a poet, this led her to the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, academic appointments and, just this year, to poet laureate of the United States (she is the first Native American to hold that post). Nevertheless, the work she has produced has always remained true to that forgotten name. \u201cI have a responsibility to all the sources that I am,\u201d she says: \u201cTo all past and future ancestors, to my home country, to all places that I touch down on and that are myself, to all voices, all women, all of my tribe, all people, all earth, and beyond that to all beginnings and endings.\u201d In this poem, from her 2019 collection, An American Sunrise, she tells the story of a people invaded by a nameless army: \u201cWe tried to pretend war wasn\u2019t going to happen. / Though they began building their houses all around us and / demanding more. / They started teaching our children their god\u2019s story, / A story in which we\u2019d always be slaves.\u201d\n\nThis could be a painfully succinct summary of what happened to the Mvskoke when white people arrived, but it could also be applied to any colonised culture. What Harjo sets up in opposition to this war, however, is a powerful expression of survival, an act of indigenous self-validation. As is so often the case in her work, she emphasises the importance of narrative song and story to this process of reclaiming native presence: \u201cSomeone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather to his grandson, / His granddaughter, as he blew his most powerful song into the hearts of the children.\u201d\n\nHarjo\u2019s pledge to \u201call voices, all women, all of my tribe, all people\u201d reveals the commitment that the project of native survival demands. Yet it also offers a vision for a new manifestation of what the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam once called \u201ca world culture\u201d \u2013 and it is cause for hope, for his poetic descendants, when we see an indigenous female poet, who has spoken movingly about the rejection and ridicule she faced at the start of her writing career, finally taking her just place as one of the most significant and powerful voices of our time.\n\n\u2022 National Poetry Day was this week.
