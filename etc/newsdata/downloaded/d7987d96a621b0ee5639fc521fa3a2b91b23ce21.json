They will use the eco-friendly vehicle to continue her climate march in Canada.\n\nOn a popular Scandinavian talk show called Skavlan, climate change activist Greta Thunberg revealed Arnold Schwarzenegger offered to lend her his electric car. (Photo: Skavlan) More\n\n\u201cI knew from the last time I had Greta on the show that she\u2019s indeed a unique personality with a lot of integrity,\u201d TV host Fredrik Skavlan tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAlthough her topic is a serious one, patience will be rewarded with great one-liners. And \u2014 as with the fact that she\u2019s now borrowing Arnold\u2019s car \u2014 some stories you really didn\u2019t see coming.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish activist previously spoke to the Skavlan in January, sharing her passion for fighting climate change, which was sparked after watching a film about ocean pollution at age 8. Thunberg sat down with Skavlan again this week in New York City to talk about her whirlwind week of activism in the U.S., which has become a source of both inspiration and ire from divided Americans.\n\nDespite facing vicious backlash, including being disparaged for her Aspberger\u2019s on national television and being mocked by Trump on Twitter, Thunberg has taken it all in stride, continuing her campaign for action on climate change unfazed.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children for promoting science, when they could do something good instead. I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us. -> \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 25, 2019\n\nBefore she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her advocacy, Thunberg made changes in her own life to combat the climate crisis. On her last appearance on Skavlan, the environmental activist talks about becoming vegan, refusing to purchase new products and only taking eco-friendly transportation even when traveling to speak all over the world. She even traveled to New York City to continue her campaign against climate change on a zero-emissions sailboat.\n\nThunberg arrived in New York City on a sailboat to reduce her carbon footprint.

Climate Summit, the 16-year-old rebuked leaders for not doing their part too.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong,\" Thunberg said, reading from a piece of paper. \"I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you come to us young people for hope. How dare you.\"\n\nAs she continues her North America campaign, the Swedish activist will be headed to Montreal, Canada for yet another climate march \u2014 a journey she will make with Schwarzenegger\u2019s electric car free of charge and using little to no carbon emissions.\n\nGreta Thunberg and Arnold Schwarzenegger did not immediately reply to Yahoo LIfestyle\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 'Fearless girl' Greta Thunberg faces down Trump in new political cartoon\n\n\u2022 How the youth-led Climate Strike is empowering grownups: 'the Greta Thunberg impact'\n\n\u2022 Greta Thunberg To World Leaders At UN Climate Summit: 'How Dare You!'\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "As 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg will continue her campaign against climate change using  Arnold Schwarzenegger's electric car.", "authors": ["Paulina Cachero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_4CIMRIQ1YVLavpoxn667A--~B/aD0zNTcwO3c9MzgzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/83ab83d0-e097-11e9-bffd-b7e91d404587", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
