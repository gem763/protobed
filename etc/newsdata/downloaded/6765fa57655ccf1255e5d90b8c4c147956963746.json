But Giuliani can be.", "language": "en", "text": "There are several different federal laws that might apply to Giuliani\u2019s conduct here. Most obviously, Giuliani appears to be in violation of the Logan Act, which makes it a crime for private citizens who attempt to intervene without authorization in disputes or controversies between the United States and foreign governments. He is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, not a government official, and so his involvement is clearly a complicating, detrimental element for U.S. diplomatic interests. Ukraine officials need to know who is speaking for the president and, as Ukrainian journalist Serhiy Leshchenko wrote this week, who is trying to \u201cdrag\u201d Ukraine into a U.S. presidential election.\n\nMore significant, Giuliani and Trump\u2019s reported actions raise the real specter of a federal criminal bribery and extortion conspiracy. While Attorney General William Barr has made it clear that he will not prosecute Trump due to current DOJ policy, Giuliani enjoys no such privilege or immunity. And, while the factual record is not fully developed, federal investigations are opened every day against people with far less known and incriminating information. Any objective prosecutor, I believe, would agree with that.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mimi Rocah", "I", "Unfortunately"], "top_image": ""}
