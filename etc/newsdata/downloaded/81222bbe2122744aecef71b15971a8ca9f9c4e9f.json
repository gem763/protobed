How do we get a tier one nation to actually go and play in Fiji, Tonga or Samoa? It just never, ever happens.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Namibian player Wian Conradie is tackled during a Group B game against South Africa\n\nOne method of promoting the sport in new rugby playing areas includes World Rugby's Beyond Legacy programme, which is aiming to grow broadcast audiences for rugby in Asia, and to get one million new Asian players participating in rugby by 2020.\n\nThey aim to do this through schemes such as holding rugby lessons in Japanese schools in the host cities of the World Cup and investing in the growth of local teams.\n\nJapan pulled off a shock victory over Ireland in their World Cup Pool A game, defeating them 19-12.\n\nSu Carty, who sits on the World Rugby council and the committee of the Irish Rugby Football Union, reflected on the defeat, saying: \"It was a tough day for the Irish, but an amazing day for Japan and an incredible day for the tournament.\n\n\"You want teams like Japan coming through and making a statement on the world stage. Their day in the sun isn't done, and they'll be committed to build on that great day against us.\"\n\nIn a major change, this year also marks the first time an Asian nation has ever hosted the World Cup, and there is speculation that the United States could bid for the 2027 World Cup, which would be the first time it has ever been hosted in North America.\n\nMr Hogan added: \"It proves the value that bringing major tournaments to new areas can do. It really can ignite a passion for the sport in that area - and hopefully we see that in the legacy in five, 10, 20 years' time in Japan and Asia.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Japanese fans pose outside the Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa\n\nHosting the Rugby World Cup could also be a wise investment for a nation new to the sport - with EY estimating that the six-week tournament could bring in \u00a31.5bn to Japan's economy and support 25,000 jobs across the 12 cities hosting matches.\n\nJapan has also invested 40bn yen (\u00a3290m) on infrastructure. This has included boosting transport links between the cities, and enhancing the stadiums and team camps with the aim of using them for Japan's growing domestic rugby scene after the World Cup has ended.\n\nDeveloping the domestic rugby scene is an important step, especially for Japan as it seeks to capitalise on its continued success. According to Statista, Japan has almost 3,000 recognised clubs with 95,000 active players.\n\nAkira Shimazu, head of Japan's rugby organising committee, said that the tournament was \"on track to deliver a significant economic legacy for our nation\".\n\nJapan's continued success could lay the framework for other nations in future tournaments - and with the support of the top tier nations, the Rugby World Cup finals could start seeing other teams making their way to the semi-finals and finals of the World Cup.", "description": "Too much money is focused on the big nations in rugby union, an ex-England international says.", "authors": ["Rory Claydon", "Wake Up To Money"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E5D7/production/_109193885_9ce7acfd-8536-4704-bc4e-f0bea7e80784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
