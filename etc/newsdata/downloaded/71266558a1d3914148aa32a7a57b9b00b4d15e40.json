The futures will allow traders to bet on whether Libra will be live by Dec. 30, 2020.\n\nBased on their short or long positions, traders will either receive Libra tokens or nothing at all by the date. In other words, if Libra is not operational by December next year, traders will lose their entire initial investment.\n\nThe initial price of Libra futures will be set at 30 cents, CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb said in the report, adding that it equates to a roughly 30% chance that Libra will be operational by the date.\n\nThis is not CoinFLEX's first IFO for a yet-to-launch token. In July, the Seychelles-based exchange launched an IFO for blockchain interoperability project Polkadot\u2019s DOT tokens. CoinFLEX also offers physically-settled futures for bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and ether (ETH).", "description": "Cryptocurrency derivatives exchange CoinFLEX is launching physically-settled futures contracts for Libra, the Facebook-led proposed stablecoin.
