The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified her as 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson.\n\nThe officer does not identify himself as police in the video. Police said the officer, who's been on the force since April 2018, was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.\n\nIn the statement, police said the responding officers saw a person near the window inside the home. The officer fired the single shot after \"perceiving a threat,\" the statement said. The bodycam video also included images of a gun inside the residence, but it's unclear if the firearm was found near the woman.\n\nAuthorities said the bodycam footage was released soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but any video taken inside the house could not be distributed due to state law.\n\nThe incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for killing her black neighbor inside his own apartment. Amber Guyger said during her trial that mistook Botham Jean's apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean's.\n\nGuyger, 31, was convicted of murder for Jean's September 2018 death.", "description": "Authorities in Texas say a black woman was fatally shot by a white officer inside her Fort Worth home after police were called to the residence for a welfare check.
