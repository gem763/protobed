Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can?\n\nBIDEN: Because I watched it. I know what the job is. I\u2019ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I\u2019ve been there, and I\u2019ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.\n\nBURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?\n\nBIDEN: Before the first vote.\n\nBURNETT: Before Iowa?\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nBURNETT: Not by the end of this year?\n\nBIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I\u2019ve released them before. I released 55 pages of my \u2014 I\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s released anything up here.\n\nBURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?\n\nWARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we\u2019re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they\u2019re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don\u2019t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what\u2019s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people\u2019s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.", "description": "Mr. Sanders, 78, is trying to reassure voters of his stamina after he had a heart attack two weeks ago.
