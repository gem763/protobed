(AP) - Debbie Osborne eased into a seat inside Herb Brooks Arena and stared out at her 17-year-old daughter, Kayle, as a hockey game between the United States and Canada featuring girls under age 18 was set to get under way.\n\nA single mother who has a full-time job in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Osborne had arranged her work schedule in mid-August to be able to drive to Lake Placid to watch her daughter play, go back home and work her shift, then do it all again two more times.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to miss anything.\n\n\u201cFor Kayle, watching her grow up and having all these dreams of getting to where she is, on the pathway _ and the hard work and the effort and the joy and the excitement and the ups and the downs _ it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cShe eats, lives, breathes hockey. It\u2019s just amazing to see her and the other girls at this level.\u201d\n\nDozens of young women trekked to Lake Placid recently to play, with many hoping it is a steppingstone to something greater: Playing in college, perhaps, maybe the Olympics or world championships, and more than a few harbor dreams of making a living at hockey. A career.\n\nThat road is a murky one for now.\n\nThe Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League folded in April after 12 years, and more than 200 players who formed the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey Players\u2019 Association a month later all pledged to sit out this season while demanding a single, economically viable league _ even as the five-team National Women\u2019s Hockey League goes forward with its fifth season, beginning Saturday.\n\nThe PWHPA elected to barnstorm and the first stop on its \u201cDream Gap Tour\u201d featured some 80 players split over four teams for a two-day tournament last month in Toronto. It was some competition for national team players like American Brianna Decker who won\u2019t be playing in a professional league this winter.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to grow the game,\u201d said Decker, who served as a coach in Lake Placid. \u201cAs the players get older, we want them to have a sustainable and reliable professional league to play in. Younger players are just honestly really appreciative of what we\u2019re trying to do. They\u2019re all on board.\u201d\n\nPlayers like 20-year-old Cayla Barnes of Eastvale, California, who followed her four older brothers into the sport.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a constant fight for equality that the older girls are wanting to get,\u201d said Barnes, who plays defense for Boston College. \u201cThey have certain things that they want. I think it\u2019s great that they\u2019re fighting for it. They\u2019re ultimately paving the way for us and girls younger than us to have more success down the road.\n\n\u201cI would love to (play professionally) eventually, so I\u2019m hoping by the time I\u2019m out of college it\u2019s all figured out and secure because that is a goal of mine.\u201d\n\nTaylor Heise of Lake City, Minnesota, a sophomore at the University of Minnesota and a member of USA Hockey\u2019s U22 team, said she appreciates the solidarity the pro players have demonstrated.\n\n\u201cBeing part of this program means supporting one another,\u201d Heise said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re on the younger team, the older team, it\u2019s important to support one another as women. Even though we have a place to play because we\u2019re in college, just staying with them and know that they have our support is really beneficial.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cDream Gap\u201d represents the missing link for women who fear that playing in college or the Olympics will be their last hurrah. And being a pro hasn\u2019t been what most probably envisioned in their youthful dreams.\n\nTry living on $3,000 a year.\n\n\u201cIn 10 years I don\u2019t want somebody to be in my shoes,\u201d said Liz Knox, a former CWHL goalie and PWHPA board member who works full-time as a contractor and also is a volunteer firefighter. \u201cI don\u2019t want somebody working full-time and trying to find time to squeeze into the gym and eat well. And let\u2019s not even talk about getting enough sleep because that\u2019s just out of the question for me.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s level the playing field. Let\u2019s give these women the opportunity to be the best athletes they can be because we really just don\u2019t have that right now. It\u2019s not because the product isn\u2019t sellable, it\u2019s because the product has never been sold.\u201d\n\nJust as important as the crowds at the small arena in Toronto for the first stop of the barnstorming tour were the sponsors on board _ Unifor, Adidas, Budweiser, the NHL Players\u2019 Association, Secret, Bauer, Tim Hortons and the Toronto Maple Leafs among them.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all starting to understand the value of strong female leaders, be it in sport or be it in business or be it in society,\u201d said former Canadian national team player Jayna Hefford, a Hockey Hall of Famer and member of PWHPA board. \u201cI think sponsors are seeing that. That\u2019s what this is creating. It\u2019s about more than hockey and it\u2019s about more than sport, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nThe PWHPA also scheduled tour stops in New Hampshire (this weekend) and Chicago (Oct. 18-20) with more in the planning stages.\n\n\u201cI think for us it\u2019s everything,\u201d said 32-year-old Kacey Bellamy, a member of the U.S. Olympic gold medal-winning team last year. \u201cYes, we\u2019re hockey players. But I think, number one, we try to be good role models. We are doing this for the next generation, and it might not benefit us, but we\u2019re hoping it benefits the girls 10, 20, 30 years from now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to put a great product out there just so that these little girls can have dreams like we did when we were little.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow in Toronto contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Debbie Osborne eased into a seat inside Herb Brooks Arena and stared out at her 17-year-old daughter, Kayle, as a hockey game between the United States and Canada featuring girls under age 18 was set to get under way.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/hockey_dreams_22140_c0-479-1670-1452_s1770x1032.jpg?402ceadd11a7eb15f52c727f5dec06606dde7fae"}
