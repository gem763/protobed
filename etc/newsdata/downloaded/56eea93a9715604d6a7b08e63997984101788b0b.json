Agholor called him a \"hero\" and offered him tickets to catch their next home game.\n\nA fire broke out at an apartment building in West Philadelphia, and its residents, including young children, needed help getting out, CBS Philadelphia reported Sunday. Hakim Laws, a former firefighter, and other people off the street jumped to help first responders.\n\nWhile the residents were able to escape safely, it was Laws' answer in an interview shading Agholor that went viral.\n\n\"I see the guy hanging out the window screaming that his kids was in there,\" Laws said. \"By that time the ladder was pulling up. Ironically, one of my old coworkers took the ladder off the truck and raised it up, and assisted people down. My man just started throwing babies out the window, we was catching them \u2013 unlike Agholor.\"\n\nThe most Philly soundbite goes to this guy who helped catch children thrown from a window during a fire. pic.twitter.com/3rH69gU2fL \u2014 Steve Lindsay CBS (@SteveLindsayCBS) September 23, 2019\n\nAgholor had two touchdown catches, but he had a fumble and some key drops in Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Detroit Lions.
