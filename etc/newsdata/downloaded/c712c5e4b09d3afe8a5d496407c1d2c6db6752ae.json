For two years, prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office had been building a criminal case against them for misleading prospective buyers of units in the Trump SoHo, a hotel and condo development that was failing to sell. Despite the best efforts of the siblings\u2019 defense team, the case had not gone away. An indictment seemed like a real possibility. The evidence included e-mails from the Trumps making clear that they were aware they were using inflated figures about how well the condos were selling to lure buyers. In one e-mail, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps discussed how to co\u00f6rdinate false information they had given to prospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the e-mails, they worried that a reporter might be on to them. In yet another, Donald, Jr., spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned about the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out, because only people on the e-mail chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception, according to a person who saw the e-mail. There was \u201cno doubt\u201d that the Trump children \u201capproved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,\u201d one person who saw the e-mails told us. \u201cThey knew it was wrong.\u201d In 2010, when the Major Economic Crimes Bureau of the D.A.\u2019s office opened an investigation of the siblings, the Trump Organization had hired several top New York criminal-defense lawyers to represent Donald, Jr., and Ivanka. These attorneys had met with prosecutors in the bureau several times. They conceded that their clients had made exaggerated claims, but argued that the overstatements didn\u2019t amount to criminal misconduct. Still, the case dragged on. In a meeting with the defense team, Donald Trump, Sr., expressed frustration that the investigation had not been closed. Soon after, his longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, entered the case. Audio: Listen to WNYC\u2019s story about how Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr., came close to being charged with felony fraud. Kasowitz, who by then had been the elder Donald Trump\u2019s attorney for a decade, is primarily a civil litigator, with little experience in criminal matters. But, in 2012, Kasowitz donated twenty-five thousand dollars to the re\u00eblection campaign of the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr., making Kasowitz one of Vance\u2019s largest donors. Kasowitz decided to bypass the lower-level prosecutors and went directly to Vance to ask that the investigation be dropped. On May 16, 2012, Kasowitz visited Vance\u2019s office at One Hogan Place, in downtown Manhattan\u2014a faded edifice made famous by the television show \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d Dan Alonso, the Chief Assistant District Attorney, and Adam Kaufmann, the chief of the investigative division, were also at the meeting, but no one from the Major Economic Crimes Bureau attended. Kasowitz did not introduce any new arguments or facts during his session. He simply repeated the arguments that the other defense lawyers had been making for months. Ultimately, Vance overruled his own prosecutors. Three months after the meeting, he told them to drop the case. Kasowitz subsequently boasted to colleagues about representing the Trump children, according to two people. He said that the case was \u201creally dangerous,\u201d one person said, and that it was \u201camazing I got them off.\u201d (Kasowitz denied making such a statement.) Vance defended his decision. \u201cI did not at the time believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed,\u201d he told us. \u201cI had to make a call and I made the call, and I think I made the right call.\u201d Just before the 2012 meeting, Vance\u2019s campaign had returned Kasowitz\u2019s twenty-five-thousand-dollar contribution, in keeping with what Vance describes as standard practice when a donor has a case before his office. Kasowitz \u201chad no influence, and his contributions had no influence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case,\u201d Vance said. But, less than six months after the D.A.\u2019s office dropped the case, Kasowitz made an even larger donation to Vance\u2019s campaign, and helped raise more from others\u2014eventually, a total of more than fifty thousand dollars. After being asked about these donations as part of the reporting for this article\u2014more than four years after the fact\u2014Vance said he now plans to give back Kasowitz\u2019s second contribution, too. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money to be a millstone around anybody\u2019s neck, including the office\u2019s,\u201d he said. Kasowitz told us that his donations to Vance were unrelated to the case. \u201cI donated to Cy Vance\u2019s campaign because I was and remain extremely impressed by him as a person of impeccable integrity, as a brilliant lawyer and as a public servant with creative ideas and tremendous ability,\u201d Kasowitz wrote in an e-mailed statement. \u201cI have never made a contribution to anyone\u2019s campaign, including Cy Vance\u2019s, as a \u2018quid-pro-quo\u2019 for anything.\u201d Last year, the Times reported the existence of the criminal investigation into the Trump SoHo project. But the prosecutor\u2019s focus on Ivanka and Donald, Jr., and the e-mail evidence against them, as well as Kasowitz\u2019s involvement, and Vance\u2019s decision to overrule his prosecutors, had not previously been made public. This account is based on interviews with twenty sources familiar with the investigation, court records, and other public documents. We were not able to review copies of the e-mails that were the focal point of the inquiry. We are relying on the accounts of multiple individuals who have seen them. Requests for interviews with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., were referred to Alan Garten, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization. In an e-mailed response, Garten did not address a list of questions about the criminal case. Instead, he quoted the company\u2019s filings in civil litigation relating to the Trump SoHo, which described complaints as \u201ca simple case of buyers\u2019 remorse.\u201d But even a lawyer in the Trump camp acknowledged that the way the case was resolved was unusual. \u201cDropping the case was reasonable,\u201d Paul Grand, a partner at Morvillo Abramowitz who was part of the Trump SoHo defense team, said. \u201cThe manner in which it was accomplished is curious.\u201d Grand, who was a partner of Vance\u2019s when the District Attorney was in private practice, said that he did not believe that the D.A.\u2019s office had evidence of criminal misconduct by the Trump children. But the meeting between Vance and Kasowitz \u201cdidn\u2019t have an air you\u2019d like,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you and I were District Attorney and you knew that a subject of an investigation was represented by two or three well-thought-of lawyers in town, and all of a sudden someone who was a contributor to your campaign showed up on your doorstep, and the regular lawyers are nowhere to be seen, you\u2019d think about how you\u2019d want to proceed.\u201d\n\nIn June, 2006, during the season finale of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Donald Trump, Sr., unveiled the Trump SoHo as a visionary project. The luxury development was intended to mark the ascension of Ivanka and Donald, Jr.,\u2014then twenty-four and twenty-eight years old, respectively\u2014as full players in the Trump empire. They signed the licensing deal alongside their father, and photographs of Ivanka were featured in the Trump SoHo\u2019s advertising, under the tagline \u201cPossess your own SoHo.\u201d Their partners on the project included two Soviet-born businessmen, Felix Sater and Tevfik Arif, who ran the Bayrock Group, a real-estate-development firm. Sater had a history of running afoul of the law. In 1993, he was convicted of assault and spent about a year in prison for attacking a man with the stem of a margarita glass in a bar fight. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering for his role in a forty-million-dollar securities-fraud scheme. The Trump SoHo was beleaguered from the start: named for one of Manhattan\u2019s trendiest neighborhoods, the development wasn\u2019t really in SoHo but located just west of it, near the entrance ramp to the Holland Tunnel. Zoning laws wouldn\u2019t allow a residential tower at the location, so the Trumps fell back on an alternative: a \u201ccondo-hotel,\u201d in which buyers got a hotel room rather than an apartment, and were legally prohibited from staying there more than a hundred and twenty nights per year. Worse, the high-priced condos hit the market in September, 2007, just as the global economy began to crater in what became the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Business was slow, but the Trump family claimed the opposite. In April, 2008, they said that thirty-one per cent of the condos in the building had been purchased. Donald, Jr., boasted to The Real Deal magazine that fifty-five per cent of the units had been bought. In June, 2008, Donald, Jr., and Ivanka, alongside their brother Eric, gathered the foreign press at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Ivanka announced that sixty per cent had been snapped up. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very fortunate position where we have enough sales, and now we are strategically targeting certain buyers,\u201d she said. None of that was true. According to a sworn affidavit by a Trump partner filed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office, by March of 2010, almost two years after the press conference, only 15.8 per cent of units had been sold. This was more than a marketing problem. The deal hinged on selling at least fifteen per cent of the units. By law, the sales couldn\u2019t close with anything less. The Trumps and their partners would have had to return the buyers\u2019 down payments. Some buyers concluded that they\u2019d been cheated. In August, 2010, some sued the Trump Organization and others involved in the project in New York federal court. \u201cThis action seeks to redress the substantial and ongoing pattern of fraudulent misrepresentations and deceptive sales practices\u201d by the Trumps and the other defendants, the suit charged. The plaintiffs argued that there\u2019s a vast difference in value between a unit in a building that is fifteen-per-cent sold and one that is sixty-per-cent sold. Their complaint accused the sellers, including the Trumps, of \u201ca consistent and concerted pattern of outright lies.\u201d After the civil suit was filed, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office opened a criminal investigation. Prosecutors are often wary of getting involved in a dispute between wealthy litigants. But, in this instance, according to a person familiar with their thinking, the lawyers in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau quickly concluded that there was enough to warrant an investigation. They believed that Ivanka and Donald, Jr., might have violated the Martin Act, a New York statute that bans any false statement in conjunction with the sale of a security or real estate. Prosecutors also saw potential fraud and larceny charges,applying a legal theory that, by overstating the number of units sold, the Trumps were falsely inflating their value and, in effect, cheating unsuspecting condo buyers. Peirce Moser, an Assistant District Attorney known for his methodical, comprehensive investigations, soon took over the case. \u201cHe is not a cowboy,\u201d Marc Scholl, who spent almost forty years as a prosecutor in the District Attorney\u2019s office, said. \u201cHe is certainly not out to make headlines for himself or to advance himself.\u201d On the other side, the Trumps\u2019 defense team included Gary Naftalis and David Frankel, of the law firm Kramer Levin; Paul Grand represented one of the real-estate brokers who had worked with the Trumps. As the investigation progressed, Vance suffered an embarrassing setback in one of his highest-profile cases. In the summer of 2011, his office had abandoned a sexual-assault case against the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Vance, who was pummelled in the press afterward, denied in his interview with us that the case made him reluctant to take on another prominent defendant. A few months later, on January 11, 2012, Marc Kasowitz contributed twenty-five thousand dollars to Vance\u2019s campaign, unbeknownst to prosecutors in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau, who continued their work. Moser was particularly focussed on e-mail correspondence, according to seven people familiar with the case. Moser began considering impanelling a special grand jury, according to a person familiar with the investigation. That would have represented a significant escalation in the case, because it is often a prelude to indictments. With a grand jury in place, defense lawyers knew the risk of indictment was high. The defense team offered a deal to stave off this possibility, floating the possibility of a settlement of some kind, including a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have meant the corporate equivalent of probation for the Trump Organization. With the investigation appearing to gather momentum, Naftalis and Grand, who had already met with the prosecutors twice, began to step up their campaign against the case. Grand calls this the \u201cinternal appellate process.\u201d Particularly when well-heeled or high-profile defendants are involved, there can be a multi-month advocacy process that slowly makes its way up the hierarchy inside the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office. Grand and Naftalis decided that it would be unwise to go over the heads of the staff prosecutors. Instead, on April 18, 2012, they sent a letter to Adam Kaufmann, then the chief of the investigative division (he\u2019s now in private practice), outlining their arguments. The next day, the defense lawyers met with Moser, Kaufmann, and others from the prosecution team. The defense team acknowledged that the Trumps made some exaggerated statements in order to sell the units. But this was mere \u201cpuffery\u201d\u2014harmless exaggeration. Such language, they contended, didn\u2019t amount to criminal conduct. The Trumps weren\u2019t selling useless swampland in Florida. The condos existed. And the buyers\u2019 money was in escrow the entire time. The defense lawyers argued that bringing such a case to trial would be wasteful and that resources would be better spent on more serious offenses. As Grand put it to us during our recent interview, \u201cI guess in a world that is completely pure and where there is no deviation between propriety and the law, that kind of exaggeration and deliberately concentrated exaggeration can be pursued. But is that the kind of criminal-law enforcement the D.A. should be doing?\u201d Moser\u2019s answer seemed to be yes, and he found support among his supervisors. Moser had prepared an elaborate PowerPoint presentation, featuring dozens of e-mails that prosecutors believed showed that Ivanka and Donald, Jr., had repeatedly lied to buyers. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had a better e-mail trail,\u201d a person familiar with the investigation told us. At the meeting, Kaufmann peppered the defense team with questions, at one point raising his voice, according to a person who was there. \u201cI believed in the case,\u201d Kaufmann told us, though he declined to discuss the evidence. \u201cBut believing in the case doesn\u2019t mean we had reached the point when [I had] settled on what should happen with the case.\u201d\n\nWhite-collar criminal cases are often challenging to bring because of their complexity. And, by the time of the April meeting, prosecutors knew that they faced another impediment, this one created by legal maneuvers in the Trumps\u2019 civil case. Five months earlier, the Trumps and their partners had reached a settlement with the disgruntled buyers. The defendants agreed to return ninety per cent of the buyers\u2019 deposits, plus their attorneys\u2019 fees. But they extracted a rare concession in return: the plaintiffs agreed not to co\u00f6perate with prosecutors unless they were subpoenaed. (Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief legal officer, noted that the settlement terms were confidential and declined to comment on them.) Adam Leitman Bailey, the attorney for the buyers, had been helping prosecutors. Now he provided aid to the Trumps, writing a letter to the District Attorney that stated, \u201cWe acknowledge that the Defendants have not violated the criminal laws of the State of New York or the United States.\u201d In our interview with Vance, he said that he had never before seen a letter where plaintiffs in a civil case asserted that no crime had been committed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever received a letter like it,\u201d Vance said. He calls it a \u201csignificant and important\u201d communication. Certainly, prosecutors could subpoena the buyers of Trump condos. But they feared the witnesses would undercut the criminal case by claiming they weren\u2019t victims of a fraud. Still, Moser, backed by his supervisors, persisted. \u201cPeirce believed in his case,\u201d Grand said. \u201cWe did not succeed in talking him out of it and didn\u2019t succeed in talking one or two levels above him into dropping the case.\u201d", "description": "In a collaboration between The New Yorker, ProPublica, and WNYC, Andrea Bernstein, Jesse Eisinger, Justin Elliott, and Ilya Marritz report on the Trumps\u2019 legal history.", "authors": ["Andrea Bernstein", "Jesse Eisinger", "Justin Elliott", "Ilya Marritz", "Sam Knight", "Mark Singer", "Joshua Yaffa", "Dan Chiasson", "Michael Schulman", "John Cassidy"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59d3cdc06c18b26638d7e9db/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/ivanka-donjr-test-3.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-04"}
