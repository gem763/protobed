Nevertheless, the plight of that territory\u2019s more than 7 million souls can teach us an important lesson about what China has in mind for the rest of the world. It is not good.\n\nFor starters, the continuing protests speak volumes about China\u2019s commitment to \u201cone country two systems.\u201d When the British transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing agreed to this arrangement. It guaranteed that Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its own governance and economic system.\n\nThe Hong Kong system\u2014one of great economic freedom\u2014has produced tremendous economic success. But economic freedom is no more popular than political freedom among the Chinese Communist Party. And in recent years, Chinese authorities have been encroaching on the rights supposedly guaranteed to Hong Kongers under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement.\n\nMatters came to a head this April, when the Hong Kong government, under heavy pressure from Beijing, introduced legislation that would allow people accused of crimes against mainland China to be extradited. The proposal set off alarms among residents who know well that the mainland\u2019s thoroughly politicized legal system is not to be trusted.\n\nFear that Beijing would quickly weaponize the proposed law to target democracy activists and journalists sparked massive protests. Efforts to suppress the demonstrations have only ignited more public demonstrations.\n\nThe protests also tell us a lot about mainland China. There is one strain of thought that Beijing, while quite happy to bully Hong Kong, would not be so rash as to put down the protests with harsh military action. That kind of response repulsed the world when the Soviets did it, ultimately leading to the break-up of the USSR.\n\nYet many observers fear that Beijing will step in and crackdown on the demonstrators. After all, they note, the USSR\u2019s demise didn\u2019t stop the People\u2019s Army from rolling tanks into Tiananmen Square.\n\nThere is no question that Beijing is waging a war on nerves. Last month, it assembled troops and equipment along the border with Hong Kong. They\u2019ve also begun airing footage of troops training for suppressing riots in urban settings.\n\nThis all speaks volumes about the callous cynicism with which the Chinese government treats its own people. The Hong Kong police are already doing Beijing\u2019s dirty work for them (helped, to be fair, by protestors and agitators who have crossed the line and become violent or destructive).\n\nAs long as \u201cpro-democracy\u201d demonstrations don\u2019t spread to the mainland cities, Beijing might not be too concerned to see Hong Kong\u2019s stature as a stable and dependable place to do business diminished. Hong Kong just doesn\u2019t mean near as much to the Chinese economy as it did 20 years ago. Besides, the Chinese would rather see investment flow to mainland cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai that are more firmly under the regime\u2019s control. As for the welfare and future of the people of Hong Kong, that is the last thing Beijing cares about.\n\nMost mainland Chinese seem indifferent about the protests. Many are jealous of the privileges long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. Rather than press for similar freedoms, they are happy to see the islanders brought down a notch. This is yet more evidence that the hope that opening up China to the world would encourage Beijing to integrate smoothly into an equitable and liberal rules-based order is little more than magical thinking.\n\nFinally, there are lessons for the rest of us. China\u2019s encroachment on Hong Kong represents yet another in a long string of promises broken by the communist regime. They have violated their commitments to U.N. Convention on the Law Seas, violated U.N. sanctions (which they voted for) against North Korea and delivered debt and corruption (rather than the promised prosperity) through their vaunted Belt and Road economic \u201cinitiative.\u201d\n\nIn sum, Beijing has a well-deserved rep for playing fast and loose with the rules as it tries to bully its way to the top\u2014and its actions with Hong Kong only reinforce that reputation.\n\nNothing reflects the contemptuous attitude of the Chinese more than its prosperous propaganda claim that the Hong Kong demonstrations were engineered by the CIA. They know no right-thinking person in the world would believe this, but they don\u2019t care. They know that the people of China will accept this explanation (after all, they\u2019ll hear no other), and that\u2019s all they want.\n\nChina is acting like a global bully. Like most bullies, it will continue to do so\u2014until the world stops tolerating Beijing\u2019s intolerable behavior.\n\nHong Kong is a warning to the world. The world ought to take notice.", "description": "The outside world can do little to assure the future of freedom in\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0beyond making the case that preserving the principles of liberty are at stake.
