It\u2019s a different approach compared with many actors who land superhero roles and are immediately handed a stack of comics.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want me to confuse how he saw this world,\u201d said King, who worked with Lindelof on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d \u201cHe was right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause I did watch the film after [filming the pilot], and I would have been confused,\u201d she added. \u201cThey stand on their own. They don\u2019t even feel related to me in any way. Which I think is a great thing. I think that\u2019s the beauty of Damon making the choice of using the [comics] as canon instead of trying to duplicate, from my understanding, something that was already great.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatchmen,\u201d debuting Sunday on HBO, departs from the original story\u2019s nuclear-war fears of the \u201980s. The series instead leaps from the Tulsa race riots of the 1920s to a present-day battle between vigilante cops and a group of masked white supremacists. King said the sensitive subject matter is a way of addressing present-day issues while also paying homage to Moore and Gibbons\u2019s creation. It\u2019s a topic bold enough to carry the \u201cWatchmen\u201d name.\n\nThe show \u201cis using the current [political] climate to help tell the story,\u201d said King, who plays Angela Abar, a police officer turned vigilante who\u2019s also known as Sister Night. \u201cIn all honesty, of the other big things that are happening in our country right now, I don\u2019t know what really is bigger than [white supremacy]. Everything is just bubbling up right now in real life. There\u2019s no more hiding in plain sight. People are wearing their racism on their sleeves.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cWatchmen,\u201d Robert Redford is the president of the United States \u2014 he doesn\u2019t play the president, he is the president, although he does not appear as himself, at least through the first six episodes made available (his candidacy was implied at the end of the original comics run). He has handed out reparations, called \u201cRedford-ations,\u201d to African American descendants of those who suffered from racial violence in Tulsa. Rising out of that attempt to make amends is a hate group called the Seventh Kalvary, which wears the iconic \u201cWatchmen\u201d Rorschach mask (in the original comic it was worn by a crime-fighter). King\u2019s Sister Night is a part of the police force tasked with hunting them down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKing said the show isn\u2019t just about race. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a love story in there. There\u2019s a historical story in there. It\u2019s a [mix] of quite a few genres. As the story goes, I hope it becomes a little more meta. I hope that people receive it that way. It\u2019s provocative.\"\n\n\u201cWatchmen\u201d will feature some classic character appearances, such as Jeremy Irons in the role of Ozymandias (who was played by Matthew Goode in the movie), the mastermind behind the world-altering scheme that killed millions in the original story, but King\u2019s character, along with the majority of the cast, are new to this universe.\n\n\u201cAt first I kind of felt, like, how are those die-hard fans going to feel about the introduction of a new character?\u201d King said. \u201cI also felt a little bit of relief that I don\u2019t have to feel like I have to live up to a character that\u2019s so beloved.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis won\u2019t be the only time King will be a part of a comic-inspired series for HBO, which is picking up two seasons of the acclaimed animated series \u201cThe Boondocks\u201d (formerly on Cartoon Network) for its upcoming streaming service HBO Max.\n\nKing, who voices \u201cThe Boondocks\u201d kid brothers Huey and Riley Freeman, says she can\u2019t wait to see what creator Aaron McGruder has been working on.\n\n\u201cI told Aaron, \u2018Your voice has been missed.\u2019 [He] left a lot on the table there,\u201d King said. \u201cWe needed to hear [his] commentary through a lot of this [political] stuff.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cWatchmen,\u201d King is proud to be playing a black superhero inspired by a popular comic book universe in a post-\u201cBlack Panther\u201d world. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who plays her husband on \u201cWatchmen,\u201d was a major villain, Black Manta, in the billion-dollar grossing \u201cAquaman,\u201d which starred a biracial titular hero in Jason Momoa. A lead couple of color is yet another example of comic book adaptations\u2019 efforts at inclusion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe also wouldn\u2019t mind making a trip to Wakanda when director Ryan Coogler\u2019s highly anticipated \u201cBlack Panther\u201d sequel arrives in 2022, even if it means going up against King T\u2019Challa herself.\n\n\u201cEven if I was a villain, I would love to be in \u2018Black Panther 2,\u2019 \u201d King said with a laugh. \u201cLook, I will find a way to make it happen.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\"People are wearing their racism on their sleeves,\u201d said the Academy Award-winner, who plays a police officer turned vigilante in the HBO adaptation of the legendary comic.", "authors": ["David Betancourt", "Reporter Focusing On Comic Book Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SJIPS9UKyGIQ5T24XTIeyRr8WrY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRZXEGRVKREFRDU33DQWLYHKQY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
