We did it again but we hope to make it easier.'\n\nLiverpool dominated the first half but had only Sadio Mane's 41st-minute goal - his 50th in the Premier League for the club - to show for it after Milner's raking pass released the Senegal international, who should have doubled their lead before the break.\n\nIn the second half, with Klopp's side unable to gain full control, Leicester hit back through James Maddison 10 minutes from time to set up an anxious finish - but Milner was the coolest man inside Anfield with the seconds counting down, with his 17th success from 19 spot-kicks for the club.\n\n'Top teams always do it, they go to the very end of the game,' said the 33-year-old.\n\n'When you haven't had your best game or things haven't gone for you in the game, you keep going to the very end and find a way to win.\n\n'We've done it on numerous occasions. Sometimes there's a bit of luck in there, but forcing the issue and creating your own luck, the best teams always seem to do it.'\n\nJames Milner celebrates his match-winning penalty in the final few minutes at Anfield\n\nDespite the nature of the defeat Rodgers was satisfied with his side's performance.\n\n'You come to a stadium that is one of the most difficult in Europe in terms of momentum and we were able to turn the momentum around for us,' he said.\n\n'You have to have all types. We had to have that persistence and perseverance but when we had spells with the ball, we looked creative and we had a threat.\n\n'It wasn't to be but I am proud of coming here and bringing a team to compete at that level.'", "description": "James Milner's added-time penalty snatched a 2-1 win over Leicester on Brendan Rodgers' first return to Anfield on Saturday.
