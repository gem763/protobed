I would not change the way that police have dealt with this to date.\u201d\n\nPolice interviewed and breathalysed Anne Sacoolas, wife of an American diplomat at the scene, but did not arrest her. She left the country citing diplomatic immunity and has since admitted to driving on the wrong side of the road and hitting the teenage motorcyclist.\n\nNow, Northamptonshire police are preparing to fly to the United States to interview Mrs Sacoolas under caution and will send a full file to the CPS, to see whether she will be charged with any crime.\n\nAt the most severe end, if charged with causing death by dangerous driving, an extradition request could be sent to the United States causing diplomatic tensions.", "description": "The police chief in charge of investigating the death of Harry Dunn says he would not have done anything differently, despite his officers missing two opportunities to arrest the wife of a US diplomat who admitted to driving on the wrong side of the road, before fleeing the country.", "authors": ["Gareth Davies", "Jamie Johnson", "Jack Hardy", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WGquMaiNUU8/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
