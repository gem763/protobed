But Sarah E Hill, a professor of social psychology at the Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas argues we need to talk about how oral contraceptives are affecting women\u2019s thinking, emotions and behaviour. How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is her new book about the science behind a delicate subject.\n\nSome US states have recently made it harder to get an abortion and the Trump administration is doing its best to chisel away at access to birth control. Is your book trying to dissuade women from using the pill?\n\nMy institution was founded as a Christian school, but it doesn\u2019t have a particular religious bent now. My goal with this book is not to take the pill away or alarm women. It is to give them information they haven\u2019t had up until now so they can make informed decisions. The pill, along with safe, legalised abortions, are the two biggest keys to women\u2019s rights. But we also have a blind spot when it comes to thinking about how changing women\u2019s sex hormones \u2013 which is what the pill does \u2013 influences their brains. For a long time, women have been experiencing \u201cpsychological\u201d side-effects on the pill but nobody was telling them why.\n\nThe backlash we are seeing against the pill, particularly with millennial women walking away from it, I think is because women haven\u2019t felt right on it and have grown weary of doctors patting them on their heads and telling them they are wrong. The more information women have, the more it will bring them back to the pill.\n\nHow exactly does the pill affect women\u2019s brains?\n\nThe pill works mainly by mimicking the second half of a woman\u2019s monthly ovulatory cycle, in which the hormone progesterone is dominant. Its primary ingredient is artificial progesterone \u2013 so-called progestin \u2013 which shuts down the brain signal that prompts egg development. But that also means the ovaries aren\u2019t producing oestrogen, the hormone which dominates the first half of a woman\u2019s natural cycle. And oestrogen does some of our favourite things to our brains and bodies, making us feel sexier and more energetic. While most pills include some synthetic oestrogen \u2013 primarily to offset progestin\u2019s unpleasant side-effects \u2013 women can feel the lack.\n\nA less well-understood mechanism is that progestins, which are often created by changing the molecular structure of testosterone, aren\u2019t an exact match for our progesterone receptors. This means they can potentially stimulate other receptors, including those for testosterone, leading to masculinising effects, and for cortisol, which over time can dysregulate stress response. The stress hormone profile of pill-taking women, research suggests, is similar to people who have experienced chronic stress. Other research has found effects on the immune system, learning and memory.\n\nWe know a lot about the small but serious health risks associated with the pill \u2013 things like stroke and blood clots. Why have we been kept in the dark about the effects on the brain?\n\nUntil very recently, there has been little research. And the research that is out there doctors often aren\u2019t aware of because it isn\u2019t being published in the medical journals they look at, but rather in psychology and neuroscience journals. Then society has taboos about talking about it. The best defence against the sexist notion that women\u2019s hormones make them less rational than men seemed to be to deny hormonal involvement in the brain. And the pill is so useful, no one is motivated to examine it too critically. But our hormones, especially our sex hormones, are a key part of what creates the experience of feeling like ourselves. And talking critically about the pill doesn\u2019t mean that the benefits aren\u2019t going to outweigh the cost. It\u2019s not antithetical to women\u2019s rights to talk about this stuff.\n\nSome women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have none Sarah E Hill\n\nHow does the pill potentially affect women\u2019s choice of mate?\n\nOestrogen is known to nudge women\u2019s preferences when it comes to their romantic partners to favour qualities that are associated with masculinity and higher testosterone: square-cut jaws, broad shoulders and brow ridges, for example. But research suggests pill-taking women \u2013 in their state of artificial progesterone dominance and lacking a cyclical oestrogen urge \u2013 seem to prefer the faces of men who are less masculine. The implication is that if a woman chooses her partner when she\u2019s on the pill and then goes off it \u2013 it might lead to relationship dissatisfaction because she no longer finds herself as attracted to the person. It is a possibility that women should at least keep in mind.\n\nWhat about the mood changes women report on the pill?\n\nBeing on the pill is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, though there are some women who report the pill stabilises their moods. The association was particulary high in young women aged 15-19 and their suicide risk is also more than twice that of non-pill takers. A dysregulated stress response is likely part of the picture, but another driver seems to be low levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone \u2013 a breakdown product of progesterone that acts as a natural sedative. In pill-taking women, the research suggests, levels are significantly lower than in naturally cycling women. Women starting the pill should keep a mood journal or tell a friend to keep an eye on them, especially if they have a personal or family history of mood-related symptoms. For young women, the pill may not be worth the trade-off if it is being used for reasons other than to prevent pregnancy \u2013 for example to clear acne or regulate periods.\n\nHow big are the effects you are talking about?\n\nThey are relatively small. But at an individual level, some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have absolutely none. Each woman should know about the research that\u2019s out there so they can monitor themselves and troubleshoot.\n\nThere are over 100 different formulations of pill along with multiple other hormonal birth control options. Should we treat them the same?\n\nThe signalling is going to be different. Progestins divide into four different generations each with a somewhat different molecular structure. Each pill can also have a different ratio of progestin to artificial oestrogen. Right now, the research that exists rarely divides women based on the type of progestin they are on, let alone the ratios. We need to push science to start looking at this.\n\nShould women seek alternatives to the pill?\n\nI am not making recommendations to any individual woman. Each knows what her own life goals are and how her body feels. But I do advise women to be strategic in their use of the pill. Understand the psychological trade-offs and then decide whether or not you want to use it. For a lot of women, the answer is still going to be yes, but now they choose knowing that information. With all the different formulations out there, I am confident women who want to use the pill are going to be able to find one that works for them. For women who are looking for something which doesn\u2019t have hormones in it, the copper IUD is one of the most failsafe.\n\nAre you concerned that raising these issues might turn women to less effective methods of birth control that could leave them with unwanted pregnancies?\n\nIt is the last thing I want to have happen. I\u2019m hoping we can use this moment to educate ourselves, but still recognise how important it is to protect ourselves from unwanted pregnancy. Not being pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be pregnant \u2013 for me the benefits of that far outweigh almost any brain changes the pill can cause.\n\nYou say the issue of birth control is not yet solved. So what would solve it? Better pills, a male pill, or something new entirely?\n\nIdeally we want contraception that\u2019s really safe and effective that doesn\u2019t monkey with anyone\u2019s brain. Maybe that means more investment in the copper IUD. Or maybe it is something yet to be invented. But we need the imagination of the best researchers on this issue. The pill works so well and is so easy, we\u2019ve become complacent. And in the meantime, we need more and better research to understand what we\u2019ve got.\n\n\u2022 How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is published by Orion (\u00a319.99).
