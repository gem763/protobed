And even now, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d\n\nThe Hongkonger said he had been distracted by the sometimes-violent unrest in his home city over the past four months.\n\n\u201cQuite a number of large-scale protests overlapped the competition time,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, I couldn\u2019t focus on the competition.\u201d\n\nThe makers of Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment, wrote in a statement Chung had broken their rules and said he would not receive any prizemoney \u2013 $10,000 according to the player \u2013 and would be banned from Hearthstone esports for a year.\n\nThose rules say players must not engage in acts that bring themselves into \u201cpublic disrepute\u201d, offend anybody or damage the developer\u2019s image.\n\nThe video game industry last year generated more than $135bn globally \u2013 $43.4bn of that in the United States alone.\n\nChung said his removal from the competition was \u201ca pity\u201d after spending four years in esports.\n\nFortnite World Cup: the $30m tournament shows esports' future is already here Read more\n\n\u201cI sacrificed time hanging out with my friends and studying because of this competition. Even though it seemed that I had wasted four years of time, I have something more important in my heart \u2013 if we lose the movement, Hong Kong will end forever.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a small stake of Activision Blizzard \u2013 the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment and one of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies \u2013 is owned by the Chinese holding company Tencent and Ng believes the developer could be bowing to Beijing\u2019s world view by silencing him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my comments would make a huge impact,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just expressing myself and why should I be afraid of this kind of \u2018white terror\u2019? This is my freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be scared. I hope my act can inspire other gamers like me, to continue to support the movement in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe gamer drew support from the gaming community, some of whom wrote on the Reddit-like forum LIHKG.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t think of any reason why the developers in esports would offend youngsters. Good luck to them,\u201d wrote one user in Cantonese.\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cI had been supporting the Blizzard Entertainment for nearly 20 years. I bought most of its games. I\u2019m uninstalling all its games. I will not support Blizzard any more.\u201d\n\nThe incident is similar to a controversy in the NBA sparked last week when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a now-deleted comment on Twitter supporting the protesters, and also elicited reactions from politicians.\n\n\u201cRecognize what\u2019s happening here,\u201d posted Florida senator Marco Rubio in a tweet. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Oregon senator Ron Wyden in a tweet. \u201cNo American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\nAt Blizzard\u2019s headquarters in Irvine, California, a plaque bearing inspirational messages such as \u201cThink Globally\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters\u201d has been reportedly covered up, while English-language fan community forums and subreddits are flooded with support for Chung.\n\nAdditional reporting by Patrick Lum", "description": "Chung \u2018blitzchung\u2019 Ng Wai, expelled from a Hearthstone tournament after showing support for Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement, said he has no regrets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ceeb38bc5b69f0591ba015294277b1e398ecfd/0_0_617_370/master/617.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3bf1becc4c27305453661f4967a6987d", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
