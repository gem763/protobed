That's pretty huge in these days,\" Popovich said, according to ESPN. \"Sometimes, it's kind of Orwellian. You think we're living in a place where, 'Is this really happening?' But that comparison was pretty stark when you put our president up against those leaders when he's with them or talking to him and how he reacts compared to the way Adam Silver reacted. I was proud of him. It was great.\"\n\nThe NBA\u2019s lucrative business efforts in China came under pressure earlier this month after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a message in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. Nearly all of the NBA\u2019s Chinese sponsors suspended their business ties with the league after Silver\u2019s statement in support of Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression, while state-owned Chinese television pulled NBA games off the air.\n\nAsked about the NBA\u2019s issues in China, Trump ripped Popovich and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr for declining to directly address the situation. Popovich and Kerr are among the NBA\u2019s outspoken voices on social justice issues, and both have been critical of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThey talk badly about the United States but when it talks about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad. I thought it was pretty sad actually,\u201d Trump told reporters last week.\n\nTrump said Kerr \u201cwas so scared to even be answering the question\u201d about China, while Popovich \u201cdidn\u2019t look quite as scared.\u201d\n\nIn response, Popovich said that Silver\u2019s leadership during the NBA\u2019s China crisis stood in contrast to Trump\u2019s handling of international issues.\n\n\"All I did was make a comparison between Adam Silver's show of principle and courage in a tough situation, as opposed to how our president reacts when in the company of authoritarian figures, whether it's Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Russia or Turkey, whatever it is,\" Popovich said. \"It comes off as really feckless, impotent, cowardly by comparison.\"\n\nThe NBA\u2019s business in China is worth $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr are among the NBA\u2019s outspoken voices on social justice issues, and both have been critical of the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Gregg-Popovich.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
