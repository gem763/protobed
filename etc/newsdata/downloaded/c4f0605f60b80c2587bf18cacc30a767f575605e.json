She was thrown on a pyre for the benefit of men", "language": "en", "text": "On Sunday evening, Congresswoman Katie Hill announced her resignation following a horrific week in which photos of her consensual sexual relationships were published in right-wing tabloids. These photographs, she says, were leaked by her estranged husband Kenny Heslep and weaponized amid messy divorce proceedings (Heslep has yet to publicly respond.) This accompanied allegations that Hill had inappropriate relationships with a staffer on her congressional campaign and in her DC-based office, something she denies. Rather than endure an ethics investigation that would inevitably amplify the images being circulated, she chose to resign and put her constituents first.\n\nIt is not my place \u2014 nor that of anyone \u2014 to defend Katie Hill\u2019s alleged inappropriate (albeit consensual) sexual relationships with subordinates, but this situation does illuminate some undeniable facts. Firstly, that women in elected office are held to entirely different standards than their male colleagues; secondly, that bisexuality continues to be maligned and erased from broader cultural conversations; and thirdly, that women, no matter their place in society, continue to have their reputations destroyed by the horrific practice of public sexual shaming.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has been accused by at least 23 women of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was accused of sexual harassment by former staffer Anita Hill during his 1991 confirmation hearing. His colleague Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault by at least four different women, notably Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Julie Swetnick, and Deborah Ramirez. Congressman Scott DesJarlais had affairs with patients under his care and appears to have unethically prescribed one of them opioids. Virginia Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax has been accused by one woman of sexual assault and by another of rape. All of these men have denied the allegations against them while others have called for them to resign. Despite calls for them to at least undergo investigation, all remain in power, most of them making decisions that directly affect the lives of women.\n\nKatie Hill is a not a predator. She is not a rapist or sexual assailant or sexual harasser. Her crime is far worse than that in our society: she is a woman \u2014 a bisexual woman at that \u2014 who has lived beyond the ludicrous, impossible restraints we put on women\u2019s sexuality, particularly those in the public eye. Men in power, particularly white men, are permitted a hero\u2019s journey in their indiscretions, a moral arc in which they can make mistake after mistake \u2014 because even the most horrible transgressions are called \u201cmistakes\u201d when you\u2019re a white male \u2014 and transcend to a higher plane of humanity that better informs their leadership style. Women who transgress even slightly are pilloried and burned at the public stake as an offering to whatever moral gods our society supposedly worships.\n\nI am not saying that Katie Hill didn\u2019t show a serious lack of judgement. Any sexual relationship with a subordinate is almost always unethical, and in the times it is not \u2014 when such a relationship has been made transparent and affirmed \u2014 it still may lead to ethical complications that puts those in the relationship, and those around at them, at risk. It would have been right of her to publicly apologize for this lack of transparency and ensure a fairer course moving forward.\n\nEvery person who condones the actions that led to this public fallout is part of the problem. We want women, particularly those in power, to not be frigid but also not have warm blood in them. We want women to present attractively but not to be too attractive, and we expect them to know the location of that thin line as it relates to our individual preferences. We want women to be saintly but also slutty, depending on whatever arbitrary mood we happen to be in and never once considering that the two might be complementary and overlapping positive qualities in a woman, as they apparently are in men. This is particularly true of queer woman, especially bisexual women, who are not permitted to have healthy relationships with both men and women beyond the pornographic fantasies in which we have contextualized them.", "description": "On Sunday evening, Congresswoman Katie Hill announced her resignation following a horrific week in which photos of her consensual sexual relationships were published in right-wing tabloids.
