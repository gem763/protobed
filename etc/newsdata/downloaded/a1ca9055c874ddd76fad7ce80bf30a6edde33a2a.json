The situation has raised eyebrows across the media industry and created a headache for the liberal-leaning CNN.\n\nSome CNN staffers were reportedly aghast when the network hired McCabe in late August, simply because he'd been fired from the FBI for lying. Now that charges against McCabe are seemingly looming, some of the shock has turned to anger and confusion.\n\n\"It erodes our journalistic credibility to have so many highly anti-Trump, former Obama DOJ/security officials without a semblance of balance.\" \u2014 Current CNN personality\n\nA current CNN on-air personality told Fox News this week that \"it erodes our journalistic credibility to have so many highly anti-Trump, former Obama DOJ/security officials without a semblance of balance,\u201d specifically pointing to pundits Samantha Vinograd, Jim Sciutto, Asha Rangappa, Juliette Kayyem and James Clapper, along with McCabe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the justification for hiring him initially since it was publicly documented he\u2019s, best case, a liar,\u201d the on-air personality added. \u201cHow will CNN handle it if he\u2019s also soon indicted?\u201d\n\nA second current CNN personality told Fox News on Thursday that many liberal-leaning staffers feel McCabe is \u201csomewhat of a freedom fighter\u201d who was \u201cunfairly targeted\u201d by the Trump administration. This was transparent on Thursday when CNN dispatched its top legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, to defend his \u201cfriend\u201d McCabe while downplaying the potential charges.\n\nCNN'S LEGAL GURU WEIGHS IN IN DEFENSE OF 'COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND' ANDREW MCCABE\n\n\"Andy McCabe is a CNN contributor. He's a colleague and a friend to many of us who work here,\" Toobin said. \"This is an extremely unusual prosecution. Andy McCabe had the right to speak to reporters. That is beyond dispute. As deputy director of the FBI, he had the right to speak to reporters. He also has an impeccable record as one of the most honored and successful FBI agents of his generation.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone inside CNN is defending McCabe.\n\nThe second anonymous on-air personality said he seems like a \u201cgood guy\u201d in general but crucial blunders will ultimately define him.\n\n\u201cHe made some colossal mistakes and the fact that he f---ing lied under oath, I have no sympathies for him. How will [CNN] have him on weigh in on anything related to integrity?\u201d \u2014 Second current CNN personality\n\n\u201cHe made some colossal mistakes and the fact that he f---ing lied under oath, I have no sympathies for him,\u201d the CNN staffer said. \u201cHow will [CNN] have him weigh in on anything related to integrity?\u201d\n\nANDREW MCCABE TO APPEAR AS KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT DEMOCRATIC FUNDRAISER\n\nThe source predicted that CNN would \u201cstand by McCabe until they can\u2019t\u201d and said network producers have kept McCabe out of situations where he could be \u201cundressed\u201d on-air by pundits with opposing views.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s colleague also pointed out that CNN doesn\u2019t typically refer to him as a \u201claw enforcement analyst,\u201d instead opting for the simpler label \u201ccorrespondent.\u201d\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe FBI famously fired McCabe on March 16, 2018, after a Justice Department inspector general report found he had repeatedly misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast month, McCabe sued the FBI and the Justice Department over his firing, arguing it was part of President Trump's plan to rid the bureau of leaders he perceived as disloyal to him.\n\nDePauw University professor and frequent CNN critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News that the ratings-challenged network made a \u201cquestionable\u201d move by hiring McCabe in the first place and needs to keep him off TV while things play out.\n\n\u201cWith this latest development, the move looks even worse. McCabe has credibility issues, and that is a problem for a news channel that has had its professional practices challenged of late,\u201d McCall said. \u201cAt the least, it would behoove CNN to suspend McCabe from his contributor position until the legal process has worked its way out.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Joseph A.
