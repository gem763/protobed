John Cornyn", "language": "en", "text": "John Cornyn\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nSandy Hook, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Santa Fe, and most recently, El Paso and Midland-Odessa. Across the nation, city names have become trending hashtags as acts of mass violence have rocked communities, and claimed the lives of innocent people.\n\nAugust was bookended by the two recent shootings in Texas, killing 22 people in El Paso, and seven in Midland-Odessa. The immediate outpouring of support was coupled with calls for action to prevent these senseless acts in the future.\n\nThe same happened nearly two years ago in the wake of the Sutherland Springs shooting. We quickly learned the shooter had a history of violence and a conviction which should have prevented him from purchasing a firearm. But this information was never uploaded to the criminal background check databases, and as a result he was able to purchase four firearms.\n\nTen days after the Sutherland Springs shooting, I introduced the bipartisan Fix NICS Act, now law, to fill the gaps in our background check system. It\u2019s led to a roughly 400 percent increase in record submissions from federal agencies, and prevents violent criminals from purchasing firearms illegally.\n\nIt\u2019s time to once again pass legislation to reduce mass violence in our country.\n\nFinally, a legislative response\n\nToday in the Senate I will be introducing the Restoring, Enhancing, Strengthening, and Promoting Our Nation\u2019s Safety Efforts \u2014 or RESPONSE \u2014 Act. This bill will include a number of provisions to prevent attacks and make our communities safer.\n\nFirst, this legislation takes aim at unlicensed firearms dealers who are breaking the law. The Midland-Odessa shooter failed a background check when he attempted to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer, but was still able to purchase his weapon from someone who appears to have been manufacturing and selling guns who never registered as a firearms dealer. By not registering, he was able to skirt the background check requirement and sell a weapon to the shooter.\n\nThe RESPONSE Act creates nationwide task forces to investigate and prosecute those who are illegally selling firearms, and those attempting to buy firearms who provide false statements as part of a background check.\n\nSecond, this bill improves the quality and availability of mental health care. We must do more to identify and support vulnerable individuals who could pose a danger to themselves or others. We know the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and while mental illness is not the prevailing cause of mass violence, enhanced mental health resources are critical to saving lives.\n\nWe thought we weren't culpable:I grew up a white nationalist. We never blamed ourselves for mass shootings like El Paso.\n\nThe RESPONSE Act expands Assisted Outpatient Treatment Programs, which provide families of individuals with mental illness an opportunity to get treatment for their loved ones in the community, rather than an institution. It also includes measures to expand mental health crisis intervention teams and improve cooperation between mental health providers and law enforcement.\n\nThird, the RESPONSE Act takes steps to increase the safety of our students. I\u2019ve heard from countless parents who are rightfully concerned about sending their children to school amid these attacks. That should never happen. The RESPONSE Act will make schools less vulnerable through promoting best practices and internet safety policies to help schools better identify and assess students whose behavior indicates a threat of violence.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s vital that law enforcement have access to information about potential threats \u2013 particularly those made online. This legislation would encourage online platforms to share information with law enforcement concerning acts of mass violence, hate crimes, or domestic terrorism. These providers and platforms already have this ability during emergencies and to fight child abuse. This simply expands the scope of information they can share.\n\nI spent time with families and victims in El Paso and Midland-Odessa following the shootings and promised each one of them I would work with my colleagues in the Senate on real solutions.\n\nNo person, family, or community should endure the heartbreak caused by the recent mass shootings in Texas. It\u2019s time to answer their call for action, and pass the RESPONSE Act to keep our communities safe from mass violence.\n\nSen. John Cornyn is a Republican representing Texas in the U.S. Senate.
