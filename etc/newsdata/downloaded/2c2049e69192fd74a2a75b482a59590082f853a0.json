According to the NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport, Neal will not face any penalty for his unsportsmanlike penalty.\n\nA good, common sense ruling: #Falcons S Keanu Neal, penalized for for unsportsmanlike conduct for throwing his helmet after suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in a loss to the #Colts, was not fined for his action. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 28, 2019\n\nMany expected that Neal would be hit with a fine this week, similar to the one Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs received last week. Diggs was hit with a $10,527 fine after removing his helmet and taunting the crowd in Green Bay. While Neal\u2019s helmet removal was completely different, the action was still the same \u2014 which technically is a violation of NFL rules.\n\nThe 24-year-old was placed on Injured Reserve on Monday. He recorded 113 total tackles in 2017, his second year in the league, marking the second-best total on the team. Neal tore his ACL last year in the season-opener, too, making his latest injury that much more devastating for the former first-rounder.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, the league made sure to spare Neal from an extra fine for a penalty many \u2014 including Colts tight end Eric Ebron, who actually confronted the officials after the flag was thrown last week \u2014 feel he never should have received in the first place.\n\n\u201c[I was upset] because they should never throw a flag on that,\u201d Ebron said this week, via the Indianapolis Star. \u201cI mean, we got free yards out of that, so I\u2019m not tripping. It just [upset] me off that the referee was not acknowledging the fact that he got hurt.\n\n\u201cI understand you\u2019re doing the job and throwing the flag, but don\u2019t throw the flag and not give a damn. That\u2019s what I was saying [to the officials.]\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Keanu Neal suffered a season-ending Achilles injury last week, and was hit with a penalty after he threw his helmet off in frustration on the field.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/M7TP6gBzz5i4tnP_kK4Vpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LorPmnmxmGuiC_MtDzlXqw--~B/aD0xODEzO3c9MjcxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dd466400-e236-11e9-b794-e0a69c6cddbc", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
