USA TODAY Sports\n\nPlease, stop it.\n\nThis is Major League Baseball.\n\nIt\u2019s a postseason game.\n\nA National League Division Series elimination game.\n\nAnd St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt is supposed to pull his ace, Jack Flaherty, after one inning just because they have a 10-0 lead over the Atlanta Braves in the first inning?\n\nOr pull him in the second inning when it\u2019s 11-0.\n\nOr the third inning when it\u2019s 13-0.\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nFlaherty, who prepared the last four days for this start, was lined up perfectly to pitch Game 5 Wednesday, taking the Cardinals to the NLCS.\n\nYou don\u2019t abruptly change your plans just because you have a massive lead.\n\nCome on, you really going to have your 23-year-old ace pitch Game 1 of the NLCS on Friday on one day's rest?\n\nOr pitch Game 2 on two days?\n\nHow about pitch Game 3 on regular rest, making him available for Game 7, as well?\n\nAll you would have done by pitching him on short rest in Game 2 is making him available for Game 6.\n\nOh, or didn\u2019t you see what happened to Houston Astros\u2019 Cy Young winner Justin Verlander pitching on short rest on Tuesday, who was pitching one day earlier than his normal routine.\n\nShildt played this perfectly.\n\nFlaherty gave up one run in six innings. (Photo: Brett Davis, Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFlaherty pitched six easy innings, throwing 104 pitches, with no stress at all in the Cardinals\u2019 13-1 rout.\n\nCan you imagine if he pulled Flaherty out early, and the bullpen coughed it up and blew the game, making him look like the biggest laughingstock in playoff history?\n\n\"No, no chance,\" Shildt said after the game.\n\n\"We made a move in the first, but you pull him after one or two and something crazy starts happening in your bullpen, no, it's not the play.\n\n\"And like I said, we finished this series. He did his job; got us through six. Kept it right there. Brought it home.\n\n\"So I did not think about -- always thinking, but did not think about after the first pulling him. That would have been pretty brazen.\"\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 bullpen badly needed a break, and with Flaherty yielding four hits over six innings, they only had to cover the final three innings with three pitchers.\n\nNow, the bullpen is fully rested and poised to go on Friday in the first game of a seven-game series in their bid to return to the World Series for the first time since 2013.\n\nFlaherty will now be available for Game 3, which major league managers will tell you is the most critical game of a seven-game series.\n\nAnd guess what? If there\u2019s a Game 7, there\u2019s no one the Cardinals would rather have than Flaherty.\n\nShildt is a strong candidate to win the NL Manager of the Year.\n\nHe proved once again why on Wednesday with his decision on Flaherty.\n\nReally, it was a no-brainer.\n\nSee you Friday with veteran Adam Wainwright taking the mound.\n\nYeah, that guy\u2019s pretty doggone good, too.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "description": "Armchair managers everywhere were wondering if Cardinals manager Mike Shildt should have let his ace pitch deep into the game with a double-digit lead.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
