The chef uses Uncle Ben\u2019s converted rice here on the advice of his cooks Pascal Dieumeme and Orenus Olean. It\u2019s parboiled, and less sticky, to yield firm, separate grains, a nice counter to the earthy pigeon peas. You can start the peas from from scratch, but it\u2019s also fine to use canned or frozen. The whole dish is finished with scallions, bell pepper, thyme and more coconut milk. As tempting as it may be, don\u2019t rush the rice to the table: Let it rest off the heat. It\u2019ll help its texture and flavor.\n\nFeatured in: The Chef; Mark Militello.", "description": "In 2002, Florence Fabricant spoke with Mark Militello, the chef and owner of the now-closed Mark\u2019s Las Olas in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who brought this recipe to The Times The chef uses Uncle Ben\u2019s converted rice here on the advice of his cooks Pascal Dieumeme and Orenus Olean It\u2019s parboiled, and less sticky, to yield firm, separate grains, a nice counter to the earthy pigeon peas", "authors": ["Mark Militello", "Tejal Rao", "Lidey Heuck", "Nigella Lawson", "Sam Sifton", "Melissa Clark", "Alison Roman", "Sarah Digregorio", "David Tanis", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/9b542c2/assets/NYTCookingLogo.png"}
