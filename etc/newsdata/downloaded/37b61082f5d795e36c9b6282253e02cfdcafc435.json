Just over two weeks later, after a massive manhunt, Beardy was also one of the first people to find the suspects' bodies \u2014 a mere eight kilometres away.\n\nBilly Beardy discovered this burning SUV on July 22, while with his wife and daughter. It was later linked to B.C. homicide suspects Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky. (Billy Beardy)\n\nWhile the intensity of that search has faded, some Fox Lake members say the sense of anxiety generated by the manhunt has not. And new details released by the RCMP about its investigation have confirmed just how close those residents came to danger.\n\n\"This will probably change everyone's lives forever,\" said Beardy.\n\nA still taken from surveillance footage released by the RCMP shows Kam McLeod, left, and Bryer Schmegelsky leaving a store in Meadow Lake, Sask., on July 21. (RCMP)\n\nOn Friday, RCMP in British Columbia released a report outlining their investigation into the shooting deaths of Lucas Fowler, Chynna Deese and Leonard Dyck. It detailed the journey police say McLeod and Schmegelsky took across western Canada, which ultimately culminated in a massive search in northern Manitoba involving police and military aircraft, tactical officers, police dogs and a dive team.\n\nTheir conclusion: McLeod shot Schmegelsky, and then himself, in a suicide pact, using two rifles also linked to the three homicides. Dyck's digital camera was found near the bodies with a series of videos where police say the pair expressed a desire to kill again, and no remorse for the homicides \u2014 but no clear motive for the B.C. killings.\n\nBeardy has lived in the area, and travelled along the formidable Nelson River, his entire life. So he says he did not hesitate when the RCMP asked for his help taking officers up and down it, beginning on July 27.\n\n\"It's unforgiving and unpredictable,\" he said of the river.\n\nBeardy acknowledges the work was tense. He believed the pair were armed.\n\nWith the RCMP report, he learned Schmegelsky and McLeod indeed left hundreds of rounds of ammunition in the Sundance area.\n\nAlong with the pair's stated desire in the video to kill again, Beardy said those conclusions are \"pretty heart-pumping.\"\n\n\"We were there,\" he said. \"We were the first ones on site.\"\n\nEnd of search leaves mixed emotions\n\nFor some in northern Manitoba, the physical end of the manhunt \u2014 coupled with the recent release of the report \u2014 has left lingering mixed emotions.\n\nFox Lake member Lynda Neckoway says life has returned to normal in many ways; people are hunting and fishing. Kids are playing outside. But others are struggling. Some elders remain afraid to this day.\n\n\"You're still looking out the window,\" she said. \"I never used to lock my door before but now I'm locking it at night. You know, that's a big difference.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel sad for what happened, sad for the young men, and their families. They're going through a whole lot. And then we went through a lot with what they've done in our community,\" she said.\n\nFox Lake Cree Nation member Lynda Neckoway says people are still looking out their windows and locking their doors, weeks after the end of the search for the B.C. homicide suspects. (Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\nShe said learning new information from the RCMP brought some relief and closure, but details about the guns and ammunition also highlighted the potential dangers during the search.\n\n\"Oh my god, they still had all that stuff with them,\" she said. \"Some of us could have died in the community. Or somebody going down the road, or some of the police. Somebody could have died when they were doing the manhunt.\"\n\nDuring the height of the search in the summer, Neckoway organized about a dozen community bonfires to help bring people together. She is one of about a dozen members who were recently recognized by the Fox Lake community for helping out during the search.\n\nEven now, Neckoway says community members are still checking in with each other. She says sharing circles will begin soon in the community to help people focus on positive aspects of life.\n\nStill, she adds it's hard to shake the unease that lingers from the summer.\n\n\"I think that trauma will always be there for a little while.\"\n\nA fateful sighting\n\nThroughout the search, Beardy suspected the pair did not get far from the area, a hunch that would later be borne out.\n\nPolice say some of McLeod's items were found on Aug. 1. Six days later, Beardy said he was heading back to an area where a sleeping back and backpack were spotted, along with about four officers.\n\n\"The last day was a miserable day because the weather wasn't on our side,\" he said. \"The water was so rough.\"\n\nSo was the shoreline. The banks are steep, says Beardy \u2014 as high as 30 metres \u2014 and difficult to climb.\n\nBut during that fateful day in the boat, he says he noticed a raven jump \u2014 and another officer spotted it, too.\n\nFighting the fast-paced and rough water, they turned around the boat, finding McLeod's body first.\n\nSchmegelsky's was not apparent until they got off the boat.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" Beardy said. \"It was just like a big surprise when we found them.\"\n\nHe then simply adds, \"I was glad I was there.\"", "description": "New RCMP details about the massive search in northern Manitoba for two B.C. homicide suspects have brought relief and closure to some residents, but also a chilling confirmation of how close danger loomed during the manhunt.", "authors": ["Cbc Manitoba", "Angela Johnston Is A Network Producer With Cbc News Based In Winnipeg.
