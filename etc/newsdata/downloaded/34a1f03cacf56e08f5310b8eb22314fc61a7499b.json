US officials have suggested the plan will not include a Palestinian state, something Netanyahu has promised to never let happen.\n\nA White House official said there had been no change in its policy and would not comment further.\n\nNetanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, is battling for his political survival and the announcement was interpreted as a rallying cry to his hardline rightwing base.\n\nThe prime minister stood in front of a large map on an easel that showed Israeli sovereignty extended over the vast majority of the Jordan Valley.\n\nIt appeared to display Israeli territory completely encircling the West Bank, slicing off the eastern border with Jordan. Jericho, a Palestinian city, and smaller Palestinian villages were displayed as enclaves that would not be annexed.\n\nRaphael Ahren (@RaphaelAhren) Here's the map of the territory of the Jordan Valley, in the West Bank, that Netanyahu vowed to annex if he wins next week's election (blue: will be annexed to Israel; orange: will remain under Palestinian control) pic.twitter.com/xMcsPeDLpt\n\nNetanyahu said: \u201cToday, I announce my intention, after the establishment of a new government, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea.\n\n\u201cThis map defines our eastern frontier. We haven\u2019t had this kind of opportunity since the [1967] six-day war, and may not have it again for another 50 years.\u201d His comment referred to the war in which Israel captured the land.\n\nJordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, warned the plan would \u201cpush the whole region towards violence\u201d. And later on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu was dragged away by his security team from a campaign rally in the southern city of Ashdod after air sirens sounded. The Israeli military said two rockets had been launched from Gaza, both of which were intercepted by its aerial defence system.\n\nHundreds of thousands of settlers live in outposts in the West Bank, which Israel\u2019s military continues to rule, controlling the lives of more than 2.5 million Palestinians.\n\nThe prime minister made a similar pledge in April to annex Israeli settlements, but the latest announcement appeared to extend to a much larger part of the Palestinian territories that border Jordan.\n\nHe made the earlier statement two days before an election in which he came out ahead with support from pro-settler nationalists. But Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition and forced a second election.\n\nThe senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that if Netanyahu\u2019s latest plan went ahead, \u201che would have succeeded in burying even any chance of peace between Palestinians and Israelis\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe need to end the conflict and not to keep it for another 100 years.\u201d\n\nAyman Odeh, the leader of an alliance of Arab parties in Israel, called Netanyahu\u2019s statement \u201cnot just election spin\u201d but \u201ca vision of apartheid\u201d.\n\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, built on land confiscated from Palestinian families. Extending Israeli sovereignty over such a large area would also be seen as putting an end to fading hopes for a Palestinian state, as there would be little unbroken land on which to create it.\n\nTrump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital early in his term further damaged the two-state ideal. The Palestinians regard the occupied eastern section of Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, and cut contact with Washington after the declaration.\n\nWhy Netanyahu\u2019s election threats could become real this time Read more\n\nEarlier this year, Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict and annexed in 1981. The move broke from the international consensus following the second world war that forbids territorial conquest during war.\n\nPalestinians warned at the time that it set a dangerous precedent for land grabs in the West Bank.\n\nIn Israeli politics, however, annexation is a popular position. Israel has long stated it would want to keep the 2,400-sq km (926.65-sqmile) Jordan Valley to maintain control over the international border.\n\nBenny Gantz, the head of the main opposition party, Blue and White, said Netanyahu had stolen his idea.\n\n\u201cBlue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley is a part of Israel forever. We are happy that Netanyahu has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognise the Jordan Valley,\u201d he said.\n\nJ Street, a liberal pro-Israel lobby in the US, said Netanyahu\u2019s annexation plan \u201cwould destroy Israeli democracy and constitute a flagrant violation of international law\u201d.\n\nJeremy Ben-Ami, the group\u2019s president, said it would \u201cmake the occupation permanent and condemn millions of Palestinians to a future of living under unending Israeli rule, without basic civil rights or self-determination.\u201d", "description": "Israeli PM says he will seek to make move \u2018in maximum coordination with Trump\u2019", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5318e981bb8bbf45577dfc304ec3a2f290968fd/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3525a7018999334d18256d722dc338b6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
