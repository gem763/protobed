Broadcom will likely appeal the ruling. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: This is the competition commission\u2019s first use of an interim order in 18 years\u2014an EU court threw out its previous attempt after the company involved challenged it.

Interim orders require the commission to prove a company\u2019s practices would create lasting damage to competition before an investigation is complete. For instance, a 2010 case in which the commission decided Google illegally favoured its own shopping tool took seven years, during which many rivals left the market. Broadcom hasn\u2019t commented on the ruling, but has previously said that it does not expect such a move to have a material impact on its business.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
