But while mobile notspots mean there can be places in your home that your smartphone\u2019s signal doesn\u2019t reach, they continue to be essential.\n\nThere are other benefits over relying on your mobile. First, almost all broadband tariffs still require a landline rental as well, so you might as well have a phone attached to it, right?\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the battery on a cordless home phone lasts longer than that smartphone you\u2019ve been using all day long when you weren\u2019t at home.\n\nEven if your mobile signal is good in the upstairs bedroom, it may not reach to the below-ground rooms, and a cordless landline can often deliver great range.\n\nThe radiation levels from a mobile phone are less of an issue than they used to be, but a cordless landline certainly still offers an even lower health risk. Corded phones have no radiation at all, of course.\n\nIf you choose a pack with multiple handsets, the first has to be plugged in to the landline socket but the rest connect by cable to the electrical socket but wirelessly to the first phone.\n\nThere are two dominant brands in this category of gadget: BT which is solid and dependable, and Panasonic which has the edge when it comes to being chic and innovative.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Panasonic\n\nPanasonic\u2019s landline looks like it wants to be a mobile, and its design works very well. It\u2019s chunkier than a smartphone but still feels good in the hand. It fits satisfyingly on the charging station with magnets ensuring it\u2019s in the right place to charge. If the phone is downstairs and you\u2019re in another room with your mobile, you can set it up so the smartphone can answer the landline\u2019s call, or use the smartphone to make calls through the landline connection \u2013 which could be a godsend if mobile reception in some parts of your home is poor. This connectivity works with Android and Apple phones though there are additional features for Android phones such as matching the smartphone ringtone on the Panasonic phone. Slick and effective.\n\nBuy now\n\nJacob Jensen telephone 3: \u00a390.90, Amazon\n\nThis handsomely designed model from Jacob Jensen is a real pleasure to use and is beautifully made with great build quality. Touch the upper part of the handset and it almost floats into your hand. Of course, regular features are there, such as memory keys and last number redial.

That means the call quality is consistently excellent, something that varies on even the best cordless.\n\nBuy now\n\nBT premium phone: From \u00a369.99, BT\n\nThe Premium looks great and has an attractive, bright colour display. It has a 3,000 name-and-number directory and, usefully, you can sync the address book from your mobile, connecting the two mobile to the landline wirelessly by Bluetooth to do so.

There\u2019s also a flashing light to indicate an incoming call, if that helps \u2013 you can turn it off if not. If you get a second handset, you can use one as a baby monitor. It can store up to 150 phone numbers, but you do have to enter each one yourself \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer them en masse from your mobile, for instance.\n\nBuy now\n\niDect loop twin: \u00a339.99, Argos\n\nThis is a very good-value phone, especially in this twin combination which means you can have landline phones in two rooms: the larger phone is the one that includes the answer machine, which records for up to 15 minutes. A nuisance call blocker is designed to prevent endless unwanted calls \u2013 like several similar systems it works reasonably well but is far from flawless. It can be used to block specific numbers as well as types of numbers such as withheld number calls or international calls. Simple to use and distinctively styled.\n\nBuy now\n\nPanasonic KX-PRS120EW: \u00a369.99, Panasonic\n\nThis handset, like the Panasonic KX-PRW120EW above, is attractive and stylish. It feels good and is very easy to use. The bright colour screen has useful extras like an analogue clock screen saver. You can block up to 100 numbers \u2013 calls from these numbers will be silently dropped if they ring. You need to be a subscriber to your phone provider\u2019s Call ID feature for this to work. You can buy an optional key finder tag which you can attach to frequently mislaid items (keys? Specs case?) so that when you press a button on the phone, the tag beeps.\n\nBuy now\n\nBT essential phone: From \u00a344.98, BT\n\nThis is a simple and well-priced phone with an answering machine that records up to 30 minutes of messages \u2013 you can access these messages remotely by calling home and entering a PIN code. It has a nuisance call blocker for up to 100 numbers, though not all nuisance calls by type.

Also available with extra handsets if you prefer.\n\nBuy now\n\nPanasonic KX-TGC410EB: \u00a324.99, Panasonic\n\nThis entry-level handset is great value. The black-and-white screen is easy to read thanks to its yellow backlight and although it\u2019s highly affordable, it\u2019s still well-built and has features such as a call blocker, though only for up to 30 entries. A built-in phone book is similarly basic, though it can hold 50 names and numbers which may be enough for many people. There\u2019s also a dedicated eco button which reduces power consumption to eke out battery life.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Home phones\n\nThe Panasonic KX-PRW120EW offers great features, striking design and a decent price, though the company\u2019s cheapest phone, the Panasonic KX-TGC410EB is also worth considering if you don\u2019t need an answering machine. BT\u2019s range is wide, with something for everyone, though the BT premium phone is the company\u2019s standout.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
