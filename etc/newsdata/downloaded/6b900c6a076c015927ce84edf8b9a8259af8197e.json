There was no quid pro quo. Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings. Every day this nonsense continues more taxpayer time and money is wasted. President Trump is leading the way for the American people by delivering a safer, stronger, and more secure country \u2013 the do-nothing Democrats should consider doing the same.\n\nIn the transcripts of his opening remarks prepared for his deposition Tuesday and obtained by the New York Times, Taylor said:\n\nAccording to Mr. [Tim] Morrison [from the White House National Security Council], President Trump told Ambassador [to the European Union Gordon] Sondland that he was not asking for a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d But President Trump did insist that [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself.\n\nHe also said that a meeting between Trump and Zelensky was contingent upon Ukraine launching an investigation into corruption allegations against a company linked to Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTaylor testified:\n\nBy mid-July [2019] it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by [Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy] Giuliani.\n\nThen-VP Biden pushed Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016 who had investigated corruption allegations against Burisma. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on the company\u2019s board of directors, prompting the allegations. Biden took the position in 2014.\n\nGeorge Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, recently told impeachment investigators that he warned the Obama administration that Burisma was corrupt when Hunter was working there. The Obama administration, however, dismissed his concerns.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint accusing Trump of pressuring Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid is at the center of the impeachment probe. Trump and Zelensky have denied the accusation.\n\nTaylor testified that he expressed concern that \u201can irregular, informal channel\u201d was driving U.S. policy in Ukraine. He said the irregular channel included Sondland, Giuliani, former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.\n\nTaylor said in his opening remarks:\n\nIn August and September of this year, I became increasingly concerned that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons. \u2026 I found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making U.S. policy towards Ukraine. There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular.\n\nTaylor explained that he had authority over the regular diplomatic processes, which he said Congress supported in a bipartisan manner:\n\nI was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland included me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels.\n\nVolker and Sondland have testified that they worked with Giuliani on pushing Ukraine to investigate Burisma, not Biden. The former VP\u2019s son, however, is linked to the company.\n\n\u201cI had come to understand well before then that \u2018investigations\u2019 was a term that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections, and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\n.", "description": "A top diplomat told impeachment investigators the Trump administration \"conditioned\u201d U.S. aid to Ukraine on an investigation into Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Amb.-Bill-Taylor-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
