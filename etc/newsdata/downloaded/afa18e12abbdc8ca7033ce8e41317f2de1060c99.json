Mitt Romney (R-UT) told the Atlantic on Sunday that he believes the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry investigating President Donald Trump will serve as an \u201cinflection point in American history.\u201d\n\nAtlantic staff writer McKay Coppins released an interview on Sunday detailing extended conversations with Romney regarding his views on the U.S. Senate, his attacks on President Trump, as well as his opinions on impeachment.\n\nCoppins wrote that while most Republicans have backed the president amidst the impeachment inquiry, Romney continues to stay \u201copen to the idea that the president may need to be evicted from the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nSen. Romney said that he believes that the potential impeachment will serve as a critical juncture in American history.\n\n\u201cI do think people will view this as an inflection point in American history,\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at myself as being a historical figure,\u201d the failed 2012 Republican presidential candidate said. However, Romney adds, \u201cI do think these are critical times. And I hope that what I\u2019m doing will open the way for people to take a different path.\u201d\n\nSen. Romney also suggested that Trump\u2019s performance in office is directly linked to his character.\n\n\u201cBerating another person, or calling them names, or demeaning a class of people, not telling the truth\u2014those are not private things,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIf during the campaign you pay a porn star $130,000, that now comes into the public domain.\u201d\n\nAfter Utah elected Romney to become the state\u2019s junior senator, he wrote out a list of 50-plus priorities he hopes to accomplish in the U.S. Senate. These include \u201coverhauling the immigration system, reducing the deficit, addressing climate change,\u201d as well as \u201ccompensating college athletes and regulating the vaping industry.\u201d\n\nSen. Romney also told the Atlantic that he does not have a strict definition of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d or actions that might warrant impeachment. When asked how to identify an impeachable act, he cited Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart\u2019s line for defining pornography, \u201cI\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he has seen impeachable offenses yet, the Utah senator said he would make up his mind after he sees the evidence at an impeachment trial, saying, \u201cAt this stage, I am strenuously avoiding trying to make any judgment.\u201d\n\nRomney then suggested that President Trump\u2019s electoral coalition of working-class Americans will not be replicable in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe have to get young people and Hispanics and African Americans to vote Republican,\u201d Romney said.\n\nHowever, despite Romney\u2019s claim, President Trump outperformed Romney amongst Hispanics and black Americans.\n\nRomney\u2019s claim contrasts with Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s vision for the GOP, which revolves around the Republican Party representing the American middle class.\n\nSen. Hawley told Breitbart News in an interview in September that if the Republican Party \u201cwants to have a future,\u201d it will have to become a movement of working people.\u201d", "description": "Mitt Romney said that he believes that the impeachment inquiry investigating Trump will serve as an \"inflection point in American history.\"", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/may8-19-mitt-romney-american-flags-getty-images-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
