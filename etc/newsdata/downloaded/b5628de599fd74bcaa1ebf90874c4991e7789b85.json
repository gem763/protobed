If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Valley National Bancorp earnings per share are up 8.1% per annum over the last five years.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Valley National Bancorp's dividend payments per share have declined at 3.9% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs Valley National Bancorp worth buying for its dividend? Valley National Bancorp has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects.
