USA TODAY\n\nThe game of musical chairs continues atop the USA TODAY Sports Re-Rank 1-130 of the Bowl Subdivision. Clemson held the honor for much of the season's first month. Last week, the title went to Alabama.\n\nNow it's Ohio State's turn. The Buckeyes are the latest No. 1 after yet another convincing win, this time a 34-10 decision at home against Michigan State that saw the offense rack up 529 yards while the defense held the Spartans to just one touchdown and 67 yards rushing. The win comes after convincing wins in their first five games that included a defeat of Cincinnati.\n\nOhio State running back J.K.

So has No. 2 Alabama, which was off this past weekend. While we're at it, so has No. 3 Clemson, No. 4 LSU, No. 5 Georgia, No.6 Oklahoma and even No. 7 Wisconsin, which remains unbeaten.\n\nNo. 8 Florida made a statement by knocking off No. 13 Auburn. Meanwhile, No. 9 Penn State keeps rolling and presents a serious threat to the Buckeyes in the Big Ten East Division.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\nMISERY INDEX: Miami (Fla.), Washington among teams with frustrated fans\n\nCOACHES POLL: Alabama remains No. 1, Ohio State moves up to No. 4\n\nIn other words, there's competition for the top spot. Which helps explain why it's been so hard to pinpoint which team exactly deserves the honor \u2014 though the task is bound to get easier in October and early November.\n\nOne league devoid of a single team in this conversation is the Pac-12, which suffered another blow to its national reputation with Washington's loss to Stanford. That docked the Huskies 17 spots to No. 29. The Pac-12 has three teams in the Top 25 but none among the best of the best: No. 14 Oregon, No. 15 Utah and No. 25 Arizona State.\n\nNew to the Top 25: No. 17 Michigan, No. 24 Cincinnati, No. 25 Arizona State.\n\nOut of the Top 25: No. 29 Washington, No. 36 Oklahoma State, No. 39 Central Florida.", "description": "There's another change at the top of  NCAA Re-rank with Ohio State - after beating Michigan State - moving past Alabama for the No. 1 spot.", "authors": ["Paul Myerberg", "Published A.M.
