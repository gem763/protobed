One local real estate agent clearly has no doubts, with his signs up every few hundred metres.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian at the Western Sydney International Airport ceremony. Louise Kennerley\n\nWhether it turns out that way will be a massive test of the ability of governments and councils to cooperate with businesses and educational institutions to design a productive, self-sustaining community with a real economic purpose and sophisticated employment and training. That also involves overcoming lingering memories of the collapse of the grand but totally flawed vision of the Multifunction Polis established by the Hawke government in the 1980s.\n\nTechnology has revolutionised the economy, speed of connections and advanced manufacturing opportunities since then, of course. But the key to western Sydney\u2019s development, according to Ayres, is the overt investment focus, explaining the MOUs with 18 highly successful and sophisticated international companies like Hitachi and BAE as a foundation.\n\nThe key to western Sydney\u2019s development, according to Stuart Ayres, is the overt investment focus, based on advanced manufacturing.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t come cheap in terms of public investment in infrastructure. RBA governor Philip Lowe should take heart. There is $20 billion \u2013 and counting \u2013 of infrastructure investment underway by federal and state governments.\n\nAs well as the airport, there\u2019s a massive road building program and a rail line connecting to the main train system at St Marys. It\u2019s still hardly the direct high speed rail corridor Anthony Albanese pushed to connect the airport to the rest of Sydney, although Ayres says people can still reach the CBD within an hour.\n\nBut he dismisses criticism about the absence of a direct rail link: he is more interested in the idea of residents finally being able to live and work locally due to the breadth of opportunities offered in a new Western Parkland city. He\u2019s also confident of many international visitors staying locally, if only to see relatives and friends in what is a very multi-ethnic area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe first stage for us is making sure you connect the western Sydney airport to western Sydney,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s a big change from the 1990s, according to Ayres, when there was community opposition to the idea of an airport and political paralysis until the Abbott government finally decided in 2014 to proceed.\n\n\u201cIt's gone from being purely viewed through the lens of environmental impact, primarily about noise, to seeing how those things sit in a landscape where we want better economic opportunities for a generation,\u201d Ayres says. \u201cThe mindset of western Sydney has changed rapidly, almost to the point where the community had moved before most politicians sensed it.\u201d\n\nNot before Minister Ayres, of course. And Westacott, who also used to be the departmental head of planning as well as housing in NSW, has also long wanted to alter the daily exodus of people driving out of a growing area via inadequate roads in order to get to jobs elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe have to completely re-imagine Sydney so it\u2019s no longer this economic migration from the western fringe to where the economic opportunity is in the east,\u201d Ayres says. \u201cWe have to create the economic opportunity where people already live. If you don\u2019t do that, you will never be able to get in front of the infrastructure requirements to cope.\u201d\n\nThat requires a different model to the traditional drawing of strict zoning lines on a map. Instead, the design is aimed at encouraging the progressive collaboration that allows businesses to talk with governments and educational institutions and the airport about what they need and where.\n\n\u201cOur starting point is the economy, off the back of the airport, versus the land planning approach,\u201d Westacott says.\n\nLarge signs declare: \u201cNew Airport, New Possibilities.\u201d And new hopes ...", "description": "A great place to live and work, a new economic powerhouse, a thriving centre of skilled manufacturing jobs.
