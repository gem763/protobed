This is a matter for the US. We have made our position absolutely clear.'\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman also sidestepped the US decision, saying the Turkish actions were 'deeply concerning'.\n\nSyrian Kurds carry flags and banners as they demonstrate against Turkish threats to launch a military operation on their region, in the town of Al-Qahtaniyah, in north east Syria\n\nTurkish forces artillery pieces are seen on their new positions near the border with Syria in Sanliurfa province last weekend\n\n'The UK has been consistently clear with Turkey that unilateral military action must be avoided as it would destabilise the region and threaten efforts to secure the lasting defeat of Daesh,' he added.\n\nEarlier Mr Trump hailed Turkey as a 'big trading partner' in a tweet.\n\n'They have also been good to deal with ... Also remember, and importantly, that Turkey is an important member in good standing of NATO,' he added.\n\nHe also insisted Washington was not abandoning the Kurdish-led forces, writing: 'We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.'\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces have said they may launch talks with Damascus or Moscow to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full US withdrawal from the area.\n\nThe Turkish Defence Ministry said late on Monday that it had completed preparations for a possible military operation in northeastern Syria.", "description": "Foreign Office Minister Andrew Murrison said Britain would 'oppose' any military incursion by its Nato ally in the wake of the widely-criticised American pull-out.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19445832-0-image-a-8_1570544258258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
