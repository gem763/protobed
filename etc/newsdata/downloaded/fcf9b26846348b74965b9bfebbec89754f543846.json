If he wins by one vote, his bill is not going to come out at the other end unchanged.\u201d\n\nFeverish cross-party discussions are under way on the best tactics and timing to ensure maximum support for a vote on a confirmatory referendum, which supporters insist has a real chance of passing this week.\n\nPeter Kyle, who is set to table a second referendum bill with fellow Labour MP Phil Wilson, told The Independent: \u201cBy the time this withdrawal bill is through the House of Commons, we are either going to have a general election or a referendum. Those are the only two outcomes from the next two weeks. If the Johnson deal goes through, he will go straight to an election.\u201d\n\nThe three-day timetable set out by Mr Rees-Mogg was denounced from all sides as inadequate.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen today that even the Westminster Brexit Secretary hasn\u2019t yet grasped the details of this deal. Trying to ram through legislation of this complexity, significance and long lasting consequences in just 3 days is an abomination of scrutiny and democracy. https://t.co/OcNH0sHOIB \u2014 Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) October 21, 2019\n\nThe commons leader\u2019s Labour shadow Valerie Vaz said: \u201cAt every stage the government has been running scared of this House and democracy and it\u2019s now attempting to force through a flawed Brexit deal which sells out people\u2019s jobs, rights and our communities.\u201d\n\nScottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \u201cTrying to ram through legislation of this complexity, significance and long-lasting consequences in just three days is an abomination of scrutiny and democracy.\u201d\n\nAnd the DUP\u2019s Jeffrey Donaldson said that the truncated period for scrutiny \u201cdoes not do justice to what the constituents I represent need\u201d.\n\nMPs pointed out that the Maastricht Treaty had 41 days\u2019 debate in parliament and the Treaty of Rome had 37, compared to the maximum of eight proposed by the government for the WAB to get through all stages in the Commons and Lords.\n\nThe furious rejection of the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan by his confidence-and-supply allies has raised expectations that the DUP may be willing to add their potentially decisive 10 votes to efforts to secure a customs union or second referendum.\n\nDefeat on the timetable would certainly wreck the PM\u2019s plan to leave the EU with a deal on 31 October, leaving the UK reliant on a Brexit extension to avoid a no-deal crash-out at the end of the month, while almost certainly ending any chance of an election before Christmas. The EU has yet to indicate when it will respond to Mr Johnson\u2019s request for an extension, amid speculation that leaders of the remaining 27 EU states may wait until next Monday to make their decision.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Halloween deadline for Brexit is in peril with MPs poised to rebel against his drive to force a 110-page ratification bill through the House of Commons in just three days.And the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal itself could be killed off on Tuesday, if MPs deny his Withdrawal Agreement Bill", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wx.xk6IqCeU0mGUqGVimrQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/0e983416d5e19e9b5471a6a6c10af658", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
