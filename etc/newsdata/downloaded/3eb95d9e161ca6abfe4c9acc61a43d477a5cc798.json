The Kurds, an ethnic group in a region that spans Turkey, northern Syria and Iraq, have fought alongside Americans in the war on ISIS for years. But their goal of carving out a national state in the region is strongly opposed by Turkey, which regards at least some of their forces as terrorists.\n\nWithin a day of the American redeployment, Turkey began mobilizing for the attack.\n\nEchoing a point raised earlier in a blog post by a right-wing commentator, Trump dismissed the Kurdish alliance with an inexplicable reference to World War II, and suggested that the Kurds are pursuing their own interests in the Mideast, not necessarily America\u2019s:\n\n\u201cNow, the Kurds are fighting for their land, just so you understand, they are fighting for their land. And as somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example, they mentioned the names of different battles, but they\u2019re there to help us with their land, and that\u2019s a different thing.\n\nPhoto: Evan Vucci/AP More\n\n\u201cIn addition to that, we have spent tremendous amounts of money in helping the Kurds,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his threat from Monday to \u201cobliterate\u201d the economy of Turkey with sanctions if \u2014 as some fear \u2014 it perpetrates a massacre of the Kurds.\n\nThe U.S. pullback, a sudden reversal of years of American policy, was met with unusually harsh and bipartisan criticism in Washington, including by Trump\u2019s frequent defender Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the Kurds had been \u201cshamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAsked about the fate of thousands of captured ISIS fighters who have been held prisoner by the Kurds, Trump said it wouldn\u2019t be America\u2019s problem:\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go. They want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn\u2019t want them from us, we could have given it to them, they could have had trials, they could have done whatever they wanted. But as usual, it\u2019s not reciprocal. You know, my favorite word, \u2018reciprocal.\u2019 That\u2019s all I want. I don\u2019t want an edge, I just want reciprocal, it\u2019s not a fair deal for the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump reminded reporters that scaling back America\u2019s overseas commitments was one of his campaign promises.\n\n\u201cI campaigned on ending the endless wars. We\u2019re all over the world fighting wars,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018You\u2019re doing the right thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe ended his comments by invoking the American casualties of the ongoing fighting in the Mideast, with an implied rebuke to Graham, who he said \u201cwould like to stay there for the next 200 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk tough, tough guys, all these tough guys, \u2018let\u2019s keep fighting, let\u2019s keep fighting.\u2019 If they had to go to Walter Reed, where they do unbelievable work\u2026\u201d Trump said, before trailing off into an anecdote about an injured soldier who had surgery to rebuild his nose.", "description": "President Trump was unconcerned about what is widely characterized as a betrayal of the Kurdish fighters who bore the brunt of the battle against ISIS.", "authors": ["Jerry Adler", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0rttpDlVIJYrXAyujjI0bA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/266f6c30-ead9-11e9-b2bc-b6dab24c31b9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
