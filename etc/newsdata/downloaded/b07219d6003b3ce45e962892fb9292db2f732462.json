An estimated 12 million women in Western countries are prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to combat the symptoms that happen with the decreasing levels of estrogen and progesterone associated with menopause.\n\nInterested in Breast Cancer?

While the study confirms long-held beliefs that the use of HRT leads to an increased risk of breast cancer, it distinguishes between different regimens of hormone therapy that are more likely to increase breast cancer risk than others.\n\nUp to this point, data from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI), the largest and most robust long-term study looking at HRT, have guided doctors' thinking about the risks and benefits of HRT. This new study deepens our understanding of the size of those risks.\n\n\u201cWomen who use HRT for 10 years essentially double the risk of breast cancer caused by HRT than if they only use it for five years,\u201d said Dr. Noah Kauff, an obstetrician and gynecologist and chief of Cancer Genetics at Northwell Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\nThe new data shows that the risk for breast cancer begins to increase with as little as one to four years of HRT use. For women taking five years of HRT starting at age 50, one in every 50 users of continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy develops breast cancer over a 20-year period than would have otherwise. Even after stopping HRT, that increased risk can persist for more than 10 years. On the brighter side, use of HRT for less than one year or use of vaginal estrogen creams alone were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nOn average, women use HRT for approximately two to three years, but the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that women use the lowest dose of hormones for the shortest period of time to minimize both breast cancer risk and risk of blood clots. Determining what exactly the HRT doses and regimens should be is challenging, and this study gives doctors a bit more guidance.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s new in this study compared to WHI is that it shows certain progestogen regimens might be more linked to breast cancer than others,\u201d said Polaneczky.\n\nWomen who take HRT can either take estrogen alone or estrogen in combination with a progestogen. For women who still have their uterus, estrogen causes excess growth of the uterine lining as an unwanted side effect, so they need to take a progestogen to balance out this effect.\n\nDan Dalton/Getty Images/Caiaimage\n\nBut there are different ways to take progestogens and there are different kinds. While some women take it daily with their estrogen, others take \u201ccyclic\u201d progestogen for only several days out of the month.\n\nThe study showed that women who take cyclic progestogens have a slightly lower risk of breast cancer compared to women taking progestogens every day. There were no substantial differences in cancer risk between the different types of progestogens used, including progestins and natural progesterone.\n\n\u201cThis study has me rethinking going back to cycling progestogens with my patients,\u201d said Polaneczky. She advises that women should be on progestogens for no fewer than 10-12 days per month to avoid the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n\u201cThese are really individualized discussions,\u201d she added. \u201cMany women don\u2019t like progestogens as it is because they can cause mood swings and bloating. I don\u2019t want women to take less and less of their progestogens as a result of this study and then risk getting endometrial cancer.\u201d\n\nIn general, more women may prefer natural oral progesterone, which tends to have fewer side effects than the more potent progestins, she explained.\n\nFor women who have had their uterus surgically removed, estrogen-only regimens are preferred.\n\n\u201cThere used to be controversy about whether estrogen alone increases breast cancer risk. That issue is put to rest in this study,\u201d said Kauff. \u201cTurns out that estrogen-only regimens are still associated with increased cancer risk, although it is less than those on combined HRT.\u201d\n\nDoctors say that women are understandably concerned about the potential for developing breast cancer in association with HRT use. It\u2019s the most common malignancy in Western countries with almost 3% of women diagnosed with the disease in their 50s.\n\n\u201cWhile using HRT may increase your risk for developing breast cancer, it also has important benefits, like reducing osteoporotic fractures and potentially reducing risk of colon cancer,\u201d said Kauff.\n\nThose benefits may level out the risks, since there is no significant difference in death due to all causes in women taking HRT compared to those who are not taking it.\n\nPolaneczky tells her patients that the risk is still minimal. \u201cWe know that using HRT increases breast cancer risk by about 1-2% over a 20-year period. It\u2019s not a large risk, but I tell them that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c \u201d Cutting out alcohol and exercising more both improve symptoms of menopause and independently reduce breast cancer risk, so there\u2019s a lot that women can do to make lifestyle changes that benefit their health.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want the breast cancer risk, then don\u2019t take hormones,\u201d she noted. Instead, Polaneczky encourages her patients who are hesitant about HRT to try other medications first, like certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and gabapentin.\n\n\u201cCutting out alcohol and exercising more both improve symptoms of menopause and independently reduce breast cancer risk, so there\u2019s a lot that women can do to make lifestyle changes that benefit their health,\u201d she said.\n\nWith such a variety of options available with risks and benefits, a serious discussion with your doctor is important as menopause symptoms approach.\n\nDr. Lauren Kelly is an internal medicine resident physician in New York City working with the ABC News Medical Unit.", "description": "A new study in The Lancet provides new evidence suggesting that the longer women use hormone replacement therapy, the higher their risk of breast cancer.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/doctor-01-as-gty-190830_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
