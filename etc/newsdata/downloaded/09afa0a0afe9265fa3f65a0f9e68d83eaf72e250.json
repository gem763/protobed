The first one in Singapore in 2018 resulted in a vague denuclearisation agreement which led to few concrete results.\n\nThe second summit in Vietnam in February 2019 ended early without any agreement.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on\n\nDidn't North Korea just test a missile?\n\nJust this Thursday, North Korea confirmed it test-fired a new type of a ballistic missile, a significant escalation from the short-range tests it has conducted since May.\n\nImage copyright KCNA via REUTERS Image caption A picture released by North Korea's news agency said to be of the missile\n\nThe missile - able to carry a nuclear weapon - was the North's 11th test this year. Fired from a platform at sea, it appears to be capable of being launched from a submarine, which means North Korea could potentially launch missiles far outside its territory.\n\nAnalysts said North Korean might have been seeking to build up pressure ahead of the talks.", "description": "North Korea says talks in Sweden broke down, but the US insists \"good discussions\" were had.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/001F/production/_109113000_mediaitem109112999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
