And also tried to wound a new apparent front-runner, demanded more attention for some ignored issues, discussed the age and health of some of the oldest people ever to run for the presidency\u2026 and pleaded for civility.\n\nRead on for the 4 biggest takeways from the fourth Democratic Debate.\n\nCandidates go after Elizabeth Warren\n\nJoe Biden Elizabeth Warren Pete Buttigieg More\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter recent polling showed Elizabeth Warren as a new likely front-runner, candidates at Tuesday\u2019s debate set their sights on the Massachusetts senator in much the same way they piled on Joe Biden in previous debates. Particularly Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who went on the offensive against Warren during a discussion of health care and Medicare for All.\n\nAfter Warren responded to a question from the New York Times\u2019 Marc Lacey about the middle class would be taxed by her Medicare for All plan, Buttigieg scrutinized her response.\n\n\u201cWe heard it tonight: A \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 question that didn\u2019t get a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cYour signature is to have a plan for everything. Except for this: No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi trillion hole \u2026 is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nLater, Klobuchar attempted to use Warren\u2019s previous \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d attack against her, saying: \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing, whenever I talk about this, that these are Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right in this room,\u201d Klobuchar said to Warren. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the debate, Biden argued Warren and Sanders (who is also polling very well) were \u201cvague\u201d and that he was the \u201conly one on stage\u201d who had \u201cgotten anything really big done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?\u201d That\u2019s what we should look at that, and part of that requires you not being vague.\u201d When Anderson Cooper asked Biden to clarify who he was referring to, Biden gestured toward Warren and Sanders and said they were both being vague about Medicare for All.\n\nBiden and Warren later had jabs for one another over the creation of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau as Warren spoke about her role in establishing the bureau.\n\n\u201cI agreed with the great job she did. And I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let\u2019s get those things straight too,\u201d Biden interjected.\n\nWarren responded by giving more of the credit to Biden\u2019s former boss. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Warren responded.\n\nKamala Harris and Cory Booker steer focus to women\u2019s reproductive rights early in debate\n\nKamala Harris Cory Booker More", "description": "The fourth Democrat primary debate Tuesday night saw Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Tom Steyer, and Tulsi Gabbard assemble in Ohio to field questions about range of issues.During the debate", "authors": ["J.
