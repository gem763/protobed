In that exchange, Sondland took several hours to respond to a suggestion by Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, that Trump was leveraging aid to clinch a political favor. When Sondland finally did respond, he told Taylor he was \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\nMeet the Ukraine Hatchet Man Trump Is Hiding From Congress\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nThe Washington Post now reports that Sondland had contacted Trump before responding, and Trump told him he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a quid pro quo.\u201d That call is said to have last less than five minutes.\n\nSondland is also expected to say during his testimony on Thursday that he spent months prior to the September text exchange working at Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s direction to get Ukrainian authorities to announce publicly that they would be investigating corruption at the Ukrainian gas company linked to Biden's son.\n\nIn exchange for that announcement\u2014described as the \u201cdeliverable\u201d in the text messages\u2014Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would finally get the White House meeting he'd been seeking, according to the Post.\n\n\u201cIt was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,\u201d the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony told the Post.\n\nGiuliani has publicly claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials to push for a Biden investigation were facilitated and directed by the State Department. But according to the whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry against Trump, State Department officials including Sondland and former U.S Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker had talked to Giuliani in a bid to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d of his shadow diplomacy in Ukraine.\n\nSondland, a political appointee who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, was blocked by the State Department from appearing for a deposition earlier this week, a move which Trump all but confirmed in a tweet declaring he didn\u2019t want his ambassador to testify \u201cbefore a totally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
