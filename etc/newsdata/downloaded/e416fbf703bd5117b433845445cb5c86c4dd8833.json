We\u2019ve had our little things whether they\u2019re on the field or off the field, obstacles we\u2019ve had to overcome, that\u2019s par for the course.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be lucky or have the gods smile on me or anything like that.\u201d\n\nAustralia head into the blockbuster quarter-final in Oita on Saturday as clear underdogs having failed to produce a complete performance in wins over Fiji, Georgia and Uruguay, and a loss to Wales.\n\nThey have also lost six successive tests to Jones\u2019s team since knocking England out of their own World Cup in 2015.\n\nCheika has never beaten former Randwick team mate Jones in their coaching rivalry and became the first Wallabies coach to be whitewashed by England in a test series on home soil in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant, really,\u201d Cheika said of that record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to avoid it, but why go back and talk about all those games?\n\n\u201cLooking backwards is only going to give you a sore neck.\u201d\n\nCheika was reluctant to talk about his relationship with Jones. It was fine, he said.\n\nHe also had little to say about England\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cLots of respect (for England) but I\u2019m not a big analyser of the opposition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always telling my coaches not to watch the opposition so much. They watch too much footage of the opposition.\u201d\n\nCheika, who took Australia to a surprise final at the 2015 tournament, has said he would quit the Wallabies job if he failed to deliver a third World Cup to the nation.\n\nHaving run a successful fashion business, he added that coaching was a passion rather than a career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got to get a real job one day when I grow up,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cCoaching (is) a series of moments along the way. Some are great, some aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI just want to enjoy the moment, live in the now and I couldn\u2019t care less afterwards.\u201d", "description": "England will have had an extra week to freshen up before their Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Australia but the teams' different preparations will mean little on matchday, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said on Monday.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440648797&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0M0", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
