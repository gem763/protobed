Thousands demonstrated in other parts of the country of 18 million people in a sign that economic concessions by President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era have failed to ease public anger.\n\nAt least 19 people have died in the turmoil that has swept Chile. The unrest began as a protest over a 4-cent increase in subway fares and soon morphed into a larger movement over growing inequality in one of Latin America\u2019s wealthiest countries.\n\nThe lack of leaders and a list of clear demands in the protest movement show the shortcomings of Chile\u2019s unpopular, discredited political parties, said Marta Lagos, head of Latinobarometro, a non-profit survey group in Chile.\n\n\u201cThere is a failure of the system of political parties in its ability to represent society,\u201d Lagos said.\n\nShe said she expected protesters to become more organized, and that it was unlikely that Pi\u00f1era, who took office last year, would resign. The protests, Lagos said, are bigger than any that occurred during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet decades ago or under democratic governments that followed.\n\nPi\u00f1era served an earlier term as president, from 2010 to 2014.\n\nOn Friday, hundreds of trucks drove slowly on a main highway that skirts Santiago, where stone-throwing protesters have fought riot police for more than a week. Some Chileans in cars and motorcycles joined the protest, held to demand an end to private highway tolls.\n\nMost car drivers pay between $35 and $130 a month to use highways around Santiago, depending on how much time they spend on the roads. Truckers pay much more because of the long distances that they travel.\n\nMany Chileans earn between $560 and $760 a month, making it hard to pay for basic needs, let alone drive on the highways.\n\nThere will be no further highway toll fee increases this year under Chilean law, transport minister Rafael Moreno said.\n\nOperators of some subway lines in Santiago also stopped service, further disrupting a transport network affected by burning and vandalism of stations in some parts of the city.\n\nAbout 40% of Santiago\u2019s metro was functioning on Friday, though several thousand buses have been deployed in an attempt to make up for the disruption.\n\nStruggling to contain the strife, Pi\u00f1era\u2019s administration announced increases in the minimum wage and the lowest state pensions, rolled back the subway fare increase and put a 9.2% increase in electricity prices on hold until the end of next year.\n\nAn explosion of protest, a howl of rage \u2013 but not a Latin American spring Read more\n\nFlanked by elderly Chileans, Pi\u00f1era on Friday signed a measure that would raise minimum pensions of $150 by 20%, an increase that would benefit an estimated 600,000 people.\n\nMost of the demonstrations over the high cost of medicine, water and other basic needs have been peaceful. But instances of arson, looting and alleged brutality by security forces have shocked many in a nation known for relative stability.\n\nAccording to Chile\u2019s human rights watchdog, more than 2,000 people have been detained and over 500 injured.\n\nThe government has declared a state of emergency and imposed curfews in 12 out of Chile\u2019s 16 regions.\n\nFormer Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, now the United Nations\u2019 top official on human rights, will send a three-member team to Chile to examine allegations of violations.", "description": "Staff hurry out of legislative building in port city of Valpara\u00edso while truck drivers and public transport workers on strike in Santiago", "authors": ["Associated Press In Santiago"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b157013eb491674e9bd0e2d8db255b21d8e13620/0_0_6892_4136/master/6892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8aa2e49db958cc162c5ef6c9473cc747", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
