What it means is that our access and our ability and our guarantee to having a home comes before someone else\u2019s privilege to earn a profit.\u201d\n\nIn September, she unveiled her \u201cA Just Society\u201d proposal, which updates national poverty guidelines, extends federal benefits to illegal immigrants, and \u201cgives access to a \u2018counsel fund\u2019 for renters who are facing eviction,\u201d as Breitbart News reported.\n\nSen.
