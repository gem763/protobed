In the background of the video a woman\u2019s voice can be heard saying, \u201cShe can stay here for the rest of the day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat voice belongs to one of the Disney cast members, Nala\u2019s handler Megan Leigh tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThey love it when Nala comes to visit them,\u201d she adds.\n\nNala and Leigh, who live near Orlando, Fla., go to Disney World two or three times a week \u2014 and were at the park when they spoke to Yahoo. \u201cShe LOVES the rides,\u201d Leigh says of Nala, who was named after the Lion King character. \u201cShe loves the breeze that some of them give and she also loves the boat rides like Pirates of the Caribbean!\u201d\n\nWhile Disney World is of course a lot of fun, Nala is also on the job while she\u2019s there. \u201cI got Nala as an 8-week-old puppy after trying multiple treatment methods for some conditions I have, one of them being high-functioning autism,\u201d Leigh tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAfter not many things working, my doctor suggested a service dog who would know and learn tasks to help me with my disability. I trained her myself. One of her most useful tasks is called crowd control, which is when she circles me in crowded areas to help keep a gap of space.\u201d\n\nNala also wears special gear when she\u2019s working. In addition to the service dog pinny, she also wears special boots. \u201cThe boots help protect her paws from the hot pavement and also even when it\u2019s not hot,\u201d Leigh explains. \u201cThey protect her paws from the wear and tear of the cement.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Named for a character in \"The Lion King,\" Nala frequently visits the park with her owner, who has high-functioning autism.", "authors": ["Elena Sheppard", "Wellness Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ieabum8Yt8wFXwn6_XyDXA--~B/aD0xMTE0O3c9OTMwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/e4cc4e50-dd69-11e9-9fab-c9402119d7d9", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
