The trauma, she says, turned her into an artist.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, reality shifted,\u201d Lipton says in James Scott\u2019s short documentary, Love Bite. \u201cBefore [the incident], I was fearless. Then, my life became something else. People were dangerous. Stuff was incomprehensible. I got the sense that reality was very, very thin, and at any moment it could just crack apart and you could fall through the hole.\u201d\n\nAnd so, from childhood, Lipton\u2019s attention was drawn to the grotesque sides of human nature. In the documentary, she explains how an all-consuming desire to create drove her to develop the style of macabre black-and-white drawings that now defines her unique and prolific body of work.\n\n\u201cThere is nobody on the planet who\u2019s drawn more than me,\u201d Lipton says in the film. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve done\u2014I haven\u2019t cooked. I haven\u2019t made children. I\u2019ve just drawn. That\u2019s all I do. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nLipton\u2019s intricate drawings harbor a disturbing quality, as if each piece conjures a half-remembered nightmare. Her work probes the most unsettling themes in our culture\u2014imagery and emotions that lurk just beneath our consciousness. In one drawing, a baby wields a knife, evidently about to murder its mother. Another depicts a classroom of children lined up for a school picture, their skeletons illuminated by the radiation of a nuclear bomb. Many of Lipton\u2019s more recent illustrations deal with the sinister nature of consumerism and the omnipresence of technology.\n\n\u201cWhat she\u2019s dealing with is something everybody has inside them, in one form or another, even though most people are frightened to recognize it,\u201d says Terry Gilliam, who is interviewed in the film. \u201cYou put it down in the basement and keep the trapdoor shut.\u201d\n\nWhen Scott himself first encountered Lipton\u2019s work, the filmmaker described it as a \u201creligious\u201d experience. \u201cI'd never seen anything like it,\u201d he told me. \u201cUniversal truths, emotionality, and dark humor shone through the incredible detail of her confrontational drawings\u2014as if she was speaking directly to me and reading my mind.\u201d\n\nNearly immediately after discovering her work, Scott contacted Lipton and asked her to meet. \u201cJust about everything about her surprised me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was petite and scathingly funny, with a huge smile. She appeared to be the antithesis of her art.\u201d Indeed, Lipton\u2019s personality belies the frightening nature of her work. She is, however, exceedingly private, and lives a very isolated life. It took four years for Scott and Lipton to cultivate a close friendship. Eventually, the artist revealed details about her past that she had long concealed from even her closest friends and family.\n\n\u201cBlack and white is the color of ghosts,\u201d says Lipton in the film. That ghost of her childhood trauma haunts her art, sometimes subtly, and sometimes markedly. In one piece, titled Stranger in the Woods, a man lurks almost imperceptibly in the background, peering at a young girl who wanders through the forest. \u201cThere\u2019s a very hurt child in all of my work\u2014very alone, very confused,\u201d Lipton says in the film. \u201cAnd she is still in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrauma manifests itself differently for every individual,\u201d Scott said. \u201cFor Laurie, and in my own experience, I believe it drives one deeper into themselves. There's a sense of focusing, even obsessing, over something that brings you joy and can help you escape from the horror of your experience.\u201d From Lipton\u2019s creative obsession, Scott believes, a deep strength emerged. \u201cPerhaps it's a way to take back control after experiencing the darkest sides of the human condition. It changes the way you see the world, and her drawings are what the world looks like to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lipton says in the film. \u201cYou never know what kind of gift comes out of suffering.\u201d", "description": "The artist\u2019s nightmarish black-and-white drawings confront the most unsettling themes of our culture.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/Love_Bite_2/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
