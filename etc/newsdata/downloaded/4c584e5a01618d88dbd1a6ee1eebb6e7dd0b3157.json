But we say: no nation, no class!\u201d one student protester said.\n\n\u201cAll we want is for the government to immediately submit its resignation. Either it resigns, or it gets ousted.\u201d\n\nAbout 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s 40-million-strong population is under the age of 25.\n\nBut youth unemployment stands at 25 percent and one in five people live below the poverty line, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC\u2019s second-largest crude producer.\n\nAnger at inequality and accusations that government corruption was fuelling it sparked protests in Baghdad on October 1 that have since attracted growing numbers of young people.\n\nOn Monday, a small group of students brought kits to Tahrir Square to treat people affected by tear gas along with cans of Pepsi \u2014 believed to alleviate discomfort when splashed on the face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first day at the protests. I told my mom I\u2019m going to class, but I came here instead!\u201d a girl with curly hair told AFP.\n\nThe protests are unprecedented in recent Iraqi history for their ire at the entire political class, with some even criticising traditionally revered religious leaders.\n\n\u2013 Parliamentary paralysis \u2013\n\nOn Monday, Iraq\u2019s parliament voted to dissolve the provincial councils, cancel the extra privileges of top officials and summon embattled Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi for questioning.\n\nAbdel Mahdi has proposed a laundry list of reforms, including hiring drives, increased pensions and promises to root out corruption.\n\nPresident Barham Saleh has also held discussions with the UN on electoral reform and amendments to the 2005 constitution, but they have not appeased protesters.\n\nIn solidarity with demonstrators, four lawmakers resigned late on Sunday, and the largest parliamentary bloc has been holding an open-ended sit-in since Saturday night.\n\nSaeroon, the bloc tied to firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr, said it was dropping its support for Abdel Mahdi.\n\nThe move has left the premier more squeezed than ever, as Saeroon was one of the two main sponsors of his government.\n\nThe other was Fatah, the political arm of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, which has said it would continue to back the central government.\n\nSeveral Hashed offices have been torched in recent days in southern Iraq, prompting vows of \u201crevenge\u201d from its leaders.\n\nSadr responded Sunday, warning them: \u201cDo not champion the corrupt. Do not repress the people.\u201d\n\nNorth of Baghdad late Monday, two mortar rounds hit the military base of Taiji where US troops are deployed, a security source said.\n\nThere were no reports of damage or casualties, and the attack was not claimed.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Honking cars and blaring music filled the streets of the Iraqi capital early Tuesday, as thousands including students kept up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/ebab61_iraqi-anti-government-protesters-burn-debris-as-cover-security-forces-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
