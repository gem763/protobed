The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70.\n\nAre all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet?\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE\n\nBiden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind.\n\nBut because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nBiden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president\u2019s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents.\n\nStill, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A Fox News poll that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden\u2019s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May.\n\nBiden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn\u2019t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president.\n\nBut what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House.\n\nSo far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier.\n\nBut it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia?\n\nLook, dementia isn\u2019t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less.\n\nAnd once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget.\n\nAnd when we look at Biden\u2019s gaffes and question if he is possibly \u201closing it\u201d or if he\u2019s fit for office, we shouldn\u2019t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own.\n\nMore importantly, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker database, as of Aug. 5 Trump \u201chad made 12,019 false or misleading claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,\u201d a Post article reported.\n\nOf course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nBut if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump\u2019s \u201cfalse and misleading claims.\u201d\n\nWe all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes.\n\nAnd we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond.\n\nSpace doesn\u2019t permit a listing of all Biden\u2019s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he\u2019s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn\u2019t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at just a few of Biden\u2019s gaffes.\n\nRecently Biden has urged parents to keep \u201crecord players\u201d on to improve the vocabulary of their\n\nchildren. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire.\n\nBiden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 \u2013 when he had been out of office for more than a year. An official with Biden\u2019s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd one of Biden\u2019s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN\u2019s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to \u201cgo to Joe 30330.\u201d He said later he meant to say \u201ctext.\u201d \u201cI was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said \u2018Joe\u2019 and I gave the number,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association: \u201cThere is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a doctor and I certainly can\u2019t diagnose Biden\u2019s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong.\n\nAnd you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race \u2013 or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks \u2013 as always happens with front-runners.\n\nMy best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn\u2019t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don\u2019t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "description": "The media and Joe Biden's opponents are focusing attention on his frequent gaffes, making voters wonder if he is mentally fit to be president.", "authors": ["Leslie Marshall", "Leslie Marshall Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In", "Providing Analysis On Both Political", "Social Issues A Liberal Point Of View.
