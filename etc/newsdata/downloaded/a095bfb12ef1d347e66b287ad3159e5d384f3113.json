So, there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLet them fight their own wars.\u201d\n\nThe split-screen foreign policy moment proved difficult to reconcile and came during perhaps the darkest moment for the modern U.S.-Turkey relationship and a time of trial for Trump and his Republican Party allies. Severe condemnation of Trump\u2019s failure to deter Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s assault on the Kurds, and his subsequent embrace of Turkish talking points about the former U.S. allies, sparked bipartisan outrage in the U.S. and calls for swift punishment for the NATO ally.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in the House, bitterly divided over the Trump impeachment inquiry, banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal. Many lawmakers expressed worry that the withdrawal may lead to revival of the Islamic State group as well as Russian presence and influence in the area, besides the slaughter of many Kurds.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., publicly broke with Trump to call the U.S. relationship with the Kurds \u201ca great alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are. I hope the vice president and the secretary of state can somehow repair the damage,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nEven among top administration officials, there were concerns that the trip lacked achievable goals and had been undermined by Trump even before it began. While Erdogan faces global condemnation for the invasion, he also sees renewed nationalistic fervor at home, and any pathway to de-escalation likely would need to delicately avoid embarrassing Erdogan domestically. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.\n\nThe White House disclosed that Trump had both cajoled and threatened Erdogan in an unusual letter last week, urging him to act only in \u201cthe right and humane way\u201d in Syria. The letter was sent the day Erdogan launched the major offensive against the Kurds.\n\nTrump started on a positive note by suggesting they \u201cwork out a good deal,\u201d but then talked about crippling economic sanctions and concluded that the world \u201cwill look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nTrump did place some sanctions on Turkey for the offensive. But he appeared to undercut his delegation\u2019s negotiating stance, saying the U.S. has no business in the region - and not to worry about the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey goes onto Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria, it\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States,\u201d Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nAs he seeks to push Erdogan to agree to a cease-fire, Pence will confront doubts about American credibility and his own, as an emissary of an inconsistent president.\n\n\u201cGiven how erratic President Trump\u2019s decision-making process and style has been, it\u2019s just hard to imagine any country on the receiving end of another interlocutor really being confident that what Pence and Pompeo are delivering reflects Trump\u2019s thinking at the moment or what it will be in the future,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, the Obama administration\u2019s senior director for Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Gulf states on the National Security Council and a former deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe withdrawal is the worst decision of Trump\u2019s presidency, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in Congress.\n\n\u201cTo those who think the Mideast doesn\u2019t matter to America, remember 9/11 - we had that same attitude on 9/10/2001,\u201d Graham said\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s comments, Erdogan had publicly stated that he will be undeterred by the sanctions and resisted calls for a cease-fire Wednesday, saying the fighting would end only if Kurdish fighters abandoned their weapons and retreated from positions near the Turkish border. If Pence can persuade Turkey to agree to a cease-fire, which few U.S. officials believed was likely, experts warn it will not erase the signal Trump\u2019s action sent to American allies across the globe or the opening already being exploited by Russia in the region.\n\n\u201cDeterring an action that hasn\u2019t yet been taken is almost always easier than trying to coerce someone to reverse an action that they\u2019ve already committed blood, treasure and honor to,\u201d said John Hannah, former national security adviser for former Vice President Dick Cheney and a senior counselor for Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nIn public appearances, Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign promise to bring U.S. troops home from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East - casting aside criticism that a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Syria betrays the Kurdish fighters, stains U.S. credibility around the world and opens an important region to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria\u2019s not happy about it. Let them work it out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have a problem at a border. It\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nTurkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the area. Erdogan has said he wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d 30 kilometers (20 miles) deep in Syria.\n\nAnkara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate as a terrorist organization.\n\n___\n\nBurns reported from Washington.
