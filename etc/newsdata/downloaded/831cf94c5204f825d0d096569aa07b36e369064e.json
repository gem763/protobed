But when you consider that it's a sector that, in theory, targets almost four billion women - roughly half the world's population - suddenly it seems quite modest.\n\nFacebook alone, for example, has a membership of just over two billion people and is worth more than 10 times that figure.\n\n\"I think in the future when historians look back, it will seem crazy that until [recently] there had never been a technology term for women,\" says Ms Boler.\n\nImage copyright Google Play Store Image caption There are hundreds of period trackers available on the Google Play store - almost all with pastel-coloured logos\n\nFemtech has only caught on as a term in the past few years. And not everyone is convinced it will be beneficial in the long run.\n\nSuw Charman-Anderson is the founder of Ada Lovelace Day. It marks its 10th anniversary this Tuesday and commemorates the woman who many consider to be the world's first computer programmer, as well as celebrating others who have been successful in Stem (science, technology, engineering and education).\n\nShe fears femtech could become a double-edged sword.\n\n\"If it evolves into just being tech, that's fine,\" she says.\n\n\"It only becomes a problem if it becomes something that only female VCs [venture capitalists] invest in, that only female entrepreneurs work on, that only women buy.\"\n\nBut Ms Boler is convinced the term opens up opportunities - not to mention purse strings.\n\n\"People thought we were completely crazy. I mean, this is an intimate device,\" she says, recalling the early days.\n\n\"And obviously, we're mostly pitching to male investors. And it's a women's health issue that nobody talks about. So everybody said, this is going to be impossible - you'll never get celebrities to talk about this. You'll never get it into retail.\"\n\nWell, you can now get the trainer in department stores, and Elvie's other product, a silent wearable breast-milk pump, made it into the 2019 Oscars' swag bag.\n\nIn her book Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez recounts the story of Janica Alvarez, who was seeking funding for a breast-pump device in 2013.\n\n\"I'm not touching that; that's disgusting,\" she was told by a male investor.\n\nWould the word \"femtech\" have broken down that barrier?\n\nWhile Ms Boler is enthusiastically on-message about the femtech brand and has certainly benefited from it - Elvie has raised $42m this year - she does also have some reservations.\n\n\"In an ideal world, we wouldn't need femtech because 51% of the UK population is women,\" she points out. \"It's definitely not niche.\"\n\nFemtech and fertility\n\nCritics of femtech also cite the inclusion of fertility issues under its brand as a problem.\n\nAccording to the NHS, one in seven couples face fertility problems. And while 25% of issues remain undiagnosed, the cause can lie with either men or women.\n\n\"If you're looking at having babies and helping people figure it out, then that is not just a female problem, it's a family problem,\" says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst from Creative Futures.\n\n\"Why should it just be labelled a female solution?\"\n\n\"To be honest with you, just saying femtech makes me cringe a little bit,\" she adds.\n\n\"When it's about men and men's health, it's not mentech, right?\"\n\nImage copyright Melanie Hayes Image caption Venture Capitalist Melanie Hayes does not use the term \"femtech\"\n\nMelanie Hayes is an investor whose firm, Bethnal Green Ventures, avoids the term.\n\n\"My biggest concern with femtech as a label is that it is used for people to say, 'Oh, I don't do that',\" she explains.\n\nMs Hayes cites an example of one of her own recent investments - a social network that helps people in casual work source better working conditions, pay and flexibility around commitments such as caring and childcare.\n\n\"While those kind of products are not femtech, and were certainly never pitched to us in that way, we can't ignore the fact that the users of the services that benefit disproportionately are likely to be women, because they are most affected by those issues,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm really interested in technologies that are around healthy lives, a fairer society, and a more sustainable planet. I think femtech could easily touch on each of those things.\"", "description": "The 'femtech' label for women's health tech is flourishing but not everybody is a fan.", "authors": ["Zoe Kleinman", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EB17/production/_109038106_mediaitem109038105.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
