REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\n\nATHENS (Reuters) - Up to 15,000 holidaymakers are stranded on the island of Cyprus after the collapse of British travel firm Thomas Cook, saddling hotels with millions in potential losses, the deputy minister of tourism said on Monday.\n\nThomas Cook arrivals to the island on a yearly basis topped 250,000 people, representing up to 6% of all arrivals. The island is also a popular wedding venue for Britons.\n\n\u201cWe will work intensively .. I believe that a large portion of the arrivals we stand to lose will somehow be regulated by the market and other travel agencies,\u201d said Savvas Perdios, deputy minister of tourism.\n\nCypriot hotels stood to lose an estimated 50 million euros ($55 million) owed by Thomas Cook, Perdios said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it will be easy to recoup that money.\u201d\n\nThe British High Commission (embassy) said it would have teams at the island\u2019s two airports to facilitate Thomas Cook customers returning to the UK.", "description": "Up to 15,000 holidaymakers are stranded on the island of Cyprus after the collapse of British travel firm Thomas Cook, saddling hotels with millions in potential losses, the deputy minister of tourism said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432910850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0O0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
