Whether it has come as a surprise to the Prime Minister is difficult to say but I\u2019m sure he will have been prepared for this possible eventuality.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely difficult to say whether the ruling will be a game changer or nothing more than a headline maker but it will certainly ramp up the Brexit theatrics, just over five weeks ahead of the end of October deadline.\n\nis probably an accurate reflection of the news, with it initially spiking on the defeat for Johnson\u2019s pro-no deal government, before settling back around pre-ruling levels (at the time of writing).\n\nGBP/USD\n\nGBP/USD 5-Minute Chart\n\nWhat will come next is anyone\u2019s guess but I\u2019ll be very surprised if Johnson doesn\u2019t have another card up his sleeve. The Brexit soap opera is just getting started.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD.
