The Capitals were almost $1.5 million over the cap heading into this week and the No. 6 and No. 7 defenseman jobs were up for grabs among Djoos, Jonas Siegenthaler and Martin Fehervary.\n\nIf Djoos clears waivers, he can be sent to the AHL affiliate Hershey Bears to take $1.075 million off the cap, NHL.com reported. But another team can claim Djoos in the next 24 hours, and if that happens, his full $1.25 million would be cleared.\n\nWashington needs to bring its roster down to a maximum of 23 players by Tuesday, the day before the regular season begins. The front office technically must get under the cap by then, too, but the Evgeny Kuznetsov suspension will take some money off the books for the first three games of the season, giving the Capitals a bit more time to make those final decisions.\n\nDjoos played 63 games for the Capitals in his rookie season of 2017-18, the year they won the Stanley Cup, and was a regular top-six defenseman last year before requiring surgery on his left leg.\n\nThe Capitals also placed forwards Liam O\u2019Brien and Michael Sgarbossa on waivers and returned Shane Gersich to Hershey.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
