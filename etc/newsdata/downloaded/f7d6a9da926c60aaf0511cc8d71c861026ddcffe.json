I therefore believe that this challenge, to develop an idea that provides meaningful work for 10 000 young people within the next decade, is particularly important in the current global environment.\"\n\nSupplied: Rhodes University\n\nTeam E-smart came up with a business model based on electronic waste, because these electronics have \"hazardous components in them\", team leader Matlou said.\n\nIn addition, South Africa annually produces 316 000 tons of electronic waste of which only 12% is collected and recycled.\n\n\"The electronic waste that is currently not collected and recycled or re-purposed will raise about R15bn for the South African economy,\" fellow team member Nene explained.\n\nTheir team coach, who is also a senior lecturer at Rhodes Business School, Dr Tshidi Mohapeloa, said she was impressed with how they adapted and understood the business world.\n\n\"This is an opportunity for them to become entrepreneurs.\"", "description": "Four Rhodes University PhD Chemistry students have bagged the top position in the 2019 Hultz Prize Challenge for their business model for a waste management system that will result in the employment of more than 10 000 young people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8784/412eb211eb264dbf9fc7442d645e179a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-24"}
