I am not waiting around for that man, he is a known pull-out.\n\n\"You can run but you cannot hide. He ran out of the press conference in Moscow last week. It is in his nature. Trust me I am coming for him.\n\n\"Where is he now in this country? I fly in, he flies out. Typical.\n\n\"I am going to go through the entire roster like a chainsaw through butter.\"\n\nMcGregor insists there is no 'outside influence' to his comeback, and that he will be in camp for 12 weeks prior to the January bout.\n\n\"Fight is 12 weeks this Saturday,\" he added. I go into camp from this tour and you will not see me until I go to fight.\n\n\"My family motivates and inspires me. I want to show them what hard work can do.\"", "description": "The Irishman has held a press conference in Russia and revealed plans for his Octagon comeback", "authors": ["James Whaling"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713291.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-105943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
