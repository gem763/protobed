That's probably the exact opposite to the way to how the industry should be thinking,\" Darren Thomson, CTO EMEA at Symantec told ZDNet.\n\n\"Someone who has lived through one of these incidents and been through the whole process, recovering from the bad experience then implementing additional security and privacy measures: that knowledge and experience is valuable and it's good to have someone with it,\" he added.\n\nThis is especially important because not only do cyber attackers continue to conduct successful campaigns, such is the prolific nature of attacks, it's often a case of when, not if an organisation falls victim to hackers.\n\nIt's therefore important for organisations to have a good resilience and recovery programme and by employing someone who has worked on one which has been successfully field tested, it could help bolster an organisation's reaction to a cyber attack.\n\n\"If you want to build a resilient organisation, wouldn't it be better to recruit a team of people who've lived this stuff rather than someone who hasn't got that experience or developed best practices in reaction to a breach occurring?\" said Thomson.\n\n\"Assuming they were doing the right things and yet a criminal got the better of them, if they can prove their resilience and what happened as a result of that, what best practices they developed, what steps they took to improve, that's invaluable experience and those are the people we should be looking for,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE ON CYBERSECURITY", "description": "It used to be the case that staff who'd dealt with the fallout of a cyber attack were seen as having failed - but they could be the answer to protecting your organisation from data breaches and cyber incidents.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/24/30478d4a-a7a4-4641-a2d1-49814601cf50/thumbnail/770x578/2c46aa6fdf212d927324f079bffe3c13/istock-workers-around-a-computer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
