There is absolutely no justification for this.\" \"Why would anyone admit doing something so ignorant?\" \"Disgusting pig.\"\n\nThe only comments which don't hound the man are from people who thought the socks were on the outside of the aircraft and expressed worry for a non-existent, and we assume very windswept, child.\n\nIt could be worse, having a quick look at the same account there's also a picture of a plastic bag filled with urine left tied to the seat in front.
