So, United Airlines Flight 1554 eventually landed at Denver International Airport around 7:30 p.m. Mountain Time.\n\nDenver Fire Department Capt. Greg Pixley confirmed to TIME that the fire department was called in to help get the passenger out and was able to get the door open.\n\nAnother passenger on United Airlines Flight 1554 posted a video to Twitter showing a group of people \u2014 some in orange vests \u2014 huddled around the bathroom door, attempting to pry it open. \u201cMa\u2019am we\u2019re just working on opening up the door at the moment ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll get you out soon, OK,\u201d says one man, who appears to be a crew member.\n\nWell folks it\u2019s never a dull moment on @united , we have to make an \u201cemergency landing\u201d in Denver because a passenger got stuck in the bathroom.
