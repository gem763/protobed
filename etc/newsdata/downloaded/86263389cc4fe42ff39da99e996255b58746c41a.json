But nobody can help themselves. Pundits and politicians react this way because they feel they have to: the temptation to sound important \u2014 by saying the president shouldn\u2019t be so trivial \u2014 is overwhelming. The feedback loop never breaks.\n\nSane people wish it would stop. Sane people can see that Trump uses provocative words because he wants to provoke, such as when he says immigrant Democratic radicals should \u2018go back\u2019 to where they came from.\n\nIt isn\u2019t because he\u2019s stupid. It isn\u2019t even because he\u2019s smart. It\u2019s because the media is stupid and thinks it is smart. Trump may have foolish traits but he\u2019s astute enough to see that. He knows the mainstream media will always fall for his bait, even when it knows it is being baited.", "description": "", "authors": ["Freddy Gray", "Spectator.Us Trump-Provocative-Terms-Provoke-Lynching"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
