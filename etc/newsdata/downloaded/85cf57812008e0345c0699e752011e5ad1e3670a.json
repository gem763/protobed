The poll \u2013 taken October 1-3, 2019 \u2013 found the majority of voters do no view Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky as an impeachable offense.\n\nRespondents were asked:\n\nThinking just about this specific case of the President\u2019s phone call with the Ukraine President, do you believe that what President Trump did was appropriate, the same as other Presidents have probably done, inappropriate, but not impeachable, or an impeachable offense?\n\nThe poll shows the majority, 59 percent, do not view the conversation as an impeachable offense, while 37 percent view it as impeachable. While opinions on impeachment are largely divided on party lines, the majority of independents\u2013 57 percent \u2013 do not view the conversation itself as impeachable.\n\nThe survey spelled trouble for Democrats who hold seats in Trump-won districts. The vast majority \u2013 62 percent \u2013 consider the conversation between the two leaders was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Only 33 percent considered it impeachable. Furthermore, Republican candidates in Trump districts represented by Democrats hold a \u201cdouble-digit advantage\u201d over impeachment-supporting Democrats.\n\nRespondents were asked:\n\nAnd, thinking ahead to the next election, would you be more willing to vote for: A Democratic candidate for Congress who believes that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office\u2026or\u2026 A Republican candidate for Congress who believes that President Trump\u2019s actions do not rise to an impeachable offense and that voters should be allowed to decide for themselves in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nFifty-four percent of voters in those Trump-won, Democrat-held districts said they would be more willing to vote for a Republican. Only 38 percent chose a Democrat, giving Republicans a 16-point advantage.\n\nAdditionally, the majority of voters in these districts \u2013 58 percent \u2013 say Democrats have not accomplished much since taking the House, and 62 percent believe that the impeachment inquiry will continue to distract them from achieving promised policy goals.\n\nOver two-thirds of voters in these key districts say that the impeachment effort is \u201call about politics\u201d\u2013 not a genuine concern of wrongdoing by the president, the survey found.\n\nThe poll\u2019s margin of error is +/- 3.46 percent.\n\nThe results of the internal findings were summed up in a memo. The bottom line concluded that \u201cvoters clearly believe impeachment is sidetracking the country and Congress, will keep Congress from getting anything else done, and cause even deeper partisan divisions in the country.\n\nThe memo added:\n\nCongressional Democrats who represent Trump districts appear to be in a precarious position here, as their voters clearly side against impeachment and are much more willing to vote for a GOP candidate opposing impeachment than a Democrat supporting it.\n\nThe polling suggests that Democrats in key congressional districts are in vulnerable positions, which could explain why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) held off the impeachment inquiry for so long.\n\n\u201cThe public isn\u2019t there on impeachment. It\u2019s your voice and constituency, but give me the leverage I need to make sure that we\u2019re ready and it is as strong as it can be,\u201d Pelosi told Democrats in a caucus-wide call in August.\n\nDemocrat leaders have been strategizing on how to successfully back Democrats in swing districts and sway public opinion in their favor. They plan to drive the impeachment narrative, in part, by utilizing repetition, repeating keywords and phrases such as \u201cbetrayal,\u201d \u201cabuse of power,\u201d and \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nGiven the poll\u2019s findings and a continued lack of evidence of wrongdoing by the president, Republican lawmakers are not expected to modify their position on impeachment.", "description": "Internal polling in key districts shows that the majority of voters do not view Trump's Ukraine call as impeachable.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/entering-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
